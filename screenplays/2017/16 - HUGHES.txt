           IN BLACK

           The even patter of RAIN.

           Titles FADE IN, one after the other, gray against the black...

                 In the 1980s, John Hughes wrote, produced, and/or directed 
                 nine films, including Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, 
                      Pretty in Pink, and Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. 

                  Together, those films comprise one of the most successful 
                      single-decade bodies of work in cinema history.

                But in 1994, still at the height of his success, Hughes left 
                 Hollywood without explanation, granting few interviews and 
                           never returning to studio filmmaking.

                  It is still unknown why Hughes left Hollywood or how he 
                         occupied himself until his death in 2009.

                               What follows is speculation.

           FADE IN:

           A 500-ACRE FARM hugging the northern border of Illinois. 
           RAIN beats down on its tidy rows of SOY... on its distant 
           ORCHARDS...

           To the east of the fields is what the Hugheses refer to as 
           their “FARMHOUSE”: a sprawling complex, luxurious but bland, 
           built to the tastes of the suburban rich.

                                 GIBBS (PRE-LAP)
                        Let’s put this in context, shall we?

           INT. FARMHOUSE -- JOHN’S STUDY -- LATE AFTERNOON [2001]

           First: meet ELLIOT GIBBS, a graying, genteel reporter who’s 
           brought with him from his native Savannah a lilting accent 
           and a kill-them-with-courtesy affect.

           At present, Gibbs stands by a bay window, looking out at the 
           puddling fields, a cup of coffee in his hand, a Premiere 
           Magazine press credential dangling from his neck.
                                 GIBBS
                        This is the first time you’ve gone on 
                        record since you spoke to the Times in 
                        ’96, when you said-- and I’ve committed 
                        this to memory-- you were speaking about 
                        Los Angeles, and you said-- “There is no 
                        city on earth less warm, no city less 
                        worthy of esteem. I highly doubt that 
                        there’s one complete person in that 
                        irredeemable wasteland... that 
                        godforsaken town...”

           Now, Gibbs turns toward the center of the room.

                                 GIBBS
                        Well now your son is in that “godforsaken 
                        town”; he’s written his first film; I 
                        think it’s fair to assume he aspires to 
                        write more. So I guess what I have to ask 
                        is the same question beat reporters ask 
                        to grieving mothers and stickup victims: 
                        how do you feel?

           Now, see Gibbs’ interviewee: a man in his early 50s, with 
           wounded eyes and a frame on the verge of surrendering to 
           obesity. This is JOHN HUGHES, almost a decade into his self-
           imposed Hollywood exile. At present, he smokes a cigarette 
           and regards Gibbs with hard, inaccessible eyes.

                                 HUGHES
                        I feel like a proud parent. James did a 
                        great job with the film, and I have no 
                        doubt that the public will agree.

           Gibbs smiles gently.

                                 GIBBS
                        Forgive me if that doesn’t sound like 
                        fatherly praise to my ears so much as... 
                        the evasive maneuvers of a spokesman.

           But John is even.

                                 HUGHES
                        My son did a great job writing his first 
                        movie, Mr. Gibbs. And I have no doubt the 
                        public will agree. Now-- you asked for my 
                        feelings; there they are. You can write 
                        them down.

           For a moment, no one moves. But then-- Gibbs shifts gears, 
           pouring himself more coffee and speaking amiably:

                                 GIBBS
                        You’re credited as a producer on the 
                        film; why don’t you tell me about that? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GIBBS (CONT'D)
                        Were you involved? Did you help Jamie or 
                        the director out at all?

                                 HUGHES
                                (relaxing a bit)
                        Well, I gave some advice here and there-- 
                        though I doubt either Jamie or Kyle would 
                        characterize my involvement as “help.”

                                 GIBBS
                                (chuckles at that)
                        Uh-huh. So you were on set, then?

                                 HUGHES
                        When they made the mistake of inviting me.

                                 GIBBS
                        And how’d that go? Did it make your 
                        megaphone fingers itch at all?
                                (off John)
                        What I’m asking is, can your fans expect 
                        your forthcoming reunion with the 
                        director’s chair?

           Hughes’ flirtation with geniality comes to an end. Icy--

                                 HUGHES
                        You know, the only reason you’re here is, 
                        I was promised this article would be 
                        about Jamie and his movie and that’s it. 
                        Not about me.

                                 GIBBS
                        Oh, and it will be-- but in order to 
                        shine the light on your son’s film, we’ve 
                        first gotta move it out of the shadows of 
                        these-- eclipsing questions.

                                 HUGHES
                                (unimpressed)
                        “Eclipsing questions.”

                                 GIBBS
                        That’s right. The questions, you can’t go 
                        an hour at any decent Hollywood bull 
                        session before they begin to bubble up:
                                (as John begins to object--)
                        Now they’re not of my invention; I’m just 
                        relaying what’s being asked-- which is, 
                        Why did John Hughes leave Hollywood? And 
                        is he coming back?

           As if on cue, THUNDER rumbles outside. 

           At the same time, there’s a KNOCK at the (open) door, and 
           Hughes looks over to see a SUPERVISOR (male, Hispanic) who 
           indicates that he has some farm-related matter to discuss. 
           So John ushers the Supervisor into the HALLWAY, where the 
           two men exchange a couple of words in mumbled Spanish. 

           Gibbs, meanwhile, returns to the bay window and watches 
           LIGHTNING crackle over the fields-- an exotic sight for an 
           Angeleno, and a beautiful one.

                                 HUGHES
                        There’s something I gotta deal with, it 
                        may take the rest of the day.

                                 GIBBS
                        What a shame. When can we pick this up 
                        again?

                                 HUGHES
                        I’m not sure that’s a good idea.

                                 GIBBS
                                (smiles)
                        John, you can’t evade these sorts of 
                        questions forever. The public demands to 
                        know-- and it has a way of getting what 
                        it wants.

                                 HUGHES
                        You may be right, but-- It’s not gonna 
                        get it from me. Not today. And not from 
                        this bait-and-switch piece you’re trying 
                        to write. Excuse me.

           With that, John exits into the HALLWAY. Gibbs calls after--

                                 GIBBS
                        I wouldn’t call what I’m writing a piece, 
                        John. Or... not merely a piece. My 
                        principal effort at this particular 
                        moment is... more of a book.

           John reappears in the doorway, his features arranged into a 
           mask of hostility. Gibbs, undeterred, produces a manuscript 
           from his attache and sets it down on an end table...

                                 GIBBS
                        I was going to tell you, of course, but I 
                        wanted to wait ‘til the moment was ripe. 
                        As a farmer, perhaps you can appreciate 
                        that.

           Hughes picks up the manuscript-- whose cover page reads, 
           UNTITLED JOHN HUGHES BIOGRAPHY. John narrows his eyes, flips 
           a couple of pages... in raw disbelief...

                                 HUGHES
                        Is this a joke?
                                 GIBBS
                        Well it’s a draft. As to whether or not 
                        it’s a joke, that’s why I’m asking for 
                        your reaction.

                                 HUGHES
                        You think I’ll cooperate with this?

                                 GIBBS
                        I think if you do, Premiere will run the 
                        story on Jamie’s film. And I think it 
                        will be a very flattering piece. And I 
                        think he won’t get that sort of publicity 
                        anywhere else, not for a small film 
                        without studios or stars, and I think you 
                        know I’m right.

           By way of response, Hughes hollers into the HALLWAY--

                                 HUGHES
                        Tom! You can show Mr. Gibbs to the door.

           Now, Hughes’ personal assistant TOM (35) appears.

                                 GIBBS
                        Manohla is writing one too. Even more 
                        explosive than mine, from what I’m told.

                                 TOM
                        If you’ll follow me...

                                 GIBBS
                        You can tell your story, John, or it can 
                        be told for you. But we’re in the 21st 
                        century now-- I’m afraid reclusion is no 
                        longer an option.

           He lets that sink in a moment. Then, he sets down his coffee 
           cup, pulls on his coat, and heads for the exit-- stopping 
           only to say--

                                 GIBBS
                        Whenever you’re ready to talk-- I’m in 
                        Chicago. The Four Seasons. The Author 
                        Suite.

           And with that, he tips his hat and allows Tom to show him 
           out.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Gibbs heads to his car, his umbrella open. But before he can 
           climb in, his attention is seized by something back at the 
           Farmhouse:
           WHAT HE SEES: in a dormer window, from behind partly-drawn 
           drapes, a WOMAN’S GREEN EYE stares out at him, with distress, 
           with disapproval...

           For a moment, Gibbs simply observes this eye, not moving a 
           muscle, betraying no emotion. Then, he nods cordially, folds 
           his umbrella, and climbs, unperturbed, into the driver’s seat.

           INT. FARMHOUSE -- JOHN’S STUDY -- SAME

           Hughes stands, holding the manuscript, paralyzed, seething. 

           He clocks his MANTLE, on which are displayed his awards and 
           trophies, most of them from his days in advertising.

           HALLWAY -- SAME

           Tom heads back into the house-- but he’s suddenly stopped by 
           something:

           SOUNDS OF WANTON DESTRUCTION coming from John’s Study: glass 
           and metal SMASH, CLANG, and SHATTER against the floor...

           Tom frowns, but he doesn’t seem altogether shocked.

           JOHN’S STUDY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Hughes leans his exhausted bulk against the newly naked 
           mantle whose previous contents now lie shattered at his feet.

           In spite of himself, he glances down at Gibbs’ manuscript. 
           On its first page is an epitaph:

                    “When you grow up, your heart dies.” Allison, The Breakfast Club

           John stares down at that with stormy, troubled eyes... and 
           it seems to cut through his shell of rage... to stir 
           something soft and fragile within him...

           And so, tentatively, he flips the page to CHAPTER ONE-- 
           which begins with a quote, this one from Molly Ringwald: 
           “The first time I heard John’s name...”

           As John reads, as Molly’s VOICE begins to fill his head, a 
           sort of chemical change seems to occur within him: a 
           tenderness begins to reveal itself in his eyes... a 
           vulnerability... a thawing...

                                 MOLLY (V.O.)
                        The first time I heard John’s name was in 
                        late May. The summer of ’83. I remember 
                        like it was yesterday:
           FLASHCUTS OF MOLLY RINGWALD... on a Lake Michigan beach... 
           in a dressing room painted pink...

                                 MOLLY (V.O.)
                        I was on the phone with my agent, Hildy 
                        Gottlieb. She’d just told me about this 
                        movie, Sixteen Candles, being made by a 
                        guy named John Hughes.

           FLASHCUTS OF JOHH, on set, in his element... laughing... 
           hopeful and unstoppable in simpler, happier times...

                                 MOLLY (V.O.)
                        Well I thought that was about the most 
                        boring name I’d ever heard. And Hildy-- 
                        she said she didn’t really know that much 
                        about him. Just that he’d written for the 
                        National Lampoon the last couple of 
                        years... that he’d been in advertising 
                        before that...

           FLASHCUTS OF JOHN ON SET WITH MOLLY... she’s Sam Baker in 
           Sixteen Candles... she’s Claire Standish in The Breakfast 
           Club... she’s Andie Walsh in Pretty in Pink...

                                 MOLLY (V.O.)
                        She said as far as she could tell, he was 
                        just another midwestern kid who’d run to 
                        L.A., fleeing boredom, hoping to find the 
                        country’s pulse.

           John, now on the sofa, reads, shaken...

                                 MOLLY (V.O.)
                        Well that has to be as wrong as anyone’s 
                        ever been about anything. I think John 
                        was looking to give the country a pulse, 
                        not to find one...

           ON JOHN’S EYES, closer and closer to tears...

                                 MOLLY (V.O.)
                        As for where he was from-- it’s hard to 
                        see him as being from anywhere-- he 
                        wanted so much for the world to be a 
                        reflection of John Hughes, it’s hard to 
                        imagine him as the product of any 
                        environment...

                                                     AS WE SLOWLY FADE:

                                 MOLLY (V.O.)
                        But I guess... I guess that’s not how it 
                        works, is it? I guess even geniuses have 
                        to come from somewhere...

                        ...right?

           And now, the sounds of the STORM morph into a din of RUNNING 
           and SHOUTING and CHEERING, building and building and 
           building until we POP IN ON--

           EXT. A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT

           A frantic, explosive game is underway, made muddy and messy 
           and damp by an early-autumn STORM.

           Now, a pass is thrown... and a FOOTBALL arcs, higher and 
           higher into the air...

           TITLE:    Northbrook, Illinois

           THE CONCESSIONS

           The first thing we see: A PENCIL, DRUMMED ON A TABLE.

           The table itself has a banner that reads CROWN DOGS, the name 
           of a local joint that gets to hawk its junk at the games.

           As for the drummer, he’s a bored teenage employee whose face 
           is obscured by a Crawdaddy music magazine (a sort of 
           precursor to Rolling Stone).

           ON THE FIELD

           The pass completes, there’s a flurry of activity, and 
           Glenbrook North, the fighting Spartans, scores a TOUCHDOWN!

           The CROWD loses its mind! DADS in ball caps pump their 
           fists! Gaggles of TEENS holler attaboys at their friends 
           down on the field!

           But DEEP IN THE STANDS, a pretty, RED-HEADED GIRL claps with 
           notably less enthusiasm than everyone else. Maybe football 
           isn’t her thing, or maybe “everyone else” isn’t her thing.  
           Either way, she seems to have had enough, and she turns, 
           slipping away from her whooping friends, unnoticed...

           BY THE CROWN DOGS CONCESSION

           The bored drummer-boy is still lost in his music mag when--
                                 RED-HEADED GIRL (O.S.)
                        Hey. Can I get a frank, ketchup and 
                        mustard?

           And now, the magazine is set down-- revealing, behind it, a 
           stringy high school kid with a “mod” haircut he’ll later 
           come to regret: this is 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN. When he sees the 
           Red-Headed Girl, it’s pretty clear that she means something 
           to him-- but he tries to play it cool.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Coming right up.

           Now, John goes to work on the frank, humming softly to 
           himself. The girl picks at a stain on her pink flamingo 
           dress. Seeing that--

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Hey, you mind if I ask, is that a Manfred 
                        Mann reference?

                                 RED-HEADED GIRL
                        ...Sorry?

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Your dress. You know, Manfred Mann, the 
                        Brit rockers? They got that “Pretty 
                        Flamingo” song. I didn’t know if-- maybe 
                        you’re riffing on that?

                                 RED-HEADED GIRL
                        Oh... I’ve never heard of them.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Oh. Well. Don’t worry. I mean, a lot of 
                        people don’t know ‘em yet, stateside.

           The Redhead grins, amused by that-- stateside.

                                 RED-HEADED GIRL
                        Well I’ll try not to let it bother me.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        ‘kay, well, that’ll be eighty-five cents.

                                 RED-HEADED GIRL
                        Right.
                                (digs in her coin purse)
                        Oh shoot, I forgot, I loaned Abbie Foster 
                        a quarter.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Oh. Well. It’s okay. I can float you the 
                        difference.
                                 RED-HEADED GIRL
                        No, come on.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        No, it’s fine, you can pay me back. 
                        You’re in the homeroom right next to me, 
                        I’ll see you tomorrow morning.

                                 RED-HEADED GIRL
                        You will? I mean... I am?

           Before John can respond, a good-looking MANAGER (17) 
           appears, changing out bank bags. He snaps at John--

                                 MANAGER
                        Hughes, next time I see you without the 
                        crown, it’s a write-up, y’understand? 
                        We’re Crown Dogs. If you blank on the 
                        dress code, look at the sign.

           Humiliated, but plainly having no choice, John affixes a 
           DIPPY PLASTIC CROWN to his head and mumbles to his boss...

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Sorry.

                                 MANAGER
                                (shit-eating grin)
                        Sorry, Miss. It’s hard to get good help 
                        nowadays, what with all the flunkies and 
                        riffraff floating around.

                                 RED-HEADED GIRL
                        Uh-huh, well the thing is, Bruce, I asked 
                        him to take the crown off, so I could see 
                        how good-looking his hair was.

           John perks up-- he’s not used to being defended, especially 
           by pretty, red-headed girls.

                                 RED-HEADED GIRL
                        And isn’t the customer always s’posed to 
                        be right? Or isn’t that true at Crown 
                        Dogs?

           “Bruce” locks eyes with her a moment. Then, pissy--

                                 MANAGER
                        Keep your station clean, Hughes.

           And with that, Bruce storms away-- leaving John to look up 
           at the redhead with appreciation shading into wonder.
                                 RED-HEADED GIRL
                        Well. My friends’ll be wondering where I 
                        am, but-- I guess I’ll see you... in next-
                        to-home-room.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Right, I’ll be there.

           She starts to go-- but stops--

                                 RED-HEADED GIRL
                        And hey-- that jerk, he called you Hughes?

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        John Hughes, yeah.

                                 RED-HEADED GIRL
                        I’m--

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Tiffany.

           He knows her name. That makes her smile. As she heads off, 
           John permits himself the dimmest hint of a grin.

           EXT. STADIUM -- NIGHT

           The CROWD pours out of the stadium... mostly rich kids and 
           happy families... while John, still in his Crown Dogs 
           uniform, heads for his car...

           None of his classmates greet or seem to know or notice John. 
           He is, for all intents and purposes, invisible.

           INT. JOHN’S CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

           It’s a real junker, but inside is something exceptional: a 
           CARRYING CASE chock-a-block full of 8-track tapes. John’s 
           treasure trove.

           John opens the case, runs his finger down the spines-- stops 
           at Revolver-- and takes it out of its case and pops it in.

           INT./EXT. JOHN’S CAR / NORTHBROOK -- NIGHT

           John floors it, speeding down Shermer Road, windows down, 
           hair flapping, blasting “Got to Get You Into My Life” from 
           his stereo.

           In the ritzy part of town, he passes a HOUSE PARTY, full of 
           attractive, wealthy TEENS, whose antics have now spilled 
           into the driveway, onto the walk, onto the lawn.
           He makes note of the party, of the kids, of the 
           camaraderie... and a pang of longing flashes across his eyes.

           But soon, he’s racing again down Shermer, out of the wealthy 
           North Field, crossing the railroad tracks (tracks we’ll 
           later see in Some Kind of Wonderful), into...

           A WORKING CLASS DEVELOPMENT

           Pre-fab houses, some better-maintained than others.

           John pulls into the driveway of one such HOUSE-- a tract 
           home beginning to go to seed.

           He cuts the engine and kills the stereo, and when he does, 
           he hears, from inside his house-- a SCREAMING FIGHT.

           He darkens, angry but hardly shocked.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Shit.

           For a moment, he just sits there, just breathes. Then, he 
           drags himself out of his car. As he does, he hears a VOICE--

                                 GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        You can stay over here, if you want.

           The Voice belongs to a FRUMPY BLONDE (16) who sits on the 
           porch of a neighboring house, smoking a cigarette.

                                 FRUMPY BLONDE
                        I just mean, til they’ve worn ‘emselves 
                        out.

           John assesses the girl’s proposal dimly-- but then, he looks 
           back toward his house, where his scrapping parents seem to 
           be kicking it up a notch.

                                 FRUMPY BLONDE
                        It’s some’n about-- how your dad lost his 
                        company?
                                (drags)
                        I think you may have to move.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                                (sharp)
                        What are you, the eight o’clock news or 
                        some’n?

                                 FRUMPY BLONDE
                                (shrugs)
                        Sorry. I wasn’t snooping or anything. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRUMPY BLONDE (CONT'D)
                        It’s just-- they’ve been a little hard to 
                        miss is all.
                                (then)
                        Hey, you want a smoke?

           John considers that. He does want a smoke-- but just then, 
           the sound of a CRASH comes from within his house-- then a 
           woman’s SCREAM-- and John decides--

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        I’d better go.

           And with that, he takes off--

                                 FRUMPY BLONDE
                        Okay, well-- if you need anything...

           But by now, John is gone, down his driveway and through his 
           yard. So the Blonde completes her thought to the empty night...

                                 FRUMPY BLONDE
                        ...I’m always here.

           INT. JOHN’S PARENTS’ HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT

           John, scrawny but fired-up, is in his burly FATHER’s face, 
           holding the older man’s arms, trying to get him to see reason:

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Hey! Dad! C’mon. What’re you doing?

                                 MOTHER
                        Johnny, go to your room.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        C’mon, get a hold of yourself.

                                 FATHER
                        You do what your mother says.

           Now, John looks at his MOTHER-- a small woman of faded 
           elegance, who sits, forlorn, in the far corner of the room. 
           John can’t help but feel his mother’s radiating despair, his 
           father’s blinding rage... but he responds with optimism, 
           with empathy...

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Hey: if something’s wrong: I mean, if you-- 
                        if you lost the business or whatever-- 
                        we’ll figure it out. Okay?

                                 FATHER
                        What, did it make the evening edition or 
                        some’n?
                                 MOTHER
                        John. Sweetie. Just go to bed.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        But--

                                 MOTHER
                        There’s nothing to “figure out.” Okay? 
                        What’s done is done.

           A beat. Then, softly...

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        But-- I’m sure there’s something we can 
                        do. I could get a second job--

                                 FATHER
                        Johnny, it’s not that kind of thing, it 
                        wouldn’t help.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Or I could get a third job. Or--
                                (as his Father protests)
                        Or-- or I could-- or I could sell my car, 
                        or I could--

                                 FATHER
                        DAMMIT!

           CRASH-- John’s Father has sent a PLATE FLYING ACROSS THE ROOM.

           To be clear-- he didn’t throw the plate at anyone-- far from 
           it-- but John nevertheless runs over to shield his mother, 
           his arms out wide.

                                 FATHER
                        Just listen to me for once: It’s done, 
                        okay?, it’s over. In less than a month, 
                        this’ll all belong to the bank. It’s the 
                        same thing as happened to my old man, 
                        prolly the same as happened to his old 
                        man, if anyone could remember...

           John frowns. He’s never seen his father so fatalistic before.

                                 FATHER
                        Look... the way the world works... 
                        there’s people who get the breaks and 
                        people who don’t... And maybe you haven’t 
                        experienced that yet, but... But if 
                        you’re anything like the men who came 
                        before you...

           That thought is too terrible to finish-- but John, struck by 
           by its meaning, by what it augurs, says the unsayable...
                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        ...One day I will.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE -- BACK PORCH -- MAGIC HOUR [2001]

           John traverses the patio of his magnificent estate.

           He looks out on his grand, glistening Redwing Farm, aglow 
           with the golds and crimsons of post-storm dusk.

           Whether he realizes it at the moment, whether it’s forever 
           on his mind, or whether it’s unthinkable-- he has, by any 
           method of accounting, come a long way since 1966.

           In the near distance, a family of RABBITS hops through 
           the eastern soy field. But John doesn’t seem to mind; 
           there’s bounty enough for all. But then--

           Tom walks onto the porch, a phone in his hand...

                                 TOM
                        John? Jamie for you.

           ...and now, John’s jaw begins perceptibly to clench.

           INT./EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT COMPLEX -- DAY [2001]

           JAMIE HUGHES (23) makes his way through a sun-baked, 70s-era 
           complex, heading from his starter car, up the stairs, toward 
           his starter apartment. 

           In one hand, he carries a brown paper bag; with the other, 
           he presses his cell to his ear. He simmers with barely-
           concealed rage.

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Did you tell Elliot Gibbs to go fuck 
                        himself?

           INTERCUT.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Jamie...

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Cuz what I heard is, you told him to fuck 
                        himself and now he’s killing our story.

           But John says nothing.

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Dad? You wanna tell me what’s going on?
                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        ...Nothing is “going on.” He’s a 
                        reporter, you can’t believe a word that 
                        he says, I thought you knew better than 
                        that.

           Jamie exhales in silent rage.

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Look, Dad: I made a promise to these 
                        producers. You think if I don’t deliver-- 
                        you think they’ll work with me again?

           Hughes, at a loss, defaults to anger.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        And what’s so great about “working with 
                        them again”?

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                                (sighs)
                        To write more movies, to have a career.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                                (scoffs)
                        Writing movies-- the work of the 
                        desperate for the depraved.

           Now, Jamie lets himself into his APARTMENT--

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Okay, look: I’m not gonna fight with you. 
                        Not about L.A., or about the industry. 
                        You’ve made your feelings on all of that 
                        very clear...
                                (as he removes a fifth of 
                                Jack from his bag, as he 
                                fixes himself a drink)
                        And look, I get it. You hate it. Okay. 
                        But I don’t. So maybe it’s changed in the 
                        last few years...

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Pfft.

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Or maybe I’m just not you.

           A beat. Shifting gears...

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Dad-- please-- I have put everything on 
                        the line for this.
                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                                (re: a sound)
                        Are you drinking again?

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                                (ignoring)
                        This film is my one shot. It is 
                        everything I have. I don’t expect you to 
                        understand that, but please, for my sake-- 
                        can’t you pick up the phone and ask Gibbs 
                        to try again?

           John frowns, registering that. Misreading the silence--

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Fine. Well... can you tell me why not, at 
                        least? What’s so much more important to 
                        you than me?
                                (a pause; then)
                        Dad? Are you there?

           But John is looking out over his fields... and sees that the 
           Rabbits are starting to burrow.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        I have to go.

           And he hangs up, leaving his son to stew in confusion and 
           misery.

           INT. JOHN’S PARENTS’ HOUSE -- JOHN’S ROOM -- NIGHT [1966]

           John lies on his bed in a room that’s mostly bare, save for 
           his Donovan posters and his self-made Beatles art.

           Elsewhere in the house: sounds of WANTON DESTRUCTION.

           John drums his pen elaborately on his hand, as he did at the 
           Crown Dogs table. Then, he checks the time: 8:15. Seeing 
           that, he sighs, gets up-- and takes a peek in his CLOSET:

           He’s looking for something “nice,” but there isn’t much that 
           fits the bill, save for a single button-down shirt and a 
           pair of slacks, mostly unworn, all the way in the back...

           INT. FARMHOUSE -- JOHN’S CLOSET -- DUSK [2001]

           Hughes looks in his spacious closet, where everything is 
           “nice”... save for a pair of overalls, mostly unworn, all the 
           way in the back.
           EXT. REDWING FARM -- SOY FIELD -- DUSK [2001]

           Hughes, now in (new) overalls and (new) boots, tromps 
           between soy rows, closing in on the offending Rabbits.

           But he takes a bad step (he’s clearly not used to working 
           the fields) and-- SPLASH-- he trips, landing, prone, in a 
           puddle.

           He stays there a moment, watching his reflection begin to 
           resolve as the muddy water settles. What looks back at him 
           is the image of a man who looks faintly ridiculous, out of 
           place. Over--

                                 TIFFANY (PRE-LAP)
                        What are you doing here?

           EXT. RICHIE HOUSE -- NORTH HILLS -- NIGHT [1966]

           16-Year-Old John, done up in his “nice” duds, sits on a 
           stone bench in the front yard of a sprawling McMansion in 
           which a high school party is currently raging. To say that 
           he looks nervous and out-of-place in this setting would be 
           to understate the case rather drastically.

           Tiffany approaches, having just left the bash herself. If 
           John wasn’t so caught up in his own anxieties, he’d notice 
           that she’s not having the greatest night of her life.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Hm?

                                 TIFFANY
                        I said, what are you doing here?

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Oh. Well-- I, uh, I heard there was a 
                        party?

                                 TIFFANY
                                (nods; then)
                        You want a tip? A house party, it tends 
                        to be inside the house.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        ...Yeah, I know.

           And now, Tiffany notices that John hasn’t come empty-handed:

                                 TIFFANY
                        Wait, did you bring a bottle of wine?

           She half-grins, trying to see what John has in his hands-- 
           but of course, he hides it-- which induces her to pursue--
                                 TIFFANY
                        Oh my gosh, it’s French and everything!

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Yeah, I know, it’s-- it’s stupid. I’m 
                        stupid. I shouldn’t’ve come here, I just-- 
                        I’ll see ya around.

           He scrambles to his feet and begins to hurry off, when--

                                 TIFFANY
                        No. Wait. Don’t go. Look, all I meant-- 
                        it may be a little too good for the 
                        pieces of shit who come to these things.

           John stops.

                                 TIFFANY
                        I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have laughed. I 
                        guess-- you’re a little bit out of your 
                        element, huh?

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        At a Richie party in Highland Park? Yeah, 
                        just a bit.

           She considers that a moment.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Well, I dunno if this helps at all, 
                        but... believe it or not... I’m out of my 
                        element too.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                                (”yeah, right”)
                        Really? You hide it well.

                                 TIFFANY
                        I know. And tonight I think I found out 
                        it’s cuz I’m out of my element 
                        everywhere, so I’ve racked up plenty of 
                        practice.

           John notices now, for the first time, the slug trails of 
           mascara running down Tiffany’s cheeks. But before he can say 
           anything, a hot CHEERLEADER-type steps out of the house, 
           scans the lawn, and hollers at Tiffany--

                                 CHEERLEADER
                        Tiff? What’re you doing? We’re about to 
                        play spin-the-bottle! 

                                 TIFFANY
                        Um, I’m kind of trying to talk to my 
                        friend here.
                                 CHEERLEADER
                        Joey Barnes asked you to play! He told me 
                        you’re in his top five for prom--

                                 TIFFANY
                        Well you tell him, it’s an honor just to 
                        be nominated, but--

                                 RANDOM HOT GUY
                                (to the Cheerleader)
                        Giggles! Hey, c’mon, the party’s inside!

           That would be a RANDOM HOT GUY who’s just come outside, 
           pursuing the Cheerleader-- who now tickles her, until she 
           SHRIEKS and is so overcome with hilarity that it’s all she 
           can do to scramble back into the house. To John--

                                 TIFFANY
                        That would be Candice.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Yeah. I know who she is. She’s like the 
                        most popular girl in school.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Yeah well, under that polished shell, 
                        you’ll find... more shell.
                                (when John smiles)
                        That’s not even the funny part. The funny 
                        part is... she’s my best friend.

           A beat. Then, Tiffany starts to take off...

                                 TIFFANY
                        Well enjoy your party.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        W-wait. Are you leaving?

                                 TIFFANY
                        That’s the general idea.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Wait, it’s just-- Look-- the only reason I 
                        came to this-- I was hoping... I thought-- 
                        I dunno-- maybe I’d find you here?

           Hearing that, Tiffany stops.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Don’t you think that’s a bit presumptuous?

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        You mean-- cuz you’re a Richie and I’m a 
                        Zoid?
                                 TIFFANY
                        No of course that’s not what I mean. I 
                        mean, cuz we’ve barely met. I mean, what 
                        makes you think I even remember your 
                        name...

           And now, John turns his eyes toward the pavement, ashamed...

                                 TIFFANY
                        ...John Hughes?

           And he looks up-- to see Tiffany flashing a dazzling smile.

           EXT. NORTHBROOK -- NIGHT

           Quiet, leafy blocks and foggy, tree-lined thoroughfares. 
           Some sights we may recognize-- the churches from Home Alone, 
           from Sixteen Candles...

           In every shot, a pink ‘64 Mustang rolls along, Tiffany at the 
           wheel, John at her side. We HEAR their conversation over--

                                 TIFFANY (O.S.)
                        Tell you what, I won’t go home on one 
                        condition: I’m not staying here to spin-
                        the-bottle with Joey Barnes.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN (O.S.)
                                (laughs)
                        Works for me. Where do you wanna go?

                                 TIFFANY (O.S.)
                        Anywhere else. Just not the park-- that’s 
                        where Coach Vernon takes his wife for 
                        their date every Friday night.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN (O.S.)
                        Christ. You think we’ll ever be like them?

                                 TIFFANY (O.S.)
                        Yes.

           INT./EXT. ‘64 MUSTANG -- NIGHT [MOVING]

           The car is hugging the edge of Lincoln Park, making its way 
           south, as suburban calm gives way to metropolitan energy.

                                 TIFFANY
                        How much further is it?

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Like the northwest corner of Old Town.
                                 TIFFANY
                                (embarrassed)
                        I don’t really know the city.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        It’s not too far.
                                (a beat; then)
                        And hey-- thanks for driving. I know the 
                        guy is supposed to drive. It’s just...

                                 TIFFANY
                        Your car in the shop or something?

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Or something. I had to sell it. My dad 
                        kinda went bust.

           Tiffany watches the road, processing this new information.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        But hey, do me a favor: don’t sit there 
                        feeling sorry for me.

                                 TIFFANY
                        I’m not.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Yeah, sure.

                                 TIFFANY
                        No, I was actually-- I think I was 
                        feeling jealous.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Jealous?

                                 TIFFANY
                        Sure. I was just thinking... if my dad 
                        went bust... maybe my mom would finally 
                        wise up, you know? Ditch the creep.

           John considers that. With a half-grin, he makes a confession:

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Y’know, ever since my dad lost his 
                        business, you know what he’s decided he 
                        really likes? His real passion in life-- 
                        is throwing shit.

                                 TIFFANY
                                (laughs)
                        Well ever since my dad got really 
                        successful, he’s decided his real passion 
                        in life is... nobody ever bothering him. 
                        Ever.
           John’s smile fades. Clocking that--

                                 TIFFANY
                        Now hey, it’s not fair for you to sit 
                        there feeling sorry for me. I’m fine. I 
                        think families are just tough. You know?
                                (then)
                        I mean, if they weren’t, people would 
                        live with their parents forever. Right?

           Careful viewers will recognize that as a Breakfast Club quote.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Hey-- it’s right up there on your left.

           He points to a driveway up ahead.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Doesn’t it say “No Public Access”?

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Yeah, it’s alright.

           So she pulls into a DRIVEWAY, where a music club manager, 
           SCOOP (African-American, 40s) is smoking a cigarette.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Hey Scoop. You got any room for us?

                                 SCOOP
                                (lights up at the sight of 
                                him)
                        Always for you, Johnny, always for you! 
                        Just hang a right at the crime scene.

           There’s a permanent/ironic “crime scene” at the edge of the 
           lot (chalk outline, police tape, etc.).

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Thanks.

                                 SCOOP
                        Oh and Johnny-- that band you got us? 
                        Those cats are oughtta sight. No 
                        bullshit; we got these stiffs hoppin’ 
                        tonight. So lemme do this for you: y’all 
                        can go in the back way, and the liquor’s 
                        on us tonight, you understand?

           Off Tiffany-- thinking she may have misjudged the odd, 
           sensitive boy in the passenger seat of her car.
           INT. OLD TOWN MUSIC CLUB -- NIGHT

           As John and his date enter the cozy dive, packed shoulder-to-
           shoulder with the HIP and SOPHISTICATED, Tiffany clings to 
           John. She’s the outsider here, the uninitiated-- a new 
           feeling for her and not an entirely welcome one...

                                 TIFFANY
                        What did that guy mean when he said you 
                        “got” the band?

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Oh, just-- I’ve been hanging around so 
                        much, some of the clubs have put me to 
                        work, scouting bands.
                                (off her)
                        Trust me: it’s small venues for crap pay: 
                        it’s not a big deal.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Not a big deal? You’re 16.

           John considers that, as if for the first time.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        I guess... if I don’t wanna end up like 
                        my dad, I figure-- I better work as hard 
                        as I can as young as I can. You know?

           Tiffany says nothing. The boys in her circles don’t “figure” 
           things like that.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Hey, listen-- what do you think of these 
                        cats?

           By “cats,” he means the BAND-- a harmony-rock group in the 
           tradition of The Byrds. Tiffany listens a moment.

                                 TIFFANY
                        They’re good. Kind of different...

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                                (getting lost in the music)
                        The song’s about how they don’t wanna be 
                        like their parents. Which, I mean, I know 
                        that sounds kind of obvious, but it’s 
                        like... They do wanna have ambition. You 
                        know? They do wanna have big lives, just-- 
                        Big on their own terms... Not their dads’ 
                        ideas of “big”... They don’t-- The way 
                        our parents went to sleep? They don’t 
                        wanna do that... They wanna stay awake... 
                        Feel things... Love and... the opposite 
                        of love... and everything else besides.
           Tiffany looks at him as if she’s witnessed a display of magic.

                                 TIFFANY
                        You know what I just realized?

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        ...What?

                                 TIFFANY
                        That you’re gonna have an amazing life.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                                (smiles sadly)
                        You barely know me.

                                 TIFFANY
                        I know that.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Well-- it’s not exactly the Hughes way.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Then in that case... I guess you’ll make 
                        your own way.

           And now, John looks into Tiffany’s eyes... and pulls her 
           into the first KISS of his young life.

           This is not a kiss that any high schooler has ever 
           experienced: it’s a kiss that brightens the lights, a kiss 
           that swells the music. It’s a kiss so perfect and promising 
           and pure that it could only occur... well, in a John Hughes 
           production.

           We DOLLY AROUND this impossible kiss, which is somehow, at 
           once, both perfectly chaste and wholly ecstatic. We absorb 
           its improbable jubilance in 360 degrees before we...

                                                     MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. CHURCH -- DAY [1970]

           John’s wedding. We’re coming in right at the climax, just as 
           the groom is planting a kiss on his beautiful bride. 

           The ONLOOKERS applaud: John’s parents sob and grin... Scoop 
           whoops... relatives aww... and Tiffany claps and smiles...

           LET’S REVISIT THAT: Tiffany’s in the crowd. Which, of course, 
           raises a question as to who, exactly, John is marrying...

           But when the newlyweds make their way down the aisle, we get 
           our answer: John is holding hands with Frumpy Blonde who 
           lived next door to him, to whom he barely gave the time of 
           day.
           CLOSER on John: he’s smiling like he’s supposed to smile-- 
           but his grin doesn’t register happiness; his eyes don’t 
           register bliss.

           When he locks eyes with Tiffany, however, it is instantly, 
           utterly clear that he’s still in love with her. For her 
           part, she holds his gaze a beat, then looks away.

           Oblivious to this, but clearly conscious that something is 
           conspicuously “off” with the newlywed couple, Tiffany’s date 
           (JOEY BARNES) leans down and whispers-- perhaps a little too 
           loudly and definitely too soon--

                                 JOEY BARNES
                        I give it six months.

           From a blizzard of RICE to...

           INT. HUGHES FARMHOUSE — NANCY’S ROOM — DUSK [2001]

           NANCY HUGHES, the once-frumpy girl, is now a matronly woman, 
           some 24 years after her wedding day.

           At present, she sits in her bedroom, tatting doilies. Our 
           first impression of her is that of a weary spouse, one whose 
           inner light has dimmed over the years, the victim of too 
           many minor slights and indignities.

           Behind Nancy, John comes to the door, a cordless phone 
           pressed to his ear. He peeks in at his wife, then moves on, 
           (silently) closing the door behind him.

           As soon as he’s gone, Nancy looks up, aware of his presence, 
           her Green Eyes obviously troubled-- this is a woman who 
           knows more than she lets on.

                                 HUGHES (PRE-LAP)
                        Hank. It’s Hughes.

           HALLWAY -- SAME

           John heads down the corridor, en route to his study--

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        I have what I assume you’ll receive as 
                        happy news: I’m finally going to sue 
                        somebody.

           INT. MANHATTAN LAW FIRM -- DAY

           HANK (50s), wearing the suit of a hotshot attorney, heads 
           down a flight of marble stairs and speaks into his cell.
                                 HANK (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Aw, who’s the lucky girl? Wait, don’t tell 
                        me, let me guess: is it by any chance 
                        Elliot Gibbs of Premiere Magazine?

           INTERCUT.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        You know about this?

                                 HANK (INTO THE PHONE)
                        We were sent the book a couple of days 
                        ago. I only just found out about it 
                        myself.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Well it is 24-karat slander.

                                 HANK (INTO THE PHONE)
                        I believe you 100%. And if we had a 
                        chance of convincing a jury of that, 
                        trust me, I’d beat down the door of the 
                        Clerk of Court in a New York minute.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        ...Excuse me?

                                 HANK (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Look, John-- the thing about slander, 
                        it’s almost impossible to prove. You have 
                        to show that the book is malicious and 
                        false and that he knows it’s false.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Of course he knows!

                                 HANK (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Really? What makes you so sure? Have you 
                        talked to him about it? Given him 
                        evidence of its errors?

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        That’s exactly what he wants is for me to 
                        comment!

                                 HANK (INTO THE PHONE)
                        You see the problem.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Can’t we just, I dunno, tie it up in 
                        court?

                                 HANK (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Well we could give it a shot, but-- his 
                        publisher’s pretty committed.
                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        His “publisher”?

                                 HANK (INTO THE PHONE)
                        HarperCollins. Who apparently gave him a 
                        pretty obscene advance. Which I believe 
                        increases to “pornographic” if he gets 
                        you on the record. Look, the only way out 
                        is if you could somehow prove his sources 
                        were fabrications, which you can’t, which 
                        nobody ever can.

           John registers that. As he does, Hank ducks into an EMPTY 
           OFFICE and closes the door. In a graver tone...

                                 HANK (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Look: my advice: prepare Nancy, prepare 
                        the kids. If your family makes it through 
                        this thing in one piece, that’s a victory.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        ...If they “make it through”? What are 
                        you talking about?

           A beat.

                                 HANK (INTO THE PHONE)
                        John, you have read the book, haven’t you?

           Hughes just stands there, stock-still.

                                 HANK (INTO THE PHONE)
                        ...John? ...Hello?

           JOHN’S STUDY -- LATER

           A MAID is cleaning up Hughes’s trophy shards-- but when John 
           walks in, she pads immediately, soundlessly out of the room.

                                 HUGHES (O.S.)
                        I mean, I gave it a shot, but I have an 
                        allergy to bullshit.

                                 HANK (O.S.)
                        Well dip into Chapter Four, it’ll clear 
                        your sinuses right up.

           Hughes sits at his desk, opens Gibbs’ book to Chapter Four.

                                 HUGHES (O.S.)
                        Why? What do you mean? What does it say?

           CLOSE ON THE BOOK, whose Chapter Four begins with a quote 
           from Michelle Manning: “The first time I heard of John...”
                                 HUGHES (O.S.)
                        What does he say in Chapter Four?

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        The first time I heard of John Hughes, I 
                        was working for Francis Ford Coppola.

           INT. AMERICAN ZOETROPE OFFICES -- DAY [1982]

           A funky, bustling office with expansive views of the bay. 
           Apocalypse Now art on the walls. At a desk in the far 
           corner...

           ...find MICHELLE MANNING (23, peppy, driven), who is, at 
           present, extracting a script from a courier envelope-- which 
           she throws in the trash, where it lands alongside a DOZEN 
           IDENTICAL ENVELOPES.

           This is, in other words, an average day in the life of a 
           small prodco employee in the early 1980s (though, for 
           whatever it’s worth [and it’s worth zero], Michelle’s 
           official title at Zoetrope is “production supervisor”).

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        John had written Mr. Mom and Vacation at 
                        that point, but nothing had been 
                        released, so he was basically unknown.

           Wearily, Michelle cracks open Sixteen Candles.

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        Now in Hollywood, an unknown writer is a 
                        bit like an unknown drug-- a little 
                        intriguing, but nobody wants to be the 
                        first to try it.

           She begins to read... AND LATER, she’s reading from a bean 
           bag... AND LATER STILL, she’s reading from a daybed, now in 
           full recline. By now, she’s deep in the script, and her mood 
           and carriage and demeanor have shifted: she’s fully 
           engrossed, and her eyes have a new focus, a new luster...

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        But when I got into Sixteen Candles... 
                        well, it’s a little hard to explain... but 
                        it was like... like I was moving back in 
                        time... You know?... Like I was suddenly 
                        back in high school... feeling those old 
                        feelings... This script-- I mean, it was 
                        like nothing I’d ever read before.
           INT. MICHELLE’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Michelle is curled up in bed, petting her fluffy CAT, looking 
           more and more like a teen herself, as she (re-?)reads John’s 
           script...

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        I mean, it wasn’t just about teens, but 
                        for them... It was told in their own 
                        language. It took them seriously. We may 
                        take that for granted now, but-- this was 
                        the era of Porky’s and Animal House. In 
                        ’82, a movie like this, it had never been 
                        made before.

           She closes the script. Looks at the Cat. Knits her brow.

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        But as soon as I finished the script, I 
                        got this crazy idea in my head, like...

                                 MICHELLE
                                (to her Cat)
                        I’m gonna make this movie.

           On the Cat, deeply skeptical.

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        The problem-- as with most of the problems 
                        I’d have in my professional life-- could 
                        be summed up in two words: John Hughes.

           INT. NATIONAL LAMPOON OFFICES -- DAY [1978]

           A tribe of HIPPIES (aka “the writing staff”) loafs around, 
           getting stoned, while John, dressed in mall clothes, sits at 
           his desk, typing fluently, working diligently.

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        Before coming to town, John had written 
                        for the National Lampoon. Before that, 
                        he’d done a decade or so in advertising...

           INT. LEO BURNETT ADVERTISING AGENCY -- DAY [1976]

           A frat of BUSINESS BROS stands around, swapping conquest 
           stories, while John, dressed in mall clothes, sits at his 
           desk, typing fluently, working diligently...

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        The thing you always heard was that he 
                        was fast-- lightning-fast. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MICHELLE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But his biggest achievement at that point 
                        was an ad called the Credit Card 
                        Challenge.

           FOOTAGE: AN EDGE SHAVING CREAM SPOT

                                 SPOKESMAN
                        With an ordinary credit card, we’re going 
                        to prove that Edge lets you shave faster 
                        than the leading foam.

           As the SPOKESMAN proceeds to demonstrate Edge’s wonders...

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        Now-- that isn’t exactly the kind of 
                        resume that makes studio bosses light up 
                        with visions of dollar signs and 
                        statuettes. And John was attached to 
                        direct. But when I went to work for Ned 
                        Tanen, I thought he might be okay with 
                        that; after all, his reputation was, he 
                        liked to take chances on new directors...

           INT. CHANNEL PRODUCTIONS -- TANEN’S OFFICE -- DAY [1982]

           Michelle sits across from the legendary NED TANEN (51), in 
           whose hands she places Sixteen Candles.

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        He’d given George Lucas one of his first 
                        movies, and John Landis, and Joel 
                        Schumacher, Amy Heckerling-- and a whole 
                        long list of others. So I handed him the 
                        script and I said, “I think you should 
                        make this.”

                                 MICHELLE
                        I think you should make this.

                                 NED TANEN
                        Okay.

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        And he said okay!

           On Michelle, beaming--

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        And I regretted it every day for the next 
                        year and a half.

           EXT. UNIVERSAL STUDIOS -- DAY [1983] [ESTABLISHING]
           I./E. JOHN’S CAR / GATE 3 -- SAME

           A MERCEDES pulls through the left lane, a LAMBORGHINI through 
           the right. Behind them is a ‘79 CHEVY NOVA-- John’s car. 
           John, we’ll note, is still dressed in mall clothes.

                                 GATE GUARD
                        Well look who it is: the only director 
                        I’ve ever met, drives a Nova.

                                 HUGHES
                                (smiles)
                        Hey, I’m from the Midwest. We’re 
                        practical people.

           THE GATE GUARD grins, hands John a pass.

                                 HUGHES
                        Say, Rick, do you happen know if...
                                (whispers)
                        ...if Ms. Manning is on the lot?

                                 MICHELLE (O.S.)
                        GOD DAMN YOU, JOHN HUGHES!

                                 HUGHES
                                (tiny beat)
                        I withdraw the question.

           And now we see...

           Michelle Manning, standing a few paces away from the gate 
           (she’s clearly been waiting for Hughes). She is, at present, 
           waving a MEMO at John-- the way you’d wave a chewed-up throw 
           pillow at your dog while bawling it out--

                                 MICHELLE (PRE-LAP)
                        What is the meaning of this?!

           INT. JOHN’S NOVA -- LATER

           Michelle rides shotgun, as John navigates the winding 
           streets of the lot.

                                 MICHELLE
                                (re: the memo)
                        You wrote the President of Production that 
                        you, “Respectfully decline his casting 
                        suggestions for the role of Sam Baker”?

                                 HUGHES
                        Well... it means I decline his 
                        suggestions for the role of Sam Baker. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HUGHES (CONT'D)
                        The “respectfully” part was admittedly 
                        dishonest, and I regret it.

           John turns into a small lot.

                                 MICHELLE
                        But Sam Baker’s the lead part! And that 
                        no-name girl you wanna cast--

                                 HUGHES
                        She has a name.

                                 MICHELLE
                        She cannot. Carry. A movie. Of this size!

                                 HUGHES
                        You’ve never seen her.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Neither have you! That’s the point! She’s 
                        been in one movie that nobody saw! 

           By now, John has parked, and he’s already out of his car. 
           Scrambling after him--

                                 MICHELLE
                        We are not finished discussing this!

           EXT. OFFICE COMPLEX -- CONTINUOUS

           John, a spring in his step, approaches a squat, pretty 
           building as HILTON GREEN (60), his line producer, intercepts--

                                 GREEN
                        Hey, John.

                                 HUGHES
                        Morning, Hilt!

                                 GREEN
                                (re: some paperwork)
                        Say, I was working on this last night, 
                        and I think I can make the budget work, 
                        so long as we shoot in L.A.

                                 HUGHES
                        But we’re shooting in Chicago.

                                 MICHELLE
                                (catching up)
                        What does it matter? This story can take 
                        place anywhere.

                                 HUGHES
                        But making it here won’t be any fun.
           And with that, he heads into the building.

           In John’s wake stands a bewildered-looking Green, who 
           appears as if he’s suddenly concerned with his aural 
           processing. He turns to Michelle--

                                 GREEN
                        Did... Did he say “fun”?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Thanks, Hilt. I’ll take it from here.

           She takes Green’s paperwork and follows John into...

           INT. UNIVERSAL -- OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

           ...where John bounds up a FLIGHT OF STAIRS. Calling after--

                                 MICHELLE
                        John!

                                 HUGHES
                                (waves her off)
                        I’ve spent years working for clients, 
                        Michelle, for editors, for people whose 
                        only mission in life is to make sure that 
                        nothing is like it’s supposed to be. Well 
                        this is my chance to do things right for 
                        once, which means shooting. in. Chicago. 
                        I mean, the story takes place in Shermer, 
                        Illinois for Chrissake.

           As they turn a corner--

                                 MICHELLE
                        What’s wrong with Shermer, California?

                                 HUGHES
                        Shermer, Calif--? There isn’t any such 
                        place!

                                 MICHELLE
                        It’s a fictional town, John! You just 
                        pulled the place out of your ass.

                                 HUGHES
                        And that is the magic of movies, 
                        Michelle: that you can bring to life the 
                        contents of your ass!

                         MICHELLE
                                                      HUGHES
           John, will you please--?
                                            Hooray for Hollywood! 
                                            America’s dream mill!

           John goes off-- and this time, Michelle elects not to pursue.
           CASTING AREA -- CONTINUOUS

           As John makes a bee-line for the end of the hall, his 
           casting director, JACKIE BIRCH, approaches, keeping pace--

                                 BIRCH
                        John-- I heard there’s a casting session?

                                 HUGHES
                        I wouldn’t call it that.

                                 BIRCH
                        Okay, well, you are aware that I’m the 
                        Casting Director, right? So probably, you 
                        should inform me when there’s a session.

                                 HUGHES
                        There isn’t a session.

                                 BIRCH
                        Look, I saw the girl from “Tempest” come 
                        in-- Molly Ringston?

                                 HUGHES
                        Molly Ringwald.

                                 BIRCH
                        Well look, she was great in the movie--

                                 HUGHES
                        Was she really? I haven’t seen it.

                                 BIRCH
                        But you know as well as I do she isn’t a 
                        star. Which means the Black Tower will 
                        have an absolute cow if you try to make 
                        her the lead. But if you want her to come 
                        in and read--

                                 HUGHES
                        She isn’t reading.

                                 BIRCH
                        She isn’t reading?

                                 HUGHES
                        She isn’t reading. But thanks for the 
                        input, Jackie. That’s all for now.

           He enters an OFFICE, shutting the door behind him.

                                 BIRCH
                        But that’s my office.
           INT. UNIVERSAL -- CASTING OFFICE -- DAY

           John enters and says...

                                 HUGHES
                        I’m sorry to keep you waiting.

           ...at which point, a rolling chair spins around to reveal...

           MOLLY RINGWALD (15), possessed of what Pauline Kael called a 
           “charismatic normality,” adorned by what Time described as 
           “waxed-candy lips semaphoring a smile.”

           IT IS INSTANTLY CLEAR THAT (THE ACTRESS WHO PLAYS) MOLLY 
           BEARS AN UNLIKELY, UNCANNY RESEMBLANCE TO TIFFANY: she’s even 
           done up in Tiffany-esque clothes; her hair is even teased 
           into a Tiffany-esque do.

           This, to be clear, is the first time John has seen Molly in 
           the flesh, and the sight of her seems to repair something 
           deep within him... as if he’s been running on low voltage 
           for the last couple of decades and the power has finally 
           been restored. Extending his hand...

                                 HUGHES
                        I’m John Hughes.

                                 MOLLY
                                (shaking)
                        I’m Molly.

                                 HUGHES
                        Molly, you look...
                                (beams)
                        ...exactly like your headshot!

                                 MOLLY
                                (confused)
                        Well-- aren’t I s’posed to?

                                 HUGHES
                        Yeah. But... Well... People aren’t always 
                        what they’re supposed to be.

           A beat. Then, snapping out of his reverie--

                                 HUGHES
                        Can I get you something to drink? Coffee? 
                        Water?

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m okay.

           But he heads to a Mr. Coffee and begins brewing himself a pot.
                                 HUGHES
                        Did you have a chance to read the script?

                                 MOLLY
                        Of course I read it.

                                 HUGHES
                        And? Whaddya think? You wanna do it?

                                 MOLLY
                        Well-- that’s why I’m auditioning.

                                 HUGHES
                        You’re not auditioning.

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m... I’m not?

                                 HUGHES
                                (measuring grounds)
                        What did you think of it? And be brutal: 
                        I want your unvarnished opinion.

                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t-- wait, I’m not auditioning?

                                 HUGHES
                        No. You’re not auditioning.

                                 MOLLY
                        But my agent... She said, you wanted me to 
                        come in and... she said I was s’posed 
                        to... I don’t understand.

           Hughes turns to her.

                                 HUGHES
                        Well: see: I had your headshot as part of 
                        a stack I got maybe a year ago from your 
                        agency. From ICM. And-- I kept it taped 
                        up over my desk while I was writing 
                        Sixteen Candles, so... you might say, in 
                        a way, it was written for you.

                                 MOLLY
                        It was? I mean-- you did?

           John nods.

                                 HUGHES
                        I saw you every time I looked up. Every 
                        morning, noon, and night. Every day for 
                        five days.
                                 MOLLY
                        You--? Wait, you wrote the script in five 
                        days?

                                 HUGHES
                        That’s actually kind of a lie. I actually 
                        wrote in three, but... well... it was 
                        five til I could stop looking at you.

           He stares at her. She shrinks from his gaze.

                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t understand.

                                 HUGHES
                                (sits beside her)
                        You have-- You can call it whatever you 
                        want. “Presence.” “Star power.” But it’s 
                        so strong, it even comes through in a 
                        lousy headshot.

                                 MOLLY
                        It does?

                                 HUGHES
                                (smiles)
                        You are everything I’m looking for. And I 
                        can tell just from talking that you’ll be 
                        perfect in this movie.

                                 MOLLY
                        You can?

           John nods.

                                 MOLLY
                        But-- but that doesn’t make any sense-- I 
                        mean, how can you tell that just-- from a 
                        conversation?

           John lets out a hearty laugh, as if that’s a charming, 
           childish question.

                                 HUGHES
                        Well I guess you’ll just have to trust me.
                                (then; leaning in; intense)
                        Do you? Trust me?

           Molly feels off-balance, out of control... but then, what 
           can she really say except...

                                 MOLLY
                        ...Okay?

           Just then, the Mr. Coffee BEEPS, and John jumps up to grab a 
           cup--
                                 HUGHES
                        Great! Then it’s all settled. I mean, 
                        assuming you’ll have me.

                                 MOLLY
                        Have you?

                                 HUGHES
                        Well you never answered my question. 
                        Whether you liked the script.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh-- well yeah-- I mean, it’s good--

                                 HUGHES
                        You mean that?

                                 MOLLY
                        Well yeah, I really liked it--

                                 HUGHES
                                (turns)
                        Cuz if that’s true-- I have others. Four 
                        others. A couple of ‘em even better than 
                        this one. Between you and me, I see this 
                        as just the first in a series of movies 
                        we’ll make together. Ringwald-Hughes. 
                        Hughes-Ringwald.

           On Molly, for whom the odd is transforming into the surreal...

                                 MOLLY
                        ...I-- are you offering me five parts?

                                 HUGHES
                        Well sure. But that’s just for starters.

                                 MOLLY
                        But you don’t even know if I can act!

                                 HUGHES
                        I don’t know if I can direct! So what the 
                        hell, let’s bankrupt Universal together, 
                        you and me. Whaddya say?

           For Molly, this has now passed “absurd” and has entered the 
           realm of straight-up, looney-tunes nuts. So she responds in 
           the way that people respond to zaniness, which is to say, 
           she lets out a big LAUGH. Hughes smiles.

                                 HUGHES
                        I’m gonna take that as a yes. Here--
                                (tosses her a phone)
                        Call your agent. Tell her you’re booked 
                        up til 1991.
                                 MOLLY
                                (along for the ride)
                        Okay.

           John heads for the door-- but stops to say--

                                 HUGHES
                        But yeah, you should actually call her: 
                        we shoot in less than a month.

           He’s again about to leave-- but again turns back--

                                 HUGHES
                        You’re gonna love Chicago, Tiffan--
                                (catches himself; then)
                        Molly.

           From John’s euphoric face to...

                                 JOHN III (PRE-LAP)
                        Why did the superhero flush the toilet?

           INT. HUGHES RENTAL HOUSE -- DINING ROOM -- DUSK [1983]

           ...John, possessed of an extremely different demeanor, as he 
           eats dinner with his family. Around his wife and children, he 
           seems quiet, reserved-- and every inch the adult.

           He sits with Nancy (33), YOUNG JAMIE (4), and the Hughes’ 
           eldest son, JOHN III (7). The atmosphere is formal, stiff-- 
           against which mood, John III (”Jack”) is attempting a joke.

                                 JOHN III
                        Mom?

                                 NANCY
                        I dunno, Jack. Why’d the superhero flush 
                        the toilet?

                                 JOHN III
                        Because it was his doody.

           Nancy smiles at that. A genuine smile-- she likes the joke.

                                 NANCY
                        That’s funny. You gonna write jokes like 
                        Daddy when you grow up?

           Now, everyone looks at John, whose response is only...

                                 HUGHES
                        We let him talk like that at the dinner 
                        table?
                                 JOHN III
                                (apologetic; confused)
                        It’s... it’s not... it’s a homonym.

           Nancy looks at Jack-- it’s okay. Everyone looks back at their 
           plates... eating in silence... until--

                                 HUGHES
                        Hey, speaking of flushing the toilet-- 
                        turns out, we’re out of here on the 20th.

                                 NANCY
                        ...I thought we were going back to 
                        Chicago the twenty-eighth.

                                 HUGHES
                        Well. It changed.

                                 JOHN III
                        What about Disneyland?

           John looks at him.

                                 NANCY
                        He’s supposed to go on the 21st.

                                 HUGHES
                                (shrugs)
                        It’s work. It’s not like I had a choice.

           He goes back to his food; the discussion is closed.

                                 HUGHES (PRE-LAP)
                                (hyper-enthusiastic)
                        Hey! I got an idea!

           EXT. CHICAGO O’HARE AIRPORT -- DUSK [1983]

           A 747 touches down...

                                 HUGHES (O.S.)
                        You said you’ve never been to Chicago; 
                        why don’t we get there a week early, do 
                        some prep?

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        Like, to rehearse?

           INT. O’HARE -- BAGGAGE CLAIM -- NIGHT

           Two wheeled SUITCASES roll past a luggage carousel...
                                 HUGHES  (O.S.)
                        What? No, you don’t need to rehearse. 
                        You’re a natural. What we need is just to 
                        hang out together, spend time together, 
                        get comfortable. You know?

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        ...Okay?

           A MARBLE FLOOR

           The Suitcases roll over a marble floor...

                                 HUGHES (O.S.)
                        I’ll get the three of us joined rooms at 
                        the Skokie Hilton, so hopefully, it’ll be 
                        a little like summer camp.

           ...and the Suitcases come to a stop.

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        Wait-- what do you mean, “the three of 
                        us”? Like you and me and... who else?

           And now, we TILT UP to reveal that the marble floors are in 
           the LOBBY OF A HOTEL and that the Suitcases belong to John 
           and to...

           A 15-YEAR-OLD KID who is, at present, elaborately drumming 
           his pen against his hand-- the same gesture we saw John 
           perform repeatedly in his youth. To Molly (who’s been 
           waiting in the lobby for the guys to arrive), John offers a 
           formal introduction:

                                 HUGHES
                        This is Anthony Michael Hall. Michael, 
                        Molly. Molly, Michael. He’s your co-star, 
                        and you will love him, guaranteed.

                                 MOLLY
                        Hey.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hey.

           That completes their repertoire of small talk. So...

                                 MOLLY
                        I guess I’ll love you guaranteed.

                                 MICHAEL
                                (laughs)
                        Cool.
                                 HUGHES
                        You will. And you know why? Cuz he reminds 
                        me of me-- and you’re gonna love me.

           And with that, JOHN’S HAND FINDS ITS WAY ONTO MOLLY’S 
           BACK... and it gives the back a little RUB, the shoulder, a 
           little SQUEEZE.

           It’s their first touch. Molly TENSES at it... John SMILES... 
           and Michael FROWNS-- though, for the moment, he does his 
           best to ignore it.

           But John removes his hand, and the moment is over as quickly 
           as it began. With a nod of his head, he signals the kids to 
           follow him to the Front Desk...

                                 HUGHES
                        Well. I guess we should get checked in, 
                        get to our rooms, huh? Tomorrow’s a big 
                        day.

                                 MOLLY
                                (exchanges a look with Michael)
                        Wh-- why? What happens tomorrow?

                                 HUGHES
                        Oh, I got a list of a thousand things I’m 
                        supposed to do.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Whoa.

                                 HUGHES
                        Yeah. Good thing I’m blowing it off, huh?

                                 MICHAEL
                        You are?

                                 MOLLY
                        What do you mean?

                                 HUGHES
                        I mean, I have better things to do 
                        tomorrow than a “studio call on the shot 
                        list.”

                                 MOLLY
                        Like-- like what?

                                 HUGHES
                                (stops, grins)
                        Like hanging out with my new friends!

           Off the kids, not entirely sold on John, nor entirely un-
           charmed...
           INT. SKOKIE HILTON -- JOHN’S ROOM -- NIGHT

           John, with a weary sigh, sets down his luggage, then strolls 
           to the picture window, where he looks out and breathes in. 
           He takes in the sights, the sounds, the smells of the north 
           shore suburbs... the only place he’ll ever consider home.

           Then, his eyes fall on something-- something that excites 
           him-- a lit-up sign just across the street that reads...

                      SHERWIN WILLIAMS
                      MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES

           He gets an idea... and he futzes with the blinds until 
           they’re about three-quarters closed, until the sign reads...

                       SHER
                       MER

           John stares at the altered sign, smiles at its fortuitousness-- 
           as if it’s no coincidence, but an omen auguring favorable 
           winds. As we FADE OUT, the name of John’s fictional town burns 
           into the darkness for a beat-- before vanishing into...

                                                                BLACK.

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        What happened during that week before 
                        production, nobody knows. If you asked 
                        Michael or Molly or John about it-- 
                        they’d just stare into space and laugh.

           A SERIES OF SHOTS: MOLLY, MICHAEL, AND JOHN’S DAY OFF

           A collage of images that directly quote Ferris Bueller, as 
           John, Molly, and Michael partake in the prototype of what 
           will be a “day off” for Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane...

           Our trio cheers at WRIGLEY FIELD... they appreciate beauty 
           at THE ART INSTITUTE... they look out from THE SEARS 
           TOWER... they make mischief at THE MERCANTILE EXCHANGE...

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        As near as I can tell, it was Ferris 
                        Bueller’s Day Off. Except it wasn’t a day 
                        off; it was a week. And except that John 
                        wasn’t Ferris Bueller; he was a 
                        30something man in charge of a major 
                        motion picture.

           The trio ends a magical day at dusk, hanging out on the 
           NORTH SHORE LAKEFRONT, sipping Cokes, watching the sun dip 
           below the water. They seem, by now, like real friends.
           And when John puts his arm around Molly, she seems less 
           bothered by it than before. Michael darkens at the sight-- 
           but the darkness quickly passes...

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        But as John and the kids were busy 
                        cavorting around Chicago, well, progress 
                        on Sixteen Candles simply wasn’t being 
                        made... Still-- it wasn’t so much what 
                        John ignored during that week that almost 
                        sunk the ship-- it was what he did...

           ...John pulls Molly close...

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        ...the relationships he made...

           THE “FUN MONTAGE” SEGUES INTO A “WORK MONTAGE”, as...

           The Sixteen Candles CREW sets up for an exterior shot of JAKE 
           RYAN’S HOUSE. (We may recognize this place: it’s the house 
           that hosted the party John tried to attend when he was 16.)

           They shoot a scene in SAM’S HOUSE... and another in the GYM 
           OF NILES EAST HIGH SCHOOL (which, here, is dressed to 
           portray “Shermer High”).

                        See, the thing about Sixteen Candles-- 
                        part of the reason it got made-- it was 
                        s’posed to be fast and easy: “lean, mean, 
                        and teen.” It was mostly a few locations. 
                        Mostly dialogue. No effects. And there 
                        was no reason it couldn’t be shot in 35 
                        days... except one:

           The Crew is shooting the scene in the AUTO SHOP where Sam 
           Baker (Molly) begins to bond with Farmer Ted (Michael). We 
           CUT through take after take, during which John goofs around, 
           cutting up with his teenage stars...

                                 MICHELLE (V.O.)
                        The scenes with Michael and Molly-- he 
                        did take after take after take. Days went 
                        by where they horsed around so much, 
                        there wasn’t a usable frame. I’d 
                        scheduled the shoot meticulously-- I’d 
                        planned for every exigency; I’d imagined 
                        every catastrophe; I’d war-gamed every 
                        scenario. But as the shoot wore on, it 
                        became clear that I’d failed to account 
                        for a major variable... the variable 
                        whose name was...

                                 MICHELLE
                        JOHN HUGHES! YOU WILL LISTEN TO ME FOR 
                        ONCE, SO HELP ME GOD!

           Hughes is currently having a smoke break while Michelle is 
           having a psychotic break.

                                 HUGHES
                        I’m sorry-- did you say something?

                                 MICHELLE
                        You canNOT keep doing 50 takes of Michael 
                        and Molly’s scenes! It is costing us 
                        money! You’re having playtime with other 
                        people’s money!

                                 HUGHES
                        Isn’t it great?

           As John heads for the door--

                                 MICHELLE
                        We are days behind schedule, we’re over-
                        budget, I’m losing my hair-- we’ll never 
                        work again if this doesn’t get under 
                        control--

                                 HUGHES
                        Well before you lose what’s left of your 
                        voice-- or your dignity-- or your... 
                        hair?-- You should check out Daily 
                        Variety.

                                 MICHELLE
                        What’s in Variety?

                                 HUGHES
                                (smiles)
                        I’ll send a PA to fetch you a copy.

           And he’s gone. Left alone, Michelle takes her hair in her 
           hand... and pulls out a CLUMP. To the clump--

                                 MICHELLE
                        God damn you, John Hughes.

                                                               CUT TO:

                                                         REVEAL WE’RE AT:

           EXT. A LAKE MICHIGAN BEACH -- NIGHT

           John (who’s just thrown the Variety onto a beach blanket) 
           high-fives with Michael (who had a supporting role in 
           Vacation).

           John and Michael and Molly are, at present, huddled around a 
           BONFIRE that CRACKLES and ROARS and sends SPARKS into the 
           air. Around them, the night is cold and crisp and promising.

                                 HUGHES
                        Eight-and-a-half! Eight-and-a-damn-half!

           Hughes lets out a WHOOP. Michael FOLLOWS SUIT. Molly watches 
           them, grinning, like Wendy watching the Lost Boys.

                                 HUGHES
                        And I’ll tell you something else: 
                        “Sixteen Candles” ‘ll make even more.

                                 MOLLY
                        What makes you say that?

                                 HUGHES
                        How could it not? For one thing, it stars 
                        Molly Ringwald.

           Molly grins at that.

                                 HUGHES
                        And I’ll tell you... the way Hollywood 
                        works... after this, after “Sixteen 
                        Candles”... no one will be able to say no 
                        to us again.
                                (looks toward the horizon)
                        No, from here on out-- it’s smiles and 
                        open doors-- as far as the eye can see.

                                 MOLLY
                                (laughs)
                        Yeah? Where do they lead?

           As John approaches the surf...
                                 HUGHES
                        “Detention.” That’s what we’re gonna do 
                        next. It’s called “Detention,” it’s about 
                        these kids who, they have Saturday 
                        detention at Shermer High. And Michael, 
                        you’ll play Brian-- he’s this sort of-- 
                        this lonely kid. Smart. A little nerdy, 
                        but-- nothing like the Geek. And Molly, 
                        you’ll play Claire, she’s-- “well off” as 
                        they say, although-- she’s really about 
                        the worst off of ‘em all...
                                (then)
                        And what they start to see, all these 
                        kids, is that the adults-- that they like 
                        to tell us we’re different species, you 
                        know? Like, a Brain and a Princess, how 
                        could they ever connect? But it’s not 
                        true. It’s just something they put in our 
                        heads. It’s not real.

           A wave CRASHES at John’s feet.

                                 MOLLY
                        Hey. Can I ask you something? What’s this 
                        thing you have with, like, Shermer, 
                        Illinois?

           For a moment, John says nothing. Then...

                                 HUGHES
                        Not a “thing.” Just a place I’ve had in 
                        my head since I was in high school. And I 
                        could tell you all about it, if you want, 
                        I could draw you a map. 

           Molly knits her brow, registering that. Then--

                                 MICHAEL
                        Wait, so is this like... are you offering 
                        me this part?

                                 HUGHES
                        What do you mean?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Like... I don’t have to audition?

                                 HUGHES
                        Audition?

           John prickles. Turning to Michael--

                                 HUGHES
                        Are you serious? Are you really asking me 
                        that-- do you have to audition?
           Michael tenses, unclear as to how exactly he’s transgressed. 

                                 HUGHES
                        What do you think I’m--? You’re like, one 
                        of the better friends I’ve ever had in my 
                        life. I mean... you may be about the best 
                        friend I’ve ever had. You think I’m gonna 
                        make my best friend audition for a movie? 
                        C’mon.

           For a moment, the only sounds are the LAKE and the FIRE... 
           the WHOOSH and the ROAR...

           Michael is pale, frozen, uncomfortable in the role in which 
           he now realizes he’s been cast... But he considers that he’s 
           only 15, that he doesn’t know much about the world, and that 
           this may, in fact, be more normal than he’d supposed.

                                 HUGHES
                        I guess, Molly and me, we’d talked about 
                        this before, how we’re gonna do movies 
                        forever. Haven’t we?

           John looks at Molly, who says nothing. To Michael--

                                 HUGHES
                        So yeah, I guess I’d just assumed... you 
                        were part of the club too. Unless, of 
                        course, you don’t want to be.

                                 MICHAEL
                        ...What? No, I mean... I mean, yes. I 
                        mean-- of course I want to be.

                                 HUGHES
                                (smiles)
                        Good. Should we drink to it?

           John reaches for a COOLER and grabs a trio of Cokes. The 
           happy mood seems to return a bit-- the kids like this part. 
           John passes around the pops-- and three SWISS ARMY KNIVES.

                                 MOLLY
                        What are we drinking to?

                                 MICHAEL
                        What do you think? To eight-and-a-half 
                        mil.

                                 HUGHES
                                (definitely)
                        To friendship.

           So it’s to friendship that they lift their cans-- and to 
           which they proceed to...
                                 HUGHES
                        3-- 2-- 1--

           ...shotgun their Cokes. To be clear: they’re bad at this, 
           and they spill all over themselves... which makes them 
           laugh, which makes them spill even more. Finally, they’re 
           done/give up, and John gets to his feet.

                                 HUGHES
                        Alright. What’re we doing now?

                                 MOLLY
                                (smiles)
                        Don’t you ever get tired?

                                 HUGHES
                        My mind is going a million miles an hour.
                                (to Molly)
                        There’s a place I think you’d like. A music 
                        club, I used to help ‘em find their bands.

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m 15, remember?

                                 HUGHES
                        Right. Yeah.
                                (thinks)
                        Wanna see the original Shermer High?

           EXT. GLENBROOK NORTH HIGH SCHOOL -- NIGHT [ESTABLISHING]

           THE FOOTBALL STADIUM

           The stands are empty tonight... but we hear the ROARS OF THE 
           CROWD... the crowd of 1966, ever-present in John’s mind...

           The crowd CHEERS and CHEERS for a game long complete, for 
           players decades from the field. As their roar fades...

           ...we find our trio amidst the bleachers.

                                 HUGHES
                        As far as we were concerned, this was the 
                        center of the universe.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You like football?

                                 HUGHES
                                (shrugs)
                        I liked hanging out with my friends. Met 
                        the love of my life at a game, as a 
                        matter of fact.
                                 MICHAEL
                        You met your wife in high school?

           On John, who met the love of his life at a game, and who met 
           his wife in high school, but who, of course, knows that 
           these were two different events...

                                 HUGHES
                        I did indeed.

                                 MOLLY
                        That must’ve been cool. Being in high 
                        school in the 60s.

                                 HUGHES
                                (laughs)
                        Well out here, it wasn’t the 60s, not 
                        exactly.

           Molly frowns, as if disappointed by that.

                                 MOLLY
                        Well you had good music, didn’t you?

                                 HUGHES
                        Well, I did. Most of these jokers...

           Hearing this, Molly suspects she’s just had a revelation:

                                 MOLLY
                        Wait, so is that who you were in high 
                        school? The kid who knew all the 
                        trendiest stuff?

                                 HUGHES
                        ...something like that.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh my god! You were popular!

                                 HUGHES
                        Well I wouldn’t--

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh my god! I mean, it makes sense. I 
                        mean, you’re funny, you were probably fun 
                        at parties...

           Noting the different eyes through which Molly is now viewing 
           him, John shrugs, (dishonestly) conceding the point.

                                 MOLLY
                        Ha! I can’t believe this! How did we not 
                        know this? Hey-- how did you party back 
                        then? Back in the olden days?
                                 HUGHES
                        Ya know. Square dances and honey mead.

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m serious. You gotta tell us all about 
                        hippy John.

                                 HUGHES
                        Oh, who can remember?

                                 MOLLY
                        Bull. Shit.

           Hughes laughs. But as he looks out over the field, the 
           school, the lot... recollections begin to come rushing 
           back... and his smile begins to fade...

           And, when he finally speaks, it’s with a different voice, a 
           distant voice, a voice that sounds like the echo of things 
           past...

                                 HUGHES
                        Well... There is one occasion I seem to 
                        recall... Happened just a few miles from 
                        here, as a matter of fact. Waverly Road.

                                 MOLLY
                        Waverly Road? Like where we’re shooting? 
                        The Jake Ryan location?

                                 HUGHES
                        The very same.

           FLASHCUT: the house at which John tried attend a party in 
           his youth...

           MATCH FLASHCUT: the same house in 1983, now overrun with 
           a film crew, John its master...

           When we RETURN TO THE SCENE, we’re TIGHT on John’s face, on 
           his pained, probing eyes, as they seem to gaze off toward 
           some infinity point...

                                 HUGHES
                        You see, after a football game, we’d party 
                        at somebody’s house. A Jake Ryan type. 
                        Richie. Absent parents. You know the 
                        drill. And-- everyone would show up. And 
                        spin-the-bottle was all the rage. Our one 
                        nod to the culture of ‘free love.’ We 
                        thought we were pretty ‘groovy,’ I guess.
                                (smiles)
                        Anyway, this one night... there was this 
                        girl there, and-- well let’s just say, I 
                        wanted the bottle to point her way. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HUGHES (CONT'D)
                        But then-- then this kid showed up, this 
                        total geek, no friends, zero status-- I 
                        mean, this guy, he showed up at a house 
                        party with a bottle of French wine!
                                (laughs too much at that)
                        And he wasn’t well-off-- from the wrongest 
                        side of the tracks-- so I mean, he must’ve 
                        dropped some money on that-- it had to 
                        hurt. But anyway, this girl I had my eye 
                        on, she left... I dunno how this happened, 
                        but somehow, she left the party with this 
                        geek! And I guess the gods must’ve smiled 
                        on him that night, because-- according to 
                        what I heard-- he somehow managed to kiss 
                        her. Only thing was-- it was a kiss that 
                        couldn’t’ve lasted more than five or ten 
                        seconds, cuz then-- then he went out like 
                        a light.

           The kids stare at John, unsure what to make of this...

                                 HUGHES
                        I mean, they were kissing, and all of a 
                        sudden, he passes out, like the gods 
                        struck him down cuz she was a Richie and 
                        he was a Zoid and ne’er the twain shall 
                        meet. But these two had tried to bridge 
                        the gap, y’know, and, well-- you know 
                        what they say about the gods... they 
                        deplore hubris.
                                (then)
                        ‘Course, it turned out, this guy, he had 
                        a disorder-- something called an 
                        ‘overactive sympathetic nervous system.’ 
                        Which basically means, he had a tendency 
                        to pass out during-- well-- during the 
                        most important events in his life... 
                        Anyway, after that, this girl-- I guess 
                        she was kind’ve spooked-- I mean like, 
                        what was she doing with this guy anyway? 
                        Then, she got in her car and drove away-- 
                        she ditched the geek-- and she showed 
                        back up at the party later that night.

           Bit by bit, Hughes finds his way back to reality, making an 
           effort to keep the floodgates closed, the levees secure.

                                 HUGHES
                        But anyway. I guess that’s not the kind 
                        of story you’re looking for probably. I’m 
                        sorry.

           Molly, of course, can’t decipher the story’s significance-- 
           but it’s hard to miss the tsunamis of pain behind John’s 
           eyes... 
           and so, for the first time, she initiates physical contact: 
           she places her thin, young, porcelain arm around John’s 
           aching back.

           John feels the touch before he sees it. Then, he looks at 
           Molly the way you’d expect a man lost at sea to look at the 
           first sign of land.

           A few bleachers behind them, Michael observes every step of 
           this dance... and he doesn’t like it one bit. In an angrier 
           tone than we’ve heard from him...

                                 MICHAEL
                        I thought I reminded you of you.

                                 HUGHES
                        Hm?

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s what you keep saying. That I 
                        remind you of you at my age.

                                 HUGHES
                        You do.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well how could I remind you of you if you 
                        were a popular kid in high school?

                                 MOLLY
                        You dork, you just admitted to being 
                        unpopular.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well he cast me as the Geek. I mean, it 
                        doesn’t make sense.

                                 MOLLY
                                (to John)
                        I think it’s past somebody’s bed time.

                                 HUGHES
                        Michael? Are you okay, man?

           Michael silently fumes. Then--

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah. Fine. Whatever.

           And then, letting off steam, Michael clangs down the 
           bleachers... and proceeds to climb over a railing... and 
           onto the FIELD--
           And that, for some imponderable reason, after all the time 
           they’ve spent in here, is what trips a motion sensor that 
           SETS OFF THE MOTHER OF ALL ALARMS:

           SPEAKERS BEGIN TO SHRIEK! Lights blink ON and OFF and ON, as 
           if screaming in Morse code, “You’re 100% fucked!”

           So our three cabelleros exchange glances... looking panicked 
           at first... then breaking into grins... and then GOING HELL-
           BENT FOR LEATHER--

           The three haul ass toward the perimeter fence-- and Michael 
           scales the fence easily-- and Molly scales it easily--

           But John, with a few extra pounds and a few extra years, is 
           having a pretty rough go of it.

           From the “safe” side of the fence, Molly CHEERS ON her 
           director-- as Michael bounces around, antsy-- as--

           POLICE SIRENS begin to be heard in the distance--

           Then CLOSER--

           John struggles to get a leg atop of the fence-- he gets a 
           foot to graze the top-- he’s almost there-- but he slips--

           And now, the cops are TWO BLOCKS away, and--

           Now, they’re ONE BLOCK away, and--

           Success! John makes it over the top and leaps to terra firma! 
           And not a moment too soon, either, as at just that moment--

           A COP CAR pulls into the fucking lot--

           The trio panics-- then heads the opposite direction--

           Michael hustles, putting a good forty or fifty yards between 
           him and the girl and the out-of-shape 30something...

           As for John and Molly, they’re having a fine time now, 
           adrenaline fulfilling its highest, most pleasurable calling. 

           Then suddenly-- John looks woozy-- and stops-- and says--

                                 HUGHES
                        Wait, sorry I just...
                                (realizes something)
                        On shit. Not now.

           And those are the last words he says before he gets to his 
           knees... before HE HITS THE GROUND, OUT COLD.
           Molly, who’s since left him behind, now scrambles back to 
           his side. But it’s only another moment until he recovers...

                                 HUGHES
                        Please don’t go.

           As John speaks, his eyes wobble with fear, with 
           vulnerability.

                                 MOLLY
                        I won’t.

           For reasons we may not yet understand, those two words reach 
           a place John’s been trying to get to his whole life. His 
           eyes shine with unexpected joy, with gratitude. Overcome 
           with emotion, he reaches up to the girl hovering over him...

           ...and draws her closer...

           And behind Molly and John, an OFFICER approaches, flashlight 
           in hand, casting the pair in an icy-white silhouette...

           But John doesn’t see the cop or the light, the danger or the 
           future. He sees only Molly, the girl who didn’t abandon him. 
           The Tiffany who stayed. As he draws her closer still--

                                                               CUT TO:

           THE FRONT DOOR OF A HOTEL SUITE [2001]

           KNOCKING comes from the other side. Furious. Incessant. Then--

           Elliot Gibbs appears at the door and opens it, revealing...

           John Hughes, standing out in the HALLWAY, looking rather 
           worse for the wear, the offending manuscript tucked under 
           his arm.

                                 HUGHES
                        For the past 20 years, it’s been an a 
                        singular obsession of mine to shield my 
                        wife and children from the underside of 
                        this business. I commuted from Chicago to 
                        L.A.-- I did that for eight years-- I 
                        stayed out of the... the “Spago circuit”-- 
                        out of the gossip pages. And I gave up my 
                        career-- right at the height, if you’ll 
                        recall-- to spare my family the poison 
                        and the corruption of this industry. Now 
                        if I’d do all that to protect them-- 
                        maybe it’s worth it to ask yourself-- 
                        what wouldn’t I do?

           A beat.
                                 GIBBS
                        You look like a man who could use a drink.

           Off John--

                                                               CUT TO:

           LAKE MICHIGAN

           As seen from the BALCONY of the magnificent Author Suite. 
           John stands on the terrace, watching the water thrash about 
           below, while INSIDE, Gibbs mixes old fashioneds.

                                 HUGHES
                        So what is this, HarperCollins’ money?

                                 GIBBS
                                (from inside)
                        I’ve always depended on the kindness of 
                        multinationals.

                                 HUGHES
                        Well if it’s a question of cash, I can 
                        double whatever they’re paying you.

                                 GIBBS
                                (laughs)
                        You really think I’m parasite, don’t you?

                                 HUGHES
                        Aren’t you?

                                 GIBBS
                                (appears at the door)
                        On the contrary-- I’m a fan.

           INT. AUTHOR SUITE -- FOUR SEASONS CHICAGO -- DAY [2001]

           Hughes takes a seat on a sofa as Gibbs distributes drinks.

                                 GIBBS
                        My son Auggie-- when “The Breakfast Club” 
                        came out, he was 15. His mother said, “He 
                        may have been made by God, but the Devil 
                        slipped Him the recipe.” We’d taken him 
                        to psychiatrists, got the sheriff to 
                        scare his pants off, but... Nothing made 
                        any difference. Not for long.
                                (cleaning up)
                        Well he wrote a preface for the book, 
                        where he says he felt seen for the first 
                        time while he sat in the chilled dark, 
                        watching a Hughes film.

                                 GIBBS (CONT'D)
                        You seem to have helped him and his 
                        eventual group of friends give a shape to 
                        their-- well, their “amorphous teen 
                        concerns.”
                                (throwing away orange rinds)
                        Are you a brain, an athlete, or a basket 
                        case; a princess, or a criminal? All of 
                        ‘em could’ve told you which they were. 
                        Which, of course, seemed rather reductive 
                        to me, but then-- “what it seemed to me” 
                        wasn’t really the point, was it?
                                (then, sitting opposite John)
                        In any case: you gave my son what his 
                        mother and I could not... And that-- 
                        well, I suppose it’s how I got interested 
                        in your work... And it’s something for 
                        which you’ll forever have my gratitude.

           John lights a cigarette.

                                 HUGHES
                        You have a unique way of showing it.

           Gibbs smiles gently at that.

                                 GIBBS
                        I went where the facts led me, that’s 
                        all. And of course, you haven’t denied 
                        anything I wrote.

                                 HUGHES
                        Fine. I deny it.

                                 GIBBS
                        On the record?

                                 HUGHES
                                (scoffs)
                        And what record would that be?

                                 GIBBS
                                (re: the manuscript)
                        The written record, John. The only 
                        durable record of history.

           John stares at Gibbs, his expression hard.

                                 HUGHES
                        Let’s cut the shit. No one allegedly at 
                        these events has ever talked to you. This 
                        is all just muck you dredged out of the 
                        gossip swamp.

                                 GIBBS
                        Now I am a lot of things, but I don’t 
                        peddle in idle gossip.
                                 HUGHES
                        So who’s your source? It isn’t Molly, it 
                        isn’t Michael.

                                 GIBBS
                        Oh, so you’ve spoken with them then?

           John goes silent.

                                 GIBBS
                        No. I suppose that would be unlikely. 
                        Sixteen years without a word to either one 
                        of ‘em. But then again, surely they 
                        haven’t changed. They wouldn’t dare-- 
                        would they?-- your “best friends.” Not 
                        again. Not without your permission.

           Deciding that’s as much as he can stand, John rises.

                                 HUGHES
                        Alright, I was never involved with a 
                        teenager, Mr. Gibbs. Unfortunate though 
                        the fact may be for the sales of your-- 
                        “record of history.” She was an actor in 
                        a couple of movies I did, and that’s it.

           Gibbs just sits there, cool as a cucumber...

                                 GIBBS
                        And that’s it.

                                 HUGHES
                        And the next step is, you’re gonna hear 
                        from my lawyer-- and I’m not gonna sue; 
                        I’m gonna make a complaint of criminal 
                        harassment. You have a good day.

           And with that, John heads for the door--

                                 GIBBS
                        She was an actor in a couple of movies, 
                        and that’s it-- okay-- let’s try that on-- 
                        so why the blowup on the set of “The 
                        Breakfast Club”?

                                 HUGHES
                                (stops)
                        What are you talking about?

                                 GIBBS
                        “What am”-- I beg your pardon. I’d 
                        assumed you’d bothered to read my book 
                        before charging in here and threatening 
                        me with the law.
                                 HUGHES
                        I’ve read enough.

                                 GIBBS
                        Well you haven’t read Chapter Five. And 
                        that’s the key to the whole thing. 

           But by now, John has resumed his retreat...

                                 GIBBS
                        Starts on one-twenty-five. The pages 
                        practically turn themselves, John.

           But now, John is half-way out the door...

                                 GIBBS
                        Well I do hope you’ll see fit to give it 
                        the benefit of your study...

           SLAM.

                                 GIBBS
                        Before we inevitably speak again.

                                 NANCY (PRE-LAP)
                        Don’t you think you’re being a little 
                        doom-and-gloom?

           INT. FARMHOUSE -- DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY [2001]

           Nancy heads toward the kitchen, a cordless phone to her ear.

                                 NANCY (INTO THE PHONE)
                        I mean, if the movie’s not the success 
                        you wanted, you can always write another.

           I./E. BUILDING LOBBY / HANCOCK PARK -- DAY

           Jamie is just leaving Premiere’s L.A. offices... and it’s 
           clear from his demeanor that whatever pleas he’s made have 
           fallen on deaf ears...

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        I can’t just “write another,” Mom. I’m 
                        not Dad, okay, I can’t write 30 movies in 
                        90 days, sell twenty and make a dozen.

           INTERCUT.

           Nancy appears confused by that, having only ever known John.

                                 NANCY (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Well I’m sure if you applied yourself--
                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        It’s not that easy for me, okay? It’s not 
                        that easy for anyone except Dad, and, I 
                        dunno, Noel Coward.
                                (then)
                        This script-- it didn’t take me a long 
                        weekend; alright?; it took me years; it 
                        took me all of my early 20s. And all of 
                        that is a waste if this movie doesn’t 
                        hit. Which is why... which is why I need 
                        this article... which is why I need you 
                        to talk to Dad.

           Nancy crumples a bit, desperate to help... but she says...

                                 NANCY (INTO THE PHONE)
                        ...Jamie...

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        No, c’mon, don’t do that, don’t say 
                        “Jamie” like that, not in that voice.

                                 NANCY (INTO THE PHONE)
                        If I thought it would help at all...

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        I know.

                                 NANCY (INTO THE PHONE)
                        It’s just--

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Hey. I get it. I know what’s it like to-- 
                        to try and talk to him. Especially for 
                        you.

           As Jamie turns into the HOLLYWOOD FOREVER CEMETERY...

                                 NANCY (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Well. Your father’s complicated.

           Jamie slumps on the first bench he sees... stares up at the 
           cloudless SKY... and takes a deep breath of the grassy air.

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Y’know, I don’t know if I ever told you 
                        this, but... you know one of my earliest 
                        memories? I guess I was four or five-- it 
                        seems like this can’t be right, but-- I 
                        mean, you know how Dad was-- all quiet 
                        and kinda dark-- and I remember-- and 
                        like, I know how this sounds-- it sounds 
                        like it can’t be right, but-- I swear to 
                        God, I was four years old the first time 
                        I heard him laugh...
                                                         BEGIN FLASHBACK:

           INT. HUGHES’ NORTH FIELD HOUSE -- NIGHT [1984]

           The CAST of what is, at this moment, known as Detention, 
           sits in an UPSTAIRS LIVING AREA with recliners, a record 
           collection, a few guitars-- John’s lair.

           When we cut into the scene, the assembled parties are 
           LAUGHING at something-- a happy group, an expanded Hughes 
           work family that’s already finding its chemistry...

                                 JAMIE (O.S.)
                        There was some kind of a meeting-- a 
                        rehearsal or something-- in the house-- I 
                        guess it must’ve been-- this was the 
                        house back in North Field. And I heard 
                        Dad with the cast-- cracking up-- and I 
                        mean-- he sounded like somebody else. 
                        Someone I didn’t know. And I guess I 
                        must’ve decided to check it out...

           ON TODDLER JAMIE, at the edge of the room, unseen--

                                                           END FLASHBACK.

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        And sometimes I think-- and maybe I’m 
                        full of shit, but you gotta admit-- it 
                        makes a certain kind of sense... 
                        Sometimes I think, it was-- sometimes I 
                        think it was that night-- that that was 
                        when I decided to come to Hollywood.

           Nancy is, for some reason, close to tears. Oblivious--

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        What were they working on that night? Do 
                        you remember?

                                 NANCY (INTO THE PHONE)
                                (lying)
                        I’m not sure I know which night you’re 
                        referring to.

                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Really? You don’t remember that?

                                 NANCY (INTO THE PHONE)
                                (evasive)
                        ...There’s a call on the other line. I 
                        should take it, it might be your father.
                                 JAMIE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        ...Okay.

                                 NANCY (INTO THE PHONE)
                        I love you, Bug.

           With that, she hangs up. Jamie frowns, concerned for his mom.

           Back at the Redwing Farmhouse, Nancy accepts her waiting 
           call... gathers herself for a moment... then says...

                                 NANCY (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Hello?

           FARMHOUSE -- TOM’S OFFICE -- SAME

           Tom sits at his desk, at work on a laptop, when he hears...

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        Tom! It’s John for you!

           He grabs the phone.

                                 TOM (INTO THE PHONE)
                        John?

                                 HUGHES (ON THE PHONE)
                        Hey. I need to reach out to Michael and 
                        Molly. I’ll need you to get their 
                        contacts.

                                 TOM (ON THE PHONE)
                                (not sure he heard that right)
                        I’m... sorry? “Michael and Molly...”?

                                 HUGHES (ON THE PHONE)
                        Molly Ringwald, yeah. And Anthony Michael 
                        Hall.

           On Tom, who looks as if he’s experiencing some kind of 
           epochal shift...

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD FOREVER CEMETERY -- DAY

           Jamie sits on a gravestone, a flask now in his hand. He 
           stares at the HOLLYWOOD SIGN, romanticizing it. From his 
           20something eyes to...

           INT. HUGHES’ NORTH FIELD HOUSE -- NIGHT [1984]

           ...FOUR-YEAR-OLD JAMIE’s eyes, as they watch-- and indeed, 
           as they romanticize-- another, more personal image of 
           Hollywood:
           This is the scene from the flashback: John sits in a circle 
           alongside Michael, Molly, EMILIO ESTEVEZ, ALLY SHEEDY, and 
           JUDD NELSON. The Brat Pack.

           The group is having a grand old time, laughing, cracking 
           jokes, ribbing each other, one-upping each other. At 
           present, Emilio is holding a script entitled Detention, to 
           which he makes reference as he asks John...

                                 EMILIO
                        So what you’re saying... You want us to 
                        rewrite your script?

                                 HUGHES
                        Well-- don’t alert the Writers Guild of 
                        America.

           The group chuckles. (They’re punchy.)

                                 HUGHES
                        No, the fact that we’re working overtime, 
                        that was Molly’s bright idea. I’ll let the 
                        accused speak in her own defense.

           And now, all eyes now shift toward...

           Molly, who is noticeably different now-- more confident, more 
           assured of her own power-- than she was when last we saw her.

                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t know, I just thought the script 
                        had changed from the draft I read.
                                (flipping through)
                        I mean, all this crap with like the “hot 
                        swimming teacher” and the “girls’ 
                        exercise class”--

                                 HUGHES
                        For the record, that “crap” came straight 
                        from the studio’s bowels. They didn’t like 
                        the idea of kids just dishing about their 
                        problems for two hours. They wanted-- 
                        “more to look at”-- which is teen-movie 
                        code for “naked girls.”

                                 JUDD NELSON
                        So you added one.

                                 HUGHES
                        Certainly not. I’m a professional.
                                (then)
                        I added four.

           The Brat Packers crack up at that.
           It’s here that we enter FOUR-YEAR-OLD JAMIE’S P.O.V.: we’re 
           approaching the group, though nobody sees “us,” not yet...

                                 MOLLY
                        So yeah, when I found out there were all 
                        these old drafts of the script...

                                 HUGHES
                        She commanded that they should appear.

                                 MOLLY
                        I asked nicely if I could see them.

           John smiles, as if agreeing to disagree.

                                 HUGHES
                        Well in any case-- what choice did I 
                        really have? After all, who am I to say 
                        “no” to a major movie star?

           Molly, from her perch on the back of the sofa, smiling and 
           rolling her eyes, puts her hand on John’s shoulder-- and he 
           takes her hand in his. This is possibly a fatherly gesture, 
           conceivably platonic-- though that’s perhaps not the 
           description that best fits the totality of the evidence.

           Suddenly, “we”-- that is, Four-Year-Old Jamie-- express 
           special interest in this interaction-- watching our father 
           be so unlike our father. As we MOVE IN for a closer look...

                                 MOLLY
                        So what I want, you’ve all got eight 
                        drafts of “Detention,” going back to when?

                                 HUGHES
                        To 1982.

                                 MOLLY
                        And we’ve got enough scissors so everyone 
                        can cut up the various drafts so we can--

           And just then, “we” run into a coffee pot-- which begins to 
           spill. Where we were invisible before, Dad sure as hell sees 
           us now. Leaping up--

                                 HUGHES
                        God damn it. Fuck! NANCY!
                                (to “us”)
                        What the hell is the matter with you?

           He yanks us by the arm and takes us to the TOP OF THE STAIRS.

           END P.O.V.

           Jamie begins to cry. Appearing below, ON THE GROUND FLOOR--
                                 NANCY
                        John? Did you need something?

                                 HUGHES
                        Well Jamie’s traipsing around up here and 
                        he spilled a pot of coffee and now it 
                        looks like Three Mile Island.

                                 NANCY
                        Is he okay?

                                 HUGHES
                        Wh--?

           John hadn’t considered that. He looks at Jamie, who says...

                                 FOUR-YEAR-OLD JAMIE
                        I’m sorry...

           ...at which point John looks back at his wife, as if waiting 
           for her to explain herself.

                                 NANCY
                        I’ll send Superfund right up, just let me 
                        dry my hands.

           Now, John leaves his son to attempt the stairs alone, as he 
           (Hughes) TURNS THE CORNER and rejoins his cast. Suddenly 
           “Fun John” again--

                                 HUGHES
                        So where were we? Right: find what you 
                        like in any draft, cut it out...

                                 MOLLY
                        And once we work up a rhythm, we can start 
                        to put it together, we can add whatever we 
                        need, find the movie we want to make.

           Off the cast, which can hardly believe the level of trust 
           with which it’s been endowed--

                                 HUGHES
                        With me, you’re never just cast or crew. 
                        You’re part of a club.

           Off Judd, who makes note of that distinction--

           KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy has her (tearful) son up on the counter. She’s 
           cleaning him off, inspecting him for damage. 

                                 NANCY
                        There you go, Bug. You’re alright. Y’see?
                                 FOUR-YEAR-OLD JAMIE
                        I’m sorry.

           Nancy smiles at her kiddo.

                                 NANCY
                        Hey. Just give me a minute. After I’ve 
                        cleaned up, I’ve got the stuff to make 
                        hot fudge sundaes. Won’t that be good?

           Off Jamie, smiling--

           THE UPSTAIRS LIVING AREA -- MOMENTS LATER

           Nancy wipes down the COFFEE TABLE... blots a stain out of 
           the CARPET... though she might as well be invisible to...

           ...the Detention Crew, which is now hard at work-- they’re 
           TALKING amongst themselves, comparing various drafts of the 
           script, making notes. Amidst the DIN of creative activity--

           Molly puts her hand on John’s shoulder, as before, but--

           In the presence of his wife, John crosses the room, putting 
           a little distance between himself and his “movie star.”

           But Molly dislikes the idea of John walking away from her. 
           She looks up at Nancy (who’s seen nothing) and scowls, 
           feeling a twinge of competition... which continues to 
           balloon until it manifests in this request:

                                 MOLLY
                        Hey Nancy? When you’re done, I think 
                        everyone would love a little more food.

           Nancy looks up. When she does, Molly looks back at her 
           script.

                                 MOLLY
                        And some sodas?

                                 NANCY
                        ...Oh... Sure. Okay.

           Judd, seeing this interaction, tries to ease the tension...

                                 JUDD NELSON
                        Thanks, Mrs. H.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh, and the ashtray’s full.

           Again without looking up, Molly slides the ashtray about two 
           inches toward Nancy, spilling a little ash in the process.
           A beat. Nancy stops what she’s doing. She looks at Molly-- 
           then glances at John, who shifts uncomfortably, laboring 
           diligently to avoid eye contact. Then, not knowing what else 
           to do, Nancy picks up the ashtray. Flashing a big, fake grin--

                                 MOLLY
                        Thanks so much!

           As Nancy heads out of the room, she hears from behind--

                                 MOLLY
                        Hey Johnny, I love what you did here in 
                        Draft Three.

           Molly giggles. It’s a giggle we haven’t heard before. It’s a 
           voice we haven’t heard before. Nancy frowns... “Johnny?”

           And Nancy isn’t the only one upset by this development: 
           Michael seems soured too; Judd, disturbed. John, aware of 
           the growing tension, applies teen first aid--

                                 HUGHES
                        You wanna put on some music?

           EXT. HUGHES’ NORTH FIELD HOUSE — NIGHT

           From inside, the vitalizing sounds of muffled ROCK...

           INT. HUGHES’ NORTH FIELD HOUSE -- JOHN’S CLOSET -- SAME

           (The MUSIC continues as--)

           Nancy is putting away laundry, when her eyes fall on the top 
           shelf, on an object she’s seen a hundred times but never 
           thought much about:

           John’s Crown Dogs crown.

           She takes it down... She clearly knows its provenance... And 
           thinking of what she saw tonight, she puts two and two 
           together.

           UPSTAIRS LIVING AREA -- LATER

           The Detention Crew cuts and pastes, everyone talking over each 
           other, everyone auditioning choice lines. We CUT BETWEEN them:

                                 JUDD NELSON
                                (from Draft Four, as Bender)
                        Over the panties, no bra, blouse 
                        unbuttoned, Calvins in a ball on the front 
                        seat, past eleven on a school night?
                                 EMILIO
                                (from Draft One, as Andy)
                        Everyone's home lives are unsatisfying. 
                        If it wasn’t, people would live with 
                        their parents forever.

                                 ALLY SHEEDY
                                (from Draft Two, as Allison)
                        You know what I did to get in here? 
                        Nothing. I just didn’t have anything 
                        better to do.

                                 JUDD NELSON
                                (from Draft Six, as Bender)
                        Sweets? You couldn’t ignore me if you 
                        tried.

           JOHN’S OFFICE -- SAME

           (Muffled ROCK MUSIC continues, as--)

           Nancy looks around. She’s not supposed to be in here. But 
           she takes a breath, opens John’s scrapbook, and begins to 
           flip through its cellophane-shielded pages... 

           Amongst its contents: 5x4 photos of her husband with Molly... 
           in L.A... in Chicago... Nancy analyzes the body language... 
           and the color begins to drain, quickly and steadily, from her 
           face.

           JAMIE’S BEDROOM -- LATER

           (Music continues--)

           Jamie is lying awake in bed when his mother appears at his 
           door...

                                 NANCY
                        Hey, kiddo.

                                 FOUR-YEAR-OLD JAMIE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 NANCY
                        No, you don’t have be sorry anymore. 
                        That’s not why I’m here.

           He looks at her with his saucer-like eyes.

                                 NANCY
                        I guess I was just wondering... if it 
                        would be okay with you... if I slept in 
                        your bed tonight.
           He cocks his head, curious.

                                 FOUR-YEAR-OLD JAMIE
                        ...Why?

                                 NANCY
                        I dunno. I guess I was just a little 
                        scared. I thought maybe you’d keep me 
                        safe. You think you can do that for Mom?

           Jamie stares at his whey-faced mother... and then, he 
           scooches over. Sitting beside him...

                                 NANCY
                        Hey, Bug. You know how much I love you?

           He nods-- Yup. And that at least gives Nancy reason to smile. 

           But as soon as he looks away, Nancy’s gaze drifts 
           involuntarily toward the door... and, gradually, her features 
           rearrange themselves into a mask of confusion and fear.

           EXT. HUGHES’ NORTH FIELD HOUSE -- DAWN

           ...dyed blue by the early morning light...

           INT. HUGHES’ NORTH FIELD HOUSE -- LIVING AREA -- DAWN

           The Detention Crew sits around the lumpy, cut-and-paste 
           monstrosity that, at 210 pages, now constitutes the “script.”

           They’re passing it around, reading through it. They’re 
           coming to the end. The damn thing looks like magnet poetry-- 
           words, phrases smushed together to form sentences like...

                                 MICHAEL
                                (reading, as Brian)
                        “We think you're crazy to make us write 
                        an essay telling you who we think we are. 
                        What do you care? You see us as you want 
                        to see us, in the simplest terms, the 
                        most convenient definitions. You see us 
                        as a brain, and an athlete, and a 
                        basketcase. A princess and a criminal. 
                        Correct? That’s the way we saw each other 
                        at seven o’clock this morning. We were 
                        brainwashed. But what we found out is 
                        that each one of us is a brain...”

                                 EMILIO
                        “And an athlete.”

                                 ALLY SHEEDY
                        “And a basketcase.”
                                 MOLLY
                        “A princess.”

                                 JUDD NELSON
                        “And a criminal.”

                                 MICHAEL
                        “Does that answer your question? 
                        Sincerely yours, The Detention Crew.”

           For a moment, everyone sits in silence, feeling the weight 
           of the story they’ve just wrought.

           Then, recalling something John said last night-- and 
           clocking the cereal boxes littering their workspace-- Judd 
           grabs his script, cuts up a few words, and pastes them atop 
           the last words of the Franken-script. Reading the change--

                                 MICHAEL
                        “Does that answer your question? 
                        Sincerely yours, The Breakfast Club.”

           A beat. Then, the silence is broken by happy LAUGHTER, 
           exhausted CHEERS, SIGHS of relief, and WHOOPS of 
           exhilaration. The newly-minted Breakfast Club grins 
           earnestly, feeling like damn champs, settling into a furious 
           group hug. John addresses them from amid the huddle...

                                 HUGHES
                        So maybe it’s just me, but I feel like-- 
                        like we did something tonight that, if we 
                        don’t fuck it up, has the potential to 
                        really last. And if we do fuck it up-- 
                        and I mean this-- I really do-- there is 
                        no one else on earth who I’d rather fuck 
                        it up with.

           The breakfast club laughs happily at that.

                                 HUGHES
                        No-- that’s not a joke, that’s 100% 
                        serious, cuz I know-- after the last, 
                        however long it’s been, 13 hours, I know 
                        this for sure-- That there’s nobody else 
                        on earth who’d fuck it up with half as 
                        much passion... or half as much heart.

           That inspires a group aww. But while everyone else is 
           feeling the feels...

           Anthony Michael Hall is standing next to Molly-- and he’s 
           moving his hugging hand down to where it’s on Molly’s outer 
           thigh.
           She doesn’t object to it-- on the contrary, she seems used to 
           it, leans into it. Something is plainly afoot with these two.

                                 HUGHES
                        So that’s what I wanted to say. I think 
                        we’ve got a movie. We’ve got The 
                        Breakfast Club. And I need you all to 
                        believe I’m sincere when I say this...
                                (a deep, emotional breath)
                        The last one to tag the wall has to tell 
                        Michelle Manning we changed every damn 
                        word.

           For a few seconds, no one moves... and then all at the same 
           time--

           The Breakfast Club MAKES A MAD DASH toward the opposite wall-- 
           everyone pushing and shoving, holding each other back, nobody 
           fighting fair-- laughter and youth and camaraderie and 
           vitality unleashed--

           Amidst the happy tumult, we cut to--

           MICHELLE MANNING, now 41

           She occupies a spacious office within BUILDING 217 (today, the 
           Redstone Building), as she’s President of Production at...

           TITLE:      Paramount Pictures

           Her assistant DALE (25) pokes his head in...

                                 DALE
                        Hey.

           ...and Michelle looks up from what she’s doing.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Hey, did those Zoolander numbers come in?

                                 DALE
                        It shouldn’t be long. But-- I actually 
                        have-- John Hughes on the line?

                                 MICHELLE
                                (furrows her brow)
                        John Hughes? That can’t be right.

                                 DALE
                        Should I tell him you’ll return?

           Michelle thinks.
                                 MICHELLE
                        You’re sure he said ‘John Hughes’?

           Dale shrugs-- That’s what he said. So Michelle grabs the 
           receiver, takes a breath, and says, skeptically...

                                 MICHELLE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Hello?

           INT. FARMHOUSE -- JOHN’S STUDY -- DAY [2001]

           John sits, a phone to his ear, Gibbs’ book in his lap.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Hi, Michelle.

           INTERCUT.

                                 MICHELLE (INTO THE PHONE)
                                (like she’s seen a ghost)
                        John? It’s... it’s good to hear your 
                        voice.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        I very much doubt that, but it’s polite 
                        of you to say. Listen, I’m sure you’re 
                        busy, so I’ll cut to the chase: the 
                        reason I’m calling-- what do you know 
                        about Elliot Gibbs?

           Michelle knits her brow. Elliot Gibbs?

                                 MICHELLE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Elliot Gibbs. Was he the brother too 
                        untalented for the BeeGees?

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        You’re actually not too far off. He’s an 
                        entertainment journalist.

           Michelle laughs.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        So I’ll venture a guess you’re not Mr. 
                        Gibbs’ source.

                                 MICHELLE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        For what?

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        For...
                                (picks it up)
                        ...the unauthorized biography of John 
                        Hughes.
           That knocks the wind out of Michelle. Empathetically...

                                 MICHELLE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Oh, John. Are you okay?

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Now why would you ask me that? I’ve lived 
                        a life that’s above reproach; why 
                        shouldn’t I want it shared with the 
                        entire human race?

           Michelle smiles sadly for her old-- friend? colleague? 
           sparring partner?

                                 MICHELLE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        John, I would never-- I can’t imagine 
                        anyone ever talking to some bottom-
                        feeding reporter--

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Well somebody did.  And I need to figure 
                        out who. It’s hard to explain, but-- it’s 
                        the only way to protect my family.

                                 MICHELLE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Well. If I hear anything...

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        I appreciate that.

           The conversational thread seems to have run its course... 
           but neither of them is ready to end the call yet. So, 
           flipping through the m.s...

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Hey-- can I ask you something? Was I 
                        really that hard to work with?

                                 MICHELLE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Is that what he said in the book?

           John nods.

                                 MICHELLE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Well. Then I’m sorry to tell you this, 
                        but... you’re pretty screwed, cuz he has 
                        a damn reliable source.

           John laughs at that. Hearing him laugh makes Michelle laugh 
           too.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Hey, you know, I’m-- there’s a lot that 
                        I’m not proud of. I know I could be a 
                        real-- piece of work, in those days.
                                 MICHELLE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Oh come on. We had some good times.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Did we?

                                 MICHELLE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Sure. I read all about ‘em in the press 
                        releases I wrote.

           John grins at that, remembering.

                                 MICHELLE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        “The Breakfast Club, a pure expression of 
                        love by a loving artistic family.”

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        What-- is that not how you remember us?

           Now it’s Michelle’s turn to guffaw. When she settles...

                                 MICHELLE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Honestly, though, when I look back... 
                        when I look back, despite the bumps, I 
                        don’t regret anything we did.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Really?

                                 MICHELLE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Really.

           A beat.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 MICHELLE (INTO THE PHONE)
                        ...Okay.

                                 HUGHES (INTO THE PHONE)
                        What is that like?

           Off John, as whatever holds him together begins to slacken, 
           to yield to a tsunami of contrition and self-reproach...

                                 HUGHES (PRE-LAP)
                        You’re fired!
           INT. MAIN NORTH HIGH SCHOOL -- LIBRARY SET -- DAY [1984]

           Hughes, 34 again, stands amidst the (empty) Breakfast Club 
           set, screaming bloody murder at a terrified Judd Nelson. 
           Michelle, meanwhile, tries to position herself between the 
           two men, tries to mediate.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You can’t fire him, John. You’re seven 
                        days into production-- You would have to 
                        start over--

                                 JUDD NELSON
                        I-- I wasn’t being myself.

                                 MICHELLE
                                (to Judd)
                        Will you shut up?
                                (to John)
                        Look, he wasn’t being himself, it wasn’t 
                        Judd saying that crap; it was Bender. Do 
                        you understand? He’s a method actor--

                                 HUGHES
                        Fine-- and I’m a method director! You 
                        want to know what my method is? My method 
                        is, if a 16-year-old girl is bawling her 
                        eyes out cuz of something somebody said 
                        to her, they get fired! ‘cuz my set is 
                        fun! And that’s what matters to me! And 
                        if “Bender” here doesn’t like it, he can 
                        do the next movie directed by Konstantin 
                        Stanislavsky!

           What John is referring to: in an enclosed office within the 
           library set-- a.k.a. the LIBRARIAN’S OFFICE-- Molly Ringwald 
           is struggling to pull herself together.

           The pile of tissues in front of her attests to her misery’s 
           durability... and she’s not done crying yet. Not even close.

                                 JUDD NELSON
                        I’m sorry.

                                 HUGHES
                        You’re gonna answer the damn question: 
                        what did you say to her?

                                 MICHELLE
                        I don’t think it bears repeating.

                                 HUGHES
                        In case this has never been clear, I 
                        don’t especially care what you think.
           Michelle is stung by that, but John doesn’t notice. To Judd--

                                 HUGHES
                        What did you say?

                                 JUDD NELSON
                        I... well-- I could’ve implied... that 
                        is, Bender could’ve implied-- or, the 
                        implication was--

                                 HUGHES
                        Christ, you sound less like John Bender 
                        than Dick Nixon. Spit it out. What did 
                        you say to her?

                                 JUDD NELSON
                        Just-- that Molly was being... 
                        unfaithful.

           A terrible silence takes hold.

                                 HUGHES
                        “Unfaithful.”

           Michelle, from behind John, tries to get Judd’s attention--

                                 JUDD NELSON
                        I said, cuz of her thing with--

                                 MICHELLE
                        Judd--

                         MICHELLE
                                                    JUDD NELSON
           Don’t.
                                            With Michael--

           The blood drains from John’s face.

                                 HUGHES
                        “Her thing with Michael.” What are you 
                        talking about?

           But Michelle is frantically shakes her head at Judd, so--

                                 JUDD NELSON
                        I dunno. Probably nothing. I’m full of 
                        shit.

                                 HUGHES
                        There’s a “thing”?

                                 JUDD NELSON
                        Probably not. What do I know?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Just let it go.
           John whips around, staring daggers at Michelle: You. Knew.

           But then... he seems to gather himself... seems to cover his 
           boiling pot of rage... and, taking a breath, he starts to 
           go. But just as Judd and Michelle begin to relax-- John 
           stops dead in his tracks. There’s something that seems to be 
           sticking in his craw:

                                 HUGHES
                        Wait-- So if there’s some kind of thing 
                        with Michael-- You said Molly was being 
                        “unfaithful”; that’s what you said.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Let it go.

                                 HUGHES
                        So then, if Molly’s going with Michael, 
                        you mind telling me-- “Bender”-- just who 
                        it is you said she was being unfaithful 
                        to?

           Off Judd--

           INT. MAIN NORTH -- HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           John storms toward the exits, his face a reference image of 
           rage... but along the way, he spots Anthony Michael Hall, 
           sitting, awaiting whatever eruptions are still to come.

           As he walks, John locks eyes with Michael, with “the best 
           friend [he’s] ever had.” It’s a staring contest without 
           winners, only losers.

                                 HUGHES (O.S.)
                        Somebody call my wife. Tell her I won’t 
                        be home tonight.

           [NOTE: The cuts begin to get faster now and the music, 
           constant--  in other words, it begins to assume the 
           character of a montage.]

           INT. HUGHES’ NORTH FIELD HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DUSK

           Nancy is in the kitchen, working on dinner, a phone to her 
           ear. What she hears on the other end arouses her suspicions--

                                 NANCY (INTO THE PHONE)
                        All night? And where did he say he’d be?
                                (grabs a pen and paper)
                        “Post-production facility.” Alright. 
                        Wait, I’m sorry-- can I get a number for 
                        that? Just in case?
           EXT. BEHIND MAIN NORTH HIGH SCHOOL -- DUSK

           Michael leans against a wall, holding Molly, who puts her 
           head against his chest. It’s magic hour, and they’re young, 
           and their love seems pressing and tragic and real.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s like... there has to be a way. You 
                        know?

           But Molly just shakes her head at that... She doesn’t know...

                                 MICHAEL
                        I mean, what’s he expect? He’s 35. He has 
                        a wife and kids. And a mortgage. And the 
                        wardrobe of the Thompson Twins.

           She laughs at that... and kisses him...

           EXT. RED-BRICK BUILDING -- NIGHT

           TITLE:     “Breakfast Club” Post-Production Facility

                                 JUDD NELSON (PRE-LAP)
                                (as Bender)
                        What’d you do to get in here? Forget to 
                        wash your jock?

                                 MOLLY (PRE-LAP)
                                (as Claire)
                        Ignore him. Maybe he’ll go away.

           INT. POST FACILITY -- SCREENING ROOM -- NIGHT

           John sits, all alone, watching dailies. UP ON THE SCREEN, 
           Bender harasses Andy, until, off-screen, somebody yells, CUT.

           To the PROJECTIONIST--

                                 HUGHES
                        Just keep it rolling. Let’s see 
                        everything-- the footage between the 
                        takes-- whatever we haven’t screened.

           The Projectionist nods. At the back of the room, a RUNNER 
           knocks--

                                 RUNNER
                        Mr. Hughes? Your wife is on the phone?

                                 HUGHES
                        My wife?
           For a moment, he wonders what that could be about. Then--

                                 HUGHES
                        Never mind. Just tell her I’m not here.

           INT. HUGHES’ NORTH FIELD HOUSE — MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Nancy once again has a phone pressed to her ear. What she 
           hears on the other end seems to make her sick to her stomach.

                                 NANCY (INTO THE PHONE)
                        I see. Thank you.

           She hangs up. As she does, her eyes fall on a framed wedding 
           photo... and her defenses begin to give way... and she 
           starts to sob...

           INT. WESTIN O’HARE -- JUDD’S ROOM -- NIGHT

           Emilio, Ally, Molly, Michael, and Judd confer about the 
           latter’s firing, their voices low, their expressions bleak.

                                 EMILIO
                        The important thing is, we have to 
                        maintain a united front.

                                 ALLY SHEEDY
                        I agree.

                                 EMILIO
                        Without Judd, there isn’t a movie. I mean-- 
                        This is it. This is the breakfast club.

                                 MICHAEL
                        But what do we say to John?

                                 JUDD NELSON
                        I could apologize again.

                                 MOLLY
                                (sighs)
                        No. The apology’s gotta come from me.

           INT. POST FACILITY -- SCREENING ROOM -- NIGHT

           John is now watching footage from between takes (he’s kept 
           the camera rolling on set-- when filming is done, he’ll have 
           shot [and printed] over a million feet of film).

           He finally finds what’s he after:
           ON SCREEN: In the b.g., Michael slips his hand around 
           Molly’s waist and gives her a squeeze. She giggles.

                                 HUGHES
                        There! Can you play that again?

           The Projectionist rolls the film back. Plays it again.

           As John watches the replay, tears begin to form in his eyes.

                                 HUGHES
                        Can we mark that?

                                 PROJECTIONIST
                        Sure. You want me to keep going?

           On John-- desperate/terrified to see more.

           INT. HUGHES’ NORTH FIELD HOUSE -- JAMIE’S ROOM -- NIGHT

           Nancy, curled up, once again, with her youngest son, hears 
           the DOORBELL... and, when it rings a SECOND TIME, she begins 
           to stir...

           ENTRYWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Now be-robed, Nancy answers the door. On her doorstep stands 
           an obscenely perky FLOWER DELIVERY GUY:

                                 FLOWER DELIVERY GUY
                        Top of the mornin’! I got a delivery for 
                        John?

                                 NANCY
                        That’s my husband.

                                 FLOWER DELIVERY GUY
                                (hands her a clipboard)
                        Just need a John Hancock from you-- or a 
                        Jane Hancock, as the case may be.

           He chuckles at his little joke. Nancy decidedly does not. 
           She just signs on the X, takes the BOUQUET, and shuts the 
           door. She fishes around, finds the card. This is what it 
           says:

                From: Molly
                For John, The only guy I truly adore!

           Nancy crumples the note, distraught. She calls upstairs--

                                 NANCY
                        Jack! Jamie!
           EXT. MAIN NORTH HIGH SCHOOL -- NIGHT

           John pulls into the lot, still wearing yesterday’s clothes.

           INT. MAIN NORTH -- JOHN’S OFFICE -- PRE-DAWN

           John sits at his typewriter, clacking away. On his desk is a 
           growing stack of fresh (screenplay) pages.

           INT. HUGHES’ NORTH FIELD HOUSE -- JAMIE’S ROOM -- PRE-DAWN

           Nancy is dressing Jamie (very much against his will) in his 
           Sunday best.

                                 JAMIE
                        Why do I need a sweater?

                                 NANCY
                        Well we haven’t seen much of Daddy 
                        lately, so I thought we’d surprise him at 
                        work. Won’t that be fun?

           INT. MAIN NORTH -- HALLWAY -- DAWN

           This is the “dressing room hallway.” John KNOCKS on a door 
           marked MICHAEL.

                                 HUGHES
                        Hey. You and Molly, Librarian’s Office, 
                        five minutes.

           INT. NANCY’S CAR -- DAWN

           Nancy, now in her sexiest dress, her every hair in place, 
           drives her two sons, looking Christmas-Card-perfect, toward 
           the Main North lot. 

           EXT. MAIN NORTH HIGH SCHOOL -- DAWN

           Nancy climbs out of the car. She takes a deep breath-- 
           determined to show her husband what he has that he stands to 
           lose.

           [And with that, the montage comes to end.]

           INT. MAIN NORTH -- LIBRARY SET -- LIBRARIAN’S OFFICE -- DAY

           John Hughes sits, absently drumming his pen once again, 
           gazing into some endless void, when, suddenly...
           There’s a KNOCK at the door. John motions for Michael and 
           Molly to entrez si’l vous plait. With sudden brightness--

                                 HUGHES
                        Well, if it isn’t my favorite movie 
                        stars. Come in! Have a seat!

           But they shuffle in like wayward students who’ve been sent 
           to the principal’s office. Observing their demeanors--

                                 HUGHES
                        You guys alright? 

                          MOLLY
                                                     MICHAEL
           ...Oh. Yeah. Fine.
                                            ...Sure. Yeah.

                                 HUGHES
                        Well I hope so. It’s a big day.
                                (to Michael)
                        We’re shooting your dance break after 
                        lunch.

           Hughes grins. Michael forces a smile. A beat. “Perplexed”--

                                 HUGHES
                        Well-- maybe this’ll perk you up. I was 
                        saving them for the wrap party, but...

           He sends a pair of Swiss Army Knives sliding across the 
           desk. Molly and Michael take them... and notice, with a 
           pang, that they’ve been lovingly engraved with their names.

                                 HUGHES
                        For old times’ sake.

                          MOLLY
           Oh. Wow.
                                                     MICHAEL
                                            Hey, thanks, John.

           Now, John passes around three Cokes.

                                 HUGHES
                        What should we drink to?

           But the teenagers remain silent... With faint menace--

                                 HUGHES
                        How about... to friendship?

           With that, John punches a hole in his can and proceeds to 
           shotgun the Coke, just as the trio once did on the beach.

           But-- the sight of Hughes’s expressionless face coldly 
           chugging to “friendship” somehow disturbs Michael and Molly, 
           even terrifies them. 
                                 HUGHES
                        You didn’t drink.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m... I’m not really that thirsty.

                                 HUGHES
                        We’re drinking to friendship, Michael.

           It’s clear that that’s not a request. So Michael and Molly 
           obediently, joylessly pierce their cans and begin to chug, 
           feeling something akin to physical distress. Then--

                                 HUGHES
                        Well. I guess that’s it. I just wanted to 
                        check in. See if my good friends had 
                        anything on their minds...
                                (when his ‘friends’ remain 
                                silent)
                        But if there’s nothing...
                                (shrugs)
                        Well okay then. I guess I’ll see you out 
                        there.

           He leans back in his chair-- The conversation is over.

           Uncertain as to whether this is some sort of a test, the 
           teens stay glued to their seats for a moment. But then, 
           not sure what else to do, Molly stands. The second she’s 
           on her feet--

                                 HUGHES
                        Oh-- and before you go-- I just thought I 
                        should pass this along: Judd wants you to 
                        know, he’s sorry for what he said to you.

           Molly nods grimly. To Michael--

                                 HUGHES
                        Did you hear what Judd said? To Molly?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Um, yeah, I mean, I think everyone at 
                        this point--

                                 HUGHES
                        He said-- It was a really good Bender 
                        improv-- What he said-- He said to Molly-- 
                        He said, that she was being “unfaithful.”
                                (then)
                        Or at least, that’s the word he used when 
                        he talked to me; I have to imagine it was 
                        somewhat more-- colorful in the original 
                        French. Am I right?
           John grins like that’s a hilarious joke. 

                                 HUGHES
                        He said, if you can believe this, Michael-- 
                        my understanding is-- he implied-- he 
                        implied that she had betrayed me. He 
                        implied that she had betrayed me for no 
                        reason at all except of course the fact 
                        that she’s having a secret relationship. 
                        With you.

           An awful stillness fills the space.

                                 HUGHES
                        He’d apparently gotten it into his head 
                        that the three of us-- that we were 
                        friends-- close friends-- and we wouldn’t 
                        keep secrets like that from each other. I 
                        explained, of course, that we used to be 
                        close friends, but that now, we’re just 
                        employees and a boss.

           Molly’s eyes are beginning to fill with tears.

                                                     MICHAEL
                          MOLLY
           John, it wasn’t--
                                            We didn’t mean to--

           But John holds up his hands to stop them. He has more:

                                 HUGHES
                        So what I should mention-- boss to 
                        employees-- I watched the rushes last 
                        night, all the footage from the week, and 
                        I found a number of places where your-- 
                        obvious-- affection for each other had... 
                        well, let’s just say it had colored the 
                        performances. Now, of course, if your 
                        characters were romantically involved-- 
                        especially if they were sexually involved--
                                (he gauges their reactions to 
                                that)
                        Well of course, that would upset the 
                        entire balance of the movie; the 
                        characters; the group; the story; 
                        everything. So, what I’m saying-- if you 
                        want to continue your relationship-- well 
                        of course that’s up to you, and it’s 
                        perfectly fine-- it’s just, in that 
                        event, I will need to be informed so I 
                        can replace you with other actors.

                          MOLLY
                                                     MICHAEL
           What?
                                            Wait, what?
                                 HUGHES
                        The issue is, you haven’t mastered your 
                        acting craft enough to conceal your 
                        obvious attraction to each other on the 
                        screen. It’s very clear in the rushes. In 
                        six places. So if you don’t break this 
                        off, I’ll have to let you go. Strictly 
                        due to job performance issues.

           Molly nods vaguely... but Michael is starting to get angry.

                                 HUGHES
                        So just let me know: do I need to do any 
                        recasting?

                                 MOLLY
                        No.

           Michael looks at Molly, surprised and upset at how quickly 
           she answered that. But then, he realizes that John is 
           looking his way... and, reluctantly, he, too, shakes his 
           head, no.

                                 HUGHES
                        Good.
                                (then)
                        Oh-- and one other thing-- as long as 
                        I’ve got you both here...

           He grabs the pages he wrote this morning and slides them 
           across to Michael.

                                 HUGHES
                        I put this together last night; it’s the 
                        first act of your new movie.

           Michael checks it out: it’s a script entitled Weird Science.

                                 HUGHES
                        The female lead’s a model you’re s’posed 
                        to have the the hots for, so any 
                        extracurricular activities won’t 
                        interfere. Molly: for you:

           He slides a smaller stack to her-- a treatment.

                                 MOLLY
                        This is-- it’s the movie I asked you to 
                        write. Based on that Psychedelic Furs’ 
                        song.

           For a moment, John softens-- but he recovers--

                                 HUGHES
                        It was a title I liked, that’s all.
           Now, we see the title: Pretty in Pink.

                                 MOLLY
                        ...Will Michael be in--?

                                 HUGHES
                        No.
                                (then)
                        Any other questions?
                                (but as there are no other 
                                questions...)
                        Fine... then I’ll see you out there.

           Having nothing more to say, the teens rise from their 
           chairs. They head for the door. Michael manages to get all 
           the way out-- but Molly turns at the last minute...

                                 MOLLY
                        John? I just... I want you to know... It 
                        wasn’t like... We weren’t trying to go 
                        behind your back, or...
                                (wipes a tear from her cheek)
                        And I didn’t mean to betray you. I didn’t 
                        think I was betraying you. I just...

           She breaks down. But John just sits there, expressionless, 
           motionless.

                                 MOLLY
                        I mean, it’s hard, you know? I’m so much 
                        younger than you. I’m at a different 
                        place in my life!

           But John remains even.

                                 MOLLY
                        Why is that so hard to understand? Can’t 
                        you see it from my perspective?

           And now, the levees burst, and she collapses into tears.

           ON THE LIBRARY SET

           Nancy is just arriving, 4-Year-Old Jamie and John III in tow. 

           The first thing that catches her eye is Molly-- inside the 
           Librarian’s Office-- pleading with her husband--

           IN THE LIBRARIAN’S OFFICE

                                 MOLLY
                        What do you want from me, John? What is 
                        it you want? You want to screw me?
                                 HUGHES
                        I think we’re done.

                                 MOLLY
                                (grabbing her chest)
                        You want my breasts in your mouth? Is 
                        that what you want? 

                                 HUGHES
                        You are embarrassing yourself.

                                 MOLLY
                                (kneeling)
                        You want me down on my knees?

                                 HUGHES
                        THAT’S ENOUGH.

                                 MOLLY
                        YES! IT’S ENOUGH! SO WHY DON’T YOU JUST 
                        TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT?!

           ON THE LIBRARY SET

           What Nancy sees, in the Librarian’s Office: Molly, clutching 
           her breasts.... descending to her knees...

           Nancy is shocked-- whatever is happening, it’s worse than 
           anything she’d imagined. In a single, swift move, she takes 
           hold of her children’s slender wrists and pulls them, with 
           awful force, out into...

           MAIN NORTH HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           Nancy is practically sprinting down the hall, her children 
           struggling to keep up with her... when she hears from behind--

                                 JUDD NELSON
                        Mrs. Hughes?

           Now, Nancy turns to see Judd-- who’s apparently rushed after 
           her, and whose dark eyes regard her with a deep, visceral 
           sympathy.

                                 JUDD NELSON
                        I just... I think, whatever happened, I 
                        think it’s over now. I just... I thought 
                        you should know.

           She wipes the pooling tears from her eyes.
                                 NANCY
                        Can I ask you something?
                                (then)
                        Can any movie be worth this? What this 
                        has cost?

           Judd considers that a moment. Then, he looks at Nancy and 
           says, very simply...

                                 JUDD NELSON
                        Yes.

                        One of the most big-hearted movies I’ve

                        a teen in your heart, there’s really just

           QUICK CUTS:

                                 TEEN GIRL #1
                        I loved it.

                                 TEEN BOY #1
                        It was awesome.

                                 TEEN GIRL #2
                        It was-- my life. You know? Like, 
                        somebody saw my life and made a movie.

           Then: TEEN after TEEN... just crying... just in tears...
                                 TEEN BOY #2
                        I just hope... that things at school... 
                        that they’ll be different after this. You 
                        know? I mean, I don’t think so, but...
                                (shrugs)
                        I hope so.

           Now, enter the “RINGLETS”-- Molly fans, many of whom wear her

                        I’m here for Molly.

                                 RINGLET #3
                        Molly is like, my idol?

           Then, a GROUP OF GIRLS in Molly wigs exclaim in cheery unison--

                                 GROUP OF GIRLS
                        Ringlets Forever!

           INT. TV INTERVIEW SHOW SET -- DAY [1985]

           A smarmy TV host-- let’s call him ROD SMOOTHMAN-- is 
           ecstatic to have John as a guest on his show this afternoon!

                                 ROD
                        Some have called him the Pied Piper of 
                        Cinema, and indeed, wherever he goes, 
                        teen viewers seem to follow. I’m sitting 
                        down with writer-director John Hughes, 
                        whose movies include “Sixteen Candles,” 
                        “The Breakfast Club,” and the upcoming 
                        “Weird Science.” Thanks for being here, 
                        John, and congrats on all your success. 
                        How does it feel?

                                 HUGHES
                                (somewhat less eager to be here 
                                than Rod Smoothman)
                        Um. Well. Of course, I’m glad when people 
                        connect with my movies, but-- I don’t 
                        think about-- “success” much-- whatever 
                        that means.

                                 ROD
                        Yeah, I hear you’re a real midwestern guy.

                                 HUGHES
                        Well, I live in L.A. at the moment, but-- 
                        I don’t think you’d ever take me for L.A.
                                 ROD
                        How do you mean?

                                 HUGHES
                        Oh, you know. I don’t know the right car 
                        to drive. The right “hotspots.” I don’t 
                        care about that; what I care about is my 
                        family.

                                                      REVEAL THAT WE’RE 
                                                SEEING THIS ON A TV IN:

           INT. HUGHES LOS ANGELES HOME -- LIVING ROOM -- DAY [1985]

           Nancy sits with her sons, watching her husband tell an 
           ecstatic Rob Smoothman just how dearly he loves his family.

                                 HUGHES (ON T.V.)
                        I’m pretty much just a normal suburban 
                        guy who likes to write. That’s it.

                                 ROD (ON T.V.)
                        Well we hope you keep it up.
                                (then)
                        Now a lot of our viewers may know you 
                        above all as the guy who discovered Molly 
                        Ringwald.

           Nancy tightens at that. John III watches his mom, concerned-- 
           he’s nine at this point and perhaps not totally oblivious.

           Nancy clocks her son’s concern, and she smiles for his 
           benefit. She tousles his hair reassuringly.

                                 ROD (ON T.V.)
                        What is it like, working with Molly?

                                 HUGHES (ON T.V.)
                        ...Well, she’s a very capable actress.

                                 ROD (ON T.V.)
                                (an awkward beat; then)
                        Well are there any Molly stories you 
                        might like to share with our viewers?

           On T.V., John shakes his head.

           Seeing how dark he gets, how reticent he becomes at the 
           mention of Molly-- that makes Nancy relax a bit. There’s 
           even the hint of a smile on her face.

                                 ROD (ON T.V.)
                        Well... I hear you’re working together 
                        again?
                                 HUGHES (ON T.V.)
                        Um, well, yes, I’m writing and producing 
                        a movie called “Pretty in Pink.” And 
                        Molly Ringwald will appear in that.
                                (feels compelled to add)
                        Alongside Andrew McCarthy and Jon Cryer 
                        and a few others.

           And that is all John is going to say about that.

           EXT. PARAMOUNT STUDIOS -- GATE 2 -- DAY

           Hughes drives onto the lot... in a black ‘85 Porsche. He’s 
           dressing differently now-- what Molly will describe to 
           Time’s Richard Corliss as “very GQ.”

           (Evidently, his protests that he “[doesn’t] care about 
           Hollywood” are as difficult to unravel as his insistence 
           that he cares only “about [his] family.”)

           TIME CUTS: John pulls into his assigned space... He makes 
           his way to SOUNDSTAGE 16 (whose door is labeled “Pretty in 
           Pink”)... He heads onto the set and takes stock of the 
           production, as...

           PRE-LAP: the sound of gentle KNOCKING...

                                 HUGHES (PRE-LAP)
                        Come in.

           INT. FARMHOUSE -- JOHN’S STUDY -- DAY [2001]

           John lies on his sofa, just now closing Gibbs’s manuscript-- 
           which he places face-down in the presence of...

           ...Nancy, who’s just poked her head in the door.

                                 HUGHES
                        Hey.

                                 NANCY
                        Hey.

                                 HUGHES
                        You’ve been quiet.

                                 NANCY
                                (re: the broken awards)
                        You’ve been loud.

                                 HUGHES
                                (sighs)
                        ...Yeah. I’m sorry about that. It’s 
                        nothing, just-- work frustrations.
           Nancy nods-- but she knows not to pry.

                                 NANCY
                        Well if this is a bad time--

                                 HUGHES
                        No, I welcome the interruption, as a 
                        matter of fact.
                                (sitting up)
                        What’s on your mind?

           Nancy sits, perched on the edge of a chair. 

                                 NANCY
                        Well... while you were out, Jamie called--

                                 HUGHES
                        He--?
                                (shakes his head)
                        Of course he called you. I don’t know why 
                        I’m surprised.

                                 NANCY
                        It was-- something about an article--

                                 HUGHES
                        Yeah, it’s something-- It doesn’t matter. 
                        He shouldn’t be bothering you with that.

                                 NANCY
                        ...Well-- I think he’s just worried that 
                        his movie won’t do well.

                                 HUGHES
                        Then he should write another movie.

           Re: a BOOKCASE overflowing with scripts, bound and un--

                                 HUGHES
                        I’ve written five dozen scripts since I 
                        retired, he can take one of those, put 
                        his name on it for all I care.

                                 NANCY
                        I don’t think that’s what he wants.

                                 HUGHES
                        He’s gotten everything he’s ever--
                                (convincing himself?)
                        The kid is spoiled, Nancy. Something like 
                        this, it could be good for him.

           Just then, Tom enters; not seeing Nancy--

                                 TOM
                        John? I’ve got the contacts for Michael 
                        and Molly--
           John nods to the corner as if to say, We’re not alone-- And, 
           seeing that Nancy is present, Tom very abruptly shuts up.

           As for Nancy, she turns white as a sheet. She looks at John, 
           feeling something akin to betrayal... Michael and Molly?

                                 HUGHES
                        Sixteen Candles is having its 20th 
                        anniversary, the studio wants to round up 
                        the old cast. That’s all.

                                 NANCY
                                (not quite buying it)
                        I thought you hated that sort of thing.

           To that, John can only lamely shrug. But, sensing that 
           that’s all she’s going to get, Nancy nods. Standing--

                                 NANCY
                        Alright. Well. I guess I’ve said my 
                        piece. I’ll leave you gentlemen to it.

           With that, she heads out of the study. As John watches her 
           go, he feels a pang... But then, shaking it off, he motions 
           for Tom to shut the door, and he leans in, ready for his 
           briefing.

                                 TOM
                        Well: apparently, Molly is moving within 
                        France, so she doesn’t have a direct line, 
                        but-- she’s checking messages with an 
                        assistant. Michael should be reachable and 
                        available; I can set a call, if you want.

                                 HUGHES
                                (thinks; then, nodding)
                        That’d be fine.

           So Tom, having his orders, turns to go. But--

                                 HUGHES
                        No, wait, just-- You can leave Michael a 
                        message too. Just ask if he’s ever spoken 
                        to that reporter, Elliot Gibbs.

                                 TOM
                                (making a mental note)
                        Elliot Gibbs. Okay, I’m on it.

                                 HUGHES
                        Oh, and Tom? No interruptions for a while.

           Tom nods, then starts to go... but John feels the need to 
           proffer some explanation:
                                 HUGHES
                        It’s just-- that I’m working on something 
                        at the moment. And I think it’s maybe 
                        best if I power through.

                                 TOM
                        ...Sure.
                                (then, feeling he’s supposed 
                                to ask)
                        How’s it going? The-- the thing you’re 
                        working on?

           John considers the question.

                                 HUGHES
                        I think I’m about to get to the hard part.

           PRE-LAP: the sounds of a working film set--

           INT. PARAMOUNT -- STAGE 16 -- DAY [1985]

           A major studio production is underway. At present, the stage 
           is set for an expansive residential interior. 

           WE’RE WITH JOHN, as he walks through the set in his mogul-
           standard attire, as GRIPS and P.A.s and ART GUYS part for 
           him like the Red Sea...

           Finally, on the far side of the stage, John comes to a 
           DRESSING ROOM DOOR painted pink. He KNOCKS. From inside--

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        Who is it?

                                 HUGHES
                        It’s Hughes.

           Now, the door is opened for John-- not by Molly, but by a 
           tall, 50something REPORTER. John seems a bit surprised by 
           the man’s presence...

                                 HUGHES
                        Hell-o?

                                 MOLLY
                        John, this is Steve. Steve, John.

                                 STEVE
                                (offers his hand)
                        Nice to meet you. Steve Galey, LIFE 
                        magazine.

                                 MOLLY
                        He’s doing a feature on me.
                                 STEVE
                        The fans demand it.

           Molly giggles at that. A note about Molly: she seems to have 
           undergone something of a change since we last saw her; she 
           seems to have blown past “confident” and to have landed in 
           the vicinity of “prima donna”...

                                 HUGHES
                        Okay, well...
                                (to Steve)
                        If you could give us the room a minute...

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh, it’s okay. Steve won’t write anything 
                        I’m unhappy with. Will you, Steve?

                                 STEVE
                        That’s the deal.

                                 MOLLY
                                (to John; cheery)
                        See? So there’s nothing to worry about.
                                (re: a chair)
                        Here. Have a seat.

           John doesn’t like this one bit-- but unsure of what else to 
           do, he takes a seat. As he does, Molly retrieves a screenplay 
           from her makeup counter. Sitting opposite John--

                                 MOLLY
                        So the reason I asked to see you: I read 
                        the script you sent.

                                 HUGHES
                        “Some Kind of Wonderful.” I just got 
                        word, we can shoot in the late fall.

                                 MOLLY
                        Right, well the thing is, I just...
                                (she sighs; “gently”--)
                        ...I don’t know about this one.

                                 HUGHES
                                (beat)
                        You don’t know... ... ... what.

                                 MOLLY
                        Well, it’s just...
                                (flipping through)
                        It seems to me like a retread: the right 
                        girl, the wrong girl, the Richies and the 
                        Zoids, blah blah.

                                 HUGHES
                        A “retread.”
                                 MOLLY
                        I’m just saying, haven’t we done all of 
                        this already? I mean, isn’t it, like, 
                        time to put high school behind us?

           Those words strike at John’s deepest, most sensitive place. 

                                 MOLLY
                                (more to Steve than to John)
                        The thing is, if I agree to a part at 
                        this point, it needs to be something that 
                        will let me expand my range as an 
                        actress. It needs some sort of 
                        originality. And as you know, I’m 
                        weighing that offer from Warren Beatty, 
                        and of course I can only do so much.

                                 STEVE
                        Right, that makes sense.

           Steve is, of course, taking copious notes-- until he observes 
           that he is the object of John Hughes’s death stare. Realizing 
           this, he lowers his pen, almost against his will, as if John 
           is controlling his arm via telekinetic force.

                                 HUGHES
                        This is very much off the record.

                                 STEVE
                                (hesitates)
                        ...Hm, well, Mr. Hughes, you really 
                        should have said that at the beginn--

                                 HUGHES
                        Let me put this another way: if you 
                        publish so much as a word of this, I’ll 
                        have it written into every actor’s 
                        contract from now ‘til the end of time 
                        that they can speak to any reporter they 
                        want to about anything they want to 
                        except any reporter affiliated in any way 
                        with LIFE magazine.

                                 STEVE
                                (gulp)
                        It’s off the record.

                                 HUGHES
                        Good. Now that thing to your left, it’s 
                        called a door. It’s sort of a “retread” 
                        of other doors, but against all odds, it 
                        still works. I suggest you use it.
           Getting the picture, Steve promptly uses the door. When he’s 
           gone, when director and star are alone, Molly seems to grow 
           very quiet, very still...

                                 MOLLY
                        What did you do that for?

                                 HUGHES
                        “Some Kind of Wonderful” shoots in the 
                        fall. And I expect you to mark your 
                        calendar.

                                 MOLLY
                        And why would I do that?

                                 HUGHES
                        You made a promise to me--!

                                 MOLLY
                        Are you serious?

           [NOTE: “/” means an overlap.]

                                 HUGHES
                        To do my movies / until--

                                 MOLLY
                        I was 15, we were bullshitting / on a 
                        beach--

                                 HUGHES
                        You made a promise, and where I come 
                        from, that still matters!

           SLAM-- John puts his fist against the wall. Molly is instantly 
           cowed. She’s never seen him violent before. A beat. Calmer--

                                 HUGHES
                        Now look: this is probably my fault. I 
                        should never have let them shoot “Pretty 
                        in Pink” in L.A. I knew something like 
                        this would happen.

                                 MOLLY
                        What “happened”?

                                 HUGHES
                        I knew you’d get taken in. I mean, what 
                        else was gonna happen, you’re just a kid.

                                 MOLLY
                        What are you talking about? What am I 
                        “getting taken in” by?
                                 HUGHES
                        By... L.A.! By reporters! By Warren 
                        Beatty! All the parasites trying to bore 
                        their way into your head.

                                 MOLLY
                        There’s nobody “in my head,” John, I’m 
                        just trying to build a career for myself--

                                 HUGHES
                        You already have a career, Molly! I 
                        should know, I’M THE SUCKER WHO BUILT IT!

           Suddenly on the verge of despair...

                                 MOLLY
                        I-- I don’t know what you want from me. 
                        Am I supposed to stay at Shermer High 
                        forever?

                                 HUGHES
                        Not forever. I didn’t say, ‘forever.’

                                 MOLLY
                        How long then? Two more movies? Five? 
                        Ten? Tell me, John. How many?

           But of course, John has no answer to that.

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m just trying to grow up is all. That’s 
                        it. It’s natural. It’s what I’m supposed 
                        to be doing at my age! It’s what everyone 
                        does...
                                (shakes her head sadly)
                        ...Everyone except you.

           A beat. Then, quietly...

                                 HUGHES
                        “Everyone,” huh? Let me tell you about 
                        “everyone.” Everyone not in this room 
                        would kill to be in a Hughes production.

           Molly slumps.

                                 MOLLY
                        Maybe, John. But how many people would 
                        kill to be in a second one?

                                 HUGHES
                                (beat; then, definite)
                        All of them.
           EXT. L.A. ROOFTOP RESTAURANT -- DUSK [1985]

           We join John and Michael amidst an al fresco dinner meeting.

           [Note that we’ll cut freely between the restaurant scene and 
           the scene in Molly’s dressing room.]

                                 HUGHES
                        I-- I don’t understand.

                                 MICHAEL
                                (re: a screenplay)
                        I’m sorry, John, it just... wasn’t for me.

                                 HUGHES
                        But it is for you. Ferris Bueller was 
                        literally written for you!
                                (beat)
                        Jesus. You talked to Molly. Didn’t you? 
                        The two of you, you planned this, decided 
                        that this was the week to cut me loose.

           IN MOLLY’S DRESSING ROOM

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m not doing anything to you!

           Both Molly and John are now in danger of falling apart.

                                 MOLLY
                        Why’s this about you? I just want to work 
                        with other people in addition to you.

           But that only engenders a look of hatred from John.

                                 HUGHES
                        I don’t think so.

                                 MOLLY
                        W-what’s that supposed to mean? What? 
                        It’s all or nothing?

           John shrugs like a sullen teenager: Maybe. Then, distraught--

                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t know why you’re being like this. 
                        It’s a business, John. Why do I have to 
                        say that to you? I’m 17, you’re 35!

           John says nothing. He just grows more and more distant... he 
           begins to drift toward the window, as if compelled there by 
           some invisible force. When he finally speaks, it’s hard to say 
           if he’s talking to Molly, or to himself, or to no one at all...
                                 HUGHES
                        It isn’t a business. People say that. 
                        “It’s a business.” Well, no, I’ve been in 
                        business: advertising’s a business. But 
                        Hollywood-- what that is-- well-- that is 
                        a goddam high school. A subject on which 
                        I believe I’m considered a bit of an 
                        expert...

           AT THE ROOFTOP RESTAURANT

                                 HUGHES
                        Cuz there’s the popular kids and the 
                        losers. Right? And the losers, in high 
                        school or Hollywood, they can’t even get a 
                        decent table at lunch. It’s like they 
                        carry a stench...

           IN MOLLY’S DRESSING ROOM

                                 HUGHES
                        ...And if anyone gets a whiff of it, boy, 
                        they drop you fast, and they’re out of 
                        sight before you even hit the ground.

                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t... I don’t know what you’re 
                        talking about. A “loser”? John, you’re 
                        one of the biggest directors in town!

           But John doesn’t seem to hear that. He just floats toward 
           the door...

                                 MOLLY
                        Please don’t go. Not like this.

           ...and he gives her a last, mournful look... and he says...

                                 HUGHES
                        Goodbye, Molly.

           AT THE ROOFTOP RESTAURANT

           Hughes is on his feet. He throws down some cash to cover the 
           check and says...

                                 HUGHES
                        Goodbye, Michael.

           ...and he walks out of Anthony Michael Hall’s life forever.

                                                               CUT TO:
           INT. SKOKIE HILTON -- LOBBY -- DAY [1985]

                                 HUGHES
                        Hello, Matthew! Hello, Mia!

           John is once again in the Skokie Hilton-- the very place he 
           met Michael and Molly before the Sixteen Candles shoot.

           When we find him, he’s waving cheerily to MATTHEW BRODERICK 
           (23) and MIA SARA (17), who are headed into the Hilton, 
           dragging rollerbags behind them.

           TITLE:  One week before production on Ferris Bueller

                                 MATTHEW BRODERICK
                        Hey, man. Are you the welcoming committee?

                                 HUGHES
                        Something like that! Looks like you both 
                        made it in okay?

                                 MATTHEW BRODERICK
                        Yeah, no problems here. Say, you’re not 
                        staying in the hotel?

                                 HUGHES
                        Yeah I am, I like for us all just to be 
                        together for this part. You know?

                                 MATTHEW BRODERICK
                        ...Sure. Okay. Well-- so I never got like 
                        a call sheet for tomorrow-- and neither 
                        did Mia-- so we weren’t... completely 
                        sure how to prepare?

                                 HUGHES
                        No preparations required. The most 
                        important thing is just that we really 
                        spend time together, get to know each 
                        other. Get comfortable. Ya know?

                                 MATTHEW BRODERICK
                                (he doesn’t “know”)
                        ...Yeah. Okay.

                                 HUGHES
                        Now Mia, you are gonna love this guy, 
                        guaranteed. Cuz he reminds me of me, and 
                        you’re gonna love me. Okay?

           Now, John gives Mia an ebullient smile, almost psychotically 
           bright. It makes her uncomfortable, and she instinctively 
           turns away. But John proceeds as if they’ve made a great 
           connection and signals the “kids” to follow him, as he makes 
           for the Front Desk... 
                                 HUGHES
                        Well. I guess we should get checked in, 
                        get to our rooms, huh? Tomorrow, it all 
                        begins.

           Matthew and Mia, trailing John, exchange a Look.

                                 MATTHEW BRODERICK
                        So, what’s beginning exactly?

           Hughes turns. Like it’s obvious--

                                 HUGHES
                        Spending time with my new friends!

           Off Mia and Matthew, straining to keep their poker faces--

           INT. SKOKIE HILTON -- JOHN’S ROOM -- NIGHT

           John stands by a wardrobe, mechanically unpacking, when he 
           hears from the next room...

                                 MATTHEW BRODERICK (O.S.)
                        ...”new friends”?

           He knits his brow.

                                 MIA (O.S.)
                        I mean, this is only my second movie, I 
                        didn’t know if this was--

                                 MATTHEW BRODERICK (O.S.)
                        Yeah, no. It’s not.

           Now, John puts his ear to the wall... strains to hear...

                                 MIA (O.S.)
                        You think it’s bad if I go and stay with 
                        my godmother in the city?

                                 MATTHEW BRODERICK (O.S.)
                        Well-- I’d say it kind of depends.

                                 MIA (O.S.)
                        On what?

                                 MATTHEW BRODERICK (O.S.)
                                (tiny beat)
                        On whether she has enough room for me too.

           And now, the actors descend into conspiratorial LAUGHTER.

           On Hughes, his expression turning cold, turning dark, as if the 
           fires that turn his pistons have been suddenly snuffed out.
           He notices his reflection in the window: he looks old, 10 
           years older than when he was last here. But before he can 
           plumb the implications of that, something catches his eyes-- 
           something outside, something just beyond the window...

           It’s the Sherwin Williams whose sign he’d managed to turn 
           into “Shermer” just a few short years ago. But in 1985, the 
           storefront is slung with a banner: “Going Out of Business.” 
           For some reason, that strikes John as grimly funny. As he 
           begins to smile... to chuckle... to laugh...

           [BEGIN MONTAGE:]

                                 GIBBS (V.O.)
                        Ferris Bueller’s Day Off would prove to 
                        be the last of the high school films that 
                        had made John Hughes a household name in 
                        the 1980s.

           INT. FARMHOUSE -- JOHN’S STUDY -- DAY [2001]

           John sits at his desk, reading Gibbs’s final page...

                                 GIBBS (V.O.)
                        After Ferris, he turned his attention to 
                        safer subjects for family fare-- 
                        mischievous kids... adorable babies... 
                        slobbery dogs...

           John spots a shadow moving outside his door.

                                 HUGHES
                        Tom?

           Tom, thus beckoned, looks into the Study and shakes his head.

                                 HUGHES
                        Nobody spoke with Mr. Gibbs?
                                (when Tom again shakes his head)
                        ...Thank you, Tom.

                                 GIBBS (V.O.)
                        The question... is why.

           EXT. GLENBROOK NORTH FOOTBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT [1966]

           16-Year-Old John stands amidst the packed stadium, soaking 
           up the energy of its innocent, happy CROWD...

                                 GIBBS (V.O.)
                        Why did the man who’d defied the adage, 
                        ‘You can never go home again’ fail to 
                        defy it twice?

           EXT. GLENBROOK NORTH FOOTBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT [1983]

           Michael and Molly and John, making mischief...

                                 GIBBS (V.O.)
                        Why did he retreat into formulaic 
                        comedies, before, in his later years... 
                        simply retreating into silence?

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. GLENBROOK NORTH FOOTBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT [1994]

           John, now in middle age, sits alone amidst the empty stands.

                                 GIBBS (V.O.)
                        Some maintained that his heart had simply 
                        closed after the films he made with Molly 
                        Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall... That 
                        he made it a point, after that, to avoid 
                        any subject that might require that he 
                        reveal any part of himself... ever again.

           John rises, taking a last look around...

                                 GIBBS (V.O.)
                        They suggest that in the end, Hollywood 
                        proved too harsh a place, too filled with 
                        the broken and the damaged and the weak 
                        and the sick, to provide the stable 
                        shoulder upon which John yearned to lean-- 
                        upon which he might have eased the weight 
                        of his difficult, fragile soul...

           As John leaves the stadium...

                                 GIBBS (V.O.)
                        Whatever the reason he left, many of 
                        John’s fans, the children of Reagan’s 
                        America, await his return like zealots 
                        awaiting their prophet’s rebirth.

                        They wait for him to observe them... to 
                        teach them about themselves... about the

                        simply biding his time?

           - John makes haste down a HALLWAY... KNOCKS on a door...

                                 GIBBS (V.O.)

                        chapters, did John Hughes simply... 
                        forget about them?

           The door opens, revealing Elliot Gibbs. Amiably--

                                 GIBBS
                        Why, John!

                                 HUGHES
                        Listen you sonofabitch, I’ve heard from 
                        Molly, I’ve heard from Michael, I’ve 
                        talked to Michelle, and not a single one 
                        of them has talked to you-- which means 
                        I’m the only person with intimate 
                        knowledge of these events, and I can tell 
                        you, you light it on fire, your book is 
                        too full of shit to burn. And what’s 
                        more, whoever your source is, if they 
                        even exist at all, they’re a self-
                        serving, bottom-feeding, duplicitous--

                        John?

           Hearing that-- John peers into the Author Suite... to see 
           that Elliot Gibbs is indeed playing host to Nancy. As John 
           pales, as his balance begins to fail him...
                                 GIBBS
                        Oh right. John: meet my bottom-feeding 
                        source. Bottom-feeding source: the 
                        singular John Hughes.
                                (then; observing the couple)
                        From the looks of things, I’d say it’s 
                        about time the two of you met.

           In response, John lowers himself to his knees... and falls 
           to the ground, as he and the film cut to--

                                                                BLACK.

           STAY IN BLACK

           Quiet... stillness... then, VOICES emerge from the silence... 
           DOZENS of them... a JUMBLE... growing louder and clearer and 
           cleaner and more urgent--

           P.O.V.: JOHN WAKES UP

           Hovering above “us”: a GROUP of 20- and 30somethings, 
           dressed as if they’re out on the town in the mid-1960s.

           One of these people we’ve seen before: an African-American 
           club manager in his 40s, who earlier thanked John for 
           procuring a hip band for his venue. His name is Scoop.

                                 SCOOP
                        Well look who’s back from the dead.

           It’s now that we notice: Tiffany is here. We’re on the floor 
           of the MUSIC CLUB we took her to-- but its lights are now 
           on, its band quiet, its party over.

                                 TIFFANY
                        John? I’m sorry, I, I-- have to go, they 
                        called an ambulance. If my mom finds out 
                        I was here...

           She winces-- I’m dead meat. Genuinely...

                                 TIFFANY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN (O.S.)
                        What? No. Don’t go. I’m okay. I don’t 
                        need an ambulance.

                                 SCOOP
                        Johnny, you ain’t okay.
                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN (O.S.)
                        This just happens to me sometimes. I have 
                        an overactive--

           As “we” try to sit up, we GROAN in pain.

           END P.O.V.

                        God damn it.

                                 SCOOP
                        That’s what I’m trying to tell you: you 
                        hit your head when you went down. And you 
                        don’t look so good-- I’m saying, even for 
                        you.

                                 TIFFANY
                        I’m sorry, John. You seem like a really 
                        nice guy.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Wait-- I’ll see you again, won’t I?

                                 TIFFANY
                                (hesitates)
                        ...Sure. I’ll see you in next-to-home-
                        room... Right?

           On John: stricken. On Tiffany: who gives this strange, 
           sensitive boy a last, affectionate look... before she turns 
           decisively away... before she flees as fast as she can, away 
           from this adventure and back to the comforting normality of 
           staid suburban wealth.

           INT. AUTHOR SUITE -- FOUR SEASONS CHICAGO -- DAY [2001]

           As in the flashback, John is sitting up, his head throbbing-- 

                                 NANCY
                        You’re alright. You’re back.
                                (takes his hand)
                        It’s okay. I’m here. And I’m not going 
                        anywhere.

           For a moment, nobody moves.

           Then, John turns to his wife, his brow beginning to furrow, 
           as he recalls the curious circumstances that brought them 
           here... 
           But he decides that now is not the right moment for questions 
           and focuses instead on “coming back”: he concentrates on his 
           breathing... inhale... exhale... and he closes his eyes...

           PRE-LAP: a CAR pulls up to a curb--

           I./E. SCOOP’S CAR / JOHN’S PARENTS’ HOUSE -- NIGHT [1966]

           Scoop has just pulled up in front of the Hughes house. Teen 
           Nancy is taking the liberty of ushering a still-woozy John 
           out of the passenger seat. Scoop gets out of his car, 
           crosses around to help with John, but--

                                 TEEN NANCY
                        It’s okay. I got him.

           Scoop looks from Nancy to John, skeptical.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        It’s okay. Thanks, Scoop.

                                 SCOOP
                                (nods)
                        ‘kay. Well. You take care of yourself. 
                        Try to stay up on both of them left feet.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        I will.

           John attempts a reassuring smile-- a middling effort. Scoop 
           doesn’t exactly buy it-- but of course, what can he really do?

           So, with a resigned nod, he climbs back into his car, starts 
           his engine, and shifts into gear. John watches him go. Once 
           his taillights have disappeared around a bend...

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        I’m-- I’m really okay. I’ve just-- I’ve 
                        got kind of a headache.

           Nancy clocks the Hughes house, where John’s parents are, 
           once again, engaged in a SCREAMING MATCH.

                                 TEEN NANCY
                        Well that’s no good for a headache. Why 
                        don’t you stay with us tonight?

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        ...With you, you mean.

           Nancy shrugs, smiles a bit.

                                 TEEN NANCY
                        Come on.
           She takes John’s arm. He puts up a little resistances... but 
           she tugs at him gently... and after a moment, he relents.

           As she helps him across the yard, up the steps, and into her 
           house... As the two teens, the two Zoids, recede gradually 
           into the background... 

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        You sure about this? I don’t wanna be any 
                        trouble.

                                 TEEN NANCY
                        Hey, for all you know, Trouble’s my 
                        middle name.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Uh-oh.

                                 TEEN NANCY
                                (laughs)
                        No, but really, it’s okay. I don’t mind. 
                        I’ll take care you, John Hughes... I’ll 
                        always take care of you...

           INT. AUTHOR SUITE -- BALCONY -- DAY [2001]

           John can once again stand... and can once again radiate 
           fury: at present, he leans on a balustrade, gazing out at a 
           choppy Lake Michigan.

           Nancy looks where her husband looks, as if hoping to read 
           his mind that way. From a few feet sway, Gibbs observes the 
           couple...

                                 NANCY
                        I guess... you must be pretty angry.

                                 HUGHES
                                (even)
                        I think I’d have to get through shock and 
                        denial first.

                                 GIBBS
                        Shock isn’t a stage of grief, John. It’s a 
                        stage of war.
                                (off the Hugheses’ icy glares)
                        But why don’t I see if I can brew us up a 
                        pot of coffee?

           Getting no response, Gibbs simply nods and moseys off. Beat.

                                 NANCY
                        ...It-- it isn’t easy to explain this.
                                 HUGHES
                        What could you possibly say that could 
                        make any sense out of why you’ve done 
                        what you’ve done?

                                 NANCY
                                (beat; then)
                        I don’t know. Probably nothing. But... I’m 
                        gonna say a couple of things, in any case.

           Hughes lowers his eyes, silently fuming.

                                 NANCY
                        The thing is, John-- You never talked 
                        about your work, not to me.

                                 HUGHES
                        That’s / not--

                                 NANCY
                        We talked about other things. The house. 
                        The boys. The weather... But never about 
                        your writing. Never about your films--

                                 HUGHES
                        ‘cause they didn’t matter. You’re what 
                        mattered to me; family mattered--

                                 NANCY
                                (holds up her hand)
                        And-- I believe-- that you believe-- that 
                        you believe that. And I’m not gonna-- 
                        “argue the point” with you... But-- if 
                        you’re gonna keep interrupting me, we’re 
                        gonna be here the rest of the day.

           The thought of that is enough to drive John INTO THE SUITE, 
           toward the wet bar, where he fixes himself a rather generous 
           drink. Nancy follows, a step behind but determined to say 
           her piece. She takes a breath, then patiently soldiers on...

                                 NANCY
                        The thing is-- since you didn’t ever talk 
                        about your work with / me--

                                 HUGHES
                        Please--

                                 NANCY
                        You assumed that, whatever you didn’t 
                        tell me, I didn’t know. I was just... the 
                        innocent little wife. Living her little 
                        domestic life. That’s what you thought.

                                 HUGHES
                        I--
                                 NANCY
                        And in a sense, you were right. But... I 
                        did know some things. Things you didn’t 
                        tell me. Things I didn’t even want to 
                        know.

                                 HUGHES
                        Things that weren’t even true!

                                 NANCY
                        Well it was true that you started to 
                        change around 1985. That was true. Don’t 
                        stand there and try to say that it’s not. 
                        You started to change, and... well let’s 
                        just say, I had a pretty clear picture as 
                        to why.

           To that, John has no retort.

                                 NANCY
                        And I guess I should have been happy when 
                        it happened. To finally have that-- that 
                        girl out of our lives. I knew how you 
                        felt about her--

                                 HUGHES
                        I--

                                 NANCY
                        I’m not saying you ever acted on it, but-- 
                        I knew how you felt. And I should-- I 
                        should’ve been glad having her gone, 
                        but...
                                (darkening)
                        What I started to learn was... that I 
                        couldn’t complete you. With her gone, you 
                        were just... incomplete. An incomplete who 
                        would barely even talk about the house 
                        anymore. Or the boys. Or the weather.

                          HUGHES
                                                      NANCY
           Nancy--
                                            Who’d barely look at his 
                                            own wife.

                                 HUGHES
                        That isn’t true.

                                 NANCY
                        I’m not saying I blame you, John. I 
                        don’t. I mean, you didn’t do anything 
                        wrong. Not really. In my accounting, the 
                        only sin you really committed was-- you 
                        married the wrong woman.

                                 HUGHES
                        Nancy--
                                 NANCY
                        You did.
                                (off John)
                        And I’m not even angry about it. Mostly, 
                        I just feel sorry for you because... 
                                (a beat)
                        ‘cause I did marry the right man.

           Now, John has to sit. Nancy goes to him...

                                 NANCY
                        Oh John... I knew on my wedding day that 
                        your heart wasn’t crying out my name. But 
                        I thought that was okay, I thought “that 
                        happens all the time.” People marry and 
                        then they grow together and then they 
                        learn to love, they...
                                (sighing a deep sigh)
                        They don’t build fictional towns where 
                        they love the right girl and the right 
                        girl loves them back and everything’s 
                        right as rain-- or I dunno, maybe they 
                        do, maybe they build those places deep 
                        down in their hearts, but they don’t 
                        build them on Earth. They don’t make them 
                        real. They don’t make Shermer.

           That changes the temperature in the room.

                                 HUGHES
                        So is that why you did this? You were 
                        jealous of my work? Or of... what you 
                        imagined between me and a teenage girl?

           Nancy takes a deep breath.

                                 NANCY
                        When you met Molly--

                                 HUGHES
                        Answer / me--

                                 NANCY
                        You moved away from the world. You moved 
                        away from me. And Jamie. And Jack.

                                 HUGHES
                        That’s / a lie.

                                 NANCY
                        You moved into Shermer full-time.

                                 HUGHES
                        No.
                                 NANCY
                        And everything that mattered to you, you 
                        took it with you. And anything that you 
                        couldn’t take with you, didn’t matter. So 
                        when Molly left... you were all alone. 
                        And I wanted to help you, but I couldn’t, 
                        my love didn’t seem to matter, because 
                        you thought you’d kept Shermer a secret 
                        from me. You thought I didn’t know the 
                        John in Shermer, didn’t love him, 
                        couldn’t love him. But I did. I love 
                        every John there is!

                                 HUGHES
                        Why did you do this?

                                 NANCY
                        How else could I make you see-- that I 
                        know everything, the worst things, and I 
                        love you still? That you don’t have to be 
                        alone? You never listened.

                                 HUGHES
                        Well. You have my attention now.

                                 NANCY
                        Yes. I have your attention now.

                                 HUGHES
                        Are you happy?

                                 NANCY
                        ...That’s not a condition I expect.

           Now, Gibbs re-enters, bearing a French press on a tray--

                                 GIBBS
                        This is from my personal stash; the beans 
                        are aged in Bourbon, so it doesn’t need 
                        any sugar, and I recommend it black. Mrs. 
                        Hughes? Can I interest you in some light 
                        sweet crude?
                                (when Nancy says nothing)
                        John?

           But John, too, says nothing... until his does, until he 
           rises to his feet and says...

                                 HUGHES
                        Mr. Gibbs, my wife had neither the 
                        visibility nor the expertise to report on 
                        the events described in your very 
                        colorful manuscript. If you publish--
                                 GIBBS
                        What? You’ll sue me? Put your wife on the 
                        stand? So you can expose her as a liar 
                        and a fake? I very much doubt that.

                                 NANCY
                        He won’t have to.

           The men turn to look at Nancy, who’s standing, and who, for 
           the first time, has drawn herself up to her full height.

                                 NANCY
                        I lied, Mr. Gibbs. Everything I said, I 
                        take it back. All of it. I retract it 
                        categorically. So if you publish now, 
                        you’ll be engaged in the commission of 
                        knowing, malicious slander.

           On John: in utter shock. He gapes at his wife, at this woman 
           whose preferred pastime is tatting doilies.

           As the totality of her plan comes into focus, he looks on 
           her with a new respect. A long-lost light begins to reappear 
           in his eyes...

                                 GIBBS
                        Mrs. Hughes, I’m afraid it’s not quite 
                        that simple--

                                 NANCY
                        Oh? ‘Cuz the lawyer I spoke with seemed 
                        to think it’s exactly that simple.

                                 GIBBS
                        But-- but you don’t-- that can’t-- I 
                        mean, HarperCollins...

                                 HUGHES
                        Mr. Gibbs, you seem lost for words. It’s 
                        a condition that becomes you.

           For a moment, Elliot Gibbs just stands there, sweating. 
           Then, he removes his pocket square and blots his reddening 
           brow. Finally, Nancy approaches the panicking reporter, 
           taking the coffee he didn’t know he was still holding, and 
           setting it safely down...

                                 NANCY
                        Now look: we’re prepared to match the 
                        advance you were paid on the book--

                                 HUGHES
                        What?!
                                 NANCY
                        I led him to what he wrote, not the other 
                        way around.
                                (to Gibbs)
                        We’ll match the advance, in exchange for 
                        an agreement from you not to publish or 
                        publicly discuss the subject of our 
                        family.

           Gibbs considers that for a moment. Sensing his contracting 
           range of options, he decides that those are indeed terms he 
           can accept.

           With a bit of a dazed look, he offers his hand-- which Nancy 
           shakes. Then, he turns to John-- who, after a moment’s 
           hesitation, shakes his hand as well.

                                 HUGHES
                        Well.

           Then, their business settled, the Hugheses head to the door, 
           John with his hand in the small of his wife’s back-- and 
           then, suddenly, he stops.

                                 HUGHES
                        Wait, what about Jamie? The article for 
                        Premiere?

                                 NANCY
                                (to John)
                        No, you see, that’s what I came to see 
                        Mr. Gibbs about, and it turns out--

                                 GIBBS
                        You dawdled a bit too long, I’m afraid. 
                        The April edition has already gone to 
                        bed.

           John nods, processing that...

                                 NANCY
                        It’s alright-- if Jamie’s really a 
                        writer, he’ll write something else. You 
                        can’t keep a writer from writing, that’s 
                        one thing I have learned. It’s the one 
                        thing that’s never changed about you in 
                        all the years I’ve known you.

                                 HUGHES
                                (taking her hand)
                        Not the only thing.

           And suddenly, Nancy has tears in her eyes... and she’s not 
           the only one.
           INT. TEEN NANCY’S BEDROOM -- DAWN [1966]

           16-Year-Old John is up before the sun. He’s sitting upright 
           in bed, composing a few lines in a moleskin notebook.

           Nancy, just waking up, watches the neighbor boy write for a 
           beat or two before letting him know she’s conscious.

                                 TEEN NANCY
                        Whatcha writin’?

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                                (hiding the notebook)
                        Oh, it’s-- it’s nothing.

                                 TEEN NANCY
                                (but she’s already seen it)
                        What is “Shermer, Illinois?”

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        I already told you, it’s nothing.

                                 TEEN NANCY
                        C’mon. I wanna know.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Why?

                                 TEEN NANCY
                        Cuz I do.

           John sighs, but she gives him a sweet smile-- the smile 
           unique to female persistence-- to which John now yields:

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        I dunno, it’s just-- it’s a place I made 
                        up. It’s like here. North of Chicago.

                                 TEEN NANCY
                                (sits up; encouragingly)
                        Uh-huh...

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN
                        Population 14k, give or take. And part of 
                        the town is Richies and part of it’s Zoids. 
                        It’s like-- You really wanna hear this?
                                (when she nods)
                        Well the only place where the Richies and 
                        the Zoids, where they overlap-- it’s at 
                        school, you see-- it’s at Shermer High. 
                        So Shermer High School-- well I guess it 
                        sort’ve becomes-- I mean-- it kind of 
                        becomes the center of pretty much 
                        everything.
           INT. JOHN’S CAR -- DUSK [2001] [MOVING]

           John and Nancy drive home together, through quiet, leafy 
           neighborhoods, through Northbrook, Skokie, Glencoe-- the 
           stages upon which they’ve lived their lives...

                                 TEEN NANCY (O.S.)
                        The high school’s the center of 
                        everything?

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN (O.S.)
                        For the kids. I mean, the adults don’t 
                        really matter all that much. They’re not 
                        really part of the town. I mean, they 
                        are, but-- they work, they sleep. But 
                        they don’t really notice stuff.

                                 TEEN NANCY (O.S.)
                                (getting that)
                        Right, sure.

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN (O.S.)
                        It’s the kids who really matter.

                                 TEEN NANCY (O.S.)
                                (as if tasting the idea on 
                                her tongue)
                        ...The kids...

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN (O.S.)
                        Yeah.

                                 TEEN NANCY (O.S.)
                        But... but don’t... I mean, one day, 
                        don’t the kids... don’t they grow up... 
                        Don’t the kids become the adults?

                                 16-YEAR-OLD JOHN (O.S.)
                        No, not really. Not in Shermer. You see, 
                        that’s kind of the thing. In Shermer...
                                (a beat)
                        In Shermer, you stay young.

           Outside the car, the ghosts of John’s characters play out 
           their stories in the north shore suburbs of Chicago...

           KEVIN MCCALISTER carries home his groceries in sagging 
           bags...

           FERRIS BUELLER drives Mr. Frye’s car, as the trio of teens 
           inside screams with undiluted joy...

           BENDER cuts across the football field, his fist raised high 
           in the air, his declaration of freedom, his declaration of 
           pride...
           And in front of the Glencoe Union Church stands JAKE RYAN, 
           with his red Porsche 944, waiting for SAM BAKER, who rushes 
           into his arms...

           John comes to a light. He watches as Sam kisses Jake... and 
           kisses him... suspended in time... forever joyous, forever 
           young.

           But John blinks hard, and the ghosts disappear like so much 
           smoke... just as hazy and ephemeral as a half-remembered 
           dream...

           Then, Johns turns to his wife, who is still there, whose 
           love for him is as real and lasting as the ancient, orange-
           red SUN that burns in the sky.

                                                              THE END.
