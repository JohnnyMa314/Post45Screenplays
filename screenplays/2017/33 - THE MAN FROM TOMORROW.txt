           A BLACK VOID

           Glassy, reflective like a TV screen.  A LOW RUMBLE as a RED
           SPHERE emerges at its center.  This could be a planet in
           space or a cell in a petri dish. 

                                 JFK (V.O.)
                        No man can fully grasp how far and
                        how fast we have come.

           PULL BACK reveals it's an eye. It blinks.  Keep PULLING BACK:

           - TO an alligator cooling off from the scorching sun in an
           acre of the Florida coastline swamp.

                                 JFK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        This is a breathtaking pace, and
                        such a pace cannot help but create
                        new ills as it dispels old: new
                        ignorance, new problems, new dangers.

           - THEN TO 100 acres of coastline, all covered with tall West
           Indian grass.   

                                 JFK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But if the history of our progress
                        teaches us anything, it is that man,
                        in his quest for knowledge and
                        progress, is determined and cannot
                        be deterred. 

           - THEN TO 144,000 acres of coastline, stamped with the 40
           most important space launch pads in the history of mankind.

           EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, CAPE CANAVERAL, FL - DAY (1961)

           A NASA globe logo, carved in stone, is prominently and proudly
           displayed at the front gate.  

                                 JFK (V.O.)
                        We choose to go to the Moon...

           PAD 39A, EMPTY - (1961)

           The most famous pad, at its creation, before the Apollo
           program's existance. It's an empty block of concrete.

                                 JFK (V.O.)
                        We choose to go to the Moon in this
                        decade and do the other things, not
                        because they are easy... 

           PAD 39A, APOLLO 11 - (1969)

           Now modified with the world's best technology, APOLLO 11
           stands taller than the Statue of Liberty, supported by a
           steel launch tower.  It's ready for launch.

                                 JFK (V.O.)
                        ...but because they are hard.
           It's a MEDIA CIRCUS. Thousands gather in the fields nearby. 
           Excitement fills the air as everyone knows they are about to
           witness history.  

           SATURN V BOOSTER ENGINES heat up, glowing orange.  The rumble
           turns to a ROAR as

           APOLLO 11 Blasts off!  The Saturn V rocket booster explodes
           with a thunderous force, climbing into the sky at Mach 1.

                                 JFK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Because that challenge is one that
                        we are willing to accept...

           The crowds CHEER loud enough to nearly drown out the rocket
           engine.  This continues throughout the entire launch. 

                                 JFK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        ...one we are unwilling to postpone...

           LOW EARTH ORBIT

           Apollo 11 detaches its Saturn V booster (Stage 1). The upper
           section (Stage 2) fires at full force further out into space. 

                                 JFK (V.O.)
                        ...and one we intend to win.

           THE MOON

           Apollo 11 launch module lands.  NEIL ARMSTRONG takes his
           famous "First Steps". History is made. The crowd's celebration
           is deafening. America officially won the Space Race! 

           MONTAGE, (1969-1972): Of each subsequent Apollo Moon mission
           and the astronauts exploring the Moon's surface.

           INTERCUT the first few missions with: astronauts at the White
           House; parades; coverage on "USA winning the Space Race";
           STOPS on DAN RATHER interviewing Saturn V creator WERNHER
           VON BRAUN with the lower third reading: "The Future of Space"

                                 WERNHER VON BRAUN
                        By the year 2000, we will undoubtedly
                        have a sizable operation on the Moon,
                        and I am certain we will achieve a
                        manned mission to Mars.  

           CHEERS QUIET at a steady pace as we INTERCUT the final few
           missions with: news on the Oil Crisis; long gas pump lines;
           inflation; Vietnam; NIXON addressing the nation. 

           THE MOON, APOLLO 17 MISSION - (1972) 

           ASTRONAUT GENE CERNAN stops walking to look around.  He gives
           a thumbs up. Cheers are barely audible.

                                 NIXON (V.O.)
                        In today's changing world, space
                        expenditures must take their proper
                        place in national priorities.

           Apollo 17 DISSOLVES away. The Moon is bare.  Complete silence. 
           PAD 39A, APOLLO 17, POST-LAUNCH - (1972)

           Cleanup and engineer crews keep working. The crowds are gone. 

           One by one, the crew DISSOLVES. Each member of NASA disappears
           like a fading memory, until the entire launch pad is EMPTY. 

           TIME LAPSE through changing days, changing seasons.  As years
           go by, the pad barely evolves.  We stop at - 

           PAD 39A, EMPTY - (2000)

           Unused. Wind WHISTLES. Dust gathers throughout the pad.  

           CHYRON:  No one since 1972 has been to the Moon...

           Quickly it turns to dusk, the sun a fiery RED looming behind
           Cape Canaveral on the horizon.  

           CHYRON:  No one has ever been to Mars...

           Night darkens to pure blackness, but for a RED blinking light
           atop the launch tower.  An alarm BLARES.

                                 SCOTT ANDERSON (PRE-LAP)
                        Servers down again!

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. PAYPAL, OFFICE, SAN JOSE - AFTERNOON

           Full pandemonium.  Workers scramble in a medium size Silicon
           Valley office. A blinking red alarm on a wall also BLARES.  

           CHYRON: 2000. PayPal. San Jose, CA.

           SCOTT ANDERSON, an overwhelmed programmer, frantically types
           at his computer terminal. He has no idea what he's doing. 

                                 SCOTT ANDERSON
                        The accounts are just gone!  I don't - 

           A HAND ROLLS Scott away from his terminal.  ELON MUSK, 28,
           rolls into view.  Elon is in complete command of the computer.  

           He doesn't speak.  He is in a trance. Elon operates like a
           logic processor.  His mind assesses solutions to problems
           faster than most see the problem. Call it "Musk Land".

           "MUSK LAND":  The blank account entries; The bandwidth
           measurements on a wall monitor;  The computer code next to
           him;  In an instant, he diagnoses and solves the issue. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You forgot to reduce the output
                        bandwidth before the server crashed. 

                                 SCOTT ANDERSON
                        I...forgot to reduce the output
                        bandwidth before the server crashed. 
                        Shit!  Sorry, Elon. 
           Elon codes at a furious, but controlled pace.  Beside him is
           his personal bowl of RED SKITTLES. He takes a scoop and holds
           it up for Scott, who is too stressed to eat. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Your loss...I'll check open nodes
                        for a breach. Go to the server room
                        and reset the parameters on my mark.

           PETER THIEL, co-owner of PayPal and all around reliable guy,
           saunters into the office amidst the chaos.  He waves, shakes
           hands, pats guys' backs. He's beloved at Paypal.

           Scott exits as Peter approaches. He looks over Elon's
           shoulder, swaying on either foot. Elon can feel it. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Stop lurching.  I hate that.

                                 PETER THIEL
                        Another breach?  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Focus on the signal, not the sound.
                        It's not actually a bandwidth issue. 
                        The signal points to...a coding error.

                                 PETER THIEL
                        Uh-huh. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Vision, Peter. EBay is in our sights! 
                        I can smell victory. 

                                 PETER THIEL
                        I can smell that shirt. CNBC is today. 
                        You couldn't have changed at home? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I haven't been home since yesterday. 
                            (stares at screen)
                        Found the error! What code is Max
                        using? Unix or Sanskrit?

                                 PETER THIEL
                        Justine is going to kill you if you're
                        late to your flight. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I own the plane.  I won't be late.   

           Elon picks his head up and sees in the BOARD ROOM that MAX
           LEVCHIN, another Paypal co-founder, is talking with someone. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Who's Max in there with? 

                                 PETER THIEL
                            (he just said)
                        CNBC. For our PayPal Mafia profile
                        piece.  She's been here all week. 
                                 ELON MUSK
                        Why is she talking to Max?  
                            (multi-tasking)
                        Okay, Scott!  Do it!

           A switch FLIPS.  The alarm SHUTS DOWN.  Order restored. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Breach clear...See?  All better.  

                                 PETER THIEL
                        I bow to your genius.  How ever do
                        you do it? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I read a lot of books. 

           Elon gets up and heads to the 

           BOARD ROOM -- to disrupt Max mid-interview with SARAH LACEY,
           an enthusiastic CNBC upstart with roots in Silicon Valley.   

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Max? Why is our system still coding
                        in two different languages?  

           Max looks around the room for defense. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        You're the only Max in here. 

                                 MAX LEVCHIN
                        To...to safeguard accounts.  I had
                        to rerout the uplink codes using a
                        Unix dummy node. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        They're safe.  So, why don't you go
                        ahead and fix that code...now.

           Elon's stocky, 6'1" frame intimidates Max, who quickly leaves. 

                                 SARAH LACEY, CNBC
                        So...you guys seem very - 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Driven. Inspiring.  Attractive?

                                 SARAH LACEY, CNBC
                        Anxious.  Stressed.  Overworked.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Business is Darwinian. It takes
                        sacrifice to endure progress.  That's
                        how we survived the dot com bubble. 
                        People here remember that, even if
                        they sometimes don't show it. 
                            (beat)
                        Let's do this in my office. 

           ELON'S OFFICE -- Sarah studies his office, learning her
           subject. 
           A framed Iron Man #1 comic, a framed picture of his wife,
           and a framed poster of Neil Armstrong in his astronaut suit.

                                 SARAH LACEY, CNBC
                        Neil Armstrong...Didn't expect that.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Who's not a fan of Neil Armstrong?

                                 SARAH LACEY, CNBC
                        You're a techy, banker guy.  I fail
                        to see the connection. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'm not a...banker guy.  I'm an
                        engineer at heart.  It's the closest
                        thing to real magic in this world. 

                                 SARAH LACEY, CNBC
                        Neil Armstrong wasn't an engineer. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        He was an adventurer.  

                                 SARAH LACEY, CNBC
                        Is internet banking your adventure?  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Life is my adventure. 

           Through his interior window, Scott holds up a large pad with
           the words: "Crash Again. Help me." Elon waves him away from
           the window before Sarah sees.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Listen, is there any way to make
                        this quick?  

                                 SARAH LACEY, CNBC
                        Why?  Big date tonight? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                            (yes)
                        My honeymoon.  

                                 SARAH LACEY, CNBC
                        Oh, shit.  Yes.  Let's see...

           Sarah GRABS a recorder from her bag as Elon STICKS HIS HEAD
           out the door to whisper yell coding commands to Scott.  She
           waits for him to finish and sit down before recording. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Sorry - my mind is always in multiple
                        places at once.  My context switching
                        penalty is higher now than as a kid.  

           In the spotlight, Elon speaks quickly and tends to ramble.

                                 SARAH LACEY, CNBC
                        Let's start with a quick bio. Outside
                        of Silicon Valley, you're an unknown. 
                                 ELON MUSK
                        Well you know my story so I don't - 
                            (off her blank look)
                        A quick bio.  Sure.  Immigrant from
                        South Africa; left home at 17;
                        graduated Upenn '95; left my P.H.D.
                        program at Stanford; with no money,
                        started Zip2 with my brother up the
                        street. Sold it. Made Paypal. Typical
                        American Dream.

                                 SARAH LACEY, CNBC
                        Was that always the pursuit? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Absolutely!  Even as a kid I knew
                        America was the land of opportunity -
                        where real innovation happens.  Henry
                        Ford.  Thomas Edison -

                                 SARAH LACEY, CNBC
                            (connecting dots)
                        - Neil Armstrong.  Got it.  Still
                        doesn't explain why you quit Stanford
                        to start an internet bank.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I left. I could've gone back.  I was
                        trying to solve the renewable energy
                        problem with ultracapacitors. 
                        Revolutionary stuff for electric
                        cars. They deliver the same energy
                        over one hundred times faster than -

           Through the window, Elon sees the red blinking light RETURN -
           another problem he's got to hurry back to.  He refocuses. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        - Anyway, I left when I realized I
                        could have an immediate impact on
                        the internet. It's low bandwidth.
                        Just need a PC and some sweat equity. 

           She notes his shift in enthusiasm for the internet. 

                                 SARAH LACEY, CNBC
                        Well, after you sell Paypal to Ebay
                        I'm sure you'll have more time to go
                        back to your other adventures.   

                                 ELON MUSK
                        That's true.  Possibly. 
                            (then, realizing)
                        Wait, what?! I'm not selling Paypal. 
                        Who said that? 

                                 SARAH LACEY, CNBC
                        Valleywag blogs.  Like every day. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Blogs.  Ugh. My wife blogs.  I don't
                        understand them...What did they say?  
                                 SARAH LACEY, CNBC
                        There are rumblings Ebay is increasing
                        cash flow to buy you guys out. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Really? Interesting.  I believe they'd
                        try. But I'll never sell. We're in a
                        race to the top!  And I will win.  

                                 SARAH LACEY, CNBC
                        They also said an inside source told
                        them your aggressive growth "to the
                        top" is to drive up the asking price. 
                        Just rumblings? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Just rumblings...

           Elon seethes.  Sarah senses she touched a nerve.  She prods.

                                 SARAH LACEY, CNBC
                        Are they?  You didn't seem as giddy
                        about internet banking as you did
                        about ultracapacitors.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Which do you find more exciting: 
                        internet banks or electric cars?

                                 SARAH LACEY, CNBC
                        I didn't start an internet bank.

           LATER, MAIN FLOOR -- Sarah exits. Elon impatiently stands by
           his office door, gritting his teeth.  He looks around the
           office. Who rumbled?!  Peter opens the front door for her. 

           Sarah leaves. Then Elon shouts. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Executive meeting!  

           All the executives quickly flock in.  They know this routine
           rather well. 

           BOARD ROOM -- Elon sits at the head of the table.    

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Whoever's #1 rules the jungle,
                        dictates terms. As of today, Ebay is
                        the lion.  That makes us the zebras. 
                        If we don't move faster, we're dinner. 
                        That is why we must increase growth. 

                                 PETER THIEL
                        Aren't we growing fast enough?

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Growth is never too fast.
                            (to group)
                        From now on we are no longer using
                        Unix. Period. End of transmission. 
           The group reacts in shock, Max the most incensed. 

                                 MAX LEVCHIN
                        Changing O.S. could cripple us!  We
                        need time to adjust. Microsoft just - 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        - Microsoft data-center just keeps
                        productivity going so we don't lose
                        12 fucking hours for hairballs.  I
                        told you the code to use.  But you
                        didn't listen and our directory
                        crashed. You need to get on our page. 

                                 MAX LEVCHIN
                        You mean your page.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        The correct page.  It doesn't matter
                        whose page it is.  Understand? 

           Max backs down, no challenge to Elon. Peter feels for him.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Meeting adjourned. Back to work. 

           ELON'S OFFICE -- Peter enters as Elon packs up.

                                 PETER THIEL
                        What was that about?  Max is right,
                        ya know. Unix is slower, but it's
                        more secure...Are you even listening?

           No, he isn't.  Peter gives up and leaves, but then - 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        There are rumblings of a sale. Here.
                        Rumblings. I didn't rumble. Who did?

                                 PETER THIEL
                        There are worse things than rumors
                        of you making a billion dollars.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I was already rich from Zip2. This
                        was to do something important.  To
                        make a positive difference in
                        humanity's future.

                                 PETER THIEL
                        With a billion dollars, you could
                        make a lot of positive differences. 

           Elon stops packing to make his point very clear. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'll never sell, Peter. It's not how
                        I'm built. I was too young to be CEO
                        at Zip2 and the board fucking sold
                        it. I'm not selling again. Ever.  
                                 PETER THIEL
                        I know. 

           MAIN OFFICE

           Scott catches Elon leaving to give him a bottle of wine.  He
           is a loyal soldier.  Peter is quick behind them.

                                 SCOTT ANDERSON
                        Congrats again.  And try to relax!

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Thanks, buddy. I'll certainly try.  

           EXT. PAYPAL, OFFICE, SAN JOSE - DUSK

           Elon walks with his belongings to his car, Peter in tow. 

                                 PETER THIEL
                        If the SEC finds out about the breach - 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        - Fuck the SEC.  We're at war with
                        Ebay.  Winning is all that matters. 

                                 PETER THIEL
                        This isn't war.  It's just business.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Business is war. And in any war there
                        are winners and losers. I won't lose.    

                                 PETER THIEL
                        At what cost? 

           Elon finds his car - a MCLAREN F1. He gets in. It's covered
           in dings and scratches from everday use.  He calms Peter. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        None, I promise. The servers will
                        hold.  Do you not believe me?  

                                 PETER THIEL
                            (rephrases problem)
                        It should've been a group decision.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'm the CEO.  It's my decision.  

           Elon waves as he drives off, leaving Peter in the dust.  

           INT. PAYPAL, OFFICE, SAN JOSE - DUSK

           A dismayed Peter reenters the office.  Max approaches.  

                                 MAX LEVCHIN
                        Peter, it's time.  Call them.  

                                 PETER THIEL
                        I know...  
           EXT. TARMAC, SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

           Elon boards a Dessault Falcon 900 PRIVATE JET.  HIS JET.   

           INT. ELON'S PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

           Elon sits in a leather recliner and OPENS his laptop.

           As fast as it's opened, it's CLOSED by the hand of his
           frustrated wife JUSTINE, 28, who stands over him.  Dirty
           blonde. Fantasy writer. Former model. Way out of his league. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        You promised me no work. 

           Justine struggles to keep calm and not ruin their honeymoon
           in the first two minutes by throwing his laptop at a wall.   

                                 JUSTINE (CONT'D)
                        You said, "J, I know I've been a
                        terrible husband lately, but when we
                        go on our honeymoon, I'll make it up
                        to you and romance you all day."

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I did say that, yes. And I'm sorry. 
                        And I will stop being a terrible
                        husband. And I will romance you all
                        day... After I finish this one thing.

           He reopens the laptop slowly, purposefully antagonizing her.
           Justine waits. He doesn't stop. She lets out a loud GROAN. 

           INT. PAYPAL, OFFICE, SAN JOSE - NIGHT

           Scott is the only worker left at the office.  He jams out to
           The Eagles on full blast.   

           INT. ELON'S PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

           Elon continues typing away on his laptop. We can't see what
           he's doing. Justine's blood boils. Elon pokes his head over
           the laptop to give her a Cheshire grin.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I swear. This is super important. 
                        Almost there...and...done!

           INT. PAYPAL, OFFICE, SAN JOSE - NIGHT

           Scott jams away when Peter enters. Odd. Then Max enters.  

                                 SCOTT ANDERSON
                        It's 10:30pm on a Friday. What are
                        you guys up to? Secret office party?

           INT. ELON'S PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

           Elon turns around his computer and presses ENTER. 
           He made a VIDEO COLLAGE titled "Happy Honeymoon" of their
           lives: at college together; at crappy Zip2 office; showing
           the engagement ring; with the McLaren; their wedding; etc.

           INT. PAYPAL, OFFICE, SAN JOSE - NIGHT

           Peter calmly stands over Scott. Other BOARD MEMBERS enter. 

                                 PETER THIEL
                        Go home, Scott.  Have a nice weekend.  

           They gather in the board room. Scott finally gets it.

           INT. ELON'S PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

           Justine cries to the video. Elon waits for praise.  It ends
           with the note: "To my beautiful new wife.  I love you". 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'm trying to be better.

                                 JUSTINE
                        You're succeeding.  

                                 PILOT (O.S.)
                        This is your Captain speaking.  At
                        this time we ask you to please turn
                        off any cellular devices. Thank you.

           Elon shuts down his laptop.  Then he pulls out his phone.

           EXT. PAYPAL, OFFICE, SAN JOSE - NIGHT

           Scott rushes to his car and immediately dials Elon. It RINGS.  

                                 SCOTT ANDERSON
                        C'mon.  Pick up. 

           INT. PAYPAL, BOARD ROOM, SAN JOSE - NIGHT

           The board takes a vote.  Everyone is tense.

                                 MAX LEVCHIN
                        All in favor?

           An overwhelming amount raise their hand.  

           INT. ELON'S PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

           Elon POWERS DOWN his cell phone.  They buckle up.

                                 PILOT (O.S.)
                        Ready for departure. 

           The plane ROLLS down the tarmac.

           EXT. PAYPAL, OFFICE, SAN JOSE - NIGHT

           Scott hangs up and redials.  Goes straight to voicemail. 
                                 SCOTT ANDERSON
                        Elon, it's Scott. You need to come
                        back right now. Peter fucked you!    

           Far in the BACKGROUND, the jet is in the sky. He missed him.  

           EXT. SOUTH AFRICAN SAFARI - DAY

           Elon and Justine ride in a Jeep, on a guided tour. Elon looks
           like a geeky Steve Irwin: hat, cargo shorts, zinc nose. 
           Justine hands him malaria pills. He refuses.  The JEEP STOPS.

           THEY SEE A ZEBRA, stopping to graze.  A beautiful sight.  

           The ground RUMBLES. Out from the tall grass, a LION POUNCES! 
           The zebra RUNS for his life!  

           He's no match as the lion chases him down and SINKS HIS TEETH
           into the zebra's neck.  The kill is shrouded by the grass.  

           As the lion devours its prey, it takes notice of the Jeep,
           and Elon.  ELON LOCKS EYES WITH THE LION. Kindred spirits. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           BLOOD

           Drawn by a mosquito. Its snout grows red until - SLAP!  A
           hand. REVEAL Elon killed the mosquito on his neck. 

           INT./EXT. GAME RESERVE BUNGALOW, SOUTH AFRICA - DUSK

           Elon wanders the bungalow trying to get a signal. None.  He
           gives up and goes to his wife.   

           Justine stands at the balcony overlooking the reserve.  She
           looks like the cover of a romance novel.  He embraces her. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        What was it like growing up here?  I
                        can't imagine young Elon Musk.   

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Imagine me, only shorter.

                                 JUSTINE
                        I mean your life here. You never
                        talk about it.

           He looks out into the jungle. Kill or be killed. He IMAGINES
           A LION roaming the plains. The lion then VANISHES.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Imagine this, only with people.  

           She holds him, nurturing. But he's not emotional about it.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        It's fine.  You bury the pain and
                        move on. Just took time. That's all. 
                        And a wonderful wife by my side. 

           He kisses her.  His love for her never stronger.   
           INT. ELON'S PRIVATE JET - AFTERNOON

           Elon looks out the window, Justine resting on his shoulder.
           Very relaxed. Very happy.  Suddenly, he grows nauseous. 

           EXT. TARMAC, SAN FRANCISCO - AFTERNOON

           He exits and breathes in the refreshing air.  It helps but
           not as much as he needed.  He looks sick.  Maybe he is? 

           Elon TURNS ON his phone.  41 missed calls.  37 voicemails. 
           750 unread emails. Elon stops dead in his tracks.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        What the...

           INT. PAYPAL, BOARD ROOM, SAN JOSE - AFTERNOON

           Elon yells at all the board members.  He's sweaty, pale. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        ...Fuck?!  Because of fucking Unix?! 

                                 PETER THIEL
                        It is the feeling of this board that
                        we go in another direction. In
                        infrastructure... 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Unix!  

                                 PETER THIEL
                        ...and in management.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Guys, there are important things
                        that need to happen at this company.
                        If I'm not CEO, they won't.
                            (pleads)
                        What about our vision, Peter?  To
                        change the banking world forever.  

                                 PETER THIEL
                        I don't care about changing banking. 
                        I don't care about changing the world. 
                        Elon, I only care about this company,
                        the employees, and our shareholders.

           The shareholders?!  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It was you that fucking rumbled... 

                                 PETER THIEL
                        I had a choice between our investment
                        or your "vision".  

           Elon is speechless at his betrayal. 

                                 PETER THIEL (CONT'D)
                        It's not rocket science.  
                                 (MORE)

                        You build a successful product, you
                        leverage it to a larger competitor,
                        you cash out. This is how it's always
                        done.  You're a genius, Elon.  But
                        there are lots of other geniuses in
                        Silicon Valley and they all get how
                        it works. You knew this.  Somewhere
                        you lost sight of it. I'm sorry. 

           Everything he's built, gone. Elon is completely defeated. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Sorry?  You're selling my company....  

                                 PETER THIEL
                        This was a group decision.

                                 MAX LEVCHIN
                        We just weren't on your page. 

           His voice is weak, with only enough strength to say - 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Fuck you, Max. 

           EXT. MUSK CONDO, DRIVEWAY, PALO ALTO - NIGHT

           Elon pulls up. He can't quite exit the car. His ego
           pulverized.  His vision challenged.  He is white as a ghost. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Fuck!

           FRONT PORCH -- Elon shakes, barely holds himself up on the
           railing. He is sick. Before opening the door, he PASSES OUT. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA - DAY (1982)

           Dirt roads.  Dilapidated houses.  Poverty.  Ruin.  South
           African apartheid militants in the streets with machine guns.  

           The old look weary. The young look jaded.  They play soccer
           in a dirt field as military jeeps drive by.  They don't pay
           it any mind.  This is real, everyday life here. 

           INT. PRETORIA LIBRARY - AFTERNOON (1982)

           Inside a beaten down library is just one lonely little boy,
           ELON, 10, with a stack of books. He reads a model rocket
           book, jotting ideas into his NOTEBOOK he titled "MASTER PLAN". 

           Each page has various ideas and drawings: spaceships, electric
           cars, Neil Armstong, NASA logos, Elon in a rocketship flying
           to Mars (he wrote labels for himself and Mars).

           The LIBRARIAN WHISTLES, points at the clock.  Closing time. 
           Reluctantly, Elon closes his book and packs up. 
           EXT. MUSK CONDO, PALO ALTO - NIGHT (PRESENT)

           Justine opens the front door.  She finds Elon passed out on
           the porch.  Their Yorkie Terrier, HOBBES, jumps on Elon,
           wimpering as he licks his master's face.  She dials 9-1-1.

           EXT. PRETORIA STREETS - AFTERNOON (1982)

           Elon trudges along the dreary landscape, through the desolate
           city streets. Each face he passes scares him.  

           He eyes a group of BULLIES across the street.  He keeps his
           head down, walking faster. Then one of them YELLS. Elon RUNS!   

           EXT. MUSK CONDO, PALO ALTO - NIGHT (PRESENT)

           An AMBULANCE races out of their driveway with Elon in tow. 

           EXT. PRETORIA STREETS - AFTERNOON (1982)

           Elon's too slow. One BULLY grabs him. Others PUNCH him
           furiously. This isn't bullying. They are hospitalizing him! 
           They pick him up and THROW Elon down a flight of stairs.  

           SLOW MOTION as Elon's lifeless body HANGS in the air,
           releasing his comics and books.  They hang with him. 

           TIGHT ON his Iron Man Comic. The cover depicts Iron Man
           standing proud atop a pile of defeated enemies.  

           INT. PRETORIA HOSPITAL, ICU - DAY (1982)

           Elon is bloodied, unconscious, and on oxygen.  His brother
           KIMBAL, 9, stays by his side.  He puts Elon's Iron Man comics
           and his Master Plan notebook on the bedside table.  

                                 ERROL MUSK (O.S.)
                        Don't you feel sorry for him.

           Elon's jingoist father, ERROL MUSK, appears in the doorway. 
           A mountain of a man, pained by years of machismo, alimony,
           and failure. He doesn't bother with Kimbal, only weak Elon.   

                                 ERROL MUSK (CONT'D)
                        He's gotta learn to be a man - fight
                        back - if he's ever gonna survive.  

           He walks closer to Elon's side, speaking to his beaten child. 

                                 ERROL MUSK (CONT'D)
                        There are winners and there are
                        losers.  Next time, win. 

           Disgusted with his son, Errol leaves.  Kimbal then taps Elon. 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        He's gone.  

           Elon opens his eyes and gingerly pulls down his oxygen mask.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        What an asshole. 
           The two kids laugh together.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. SEQUOIA HOSPITAL, ICU - DAY (PRESENT)

           Elon awakens to a familiar face at his hospital bedside.  

                                 KIMBAL MUSK (O.S.)
                        How do you keep surviving? 

           KIMBAL MUSK, now 27, smiles, expecting the good news. Kimbal
           is the polar opposite of Elon.  Charming, relaxed, social.

                                 KIMBAL MUSK (CONT'D)
                        You didn't take the malaria medication
                        on safari.  You contract the deadliest
                        malaria strain on Earth.  And yet,
                        not only will you live, you're gonna
                        be perfectly fine.  Just how? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Better to be lucky than smart.  

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Only an idiot would say that.  

           Justine enters to see him awake. She kisses him repeatedly. 
           Elon enjoys it, but doesn't want any sympathy. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'll be okay.  By this time next
                        month, I'll be climbing Everest. 

           EXT. COLORADO MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DAY

           HIKERS trek up a snowy mountain trail.  This is no Everest.  

           CHYRON: 6 months later. 

           TRAIL APEX -- The FIRST HIKER to the top enjoys a victory
           protein bar. Kimbal's next. He sits, relieved it's over.  

           He remembers something and looks over the edge to find Elon
           much farther down, climbing ever so slowly. 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Don't push yourself. We'll come down!

           Elon's too tired to yell back.  He gives Kimbal the finger. 

           LATER -- Kimbal sits, waiting.  Elon finally makes it up. He
           stomps on the mountain top right in Kimbal's face. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Fuck you.  I can do anything. 

           Elon soaks in the stunning view. Malaria left Elon thin and
           frail these past months, but it did not weaken his spirit. 
                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        I haven't felt this free in a long
                        time. I go from Stanford to Zip2 - 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        - 2 days of Stanford.  2 days - 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        - And then right into Paypal.  And
                        now? I'm free.
                            (hollers)
                        I can do anything!!!

           He overexcites himself and vomits.  

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Even that, apparently.  

           Elon stands back up, proving his toughness.

                        You must still really hate Peter. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I hate the reasoning by analogy that
                        infects people like Peter much more. 
                        "I do X and not Y because that's how
                        it's always been done." Silicon Valley
                        was filled with dreamers, but nobody
                        takes risk anywhere anymore, even
                        when opportunity stares them in the
                        face.  People have become lemmings.

                        Just because you thought they could've
                        changed the banking world - 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        - They could've -

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        - Doesn't mean you're right.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        - I was. If people can't see a better
                        future on their own, I have to show
                        it to them. Or build them a path
                        myself. And it has to be actually
                        important. Next time...

           Elon stares intensely out toward the setting red sun.

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        So what is the next adventure? 

           Elon ponders that as he TROTS down the mountain.  First. 

           INT. KIMBAL'S MOUNTAIN LODGE, COLORADO - NIGHT

           It's a cozy cottage. Kimbal and Justine, now 6 months
           pregnant, prepare dinner. He changed clothes. Elon didn't.
           He sits at the table deep in thought. Kimbal talks at him.
                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Solar?  You could invest in solar. 
                        Too boring...Electric cars, then? 
                        You never shut up about electric
                        cars since your 2 days at Stanford.

                                 JUSTINE
                        How about nothing? We have enough
                        money to retire on our own island.  

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        E always has some crazy new idea
                        running in his head. Look at him. 
                        He hasn't moved in a half hour. 

           Elon's head tilts at an odd angle whenever he thinks deeply. 
           He stares at a dinosaur poster on Kimbal's wall.  

                                 KIMBAL MUSK (CONT'D)
                        He's got kind of a Forrest Gump thing
                        going, don't you think?

           "MUSK LAND": dinosaurs; Ice Age; asteroid attack; Armageddon;
           Earth destroyed; the Moon; Mars... Then out of nowhere - 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Do you think we're prepared for an
                        asteroid attack?  Or some other kind
                        of extinction event? 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Hypotheticals after dinner.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Forgive me, I nearly died. I'm
                        thinking about mortality at the
                        moment.  What would we do?  

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Die.  We would die. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Exactly.  We would die.  So not
                        knowing what that extinction event
                        might be, wouldn't it be important
                        that we are a multiplanetary species?  

           She stops setting the table and stares at him.  Seriously?
           Elon, now excited, finishes setting the table for her.

                                 JUSTINE
                        It's important we live on Mars? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Long term, absolutely!  It's one of
                        the most important achievement in
                        the history of mankind.  Governments
                        should invest some amount to it -
                        say, 1% of our resources.  It's less
                        critical right now than health care,
                        but more than, say, cosmetics. 
                                 JUSTINE
                        You'd miss my lipstick. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I love your lipstick.  But your lips
                        or Mars?  Not that difficult.  

           She kisses his cheek, leaving a lipstick imprint on him. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        You're not going to Mars, baby. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Why not? Why can't I go to Mars?  Or
                        rather, as of today, when can I go?  

                                 JUSTINE
                        You're not going to Mars!

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        When is NASA going to Mars?  

                                 JUSTINE
                        K, don't encourage him, please.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'm sure it's on their website.

           Kimbal hops on his desktop near the couch and looks.

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Actually, no.  It isn't. No missions
                        on the manifest.  No rocket tests. 

           Elon, in disbelief, pulls Kimbal back from the computer. 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK (CONT'D)
                        E, wait. You can't - 

           Elon shoots him a look.  Don't say, "you can't".

                                 KIMBAL MUSK (CONT'D)
                        What I meant was, before you do
                        something very...Elon...why don't
                        you learn more, please? 
                            (Elon isn't listening)
                        And that's exactly what you're doing.  

           Kimbal loses Elon to his brain. In seconds, 19 articles and
           websites are open.  He's reading them all, including NASA's
           website which has no mention of Mars.  

                                 KIMBAL MUSK (CONT'D)
                        I hated when you did this shit with
                        our encyclopedias.  Hey, Jackass! 

           Elon pulls out of his trance to listen to his brother.  

                                 KIMBAL MUSK (CONT'D)
                        If NASA isn't going, there must be a
                        really good reason.  
                                 ELON MUSK
                        And if there isn't? 

           He stops on one website in particular.  The home page is all
           red with two words in the middle: Mars Society.

           EXT. VALLEY VIEW SUN FOUNDATION - NIGHT

           Elon's McLaren peels into the valet.  Elon exits in a tuxedo.
           Justine stuns in a ruby red dress.

           INT. VALLEY VIEW SUN FOUNDATION, BALLROOM - NIGHT

           Inside is equal parts bar mitzvah and airport conference.
           Men wear department store suits. Women wear casual sweaters.  

                                 JUSTINE
                        We look like Bond Villains. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Timothy Dalton Bond Villains at best. 

           Society Chairman ROBERT ZUBRIN, 50, speaks at a podium with
           a 90's high school video projector setup.  His voice booms.  

                                 ROBERT ZUBRIN
                        NASA has lost the will. If they won't
                        go to Mars, then someone here will. 

           He receives a rousing APPLAUSE - Elon the most enthusiastic.
           The projector then plays a CGI SIMULATION of a capsule on
           approach to Mars.  Elon lights up. 

           LATER, TABLES -- Dinner is served. Everyone eats. Several
           big wigs include JEFF BEZOS, RICHARD BRANSON, JOHN CARMAC. 
           All have a great time. Except Elon. He's bored and confused.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You don't see any computers or
                        business plans open. No one working
                        in groups. Why are they just...eating?

                                 JUSTINE
                        Hunger. It's only a theory.  

                                 CHRIS THOMPSON (O.S.)
                        Interesting theory. 

           CHRIS THOMPSON, a well groomed rocket scientist, pipes in. 

                                 CHRIS THOMPSON (CONT'D)
                        Nobody believes we're actually going
                        to Mars in our lifetimes.  So people
                        come to talk shop, network, and eat.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Was Zubrin right? Did everyone at
                        NASA simply lose the will? 
                                 CHRIS THOMPSON
                        Space exploration hasn't progressed
                        since Apollo. We're still using parts
                        from the 60s. The Shuttle has been a
                        disaster. We pay the Russian Soyuz
                        to get to the I.S.S. Mars?? We can't
                        get back to the Moon. Forget Mars.  

           Elon's heard enough.  He gets up and beelines to  

           ZUBRIN'S TABLE -- Elon purposefully COUGHS to get everyone's
           attention.  The whole table turns and stares at him. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Why isn't NASA going to Mars?  

           The table includes MICHAEL GRIFFIN, 30s, military pilot
           material.  He is comfortable being the spokesman. 

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        It's more complicated than just going
                        or not going. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It really isn't.  Either we have the
                        technology or the ability to develop
                        it now or we don't.  Either we can
                        go to Mars or we can't.  Can we?

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        Theoretically?  Yes. Actually?  No. 
                        It's just not a concern right now.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It's the entire planet's concern!

                                 ROBERT ZUBRIN
                        Michael, do you know this man? 

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        That's Elon Musk.  He made Paypal. 
                            (shaking Elon's hand)
                        Michael Griffin, Orbital Sciences.

                                 ROBERT ZUBRIN
                        Michael is the next NASA Admin in
                        waiting. Some would argue nobody
                        knows more about space travel.

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        I've argued that many times myself. 

                                 ROBERT ZUBRIN
                        So you're a banker?

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Classically trained as an engineer. 
                        Why isn't someone going to Mars? 

                                 ROBERT ZUBRIN
                        Politics.  Bureaucracy.  Technology.
                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                            (cutting the bullshit)
                        Money. Lots of it. Space is expensive.
                        Governments and Big Aerospace can
                        afford it. People can't.  

           INT. UNIVERSITY BOOKSTORE - DAY

           Elon goes through the engineering section with purpose,
           putting textbook after textbook into his cart.  

           LATER, CASHIER -- Justine puts one book on the conveyor. 
           Elon has 12! Justine isn't shocked. He'll read all of them.  

           INT. MUSK CONDO, PALO ALTO - NIGHT

           Elon speed reads a stack of books on his half of their SPLIT
           DESK.  He looks just as he did as a kid. Justine, now almost
           at her due date, writes on her side.  Both work quietly.  

                                 JUSTINE
                        Ahh, this monologue's killing me! E,
                        you have no idea how hard this is. 

           Elon lifts his head up from one of his books. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Is it as hard as this rocket science
                        thing?  Cuz, ya know, rocket science.  

                                 JUSTINE
                        Point taken.  I'll shut up now.

           FAST FORWARD -- Justine eventually exits; Elon works through
           the night; sifts through various manuals; puts finished books
           in a pile; plays video games; reads more until sunrise.

           Every book's in the finished pile. His phone RINGS ON SPEAKER. 
           As soon as the person picks up, Elon starts. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        In your opinion, can liquid propulsion
                        be cooled enough to carry a rocket
                        into LEO without adding .75 tons? 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        No.  That's a stupid question...Who
                        the hell is this? 

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO CAFE - DAY

           Elon is mid conversation with a shocked MICHAEL GRIFFIN.

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        Say that again.  A rocket for what? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I want to send a small greenhouse to
                        Mars. A public spectacle. Reinvigorate
                        the public towards space exploration.
                        And I need your help finding a rocket.   
                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        In America, the cheapest to buy is
                        Boeing's Delta II at $50 million.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Fuck. That's so unnecessary.  Nothing 
                        I've read on rocket components at
                        all would justify that cost. 

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        It's not what's in 'em.  It's who
                        makes 'em. Without competition, Boeing
                        and Lockheed have no incentive to
                        charge anything other than top dollar.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        There has to be a cheaper way.

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        There is.  You just need to get
                        yourself a refurbished ICBM.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        And where can I get that?

           INT. MUSK CONDO, PALO ALTO - NIGHT

           Elon wheels his luggage downstairs.  He kisses Justine and
           their newborn boy, NEVADA, on the couch.  

                                 JUSTINE
                        Russia? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It's only a few days.  

                                 JUSTINE
                        Are you losing your mind? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You've known me for 10 years.  Is
                        this really odd behavior for me? 

                                 JUSTINE
                        No...Still...Russia?

           EXT. ELON'S PRIVATE JET - DAY

           Elon's jet flies over the Pacific.  

           INT. ELON'S PRIVATE JET - DAY

           Griffin, Kimbal, and Chris sit in one aisle on recliners. 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Russia.  To buy intercontinental
                        ballistic missiles. Great.  We're
                        gonna nuke Mars. 
                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        Actually we're just purchasing the
                        rocket mechanism.  We'll let them
                        keep the bomb portion.  

           The word "bomb" has them slightly terrified.  

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Chris, you think he's nuts, right? 

                                 CHRIS THOMPSON
                        I think one day more humans will be
                        living off of Earth, than on it.

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        So that's a no?  Good talk.    

           Elon pops in, enthusiastic, holding an important SUITCASE.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Now this is an adventure! 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        This is Russian Roulette. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It's worth noting in Russian Roulette
                        that you're probably going to win. 

           EXT. ST. PETERSBERG - NIGHT

           The plane lands on a closed, snowy runway.  They exit to a
           femme fatale, TALIA, and her associates waiting. 

           Her associates pull out GUNS!  Elon's hands shoot up. Chris
           calmly lowers Elon's hands.  These are their escorts.   

                                 TALIA
                        Welcome to Russia, Mr. Musk.

           INT./EXT. FIELDS - NIGHT

           The escort truck rampages through large fields. The group
           struggles with the turbulence. Elon clutches his SUITCASE.  

           INT. RUSSIAN HOTEL - DAY

           Though lavish and elegant, the "hospitality" of this place
           is betrayed by the myriad of armed guards. 

           Elon's team sits on a sofa across from NPO CEO, VICTOR HART. 

           Victor sips tea as Chris explains their demands in Russian. 
           Victor nods.  Elon has no idea if this is good.  Victor smiles
           at him.  Elon smiles back.  Maybe good?  Then - 

                                 VICTOR HART
                        Fuck. You.

           INT. KREMLIN CAFE - AFTERNOON

           Now they sit with another fat old man, VADIM KOVALEV.  From
           his pure black outfit and his stoic expression, there's no
           telling who he works for. 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        He reminds me of Dad. 

           Elon quiets him as Chris translates Elon's demands.   

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Make sure it's a Knepper ICBM rocket
                        capable of reaching Max Q.

           Chris gives a thumbs up. "I got this." Kovalev listens, then
           SPITS in Elon's face! Guards drag them away like children. 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Yep. Definitely reminds me of Dad.

           Next...

           INT. RUSSIAN MISSILE SILO - NIGHT

           Talia ushers them inside a dank, dusty Cold War relic; Nobody
           would hear them scream except Kosmotra CEO, VLADIMIR ANDREEV. 

                                 VLADIMIR ANDREEV
                        Hello, Chris.  Friends of Chris. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You speak English?  Perfect. 

                                 VLADIMIR ANDREEV
                        Yes.  I meet lots of Americans who
                        wish to be the next Neil Armstrong.   

                                 ELON MUSK
                        The irony isn't lost on me. 

                                 VLADIMIR ANDREEV
                        Americans beat Russians to the moon. 
                        Then quit. We built MIR, so you built
                        I.S.S. except you need Russian rockets
                        to get on board. That's fucking irony.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I lived in South Africa during the
                        Cold War.  This is merely business.

           Elon opens his SUITCASE. Inside is $20 million cash.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        You sell RD-180's to Boeing and
                        Lockheed, correct?  Well, I'd like
                        three Kneppers.  Please.  

           The muscle behind him stands. Chris shivers. Elon doesn't.

                                 VLADIMIR ANDREEV
                        Lots of balls on you. 
                                 ELON MUSK
                        Regular amount of balls, just a little
                        more in them.  

                                 VLADIMIR ANDREEV
                        I know about you, Mr. Silicon Valley. 
                        You buy missile, reverse engineer
                        it, and what? Make American versions? 
                        You plan to start the space race all
                        over again by yourself?  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Is it a deal?  Or do I go elsewhere?  

                                 VLADIMIR ANDREEV
                        You don't understand.  You buy from
                        nobody in Russia.  We dominated the
                        Space Race for 30 years.  And we
                        will for another 30. Now fuck off. 

           INT./EXT. FIELDS - NIGHT

           The team drives back defeated. Elon stares out the window. 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Sorry it didn't work out, E.

           Elon sees KIDS set up around a fire pit with a metal grill.
           They stuff a balloon with alcohol into an empty can.  They
           place the can upside down on the grill and run.  

           In seconds, the balloon POPS releasing the alcohol. It strikes
           the fire and EXPLODES sending the flaming can sky high!  

           "MUSK LAND": In flashes - (1982) Elon blasts a model rocket
           on his lawn; a page of his notebook with the rocket specs;
           (PRESENT) The can stops in mid-air, transforms into a rocket. 
           It separates into 3 giant pieces; Each piece has thrust,
           weight, vectors, equipment all being itemized. Elon gets it. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It's just that simple...  

           INT. ELON'S PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

           All in the same recliners as before.  More traumatized.

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Well, that was terrifying.  To Mother
                        Russia!  And never coming back here. 

           They toast to that. Elon interrupts, holding his laptop.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It's fairly obvious based on today's
                        rather unimpressive showing, that a
                        new plan is needed. 

           He doesn't look a bit demoralized.  In fact, he's inspired.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        I did some of the calculations and I
                        think - I know - this makes sense. 
                                 CHRIS THOMPSON
                        What makes sense? 

           Elon shows them the laptop data. Griffin and Chris both look. 

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        Where did you get this? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I made it. 

           ROCKET SPECS -- The height of each level of atmosphere has a
           velocity and thrust number associated with a rocket launch.  

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        How are Russians able to make
                        something so much cheaper than
                        Americans?  It's not like we buy
                        Russian cars, fly Russian planes or
                        use Russian kitchen appliances. They
                        just go and build them.

           SPREADSHEET -- costs associated with each rocket component. 
           It's detailed on a massive scale.

                                 CHRIS THOMPSON
                        Incredible. I got an engine guy, Tom
                        Mueller, would kill to see this.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        The answer to this problem was obvious
                        from the start.  I just wasn't asking
                        the simple, right question.  I kept
                        asking, "Where do we find a rocket?"     

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        But the real question is - 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        - "How do we get mankind to Mars?"

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        The answer? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        We make the rockets ourselves.  Not
                        just a rocket. Our own space company.

           The impact of that statement hangs in the air.  Chris and
           Griffin look to Kimbal, who bows out.  

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Don't look at me.  I know my brother.
                        I knew he was going there. 

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        You'll need way more than $20 million.    

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'm aware, Michael. 
                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        I don't think you are. 50 years. 
                        Hundreds of billions of dollars. 
                        Entire nations.  The smartest men
                        and women in the history of space. 
                        None of them could get to Mars.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        They didn't have this spreadsheet.  

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        It's not funny.  I was onboard to
                        launch a rocket for philanthropy in
                        hopes of increasing NASA's budget,
                        not to compete against them.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You think I prefer this way. It's
                        NASA!  I've had Neil Armstrong posters
                        on my wall since I was a kid and
                        today kids have that same poster -
                        because people forgot how to have
                        big dreams.  Or take big risks.    

           Elon stares at Chris as if to say, "Are you on board?"  

                                 CHRIS THOMPSON
                        Only if the Missus approves. 

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        Take some free advice: Don't do this.
                        Go live the rest of your life like a
                        king instead. Don't be like every
                        other rich schmuck who lost his entire
                        fortune in space. You will fail.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You're probably right.  Failure is
                        the highest probable outcome... 

           Elon sits back down.  Is he that easily defeated?  

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        ...I'm gonna do it anyway.

           Elon sips his whiskey - his confidence never stronger. 

           INT. MUSK CONDO, NEVADA'S BEDROOM, PALO ALTO - AFTERNOON

           Elon and Justine both kiss Nevada goodnight, now asleep in
           his crib. Elon caresses his son's cheek. A proud father. 

           LATER -- Justine cleans up the house. She sees Elon staring
           into nothingness, half watching TV, half thinking. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        You're off in 'Musk Land' again.
                        What are you thinking about?  E?

           ON TV -- GM debuts EV-1, the first PRODUCTION ELECTRIC CAR. 
           They open the hood to showcase the ultracapacitor battery.  
                                 ELON MUSK
                        Electric cars.  I think about them
                        all the time.  Do you?

                                 JUSTINE
                        No.  I don't.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You should. It's important that we
                        make the switch to renewable energy.

                                 JUSTINE
                        How about one crazy idea at a time?  
                            (she heads upstairs)
                        Okay, nap time's over.  You coming,
                        Elon?  Or is it Elton now?

           Elon's confused. OFF SCREEN she turns the sound system on. 

           NEVADA'S ROOM -- Justine walks in to check on Nevada.  She
           rustles his tummy, but he doesn't wake up yet.  

           DOWNSTAIRS -- Elon finally turns off the TV, ready to help
           and hears the song she picked: Rocket Man by ELTON JOHN. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You're a riot, J!

           NEVADA'S ROOM -- We look at Justine as she nudges her baby.   

                                 JUSTINE
                        Nevada?  Wake up...Baby?

           Then horror strikes across her face.  Something is very wrong.

           DOWNSTAIRS -- Elon slowly gets off the couch when he hears -    

                                 JUSTINE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Elon!!!!

           Her screams LAUNCH Elon up the stairs to the rescue.  

           INT. PALO ALTO HOSPITAL, ICU HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Elon has been up for days as he digests what the DOCTOR says.  

                                 DR. ADLER
                        There's been no brain activity in 3
                        days.  SIDS is a terrible condition.
                        There's just nothing more we can do.  

           NEVADA'S ICU ROOM -- Justine can't move from the bed. At 10
           weeks old, her baby is attached to a ventilator.  Elon enters.

           Elon's eyes swell with pain. He looks at his son and kisses
           him for the last time.  It tortures him to have to guide
           Justine away from Nevada. She SCREAMS in agony for her baby.

           Elon needs to restrain her so the doctors can shut down the
           ventilator.  As it's shut down, Elon bursts into an endless
           sob with her. Two parents lose a child.  Inconsolable pain.  
           EXT. CEMETERY, NEVADA'S FUNERAL - DAY

           A private gathering. Justine cries as hard as before.  She
           hangs on Elon.  He stays strong for her, holding back some
           tears, learning to swallow his pain.

           INT. MUSK CONDO, PALO ALTO - EVENING

           Elon greets guests giving their condolences.  Sadness fills
           every part of this condo.  

           LATER, BACK PATIO -- Open design with a great view. Elon
           finds Justine.  He'll say anything to distract her heartbreak. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        The patio needs a cobblestone trim.
                        What do you think?  Maybe grey or - 

           Justine isn't listening. She fidgets with his large TELESCOPE.
           Elon adjusts the telescope's position for her.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Look at it now. 

           Justine puts her eye to the telescope. 

           TELESCOPE -- It's a view of Mars, millions of miles away. 
           Red glow. The detail is vivid - you can even see ridges. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        It's beautiful.  What's it like there?

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Well, the gravity is 1/3 of ours. 

           EXT. MARS - DAY (ELON'S VISION)

           A cold, red desert with valleys and mountains.  

                                 ELON MUSK (O.S.)
                        The average temperature is minus 80
                        degrees. Atmosphere is 95% carbon
                        dioxide. It's red because of the
                        iron oxide on its surface. 

           A CAPSULE lands.  Elon steps out.  

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Getting there would only take about
                        80 days when the planets align -
                        happens once every 26 months.

           BACK TO PATIO:

           Elon looks up at Mars.  So far away to him.  And yet not. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Do you want to die on Mars?

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Not on impact.
           She chuckles sadly. Only one thought comes to Elon's mind. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        I love you.  

           She smiles but she's too hurt to let go of her pain.  

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        We'll get through this, J. In a long
                        enough timeline everything goes back
                        to normal. Just takes time. That's
                        all. Just time. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        It will never go back to normal. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Then we make new. All of it.
                        Everything. It will get better. I
                        promise you that. It will. 

           She HUGS him, cries. He lets her, silently holding her tight.  

           LATER, ELON'S OFFICE -- Elon tries to work on his rocket. 
           He reaches for a pen and catches a glimpse of a PHOTO OF
           NEVADA on his desk.  His hardened exterior crumbles as he's
           overcome with grief, crying uncontrollably into the photo.  

                                                               FADE OUT:

           INT./EXT. SAN JOSE HIGHWAYS - DAY

           Months have now passed. Elon looks a little more filled out
           as he cruises in his McLaren. He heads toward Silicon Valley.

           INT. EBAY H.Q., SAN JOSE, CA - DAY

           Peter and the Paypal board take pictures with Ebay's board.  

                                 CNN REPORTER (O.S.)
                        Paypal CEO Peter Thiel announced
                        today that Ebay has purchased the
                        internet bank for $1.5 billion.

           OFF TO THE SIDE -- Elon, not allowed in the photo. 

                                 CNN REPORTER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        $180 million going to former CEO
                        Elon Musk, the leading shareholder.

           Friend and former Ebay co-founder JEFF SKOLL, 37, joins him.  

                                 JEFF SKOLL
                        Remember when they were our companies? 
                        You won't miss it.  Trust me.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I already moved on to the next thing.  

                                 JEFF SKOLL
                        Good for you, pal.  So what is it? 
                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'm going to Mars.  

           Jeff DROPS his drink.  Elon leaves him on that note. 

           INT./EXT. HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA - DAY

           The McLaren races down the coast into an industrial section.

                                 CHRIS THOMPSON (O.S.)
                        Tom Mueller did things at TRW that
                        they didn't like, but you would. 

           INT. INDUSTRIAL WORKSHOP - DAY

           TOM MUELLER, 30s, an engineering boy scout, finishes a bolt
           on a makeshift engine.  He runs to his bunker. The engine
           FIRES, roasting the test bed underneath.

                                 CHRIS THOMPSON (O.S.)
                        He built an 80 pound liquid engine
                        that produced 13,000 lbs of force - 

           LATER -- Tom lifts the engine, finishing the story to Elon.

                                 TOM MUELLER
                        - Or simply put the world's largest
                        amateur liquid rocket. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Ever work on anything bigger? 

                                 TOM MUELLER
                        I developed engines for Delta IV but
                        they went in "another direction." 
                        That's why I'm here.  I'd rather do
                        it all myself. At least I'd use them.   

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Make an engine for me. I'll use it. 

                                 TOM MUELLER
                        And where's my engine going? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Mars. 

           Tom DROPS the engine. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Why do people keep dropping things
                        when I say that? 

                                 TOM MUELLER
                        I don't think I can make that.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Yes, you can.  Can you get into LEO?

                                 TOM MUELLER
                        Yes.  Absolutely.
                                 ELON MUSK
                        Then what's the difference?  Same
                        parts. It's just farther away.  Decide
                        if you're up for this, then call me.

           Elon walks away.  Tom has to shout at him.   

                                 TOM MUELLER
                        Where's your company located? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'm working on it. 

           EXT. MUSK HOME, LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Elon brings Justine, sporting a brand new baby bump, to their
           beautiful new $17 million Bel Air Mansion.  It's a palace. 

           INT. MUSK HOME, LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Completely empty. Hobbes excitedly runs throughout the house.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Yea, all new smells buddy.
                            (to Justine)
                        You like it, baby? 

           She's filled with energy looking at the elegance of the house, 
           but mostly at the effort Elon is putting in.  She smiles.

                                 JUSTINE
                        I love it.  You did good. 

           EXT. FACTORY DISTRICT, EL SEGUNDO - DAY

           Elon admires an empty white factory in a business district.  

           CHYRON: June, 2002. El Segundo, CA. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It was an old shipping factory. 

                                 TOM MUELLER
                        It's definitely old... 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Vision, Tom.  Have vision.

            Tom is less optimistic.  As they walk in...

           INT. SPACEX, FACTORY, EL SEGUNDO - DAY

           ...they are wearing different clothes.  Two months later and
           every inch of the interior has a fresh WHITE epoxy coat.  

           Construction outlines have begun on several areas. Drills,
           hammers, saws - a cacaphony of progress...and NOISE. 
           INT. MUSK HOME, LOS ANGELES - DAY

           The construction NOISE continues in the Musk's new house. 
           Justine, now with a larger baby bump, grows irritated
           listening to it while she watches TV.  She MUTES it. 

           Elon does a walkthrough with crew members into the living
           room.  He stops walking when he sees that HE'S ON TV.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        What are you watching? 

           Justine UNMUTES the TV.  

           CNN REPORT: CNN interviews tech expert MIKE MUSGRAVE. In the
           corner of the frame is video of Elon interviewed at SpaceX.

                                 CNN REPORTER
                        What do you think of Elon's
                        announcement that he's leaving Silicon
                        Valley to send humans to Mars? 

                                 MIKE MUSGRAVE
                        We call guys like him "Thrillionaires"
                        since they spend their tech fortunes
                        on high risk ventures. I don't get
                        this move at all. 

           Justine MUTES the TV again.

                                 JUSTINE
                        They are on CNN laughing at you. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I don't care what anyone thinks. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        I can see that...Are they right? 
                        Are we going to lose everything? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        No. I'm right. I promise. 
                            (holds her hand)
                        I need you behind me, J. 

           Before she decides that, there's a KNOCK at the entrance.  

           FRONT ENTRANCE -- It's missing the front door.  Kimbal walks
           right in, KNOCKING on a nearby wall. He finds them.  

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Woah, this place is a fucking mess.  

                                 JUSTINE
                        Welcome to our new life. 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Not gonna touch that.  E, I wanna
                        show you something I made for you. 

           Kimbal puts in a DVD. Elon sits next to Justine, who at the
           moment doesn't want to be touched. Kimbal hits PLAY.

           and rocket crash ever.  Apollo II. Challenger. You name it.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You do understand I wont be in the
                        rocket?  

           Another rocket goes up and EXPLODES!

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        So?  This is what happens to rockets. 
                        They explode.  They fail.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        They soar.  They go to other planets! 
                        I'm gonna fly to outer space. You
                        have to admit, this is exciting.

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Yea, it is kinda awesome. 
                            (then)
                        Wait - stop! Don't do that. I'm
                        serious. The odds are against you. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        When something is important enough,
                        you do it even if the odds aren't in
                        your favor.  This is important enough. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. SPACEX, FACTORY, EL SEGUNDO - MORNING

           GWYNNE SHOTWELL, a blonde bulldozer in the middle of her
           rising career, stares at the outside of this crummy factory.

           INT. SPACEX, FACTORY, EL SEGUNDO - DAY

           Trucks are pulled inside to deliver office supplies. Elon
           helps unload. He's joined by familiar faces, Chris and Tom,
           and two others, HANS and TIM - we'll meet later.  

           Chris half gestures to Elon, finding a moment to speak up. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Out with it, Chris.  

                                 CHRIS THOMPSON
                        Can we change some of the designs? 
                        Nothing sucks the fun out of working
                        in space like using knobs and dials
                        made for a 60's laundromat.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Do we need any of it? 

           Tim grabs a piece of furniture and pipes in.

                                 TIM BUZZA
                        Nope!  
                                 ELON MUSK
                        I don't care how it's been done
                        anywhere. Think for yourself.  If we
                        don't need it, we get rid of it.  

                                 CHRIS THOMPSON
                        Thank you, Elon!

           Elon walks away to greet Gwynne, who enters the front gate. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You're right on time.  Hans raves
                        about you: "If anyone can sell your
                        rocket, it's Gwynne Shotwell"...Ahh,
                        I like him.  Come. Right this way.

           INT. SPACEX, OFFICE, EL SEGUNDO - MORNING

           The office is completely empty, except for their two chairs.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        How much did Hans tell you about us?

                                 GWYNNE SHOTWELL
                        Only the sound bite on Mars. I haven't
                        heard about your market entry.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Our initial goal will be to provide
                        transportation services for small
                        satellites to LEO.  
                            (explains)
                        We can control the market if we launch
                        cheaply, launch regularly, and launch
                        reliably.  Basically become -

                                 GWYNNE SHOTWELL
                        - The Southwest of space?   

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Cheap, reliable, and never out of
                        the sky! 

           Elon's having fun, but Gwynne is nonplussed. He straigtens.

                                 GWYNNE SHOTWELL
                        What's it... 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        ...Pay? Shit.  I want as much money
                        invested in the company.  But every
                        employee gets stock options. So every
                        member stands to become a millionaire. 

           Gwynne ponders his salesman routine up and down. 

                                 GWYNNE SHOTWELL
                        The infrastructure here won't pass
                        FAA regulations. We're grossly
                        understocked on supplies, equipment -
                                 ELON MUSK
                        - Relax. We'll fix it. That's what
                        I'm here for.  

                                 GWYNNE SHOTWELL
                        How do you even know how to build a
                        rocket? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I read a lot of books...Now, why did
                        you want to meet me?

                                 GWYNNE SHOTWELL
                        I've been doing this for 15 years
                        and I'm sick of how this business
                        drags its feet.  I'm desperate to
                        explore outer space.  I wanted to
                        know if you were the real deal. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I am going to Mars.  With or without
                        you. I'd prefer with.  Interested?

           INT. SPACEX, OFFICE, EL SEGUNDO - DAY

           Elon walks with Gwynne in tow. He reads an email on his new
           BLACKBERRY; it will be attached to his hand from now on. 

           His young assistant, MARY BETH, hands him a Diet Coke.  She
           follows him like his shadow.  Her anxiety powers her through
           every task.  This girl never sits still.

                        We're gonna need a launch site.  

           CONFERENCE ROOM -- The other five employees chit chat waiting
           for Elon. Still no chairs.  Elon enters with Gwynne and MB.  

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Everyone, this is #7, Gwynne Shotwell,
                        our new VP of Business Development. 
                        She moonlights as an engineer.  

           Gwynne waves, then falls back in line. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Welcome to Space Exploration
                        Technologies. SpaceX for short. 
                        So I know we're all here because we
                        want to go to Mars. But we can't
                        think about Mars until we first launch
                        a rocket to LEO.  

           He writes on the board behind him.  'Step 1, LEO'.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Step 1 - we build a rocket. Falcon 1
                        will be a clean sheet design.  All
                        ideas are welcome. Best one wins, no
                        matter who says it. Hopefully, I do.  

           TIM BUZZA, class clown, raises his hand while chewing gum.
                                 TIM BUZZA
                        How many launch attempts do we got?

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Tim Buzza, Boeing's lead rocket tester
                        and now our lead rocket tester. 
                        Please say your name and title when
                        it's your turn to talk, thank you.  

           The team looks at each other.  Is this high school?  

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        To answer your question, we have
                        enough money for 3, maybe 4 tries. 
                        Probably 3.  

           He thinks on it. Writes '3' on the board with optimism.

                                 CHRIS THOMPSON
                            (raising hand too)
                        Chris Thompson, VP of Operations.
                        Who's our Chief Engineer?

                                 ELON MUSK
                        We weren't able to lure someone I
                        felt comfortable with so...
                            (raises hand)
                        Elon Musk, CEO and Chief Engineer.

           They tease him with a fake clap.  Elon enjoys this group. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Okay, fuck you guys.  Step 2 - Cost.  

           Elon writes down 'Step 2, COST' and then the 5 items below.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        5 things make launches expensive: 
                        Overhead.  Engines.  Structure. 
                        Avionics.  And Launch Operations. 
                            (beat)
                        We're going to make all that shit
                        cheaper, faster, and better.

           Elon shakes hands and takes pictures with graduates. The
           excitement in these young minds is overwhelming.

                                 ELON MUSK (O.S.)
                        That means cheaper employees. Stalk
                        campuses. Get graduates.  Get interns.

                                 ELON MUSK (O.S.)
                        Your friends, ex-colleagues, anyone
                        fed up with bureaucracies. If they're
                        bored, they're perfect. Steal 'em.

                        Cheaper equipment.  If it costs a
                        lot, try auto parts stores for valves,
                        computer stores for circuitry, etc. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Meet Mobile Mission Control. We won't
                        have 300 people stand around a launch
                        pad for fucking weeks during prep.

                        Cheaper Testing.  Find other people's
                        used stuff.  If it works, who cares.

                                 ELON MUSK (O.S.)
                        Faster decisions.  No paperwork or
                        reports. You don't need babysitters. 
                        Do what you think is best. Need
                        something? Speak up.

                        Elon?!  Micronozzle is shot.  Gonna
                        cost $75,000 for it. 
           30 feet away, despite wearing an Italian blazer, Elon is
           filthy, helping the welders. He trusts Chris' word.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Can you get it down to $65,000? 

                                 CHRIS THOMPSON
                        I can do that.  Approved? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Okay!

                                 ELON MUSK (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        It will be hard work.  The hardest
                        of your life.

           BIRD'S EYE POV -- In 2 years, SpaceX is now a rocket producing
           revolution.  200 employees.  3D models.  Engine designs. 
           Capsule designs. Young minds building things in every corner. 
           The Falcon 1 casing is finally visible.  Truly unbelievable.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You have to admit, this is exciting.

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Yea, it is kinda awesome. 

           PRELAP: The thunderous ROAR of a rocket engine. 

           EXT. MCGREGOR AIR FORCE BASE, TEXAS - DAY

           TIGHT ON AN ENGINE FIRING!  A Merlin Stage 1 booster engine
           is hooked up to a horizontal test stand.  It fires 3 seconds
           of steel-melting, blue heat before shutting off.  

           Elon excitedly steps out from a small dirt bunker with D.O.D.
           Consultant, GENERAL PETE WORDEN, 50's.  Worden is that heroic
           military hero you want your kids to look up to.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It's incredible, isn't it!?  Tom
                        developed a unique pintle injection
                        thrust design, that's really quite - 
                                 GENERAL WORDEN
                        - Gwynne said you're a talker.  Tell
                        me, what's our launch timeline?

                                 ELON MUSK
                        We've been wet testing for about 6
                        months now so I'm guessing...March?
                        What's the payload we're launching? 

                                 GENERAL WORDEN
                        It's classified.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Right, D.O.D.  I always forget.

           Worden wanders around, observing the now partially upgraded
           testing grounds.  The rust is gone. Everything is operational. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Better than a trip to NASA, right? 

                                 GENERAL WORDEN
                        The word at NASA is you're one of
                        these Silicon Valley "Thrillionaires"
                        spending his dot com money on hobbies. 
                        Today it's rockets. Sooner or later,
                        you'll get bored...and quit. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        NASA's scared.  Just like DARPA
                        underwrote the cost for the internet
                        before dot com guys like me improved
                        it, NASA took on the initial cost of
                        space.  Now it's up to the private
                        sector, like me again, to take over
                        and improve space. Don't you agree? 

           Worden's military stare is hard to read.  Did Elon just insult
           him?  Worden waits a beat as he studies Merlin one last time.  

                                 GENERAL WORDEN
                        NASA is filled with dinosaurs. If
                        NASA, Boeing, and Lockheed don't
                        start thinking like you - simple,
                        cheap - they'll be left behind. 

           LATER -- Worden leaves in a government sedan, picking up a
           dust trail.  Elon watches them go; Tom meets him, elated.

                                 TOM MUELLER
                        It's really happening, isn't it? Our
                        first customer.  This is awesome! 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Tom, I have no idea why you're
                        excited.  Merlin burned for 3 seconds. 
                        It needs to burn for 180 seconds or
                        there is no fucking launch. You're
                        on the critical path to my success. 

           That pressure terrifies Tom. Elon harnesses that fear. 
                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        I believe in you.  That's why I hired
                        you. Can you make this work? 

                                 TOM MUELLER
                        Yes.  Yes, I can make this work.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Good.  I'll give you whatever you
                        need, you say the word. But it's on
                        you now. Don't fuck this up. 

           INT. MUSK HOME, ELON'S OFFICE, LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Elon works on launch trajectories at his desk.  He's intensely
           focused.  Justine holds one of the twins, now 1, and enters.

                                 JUSTINE
                        Hey, Genius! Come play with us.    

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Sorry, J. I'm trying to figure out a
                        launch site on our budget 

           Justine encroaches Elon's space using her boy as a prop.   

                                 JUSTINE
                        Are you gonna say "no" to this face?  

           Elon is face to face with his son, who has snot crusted on
           his nose and PB&J still left on his lips and cheeks.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It's easier than you think.

           Elon puckers for a kiss. The boy turns his head away.  No!

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        No?  No?! Why you little - 

           Elon rips him out of Justine's hands and acts like he's gonna
           throw him before they all giggle and run to the couch. 

           INT. MUSK HOME, LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Elon and the twins play on the couch. He's rolling around,
           picking them up in the air, playing peek-a-boo.  Justine is
           in the middle of it, but mostly sits and watches, happy.  

           Elon sees her laptop and notes on the kitchen table. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Blogging or real writing?

                                 JUSTINE
                        Both.  But it's going well. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        As long as you finish it - whatever
                        gets you working - is great!  Always
                        believe in what you're doing.  I do.   
           Justine rests her head on his shoulder. 

           LATER, FRONT ENTRANCE

           Elon kisses Justine goodbye and rolls his suitcase out first
           before exiting. 

           LATER, KITCHEN TABLE -- Justine opens a new entry in her
           blog. Previous articles include, "The Motley Crew" & "The
           Billionaire's Wife". We HEAR her as she types.

                                 JUSTINE (V.O.)
                        E's left to prepare his rocket site. 

           TIGHT ON A MERCATOR PROJECTOR:

           Listing every launch site in the world. Only 2 are near
           SpaceX: Vandenberg Air Force Base, within a 30 mile drive; 

                                 JUSTINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Vandenberg delayed SpaceX by a year
                        to launch the retiring Titan IV. 

           And A TINY ISLAND, 2000 miles west of Hawaii.

                                 JUSTINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Needless to say, Elon doesn't wait.  

           EXT. KWAJALEIN ISLAND - DAY

           Beautiful tree tops cover the small tropical islands.  This
           looks like paradise.  Looks.  

           CHYRON: The Kwajalein Atoll.  Marshall Islands. 

                                 JUSTINE (V.O.)
                        The U.S. Army conducted missile tests
                        on Kwaj for decades. The only way
                        there is either boat or jet. 

           Like troops sent to Vietnam, BOATS ferry cargo and crew to
           the main island.  They reach land. 

           Teams exit with their supplies and trudge through the trees
           until they reach the MAIN LAUNCH SITE, a 7 acre open grass
           field with two dilapidated bunkers. This is no Pad 39a. 

           Tim drops his stuff and takes one look around. 

                                 TIM BUZZA
                        This is gonna fucking suck.

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - LATER

           Dark clouds and thunderous rain blast the island sideways. 

                                 JUSTINE (V.O.)
                        There is periodic heavy rain
                        throughout the day and the wind is
                        so strong it blows the rain sideways.
           INT. KWAJALEIN, BARRACKS - NIGHT

           The team shivers in these old army barracks. Rain pelts the
           metal walls with force and vigor - then it STOPS. 

                                 JUSTINE (V.O.)
                        Sometimes the rain stops instantly. 
                        In minutes, the sun returns to dry
                        you out at a blistering 98 degrees
                        with 75% humidity.  

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           Elon and the team sweat like dogs in the sweltering sun as
           they construct the launch pad.  An empty rocket shell is
           moved with logs, like stones were for the pyramids.

           INT. KWAJALEIN, MACHINE SHOP - DAY

           Rain returns to blast away as the rocket equipment is unpacked
           in the shop. Elon observes some of Tim's items. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Does that calculate weight to transfer
                        ratios? Can you teach me how it works? 

                                 TIM BUZZA
                        Sure.  I have time for that.  While
                        I'm at it, why don't I just teach
                        you how to do my whole fucking job?  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Really?! That would be great!

           Elon's genuine excitement defeats Tim's sarcasm.  

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           The LAUNCH PAD is finally installed. A working Falcon rocket
           stands on the tower. Every part is tested thoroughly.   

           INT. SPACEX, OFFICE, EL SEGUNDO - DAY

           Gwynne oversees the Mission Control team.  They confirm each
           test protocol. She gets the final launch approvals.  INTERCUT -

                        Green light on our end, Kwaj.  Our
                        bird is ready to soar. 

           Elon glows with pride.  They are ready. He radios back.   

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Copy that, H.Q.    

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           The birds chirp.  The sun shines.  Palm trees wave.

           The FALCON 1 rocket stands only 70 feet but on this small
           island it looks massive.  Workers fuel it with Liquid Oxygen.
           CHYRON: March 24th, 2006. Falcon 1, Test #1. 

           INT. KWAJALEIN, TEMPORARY MISSION CONTROL - DAY

           A makeshift Mission Control is set up for the on-site
           operators.  Operators do final pre-tests. 

                                 TOM MUELLER
                        Go for precheck.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL TRAILER - DAY

           The trailer is transformed into a row of computers against
           one wall.  Several monitors track the flight.

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           Elon arrives by helicopter in a t-shirt and shorts.  As he
           steps onto the small island, he admires his masterpiece.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You are the most beautiful thing I
                        have ever seen in my life.  

           INT. SPACEX, FACTORY, EL SEGUNDO - DAY

           The other employees listen to the launch through the speakers.  

           INT. MISSION CONTROL TRAILER - DAY

           Gwynne, Chris, and Hans at their stations. Everyone has
           headsets. On a monitor, they see the rocket standing tall.

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           Elon is ushered away as the crew finishes tightening the
           bolts.  The fuel pump is pulled away from the rocket.  

           INT. KWAJALEIN, TEMPORARY MISSION CONTROL - DAY

           Elon enters, relaxed, but excited. Worden and DARPA officers
           watch on TV monitors. Worden is skeptical. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Better than a trip to NASA yet?

                        We'll see, Musk. 

           Elon plays an animation of the flight path on TV monitors. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I had this made for you guys. 

           CGI ANIMATION -- (all over techno music) 
           Falcon 1 launches up until trajectory moves sideways,
           accelerating to gain ORBITAL VELOCITY (Max Q). The jetstream
           matches the curved "X" in SpaceX's logo.  

           At Max Q it escapes gravity to enter LOW EARTH ORBIT (LEO). 

                                 ELON MUSK (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        We'll reach the end of Stage 1 at
                        6,850 mph.  Stage 2 could reach a
                        Max Q of 17,000 mph.

           In LEO, the first section (Stage 1) detaches. The second
           section (Stage 2) refires and stays in orbit before releasing
           the top portion (Fairing) with the cargo (Payload). 

           ANIMATION ENDS.  Mission Control gives Elon the "go".

                        It's really happening...

                                 SPACEX MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                        Thrust at 50,000 lbs.

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           Falcon 1 is leaving Earth in its wake.  Then suddenly, a
           FIRE on the side of the Stage 1 engine!  

                                 SPACEX MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                        Control, we have a Stage 1 breach!

           Falcon 1 RIPS APART!  The exposed engines collide and EXPLODE! 
           A massive fireball of debris falls down on the launch site.  
           INT. KWAJALEIN, TEMPORARY MISSION CONTROL - DAY

           Elon on the com unit, panicked.  He watches the debris fall.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Everyone evacuate the area!  

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           Workers run as the fiery debris crashes everywhere, including
           the ocean. Tim and others jump into the water after it. 

                                 TIM BUZZA
                        Grab the panels!  Grab the guidance
                        systems!  Let's move!

           INT. KWAJALEIN, TEMPORARY MISSION CONTROL - DAY

           Silence on the coms. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Somebody talk to me - What's happening
                        out there?  Who's safe? 

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           The site is a wreck, but the crisis is over. Tim checks in. 

                                 TIM BUZZA
                        We're okay.  We made it.  

           INT. SPACEX, FACTORY, EL SEGUNDO - DAY

           Gwynne listens in and hits the com. 

                                 GWYNNE SHOTWELL
                        Where's the payload? 

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, MACHINE SHOP - DAY

           The sky is empty....Birds chirp again....Then the PAYLOAD
           SMASHES through the roof. 

           INT. KWAJALEIN, TEMPORARY MISSION CONTROL - DAY

           Elon waits to hear something from someone.  

                                 TIM BUZZA (O.S.)
                        Now we made it. 

           Elon shuts off the com.  He then addresses the room. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It's perhaps worth noting that those
                        launch companies that succeeded also
                        took their lumps along the way. Only
                        5 of the first 9 Pegasus launches
                        succeeded.  3 of 5 for Ariane; 9 of
                        20 for Atlas; 9 of 21 for Soyuz;
                        Failure is how we learn. 

           Worden and DARPA aren't loving it. Elon squeezes by to leave.  
                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Sorry about your stuff. Excuse me. 

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           Elon's boat reaches the main island. He quickly scampers to
           see. Everything is destroyed.  The SpaceX logo on the Payload
           MELTS from the fire in the machine shop. 

           Tom and Tim are covered in soot, clothes a mess.  Tim finds
           Elon, hands him a beer.  Tom drinks quietly beside them both. 

                                 TIM BUZZA
                        We just launched a rocket. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        We just crashed a rocket. 

                                 TIM BUZZA
                        Crashed, right, of course.  Crashed. 

           Elon hasn't decided if he'll kill them for celebrating, yet.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You're still on my critical path. 

                                 TOM MUELLER
                        I know...  

           Elon cracks open his beer and smiles. He lives for this stuff.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        We just launched a rocket. 

           INT. AVIATION CONFERENCE AFTER PARTY, PALO ALTO - NIGHT

           A tradeshow-like atmosphere.  The biggest tech geeks around
           mingle on a patio with trophy wives, or no wives at all. 
           It's rather droll to consider this a party.  

           Elon sends Justine a quick text: "Write, damn you! This is
           my motivational message :-)"

           She writes back: "Ah.  The power of love.  Foiled again!"

           Elon finds his friend, LARRY PAGE, a fellow dorky, tech
           genius. If his name seems familiar, it's because that dork
           created some company called Google. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        This is Palo Alto's idea of a party? 

                                 LARRY PAGE
                        Rich and successful?  Yes.  But
                        celebrities we are not, my friend.

           LATER, PRIVATE CORNER -- Elon geeks out with Larry.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        The indefinite extension of the Fossil
                        Fuels era is the dumbest experiment
                        in the history of our planet. 
           Overhearing them is JB STRAUBEL, a young, shy genius with no
           social skills. He's fixated on their conversation.   

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        The greater the change to the chemical
                        composition of our oceans and
                        atmospheres -   

                                 JB STRAUBEL
                        - due to increased carbon emissions.

           Elon turns to see JB, this stranger, on his page. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Exactly... The greater the long-term
                        effect will be.  Given that at some
                        point they'll run out anyway, why
                        run this crazy experiment to see how
                        bad it'll be?  

                                 LARRY PAGE
                        On that fun note, I need a drink.

           Larry exits as JB makes his move towards Elon.  

                                 JB STRAUBEL
                        I couldn't agree more about switching
                        to renewable energy source. 
                            (closes in)
                        You ever think about electric cars?

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You could say that.  

           EXT. AVIATION CONFERENCE, PARKING LOT - LATER

           Elon waits by JB's car.  JB plays him a video on his laptop.

           ARCHIVAL NEWS VIDEO: At a city junkyard, a row of EV-1's are
           lined up near a MACHINE PRESS.  

                                 JB STRAUBEL (O.S.)
                        The EV-1.  After restrictions on oil
                        were lifted, GM immediately recalled
                        the electric car for destruction.  

           EV-1 owners stand by the press holding a candlelight vigil. 

                                 JB STRAUBEL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        When do you ever see people hold a
                        candlelight vigil for a product?  

                                 ELON MUSK (O.S.)
                        Especially for a GM product.

           An EV-1 is moved onto a machine press. SMASH! It's flattened.

           BACK TO PARKING LOT: 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        What kind of battery did it have?
                        Those weren't ultracapacitors. 
           JB hands a small lithium BATTERY to Elon. 

                                 JB STRAUBEL
                        18650 Lithium Ion.  String together
                        enough batteries and you could power
                        a car farther than gas ever could. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Now that's a reason to buy an electric
                        car. Is somebody making one? 

                                 JB STRAUBEL
                        Tesla Motors.  3 engineers out in
                        Menlo. They're smart. But need money
                        and a battery. Doing a Series A now.      

           INT. ELON'S PRIVATE JET - DAY

           Elon still holds the battery.  He enters "Musk Land."

           "MUSK LAND": Thousands of batteries string together in mid-
           air. A bare chasis appears, the batteries lay in the middle. 
           Mathematical formulas float in the air - DRAG, TORQUE, KWH/HR. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        1,000 miles on a single charge...

           MB is constantly emailing as Elon speaks out of nowhere.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Electric cars.  I think about them
                        all the time.  Do you? 

           She snaps to attention to answer, jittery from anxiety. 

                                 MARY BETH
                        I haven't. I will!  I saw JB's email;
                        I swear I read it -  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        - MB?  Are you afraid of me? 

                                 MARY BETH
                        Yes?  I mean...
                            (reluctantly honest)
                        ...Yes.  

           INT. TESLA, OFFICE, MENLO PARK - DAY

           MARTIN EBERHARD, 30s, leads the 3 man pitch to Elon and JB
           in a small, shitty office.  He is overly cocky, but brilliant. 

                                 MARTIN EBERHARD
                        Your $7 million investment for a
                        Tesla prototype will help humanity
                        switch to renewable energy sources. 

           Elon skims their business plan.  The car design looks like
           something from The Jetsons.  Unimpressed, he hands it to JB. 
           Elon grills Martin, not wanting to waste his money.
                                 ELON MUSK
                        Don't exaggerate.  This buys maybe 2
                        mules. Manufacturing strategy?

                                 MARTIN EBERHARD
                        We already have a deal with Lotus on
                        the chasis and Gage licensed us his
                        power train amongst other things. 
                        We'll be outsourcing most parts.  

           JB marks up their business plan.  It has highlights like 0-
           60 in 3.9 seconds; 300 mile range; world class handling.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        JB runs the battery department. Or
                        no deal. Trust me, you'll thank me.  

           That surprised them.  Martin and his team are reticent. 

                                 MARTIN EBERHARD
                        You see, the thing is we want someone
                        who sees our vision, our way - 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        - I know you're worried about control,
                        Martin.  I've been there. I'm prepping
                        a launch. I've got twin toddlers.  I
                        don't have extra time to fly here
                        every week. Now I'm making an electric
                        car.  So either I invest in you or I
                        invest in your future competitor. 

           Marc and Ian look to Martin.  Martin shake's Elon's hand.

           INT. MUSK HOME, LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Justine cooks a large feast.  The dining room is set for 15
           people.  Elon enters the front door with his carry-on.  He
           drops it, walks to the fridge to grab a Diet Coke.   

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Hi. Going to the office.  Bye.

                                 JUSTINE
                        No.  Not bye. It's Thanksgiving.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It's a turkey dinner for people who
                        take days off.  I don't take days
                        off. I'm the Chief Engineer of a
                        space company preparing for a launch.  

                                 JUSTINE
                        You're Chief Engineer every day. 
                        Today you're Mr. Justine Musk.  

           Getting through to him is infuriating.  Then she blurts out. 

                                 JUSTINE (CONT'D)
                        The IVF worked! Again!
                                 ELON MUSK
                        What?!  You're pregnant!?

           He drops his bag and erupts in joy, kissing his amazing wife.  

           INT. MUSK HOME, LOS ANGELES - AFTERNOON

           The dining hall is fit for a presidential banquet as it houses
           Elon and Justine's extended family. They drink, laugh, eat,
           horse around, try and stop Hobbes from eating everything.  

           Justine wheels in the twins, who wave, to much coo-cooing. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Are you boys saying 'Hi'?  Are you?

           Elon doesn't notice, typing on his phone. She glares at him.
           Kimbal cuts the tension and SLAPS Elon's phone from his hands.   

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        So Tesla?  That's...additive. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Yes, it is.  He's lead investor,
                        chairman, and designer.  But from a
                        distance, of course. 

           The sass in her voice is thick.  She and Kimbal gang up as
           Elon picks up one of the twins and holds him as a buffer.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        So I'll be a little busier.  I'm
                        growing my family and my businesses.  
                            (beat)
                        This is all part of the same Master
                        Plan since I was 10 - Human Survival.  

           Kimbal sees the plush IRON MAN doll Elon's son holds.

                        You know you can't ever actually be
                        Iron Man, right?  Cuz he's not real.     

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I don't think anybody could really
                        be Iron Man.  The feet propulsion
                        isn't feasible to control. He'd tear
                        his own legs off.  Though, I suppose
                        theoretically you could design -   

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        - I'm gonna shove a Merlin 1-B class
                        engine thing up your ass if you don't
                        say to me that you know you can't be
                        the fictional superhero Iron Man.

           Kimbal waits.  Elon changes subjects to avoid answering.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        K, I've been wanting to do clean
                        energy since Stanford.

                        2 days at Stanford.  2 days! If GM
                        failed to do it, how can you?

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Maybe I can't.  So what? It's okay
                        to fail. Companies fail all the time.
                        As long as I try. 
                            (explains)
                        At its core, what's in an electric
                        car?  Batteries. Drive electronics. 
                        Electric motor. Silicon Valley skills,
                        not Detroit skills. I know that. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        And I know you. Once someone does
                        their job wrong, you'll fire them
                        and take over.  Am I wrong?

                                 ELON MUSK
                        J, I promise you I don't want to be
                        CEO of two companies and I won't be. 
                        I'm not crazy.  

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        You know Nikola Tesla went crazy. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        A new idea is crazy. Until it's not. 

           INT. NASA HQ, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Elon sits with BURT RUTAN, BOB BIGELOW, and a few other NAMES
           around a conference table. The TV plays a video.

           VIDEO ENDS -- Standing by the door is new NASA Administrator,

           Jackpot! Elon's brain is already racing.  Griffin hands Elon
           his packet.  They exchange a nod.

                        But let me be blunt: 'partnership'
                        doesn't mean 'helping NASA spend its
                        money'. You'll have skin in the game.

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE - DAY

           Elon drops off a folder to a surprised Worden. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Here's our Falcon 1 report to go
                        along with yours. I don't want any

                                 GENERAL WORDEN
                        I appreciate that.  Ready to quit?

                        Never. Just getting started. 

           EXT. TESLA, FACTORY, SAN CARLOS, CA - DAY

           CHYRON: Tesla Factory.  San Carlos, CA.

           A Tesla prototype, or "MULE", pulls onto a makeshift TRACK
           beside the factory.  It looks like a mutated Lotus Elise. 
           Not a very pretty thing.  

           The driver's ready, waits for the signal. It's GREEN.  He
           SHOOTS off the line like a Ferrari.  Track speedometer clocks
           it: 3.9 seconds. 

           The mule pulls up to Martin and JB.  The driver takes off
           his helmet. It's Elon. The doors don't work so he jumps out. 

                                 JB STRAUBEL
                        6,381 batteries in that sucker.  230
                        miles range.  But it can do better.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        So fucking cool, man. Just beautiful. 

                                 MARTIN EBERHARD
                        Thank you.  The look is - 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        - Shit, Martin.  It's shit. 

           Elon inspects it, tucks wires in. He's visually unimpressed.
                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Martin, it needs to kick ass.  The
                        first "cool" electric car. 

           Elon hands Martin the key.  JB and Elon high five.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        We only get one chance at a first
                        impression.  If it doesn't delight
                        customers, it's over.  So when you
                        modify it, focus on "cool".

           INT. NASA HQ, MICHAEL GRIFFIN'S OFFICE - DAY

           Griffin meets with Elon. They have grown distant since Russia. 
           Griffin reviews a file he has on SpaceX.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        What's our delivery schedule like if
                        we decide to help you?  

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        You have until August to deliver
                        your proposal.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Proposal?  Isn't having a real,
                        functioning rocket company better
                        than any proposal? 

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        Not if your rocket explodes. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Oh, I haven't missed your pessimism. 
                        You still don't believe I can do it,
                        huh? You think I'm the rich schmuck?

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        You're giving 24 year olds full
                        authority to run around buying cheap
                        makeshift parts for space travel.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        What difference does it make to you
                        how much the parts cost? 

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        Cheap shit is cheap for a reason.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Legacy parts breed legacy costs so -

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        Elon, I know you believe anything's
                        possible and that's part of your

                        "sell". This is the big leagues. You
                        don't know all that you don't know.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        By definition, does anybody? 

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        This gets voted on. That's the
                        reality.  You remember reality, right? 
                        That thing that's always in your
                        way?  So here's some more free advice:
                        play by the rules and take all the
                        help you can get. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'll write your proposal, but put us
                        in the program.  What could possibly
                        happen?  We fail.  And you get to
                        stay on your very high horse. 
                            (beat)
                        Or we succeed. And wouldn't that
                        just be a real fuckin' tragedy.   

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, CAPE CANAVERAL, FL - DAY

           A gathering at an outdoor press conference. SpaceX, RpK, and
           NASA are on stage. Griffin speaks.  

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        We are pleased to announce RpK...and
                        SpaceX...are the winners of the COTS
                        Phase 1 rocket development contracts.

           EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, CAPE CANAVERAL, FL - LATER

           It's a full cocktail party celebrating the agreement.  Guests
           are primarily comprised of NASA, RpK and SpaceX executives. 

           Gwynne, the only one still reviewing the COTS agreement,
           catches Elon by the punch bowl.  She's concerned.  

                                 GWYNNE SHOTWELL
                        'NASA will be on site to review and
                        approve all design and manufacturing. 
                        Partial payments of Phase 1's $278
                        million will be due only after each
                        of the 19 milestones are met.'

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Half of these we won't get done for
                        another 3 years.  They are hedging. 

                                 GWYNNE SHOTWELL
                        You knew it was on purpose? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Wasn't it odd to you that Boeing or
                        Lockheed didn't compete at all? 
                        NASA hopes this fails so they can
                        stop being pressured to go commercial. 
           Elon closes the agreement for her and hands Gwynne a drink. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        As long as we get to orbit, none of
                        that matters.  They'll have to give
                        us the I.S.S. resupply contract.    

                                 GWYNNE SHOTWELL
                        We'll need more machines, more
                        manufacturing, more staff -  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        - Gwynne, that's what I'm here for.  

           LATER, PAD 39a

           Elon wanders alone to see the pad up close. Alone means MB
           is a step behind him awaiting his every command. The two of
           them are puny next to the monolithic structure.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Did you know Apollo 11 took off from
                        this very pad?  Right at our feet! 

           OVER SFX: Transmissions from Apollo missions.  Elon hears
           them in his head as he marvels at the pad's place in history.

                                 MARY BETH
                        I'm sorry Elon, but we need to be in
                        Santa Monica by 8pm. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        One day.  One day I'm going to fly
                        from right here.  

                                 MARY BETH
                        All the way to Mars. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        That's right.  In my own capsule.  I
                        need the extra leg room.  

           Elon walks back the way he came.  MB quickly follows. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Come.  Let's go change the world.

                        After much anticipation, PayPal
                        founder and tech-visionary Elon Musk
                        is finally ready to show off one of
                        his keynote projects... 

           INT. DEBUTANTE BALL, BARKER HANGER, SANTA MONICA - DUSK

           Elon is on stage with a mic, the emcee of the evening.
                                 ELON MUSK
                        The Tesla Roadster! 

           FLASH!  The Roadster center-stage on full display.  It looks
           magnificent.  Cameras, press, and fans come to admire it. 

           CHYRON: July, 2006.  Tesla Roadster Test Drive Event. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Faster than a Ferrari, more efficient
                        than a Prius. 

           The buzz is palpable. Stars like SCHWARZENEGGER, DICAPRIO,
           and SPIELBERG are in attendance. They speak to engineers,
           the real stars of the night.

           LATER, CENTER-STAGE -- Martin takes over to do the Q&A. 
           Elon stands beside him.  Martin is mid-answer.

                                 MARTIN EBERHARD
                        No, the Roadster won't be sold at
                        dealerships.  We sell memberships
                        for our early customers to keep the
                        price at a reasonable $85,000.  
                            (silence, waits)
                        Are there any more questions?

                                 POTENTIAL CUSTOMER
                        Elon, when can we go to Mars?

           The crowd laughs. Elon chuckles, delighted for the spotlight. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        As soon as I sell enough cars! 

           Large APPLAUSE. The crowd loves him.

           LATER, OUTSIDE -- Elon finds Martin watching the test drives. 
           A TEST DRIVER opens the passenger door for the next potential
           customer: ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER.  Press surround him.

                                 MARTIN EBERHARD
                        We need more money for production to
                        match this kind of order size.    

                                 ELON MUSK
                        That's fine. I'll lead another round. 
                        Are we on schedule to go from
                        development to production in Q3?  

                                 MARTIN EBERHARD
                        We're not there yet.  I need to focus
                        on fixing the 2 speed transmission.

           Schwarzenegger takes up half the car with his frame.  The
           car TAKES OFF!  It rockets down the track.  Elon is livid.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It's an electric car.  We can regulate
                        torque however the fuck we want.  It
                        doesn't need a 2 speed transmission.  
                            (calms himself)
                        What does the group think?  
                                 MARTIN EBERHARD
                        It's not a group decision.  I'm CEO. 
                        It's my decision.  

           Elon bites his tongue for a moment, trying to placate.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It can't affect the $85,000 price
                        tag.  And it can't go overbudget.  

           Griffin ignores him as Schwarzenegger returns from his drive.
           The press awaits a response... Arnold puffs his cigar and
           GRINS. The Roadster is officially approved by The Governator.  

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Look at that. We were an idea before. 
                        Now we have expectations...
                        Congratulations, Martin.

                                 MARTIN EBERHARD
                        You too, Elon.  

           The rivalry apparent to both. Elon leaves Martin to take the
           lead in greeting Arnold.  The two pose for pictures together. 

                                 CNN REPORTER (V.O.)
                        The debut of Elon Musk's Tesla
                        Roadster could not have gone better. 
                        Pre-orders are already sold out with
                        shipments expected in mid-2007.

           EXT. BURNING MAN - DAY (2006)

           Fire shoots out of a man's mouth as he spits gas through a
           torch.  Burning Man brings hordes of free spirits in cars 
           to spend a week escaping today's world.   

           Justine, Elon, and Elon's cousins, PETER and LYNDON RIVE,
           exit their luxury camper van into the MAD MAX style arena.  

           Kimbal is already there in his own van waiting to greet them. 
           He's not really sober at the moment. 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Is that Iron Man?!  Here??

           They give each other a big bear hug and begin the festivities. 

           LATER, EAST SECTION -- Three 40 foot climbable POLES stand
           for people to conquer their inner warrior. Elon observes. 

           Peter and Lyndon find him. They grew up in Pretoria too but
           never lost their accents or comfort in hot, dusty climates. 

                                 LYNDON RIVE
                        I love it here - reminds me of home.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It does... 

           He looks back at Kimbal leading a large group of dancing,
           cheerful people - including Justine.  Elon smiles. 
                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        ...and it doesn't.  

           The sun blinds him, he quickly turns and shades his eyes. 
           Now in his view is a BURNER holding a MAGNIFYING GLASS to
           sticks.  The sticks catch fire.  Elon sees something more.

           MUSK LAND: The festival VANISHES into acres of flat surface.
           Solar panels appear. The suns rays visibly draw into them.
           Equations for Kw; output; panels - increase at absurd rates. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Did you know, if you occupied the
                        same land as a nuclear power plant
                        and replaced it with solar panels,
                        you'd create more energy?  With about
                        200 sq km of solar panels we could
                        power the entire U.S. 

                                 LYNDON RIVE
                        When d'ya start thinkin' about this? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Always.  Tesla is renewable energy
                        consumption.  Solar is renewable
                        energy production. Eventually I want
                        Tesla to be solar powered.  With our
                        battery, we could be energy positive.    

                                 LYNDON RIVE
                        Is SpaceX using renewable energy? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        We can't. The whole Newton's 3rd law
                        thing.  We need that reaction. 

                                 PETER RIVE
                        E, you sellin' solar panels now?

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You don't sell.  You lease like a
                        car. Infrastructure would then be in
                        the $10 million range, I'm guessing.

           Elon knows he's onto something.  He grows more confident and
           starts eyeing up one of the poles for his own climb.  

                                 LYNDON RIVE
                        E, give us $10 million and we'll do
                        it. You don't worry about a thing.  

           Impulsively, Elon CLIMBS onto a pole. He clenches it for
           dear life. Unlike other climbers, he shimmies his whole body. 

           On the ground, Peter HITS his brother in the arm. 

                                 PETER RIVE
                        Don't ask our cousin for money. 
                        Rude sonofabitch sometimes. 

                                 ELON MUSK (O.S.)
                        Okay!  
           Peter and Lyndon look around for where Elon is. Shockingly,
           they see he's already half-way up!  And still climbing higher.   

                                 LYNDON RIVE
                        Okay, what, mate? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        $10 million. It's yours.  

           Elon reaches the top.  He sits on the stump, no support
           protecting him. The crowd CHEERS below.  Elon ROARS!

           MONTAGE: 

           MUSIC over a CNN PROFILE PIECE on Elon.

                                 CNN REPORTER  (V.O.)
                        Elon Musk is quickly becoming our
                        hope for the future of humanity.

           EXT. INC. MAGAZINE PHOTO SHOOT - DAY

           Elon poses for a photo shoot. FLASH!  The image FREEZES. It
           becomes the cover of Inc. Entrepreneur of the Year 2007.

           ELON ON MORE MAGAZINE COVERS: Wired, Discover, Time, etc. 

           EXT. NECKER ISLAND, BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS - DAY

           Helicopter flyby reveals Richard Branson's Billionaire Island. 
           On the BEACHFRONT, Larry Page is getting married. Justine
           and Elon are in attendance. 

                                 CNN REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Part playboy.  Part tech genius.
                        Part family man. 

           INT. MUSK HOME, LOS ANGELES - DAY

           This is Elon's real private life: a playpen for the twins,
           now 2, a COOK, a HOUSE KEEPER.  Three NANNIES to hold his
           newborn TRIPLETS! Elon bought all the help he needed.  

           He kisses Justine and leaves for the day.  She's used to it.

           EXT. TESLA, FACTORY - TEST TRACK - SAN CARLOS, CA - DAY

           Elon races a Roadster with a delighted reporter/passenger.

                                 CNN REPORTER (V.O.)
                        He's ramping up the car industry
                        with his electric masterpiece Tesla. 

           INT. TESLA, BOARD ROOM - DAY

           The Tesla Board is up to 7 members. The original 3 founders,
           Elon, and 3 "Musk Men": JB, Larry Page, and VantagePoint CEO
           ANTONIO GRACIAS.  They are in the midst of voting on an issue. 

           The Musk Men wait for Elon to vote first. He raises his hand
           as a YES vote. They follow and vote YES. Elon's power grows. 
           BACK TO MUSK'S KITCHEN -- Elon types on Tesla's website. 
           (NOTE: this is still on Tesla's website to this very day) 

           IN SHORT, THE MASTER PLAN IS:(cid:13)
           -Build sports car (cid:13)
           -Use that money to build an affordable car (cid:13)
           -Use that money to build an even more affordable car (cid:13)
           -While doing above, also provide zero emission electric power
           generation options (cid:13)
           -Don't tell anyone.

           INT. SOLAR CITY, BOARD ROOM, SAN MATEO - DAY

           Elon signs the investment deal.  Across are Peter and Lyndon.

                        He's getting us off the grid as the
                        Chairman of Solar City.  

           INT. VALLEY VIEW SUN FOUNDATION, BALLROOM - DAY

           In front of a more excited, engaged crowd, Elon is now the
           speaker of the Mars Society. It is a proud moment for him. 

                                 CNN REPORTER (V.O.)
                        And, of course, he's taking us to
                        Mars with his rockets at SpaceX. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        We will get to Mars! And we will do
                        it in this lifetime.  

                                 CNN REPORTER (V.O.)

                        Like what you do.  Life's too short. 
                        If you like what you do, you think
                        about it even when you're not working.

           INT. MUSK HOME, MASTER BEDROOM, LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Elon and Justine are turning down for bed. Justine feels
           tortured having to listen to yet another Elon idea. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Propulsive landing now?

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Yea! It's the key to reducing cost.
                        I mean it'd be kind of weird in a
                        movie if aliens landed by parachute.
                        It'd be like, "Okay. Nothing to fear."

                                 JUSTINE
                        So we're the aliens now? 
                                 ELON MUSK
                        When we land on Mars, we will be. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        If you say so.  

           EXT. SPACEX, FACTORY, HAWTHORNE - MORNING

           The sun rises over 11.4 acres of new SpaceX property.

           CHYRON: January, 2007. 1 Rocket Road, Hawthorne, CA.

           INT. SPACEX, FACTORY, HAWTHORNE - DAY

           Hawthorne is light years ahead of El Segundo.  500 employees
           work in-house on assembly, manufacturing, storage, etc.  Raw
           materials go in, rockets come out. 

           INT. SPACEX, OFFICE, HAWTHORNE - DAY

           The new offices have a Silicon Valley feel in design and
           efficiency. Low walls, open cubicles, Red "Mars" motif.  MB

           INT. SPACEX, FACTORY, HAWTHORNE - DAY

           NASA makes notes on clipboards at each terminal.  Gwynne
           watches them observing work, noting the job of one WELDER. 

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        Why is he trying to build the nozzle
                        lock?  India sells it at cost.  

           The welder stops and addresses him. 

                                 WELDER
                        Legacy parts breed legacy costs.  

           He takes off his helmet and approaches.  It's Elon!

                        That nozzle costs $17 on the open

                        He produces them in-house. It costs
                        us $3 per unit now. That's why. 

           Griffin reluctantly bites his tongue.

           EXT. VANITY FAIR PARTY, VALET, HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           Elon pulls up in a Roadster prototype. The crowds can't stop
           staring at it. People come up to take pictures with the car. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Now, we look like Bond Villains. 
                                 ELON MUSK
                        Pierce Brosnan Bond Villains, maybe.  

           EXT. VANITY FAIR PARTY, HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           Absolute bedlam.  Hundreds of celebrities, models, rappers.
           Champagne flows.  Deejays blast music. Bartenders.  Ice luges. 

           MOVING THROUGH THE CROWD, it's as much a work event as it is
           a party. A gala to the rich and powerful - Hollywood Elite.

           In the center of it all: Elon! He gives the same "propulsive
           landing" talk. Unlike Justine, everyone soaks it up! Geek is
           now cool. They've never had someone like him at these parties.  

           OFF IN A CORNER -- Justine is by herself, staring at Elon. 
           He's so far away and growing more distant.

           Kimbal comes by, absorbing the craziness of this party and
           his brother at its chic center.  

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        I never thought I'd see the day when
                        Elon is the coolest person at a party. 

           She dismisses Kimbal, enjoying her drink.  

                                 KIMBAL MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Don't tell me you're jealous?

                                 JUSTINE
                        No!  Let him tackle the larger issues
                        of space exploration and clean energy
                        and general let's-not-destroy-
                        ourselves-first human advancement. 
                        All I want to do is turn out my daily
                        five-to-ten pages, read to the kids,
                        then to myself, hit the gym.  Recycle.

           Elon notices her in the corner and excuses himself. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        There are people here for your book.

           He grabs her hand and leads her to be swept up in the hoopla. 

           INT. SPACEX, OFFICE, HAWTHORNE - DAY

           Gwynne gets to her desk at work and sees a full cup of coffee. 
           Elon sticks out his hand, waves. He's there before everyone. 

           LATER, CAPSULE TEST ROOM -- Elon reviews works with Hans.
           YELLING and LAUGHING can be heard from the factory.  Elon
           ignores it, but it grows too loud.  He leaves to investigate.  

           FACTORY FLOOR -- Elon sees his employees all gathered around
           something.  Elon breaks up the crowd. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Unless Chris's tie is caught in the
                        landing gear again and someone has a
                        camera this time, get back to work.  
           Elon moves to the front. The throng opens up.  Then Elon
           sees - it's ROBERT DOWNEY JR.! Iron Man! Elon's star struck. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        I...I can't believe its Iron Man! 

                                 ROBERT DOWNEY JR.
                        I go by Robert most days. So nice to
                        meet you. Though Iron Man is why I'm
                        here. Technology is like an extension
                        of Tony Stark's mind.  And well - 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        - You need to know our technology?  

                                 ROBERT DOWNEY JR.
                        No...I need to know you. 

           Elon gets a text - Hans: "Is that Robert Downey Jr.?"   
           Elon looks up and sees Hans's face pressed against the window.

           LATER, OTHER SIDE OF THE FACTORY

           Elon and RDJ stand in awe beside a real DRAGON CAPSULE.  

                                 ROBERT DOWNEY JR. (CONT'D)
                        So this is really going to take us
                        to Mars some day.  Wow! Where do
                        ideas like this come from? Divine
                        Intervention? Drugs? A Fortune Cookie? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Well, I suppose I start by thinking
                        from a First Principles perspective. 

                                 ROBERT DOWNEY JR.
                        What is that? Can anyone do it? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Sure. First Principles asks you to
                        boil things down to their fundamental
                        truths and say, "What are we sure is
                        true?"  Then reason up from there. 

                                 ROBERT DOWNEY JR.
                        Yea, you lost me. I'm more of a visual
                        learner.  Maybe some examples. 

           INT. IRON MAN SET - DAY

           The conversation continues on a set tour, Justine with them. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        People used to say, "Nobody wants a
                        car because horses are great: there
                        are lots of them, they eat grass,
                        and there's no gasoline to buy."  

                                 ROBERT DOWNEY JR.
                        We know how that worked out.
                                 ELON MUSK
                        Exactly!  People now say, "Nobody
                        wants electric cars because gas cars
                        are great: we have them, gas is cheap,
                        and batteries will always cost $600
                        per kwh and that's too expensive."
                            (beat)
                        First Principles would ask, "What
                        are batteries made of?  What is the
                        spot market value of the material?"
                            (lists)
                        You got: cobalt, nickel, aluminum,
                        carbon, some polymers for separation,
                        and a sealed can.  

                                 ROBERT DOWNEY JR.
                        How much to buy it all separately? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        $80 per kwh.  So all you need are
                        clever ways to combine it and -

                                 ROBERT DOWNEY JR.
                        - you get batteries cheap enough to
                        change electric cars forever.  Wow. 

           Elon looks for Justine's approval at his answer.  RDJ notices.

                                 ROBERT DOWNEY JR. (CONT'D)
                        And how long have you two -

                                 ELON MUSK
                        - going on 14 years. 

                                 ROBERT DOWNEY JR.
                        Justine, what's it like being married
                        to a "Man from Tomorrow" so to speak? 

           Justine sees Elon's worry; she is careful with her words.

                                 JUSTINE
                        Well... You and everyone else sees
                        this tech billionaire genius. I don't. 
                            (beat)
                        I still see the boy from South Africa
                        I met my first week of my first year
                        at Queen's University in Canada. He
                        invited me out for ice cream - 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        - she stood me up. 

           They reminisce together.  Justine glows from nostalgia.

                                 JUSTINE
                        Of course.  C'mon, I was - 

           She points to her own model-esque figure. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        And I was - 
           Elon points for comparison between his face and RDJ's. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        But, he refused to take no for an
                        answer, until I finally caved.  
                            (resentment brewing)
                        He is brilliant.  But also relentless,
                        you see. Single-minded.  Unstoppable.
                        Difficult.  Critical. "My way or the
                        highway" kind of man... 

           She squeezes his hand. Elon's collar is getting hot. 

           INT. MUSK HOME, FRONT ENTRANCE, LOS ANGELES - LATE NIGHT

           Elon says goodbye to Justine.  He rolls his suitcase out
           first before exiting. The door shuts. Justine is alone again. 

                                 JUSTINE (V.O.)
                        ...Nobody truly knows or understands
                        the sacrifices he had to make to
                        become the man he is today.

           She leans against the door. The cathedral ceilings illustrate
           the loneliness she feels in this big, empty house.  

           BACK TO IRON MAN SET -- She hides her sadness with poise.  

                                 ROBERT DOWNEY JR.
                        Determination.  Sacrifice.  Wants to
                        make the world a better place. All
                        the makings of a superhero, I'd say. 

           Justine smiles, but deep down only she knows that's his curse. 

           INT. MUSK HOME, MASTER BEDROOM, LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Justine walks into her bedroom.  Alone. 

           INT. ELON'S PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

           Elon is on his way to Kwaj, still working on his laptop.

           INT. MUSK HOME, MASTER BEDROOM, LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Justine can't sleep.  Elon's side is still tucked in.    
           Two people literally and figuratively worlds apart. 

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           The team is frantic to get off the island.   

                                 SPACEX MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                        Launch is ready. T-minus 10....9... 

           CHYRON: March 21st, 2007. Falcon 1, Test #2.  

           INT. MISSION CONTROL TRAILER - DAY

           Elon watches the launch from the now operational trailer.
           Worden and NASA are present, observing.   
           Elon puts on a headset, flashes a maverick smile.  Showtime! 

           INT. SPACEX, MISSION CONTROL, HAWTHORNE - CONTINUOUS

           The mecca of SpaceX.  80 terminals surrounded by three glass
           walls that overlook the factory floor.  2 stories worth of
           monitors on the fourth wall.  Gwynne and the larger Mission
           Control team watch Stage 1 break Earth's atmosphere.  

           CHEERS from employees on the other side of the glass wall.

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           The setup for Falcon 1 Test #2 is exactly as before.  The
           deluge SPRAYS.  The rocket IGNITES.

                                 SPACEX MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                        We have ignition. 

           The Falcon 1 flies straight and perfect. 

                                 SPACEX MISSION CONTROL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Systems are nominal.  Ready Stage 2.

           EXT. LOW EARTH ORBIT:

           Unlike Test #1, this rocket reaches the floor of outer space.  
           Stage 1 separates, dropping to Earth. Stage 2 ignites. 

           INSIDE ROCKET:

           The LIQUID OXYGEN fuel in the tank SLOSHES. 

           INT. MISSION CONTROL TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

           The sloshing causes Stage 2 to gyrate during acceleration.

                                 TOM MUELLER (O.S.)
                        I don't like the way she wiggles. 

                                 SPACEX MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                        T +4 minutes.  Stage 2 on target. 

           The wiggling increases into FLAILING. The force at those
           speeds RIPS the rocket in two. 

           The entire upper stage EXPLODES! Mission Failure...    

           There is collective disappointment, except NASA, basking in
           Elon's comeuppance.  He is quick to address the group.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        We hit Stage 2. Our rocket technically
                        was in space. Incredible progress.
                        We're closer. We really are, guys.  

           The monitor still shows the flaming rocket falling into the
           ocean.  The feed REWINDS to the explosion and it replays.  

           LATER -- The trailer has been cleared out. Elon clicks and
           watches the broadcast alone. REWINDS. Watches all over again.  
           Elon is sick with failure. The emotion quickly fades, replaced
           only with his obsession to solve the problem.

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE - DAY

           Worden flips through the latest report while Elon watches.

                                 GENERAL WORDEN
                        LOX sloshing overflow.  Solutions?

                                 ELON MUSK
                        We're testing a new Kestrel casing
                        to secure the run off. 

                                 GENERAL WORDEN
                        What does Griffin think?

           Elon doesn't want to refer to Griffin by name. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        NASA has slowed our progress.  I'm
                        developing the casing myself. 

                                 GENERAL WORDEN
                        NASA is trying to help you.  Let
                        them...or you could just quit.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'd rather commit seppuku than quit. 
                        It's expected we'll lose some battles,
                        but we'll win the war.  

           Worden closes the report, happy with Elon's resolve.  

                                 GENERAL WORDEN
                        Let's call that one a demo.  Load
                        TacSat-2 on the next one. And can
                        you stop blowing up my stuff, please? 

           INT. TESLA, FACTORY, SAN CARLOS, CA - DAY

           Elon gives Kimbal the tour. Kimbal marvels at new red assembly
           machines autonomously constructing car parts. 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Which Tesla are you giving Iron Man
                        for his collection? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I kinda like this gray one.  

           They stop at the first Roadster off the assembly line. Elon
           hops into the Roadster and starts it, but it won't turn on.  

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        JB, this one doesn't work. 

                                 JB STRAUBEL
                        This whole row doesn't actually.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        How many are like this?! 
                                 JB STRAUBEL
                        Maybe a third? Hard to tell. Most of
                        them haven't shipped back to us yet.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Will we still make November? 

                                 JB STRAUBEL
                        November 2009 maybe.  

           Elon spots Martin farther away.  He fucked this all up...

           INT. LOTUS FACTORY, LONDON - DAY

           Elon walks the floor with an OPERATIONS MANAGER.  Lotus
           assembly moves rapidly everywhere.  Elon has to shout. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You're 3 months behind schedule.
                        Where are all the Teslas?  

                                 OPERATIONS MANAGER
                        In the back. 

           They walk until Elon spots a single row of Teslas.  ZERO ARE
           FINISHED! None are even being worked on. It's quiet here.

           EXT. BATTERY FACTORY, THAILAND - DAY

           Elon arrives at what he expects to be his factory.  

           INT. BATTERY FACTORY, THAILAND - DAY

           It's a corrupt assembly operation. Empty. Dusty. Equipment
           is covered in salt deposits.  A concrete manufacturing tomb. 
           Elon is disturbed at the sight.  Something must be done. 

           INT. TESLA, BOARD ROOM - DAY

           The entire Tesla Board meets without Martin.  Speaking is
           TIM WATKINS aka "The Money Man", 40s. His specialty is finding
           where the money goes. They read his report on the Roadster. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        We have a battery factory in Thailand,
                        panels in France, motors in Taiwan,
                        bodies in England - all shipped here.
                        How the fuck did this happen??  

                                 ANTONIO GRACIAS
                        Just how bad is it? What's the number?

                                 TIM WATKINS
                        Your stated car valuation was $85,000. 
                        The actual valuation is $200,000. 

                                 LARRY PAGE
                        Fuck! That's a new Lamborghini.  For
                        that money, do they at least work? 
                                 TIM WATKINS
                        The Roadster was also revealed to
                        have 14 separate issues that will
                        cause a full system shutdown. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        We basically have to reboot the entire
                        car from scratch.  What's the overage? 

                                 TIM WATKINS
                        Forecast puts your overage at $40
                        million dollars for production. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Okay. We do another $40 million round.
                        I'll put in half if you all match. 

           Larry questions the math of Elon's wealth.  Elon answers it. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Yes, it's the last of my Paypal
                        reserve, but I don't care.  We can
                        fix this and produce the Roadster we
                        promised. These are management
                        mistakes, not investment mistakes.

                                 ANTONIO GRACIAS
                        What are we doing about those
                        management mistakes? 

           They all look to Elon. He knows what they want. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        No, I can't become CEO...I need to
                        spend more time at home as it is.  

                                 LARRY PAGE
                        Martin has taken this company as far
                        as it can go. He doesn't have your
                        ability to deliver. We need you, E.

           Elon mulls it over, then checks his watch and quickly panics. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Shit! I'm gonna be late for J's book
                        release.  I'll think about it. Thanks. 

           INT. MUSK HOME, MASTER BEDROOM, LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Justine finishes her makeup.  Her ASSISTANT shows her dress
           options.  An entourage of people put her together.  This is
           her night. Elon holds a bouquet of long stem roses.  

                                 JUSTINE
                        What do you mean you're investing
                        more?  How much more? What's wrong?
                            (to Assistant)
                        The red one, Jeanie.  The book is
                        called Bloodangel.  C'mon. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        $20 million.  It maintains my share
                        percentage. There's more... J?  
           She's too frazzled to listen.  She doesn't know what else
           she forgot to do.  As she wanders off, Elon BLURTS out -  

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        I'm considering becoming CEO. 

           She stops.  He finally went there. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Elon, no.  You promised me. The kids
                        need their father. I need my husband. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I wouldn't do it if I didn't think I
                        had to. Otherwise Tesla will fail.

                                 JUSTINE
                        Who gives a shit? Let it fail.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        What do you mean, "let it fail?" I
                        can't just let it fail.

                                 JUSTINE
                        Why?  You said it's okay to fail.
                        Companies fail all the time.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        These companies are like my kids. I
                        can't watch one of them die. 

           Justine erupts on him.  He had to make that point?  

                                 JUSTINE
                        It is nothing like watching a child
                        die! 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'm sorry, I didn't mean that - 

           He's cut off by her assistant, motioning it's time to go.

                                 JUSTINE
                        Why don't you just stay home tonight? 
                        I'm used to you not being around. 

           She leaves him still holding the bouquet.  

           INT. SPACEX, FACTORY, HAWTHORNE - DAY

           Elon still thinks about his decision.  He walks through the
           factory floor, his place of peace. The workers all look busy,
           talking to each other in harmony. In one word: efficient. 

           Elon continues walking... 

           INT. TESLA, FACTORY, SAN CARLOS, CA - DAY

           ...only now he's at Tesla.  The machines aren't running. 
           Departments silently stick to themselves.  In one word:
           inefficient.  To Elon, another comes to mind: unacceptable.  
           INT. AUTOMOTIVE CONFERENCE - DAY

           Martin reviews notecards backstage. He's the guest speaker. 
           His assistant whispers something and hands him a cellphone.

                                 MARTIN EBERHARD
                        What was the final number? 

           Martin paces back and forth. Stress oozes from his pores. 

           INT./EXT. MALIBU - DAY

           Elon takes command of his empire like Tony Stark would.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        $200,000. Per car. 
                            (silence)
                        Expectations, Martin...

           INT. AUTOMOTIVE CONFERENCE - DAY

                                 HOST (O.S.)
                        Welcome Tesla CEO, Martin Eberhard! 

           The audience CHEERS.  Martin's face falls. It's over. 

           INT. TESLA, CONFERENCE ROOM, SAN CARLOS, CA - DAY

           Elon meets with the remaining execs.  Everyone is on edge.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        With Martin and now Ian gone, there
                        are going to be a lot of changes
                        here, starting with personnel.  

           The executives all look worried for their jobs. Elon shows
           his strength and leadership in a room full of fear. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        I don't suffer fools.  The minimum
                        passing grade is 'excellent'.  The
                        minimum passing emotion is 'happy'. 
                        It's not okay be unhappy and part of
                        this company. If you're not happy,
                        you get divorced.  

           That last part slipped out. He stops, but quickly moves on. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        We haven't shipped one Roadster yet. 
                        That changes today. 

           INT. TESLA, FACTORY, SAN CARLOS, CA - DAY

           Elon continues the meeting on the floor with his executive
           team.  He carries his own Ikea desk.   

                                 ELON MUSK
                        We'll work nights, weekends, sleep
                        under desks, until it's completed. 
                                 JB STRAUBEL
                        These guys need some kind of a break. 
                        They need to see their families. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You'll have a lot of time to see
                        your families when we go bankrupt.

           He passes in front of newly installed BATTERY EQUIPMENT taken
           from Thailand. He DROPS his desk in the middle of the factory.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        What we have to do is fucking hard. 
                        That's why you must use max effort.

           LATER -- Engineers put 70 batteries together to form the
           "brick". The teams are testing it in cold and hot air.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        I want you to think ahead and think
                        so hard every day that your head
                        hurts at night when you go to bed. 

           LATER -- Engineers lower a brick into a Roadster chassis.
           Elon walks over and points out something they did wrong.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Let's do it again.  Let's go. 

           Elon's hard charging ways push them to work like they never
           have before. They do it again.  

           EXT. JEFF SKOLL HOME - NIGHT

           Elon checks the time.  2:00am.  He knocks.  Jeff answers. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It was too late to drive back to LA.

                                 JEFF SKOLL
                        Come on in, buddy. I've got room.

           LATER, EXTRA BEDROOM -- Elon texts Justine, "Love U G'Nite." 
           He crawls into bed, head hurts. He practices what he preaches.  

           INT. TESLA, FACTORY, SAN CARLOS, CA - MORNING

           The morning carpool of engineers enters at the same time
           only to find Elon is already at his desk, drinking coffee,
           watching brake pad simulations on the system. 

           LATER -- Elon finalizes tweaks on a nearly ready Roadster.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Good job everybody.  It's a start.   

           INT. MUSK HOME, LIVING ROOM, LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Elon opens the door.  The exhausted warrior is finally home.
           He picks up a triplet and relaxes on the couch with him. 

           LATER, TWINS' ROOM -- XAVIER, 3, strokes a bandaid on his
           cheek while talking with his parents. We HEAR Justine's blog.  
                                 JUSTINE (V.O.)
                        During our nightly bedtime chat, my
                        son told us how a bully tripped him
                        to score the winning soccer goal.  

                                 XAVIER MUSK
                        I didn't cry!  Not once!

           He puffs his chest, looking to Elon for praise.

                                 JUSTINE (V.O.)
                        Only four and he's already learning
                        to suck it up and move on.

           Justine glares at Elon as she kisses her son's cheek and
           holds him tight.  During the embrace - 

                                 JUSTINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It's no secret since he's profiled
                        in everything from Wired to Discovery
                        that E grew up in a male-dominated
                        family in a male-dominated culture,
                        and works in a male-dominated
                        industry.  He lives in a highly
                        competitive world. 

                                 XAVIER MUSK
                        I'm so mad we lost. It's not fair! 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Xavier, in this world there are
                        winners and losers.  Fairly or
                        unfairly. In this case, you lost. 

                                 JUSTINE (V.O.)
                        He's done very well in that world.

           Justine smacks Elon's arm. Elon calms her. He wasn't finished.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        But that's okay. Daddy fails all the
                        time. It's how we learn to win.  

                                 XAVIER MUSK
                        But they laughed and made fun of me.  

                                 JUSTINE
                        Did it hurt your feelings?  Because
                        it's okay to have those feelings.

           Elon accidentally undermines her point.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Don't listen to it.  Those bullies
                        are all noise and sound. You just
                        focus on hearing your sound.
                            (Off Xavier's confusion)
                        There's a signal in your brain that
                        you know is true.  And it will make
                        you stronger than any bully in the
                        world. Hear the signal, not the sound. 
                        And one day, you'll win. Understand?  
           Xavier nods. This made some kind of sense to him. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Now, are you a winner or a loser?

                                 XAVIER MUSK
                        A winner!

           He brightens.  Elon wraps his loving arms around his boy.  

           INT. MUSK HOME, MASTER BEDROOM, LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Elon and Justine get ready side by side. It's sadly quiet, a
           growing space between them. As Elon helps her with a necklace - 

                                 JUSTINE
                        From now on, when you introduce me,
                        you will say that I'm a published
                        novelist, please. I won't be looked
                        at as some trophy wife.  Thank you.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Out of nowhere, but okay. Sure...

           INT. TESLA SHOWROOM, MENLO PARK - DAY

           Elon presents the first PRODUCTION ROADSTER to a happy crowd. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        This is only the beginning of the
                        beginning. We won't stop until every
                        car on the road is an electric car!

           OFF TO THE SIDE -- Antonio and Larry comment. 

                                 ANTONIO GRACIAS
                        One.  He made one car. 

                                 LARRY PAGE
                        Nobody works as hard as that guy. 
                        If Elon says they'll deliver the
                        cars, I believe him.  

                                 ANTONIO GRACIAS
                        And if he doesn't?  Each month we
                        spend millions with no cars, we kill
                        what the Tesla name has become.

                                 LARRY PAGE
                        Stop. I invested in Elon, not a brand.

                                 ANTONIO GRACIAS
                        I'm not talking about the brand. 
                        He's the face of this thing. If he
                        fails, this electric car revolution
                        he started fails with him.  

           LATER, MEET AND GREET -- Elon greets a potential ELDERLY
           BUYER. Justine hangs on Elon like arm candy.
                                 ELDERLY BUYER
                        My eldest passed 5 years ago.  Lung
                        cancer.  Didn't smoke a day in her
                        life. Doctors said it was the smog
                        in the air. We've gotta do something.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        That's why we're all here tonight. 
                        But we have a long way to go.  

                                 ELDERLY BUYER
                        We'll get there, won't we dear?  

           Justine politely smiles. Elon only now introduces her. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Sorry. This is my wife, Justine.  

           Justine waits. Her resentment is palpable. Elon doesn't
           understand. It's a painful beat before it clicks in his head. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Right, sorry - she reminded me to
                        tell people that she's a published
                        novelist. This is me telling you. 
                        Quite good books, all biases aside. 

           Elon thinks he did right.  To Justine, he's dead wrong.  

           INT. MUSK HOME, LIVING ROOM, LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Still in their dress clothes, she scolds him as loud as she
           can without waking the kids. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        What did I do? You told me what to
                        say.  I said it. I don't understand.  

                                 JUSTINE
                        You know what you did!  "Justine
                        wanted me to tell you." I don't care
                        where you fit on the autism spectrum,
                        you know that's rude.  Goodnight!

           Justine stomps up the stairs. She SLAMS her door. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'm always wrong...

           Elon pulls out a check as he continues muttering to himself. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        But she did order a car, right? 
                        Everything's fine.  This is good.

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           Thunderous rain blasts the island. Tim and his team are
           quickly trying to top off the fuel. 
           INT. MISSION CONTROL TRAILER - DAY

           Elon waits on the "Go ahead" from NASA.  They wave it off.

                                 SPACEX MISSION CONTROL
                        That is an abort launch.  Over.

           Elon throws his headset down and storms out. 

           INT. SPACEX, MISSION CONTROL, HAWTHORNE - DAY

           Elon finds Griffin beside one of the OPERATORS. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        This is bullshit!  We would've gotten
                        it refueled.  The panel would hold. 

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        I don't care that it could hold, the
                        thermal casing isn't regulated for
                        these weather conditions.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Bullshit!  You're wasting my time.  

                                 MICHAEL GRIFFIN
                        It's not your way or the highway
                        here.  Follow the rules.  

           INT. SOLAR CITY, BOARD ROOM, SAN MATEO - DAY

           Elon meets with Peter and Lyndon. Elon reviews their books.
           The Rives are grinning like idiots.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Let me guess?  Good news again.  

                                 LYNDON RIVE
                        Yep! Everything's great!

           The relief on Elon's face is priceless. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I love coming here.  

           EXT. TESLA GARAGE, MENLO PARK - NIGHT

           Construction is underway for the delivery infrastructure.
           Elon does an interview with SARAH LACEY again, now with Yahoo.

                                 SARAH LACEY, YAHOO
                        So... Electric cars.  You did it.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I did. And now you're the blogger? 

                                 SARAH LACEY, YAHOO
                        Online publisher. It's like a blog,
                        minus the dirt or gossip. Sometimes.
                                 ELON MUSK
                        I don't enjoy that part of celebrity. 
                        Sometimes people say false things
                        and I think, "My kids will read that
                        one day." Stuff that isn't even true.  

                                 SARAH LACEY, YAHOO
                        Stuff like Leo Dicaprio going to
                        your house and buying a Roadster in
                        cash?  Off the record, of course..

                                 ELON MUSK
                        No comment.  Which gossip blog do I
                        have to thank for that one?  

                                 SARAH LACEY, YAHOO
                        Your wife's blog.  Now she rumbles.   

           Elon seethes at the betrayal.  

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO CAFE - DAY

           Justine reads a book in peace.  

                                 JUSTINE (V.O.)
                        Love going into bookstores in San
                        Fran. Couldn't resist picking up
                        Gordon Ramsey's autobiography.

           Elon exits the cafe holding two coffees for him and Justine. 

                                 JUSTINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Yet another ferociously driven,
                        successful man who suffered an asshole
                        for a father.  

           Elon places Justine's in front of her and kisses her forehead. 

                                 JUSTINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I'm hardly saying that all uber-
                        successful people have brutal parents,
                        or that the child of a brutal parent
                        will grow up to be successful... 

           INT. MUSK HOME, MASTER BEDROOM, LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Elon READS THE BLOG in bed to an unapologetic Justine.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        ...But in my experience, especially
                        the last few years, among people I
                        know, there seems to be an uncommonly
                        common link.

           Elon CLICKS another entry.  He reads it to her. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        You know you've been married for a
                        while when you take a moment out
                        from arguing to decide to go to a
                        Maroon 5 concert, and then resume
                        arguing again.
           Elon CLICKS another entry.  He reads it to her.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        I'm dealing with the issue of just
                        where, exactly, to exercise this new
                        steel-like sense of discipline. Home
                        is no longer - and hasn't been for a
                        long time - a reliable, happy place
                        in which to get work done.

           Elon CLOSES the laptop, dumbfounded.  There's silence. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Just say something. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'm afraid to.  You'll put it on the
                        fucking internet. What is the matter
                        with you?  Our private lives are
                        ours and nobody else's. Understand? 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Don't talk to me like an employee. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        If you were an employee, I'd fire
                        you for this. Use your head, J, for
                        god's sake. I'm a public figure.  My
                        reputation makes sales.  

                                 JUSTINE
                        That you read all of this, and your
                        first thought was about your company - 

           She's CUT OFF by Elon's phone RINGING. It's Mueller.  He's
           torn between answering it or arguing with his upset wife.  

                                 JUSTINE (CONT'D)
                        I'm sure it's more important.  

           She chooses for him and walks away, leaving him alone.  

           EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER, HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           Thousands are outside for the Iron Man Premiere.  Elon walks
           on the red carpet with Justine.  He's in 7th Heaven.  

           Towards the front, RDJ answers a reporter's question. 

                                 ROBERT DOWNEY JR.
                        The inspiration for Tony Stark? It's
                        Elon Musk. He's the real Iron Man. 

           Cameras cut over to Elon. Justine taps him to turnaround and
           wave. Elon soaks in every minute of this red carpet moment. 

           LATER -- Elon interviews with those same reporters. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Hi, Elon Musk.  And this is my wife,
                        Justine. She's a published novelist.  
           Justine appreciates it, but it may be too little, too late. 

           INT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER, HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           A packed house watches the movie. Elon is glued to the screen.

           INTERCUT IRON MAN MOVIE AND ELON WATCHING THE MOVIE

           IRON MAN: Soars through the clouds, testing his limits.

           ELON: Smiles like a little boy, as his hero comes to life.

           IRON MAN: Has a glitch in his feet propulsion.  

           ELON: Giggles and points at the screen. He called it! 

           IRON MAN: Crashes into his lab destroying a few of his luxury
           cars. Behind him, one car was spared:  A TESLA ROADSTER!

           ELON: Tears up. His baby is on the screen. Validation.  

           EXT. IRON MAN PREMIERE AFTER PARTY, HOLLYWOOD - LATER

           Among the high profile crowd, Elon geeks out with Larry.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'm not putting J.A.R.V.I.S. in a
                        Roadster. It's dangerous. 

                                 LARRY PAGE
                        C'mon, why?  A.I. could autodrive
                        Teslas or order you coffee as you
                        drive.  Limitless possibilities! 

           Justine doesn't bother participating.  She's checked out.

           INT. MUSK HOME, MASTER BEDROOM, LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Elon and Justine undress from the premiere.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I don't like it. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Don't like what? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Larry's excitement for A.I. I should
                        start an R&D team and see where they
                        stand on it.  I'm thinking in Tokyo. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Are you fucking kidding me right
                        now?  You're thinking about stopping
                        robots from taking over the world. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It's a real concern. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Only to you and Larry.  
                                 ELON MUSK
                        Well just to me.  That's my point. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Just like you are the only one
                        concerned with getting us to Mars?

                                 ELON MUSK
                        That was rhetorical, right? 

                                 JUSTINE
                        You don't know any of this you're
                        building will work. Your rocket won't
                        fly.  Your electric car won't drive. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I won't fail. I can't. Too many people
                        are counting on me. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        And what if you do fail? What happens
                        then?  You gonna mortgage the house? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        If we have to mortgage the house,
                        then we do it. We'll live at Kimbal's.
                            (quoting Iron Man)
                        "There is nothing except this. The
                        next mission, and nothing else."  

                                 JUSTINE
                        Can you not hear how insane you sound?
                        You know that wasn't you on the
                        screen? You're not Iron Man. 

           Justine sees that he's too locked into his position. 

                                 JUSTINE (CONT'D)
                        In college, you were a guy who wanted
                        to make the world a better place.
                        And it was sweet and noble.  But
                        somewhere along the line you got
                        lost in your "vision" and you haven't
                        come back. Your mind is always
                        somewhere else. It's either Mars, or
                        electric cars or A.I. or flying cars - 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        - I disagree on flying cars for a
                        number of reasons, the first being - 

                                 JUSTINE
                        - Shut up!  I can't do this any more.

           Justine stops undressing and enters her walk-in closet. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        What are you doing?  

                                 JUSTINE
                        I'm leaving.  I can't live with half
                        a husband anymore.  I can't.
           Elon walks into the closet to see she's packing a suitcase.
           She can't see what she needs, she just packs.  (This is all
           highly unnecessary - her assistant could do this) 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You're packing?  This is ridiculous.

           With renewed confidence, she stops packing. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        You're right.  It is. 

           She goes back into the walk-in closet and comes back with
           HIS suitcase.  Places it on the bed and packs his things. 

                                 JUSTINE (CONT'D)
                        You leave. I actually live here.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        What do you mean? I live here. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        On which days of the week? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Yes, I'm working more now.  But our
                        kids are healthy and happy.  I've
                        never cheated.  I don't have a
                        substance problem.  I take you on
                        plenty of trips.  I don't see how I
                        haven't provided everything else you
                        needed.  I don't understand. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        I know you don't understand. That's
                        the problem... 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        How can I solve this?  Tell me.

                                 JUSTINE
                        Marriage isn't a physics problem,
                        Elon.  Maybe to you it is.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        J, please. What do I have to do?  I
                        won't leave until you tell me.  

           She stops packing and calms down enough to give him a chance.  

                                 JUSTINE
                        Answer one question: When? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        When, what?  Can you be more specific?

                                 JUSTINE
                        When will you finally stop?  When
                        will you accomplish enough to sit
                        beside me and say, "I did it."  We're 
                        50? 70? People are on Mars?  When?
           She holds out hope, but Elon can't lie to her. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Never...It will never end...

           Can this really be how it ends?  14 years.  5 kids.  

           Elon steps close to her. She retracts, but not from disgust -
           from the unfamiliar intimacy they lost a long time ago. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        I tried to be better. 

                                 JUSTINE
                        Failure is a part of learning, I
                        suppose.  

           He kisses her cheek. One last feeling of love.   They touch
           for the final time. He heads to the door. 

           INT./EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Musk drives off, tormented over his marriage.  

                                 JUSTINE (V.O.)
                        I am getting divorced. We married
                        young, took it as far as we could.

           EXT. JEFF SKOLL HOME - LATE NIGHT

           Elon knocks on Jeff's door.  Jeff opens and immediately gets
           the situation. Elon is a disheveled mess.

                                 JEFF SKOLL
                        Come on in, buddy.  I've got room.

                                 JUSTINE (V.O.)
                        In the end, I wanted smaller and
                        slower and closer where he wanted
                        grander and faster and farther. It
                        was a good run. And now it's over.  

           INT. JEFF SKOLL HOME, ELON'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Elon is now the one sleeping with one side still tucked in. 

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           CHYRON: August 2nd, 2008. Falcon 1, Test #3.

           The team scrambles to get everything strapped in and test
           every bolt. They raise the rocket as carefully as can be. 

           INT. SPACEX, FACTORY, HAWTHORNE - DAY

           Elon looks worn out.  Gwynne finds him. 

                                 GWYNNE SHOTWELL
                        Are you okay?  Nervous?  
                                 ELON MUSK
                        Yea. Probably all it is.  Come. Let's
                        fly this thing. 

           INT. SPACEX, MISSION CONTROL, HAWTHORNE - DAY

           Gwynne and Elon walk in to greet the Air Force and some NASA
           experts, including Griffin.  Mission Control is bustling
           with activity.  Crowds of employees gather outside to watch. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                            (to D.O.D.)
                        We have your satellite,
                            (to NASA)
                        And your...let's say "experiments". 

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           The Falcon 1 starting point is the same.  It's being pumped
           with fuel.  Then gets a full systems check.  

           INT. MISSION CONTROL TRAILER - DAY

           Elon has moved to the trailer. He is confident today.

                                 SPACEX MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                        Falcon 1 launch in 5...4...3...

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           The deluge SPRAYS. 

                                 SPACEX MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                        ...2...1...Ignition.

           The rocket IGNITES.  Take off goes smoothly.  Falcon 1 climbs
           higher and higher, reaching beyond Earth's atmosphere.

                                 CONTROL TRAILER (O.S.)
                        Begin Stage 1 separation.  

           Stage 1 unhooks from Stage 2. 

           INT. MISSION CONTROL TRAILER - DAY

           Elon doesn't move a muscle.  He waits. 

                                 SPACEX MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                        Separation complete. 

                                 CONTROL TRAILER
                        Commence Stage 2.

           EXT. SKY - DAY

           Stage 2 releases from Stage 1, then begins thrust.

           Except Stage 1 doesn't slow down and fall.  It SPEEDS UP! 

           INT. MISSION CONTROL TRAILER - DAY

           Elon tenses up.  He can already calculate the error.  
           ON MONITORS -- Stage 1 gets uncomfortably close to Stage 2.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Please don't...

           EXT. EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE:

           Stage 1 SLAMS into Stage 2.  The rocket EXPLODES!

           This high into our atmosphere contains barely any oxygen. 
           The large fireball from the rocket is snuffed out, leaving
           only BLUE SKIES.

           INT. SPACEX, MISSION CONTROL, HAWTHORNE - DAY

           All heads hang like a funeral.  They failed.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL TRAILER - DAY

           Elon's eyes dart back and forth.  Is he giving into failure? 
           He's manic, hard to get a read.  Is it regret or defiance? 

           EXT. MISSION CONTROL TRAILER - DAY

           The trailer doors open.  Elon steps through.  He slowly
           approaches the factory floor.  Mood still unclear. 

           EXT. SPACEX, FACTORY, HAWTHORNE - DAY

           Elon enters and looks around at the devastation in the room. 
           Employees are holding each other, crying.  Looking for hope. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        The most important message I'd like
                        to send right now is that SpaceX
                        will not skip a beat in execution
                        going forward.  We are going to launch
                        #4 immediately.  For those who don't
                        believe, you lack vision.  For those
                        who don't stay, you lack will.  For
                        my part, I will never quit on SpaceX
                        or our mission. I mean never!

           A silent beat.  How will the crowd react? 

           The company ERUPTS. Applause. Cheers. Griffin even smiles,
           surprised. He is bombarded with high fives and hand shakes. 
           His troops are devout radicals to the house of Elon.

           Behind the speech, though, Elon knows this could be the end.

                        Tesla Death Watch is now at 7 months. 
                        CEO Elon Musk promises to deliver by
                        the end of the year, but it looks
                        less likely every day.

                        It feels like a bait and switch.  We
                        were told to have faith and wait it
                        out.  We did. And now because you
                        screwed up, we have to pay for it?

                        It is a bait and switch.  I admit
                        it.  We screwed up.

           TESLA DEATH WATCH 31:  Or is it Tesla Suicide Watch?

           EXT. MCGREGOR AIR FORCE BASE, TEXAS - DAY

           Falcon 9 engines FIRE on the test stand.  It doesn't make it
           more than 10 seconds before glitching and shutting down.

                        Meanwhile, SpaceX has still not
                        announced its return to flight,
                        bringing doubt as to whether they
                        will make the final COTS deadline. 

           INT. SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING - DAY

           Neil Armstrong, now 75, speaks before the committee, railing
           against privatizing space. Elon's hero is even against him.  

                                 NEIL ARMSTRONG
                        I support the encouragement of
                        newcomers towards a lower cost entry
                        to space. But having cut my teeth in
                        rockets more than 50 years ago, I am
                        not confident.

                        Once considered the living embodiment
                        of Iron Man, now we can only wonder
                        if it was all a hoax. The childhood

                        He duped us. I really wanted to
                        believe someone could do all the
                        things he said. But he's a fraud.

           Elon meets with SILVERSTEIN, his divorce lawyer. Elon's weight
           has dropped considerably. He's a haggard shell of himself.  

                                 SILVERSTEIN
                        Elon, you look like Kate Moss.  What
                        happened to you? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        How much is she asking?

           EXT. MUSK HOME, LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Justine opens the door and the kids run out to the car.  At
           the doorway isn't Elon, but MB.  Elon won't go himself. 

                                 ADAM SILVERSTEIN (O.S.)
                        She is contesting the post nuptial. 
                        If deemed invalid, then every dollar
                        from Paypal would become a marital
                        asset, entitling her to half of your
                        estate: Tesla, Solar City, SpaceX. 

           MB leaves with the kids for Elon's visitation. Justine closes
           the door and breaks down in full on hysterics.  

           INT. GROSSMAN, SILVERSTEIN & ZAMBRANO, OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Elon is in disbelief over this situation.  

                                 ADAM SILVERSTEIN
                        We'll fight it. But the court asks
                        for living expenses for her during
                        the trial.  A minimum amount of -

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Nothing? I just put my last reserves
                        into SpaceX.  Can I send an I.O.U.?

                                 ADAM SILVERSTEIN
                        Don't piss off the courts with this
                        one.  It's a very generous amount in
                        our favor.  This gives you options.
                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'll never pick those options. 

                                 ADAM SILVERSTEIN
                        Elon, I've known you and that stubborn
                        look for 15 years. Even if we
                        liquidate all of your long term
                        assets, without new revenue, by
                        Christmas you'll only have enough
                        money for Tesla or SpaceX. Not both. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Adam? Start liquidating.

           Elon watches his McLaren lifted onto a FLATBED TRUCK and
           strapped in like it's a prisoner. Asset liquidated.

           INT. SOUTHWEST AIRLINES, ECONOMY CLASS - DAY

           It's not Elon's.  He's now crammed on the airline he modeled
           SpaceX after.  He reads the "Tesla Death Watch".

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE - DAY

           Elon hands in his report for the latest crash.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        It was a timing issue. We tested a
                        new engine for NASA that had more
                        thrust jettisoned. But it's being
                        fixed now. This one will succeed.

           Amidst Elon's delusion, Worden still has to give bad news. 

                                 GENERAL WORDEN
                        We don't have a satellite ready to
                        go. Next Ratzat won't be deployable
                        'til March, I think. Until then, we
                        have to postpone our next contract. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        No...

                                 GENERAL WORDEN
                        It's just a delay.  We'll be happy
                        to ride launch #5. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        But we need that money.  We will
                        make it to LEO this time.  I swear.

                                 GENERAL WORDEN
                        There's nothing I can do.  We don't
                        have a payload for you.  I'm sorry.

           Elon opens his door to exit. Worden sees his resolve cracking. 
                                 ELON MUSK
                        I know what you're going to say.

                        So we have to start from scratch? 
                        Can we run the other test stand?

                        You are really fucking us over.

                        The deadline is too tight.  Merlin 1-
                        C was made for Falcon 9, which isn't
                        supposed to launch for four more
                        years. You're asking for an upgrade
                        in a few months. I need more time. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        We don't have more time, understand? 
                        We must win COTS. I won't lose.  I
                        can't launch my rocket without a
                        working fucking engine. So hurry!

                        Elon, I bleed SpaceX. I love this

                        to put another engine on the stand,
                        fine. Sure, whatever you say. I work
                        100 hours a week. I'm chafed.  I
                        popped three blisters on my right

                        my opinion, I've blown up enough
                        fucking shit today!!!

                        Okay, alright, that's fine.  Just
                        calm down. We'll do it again tomorrow.

                        Understood. Thank you.  <Click>

           Tom hangs up in victory.  Tim's jacked up from that.

                        being built now, all returning zero
                        income. We have to shut it down until
                        we find a launch partner for #4. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        No, we stay the course. When #4 flies,
                        this will all work itself out.

                        We'll make a dummy payload.  We don't
                        need any customers.  We don't.

                        Everything else ran fine.  We already
                        fixed the glitch.  So #4 will work.

                        Car, for many, is dying.  

           The factory's machines come to a HALT.  The lights TURN OFF. 

           INT. TESLA, BOARD ROOM - DAY

           The board meeting just started and there's already panic. 

                                 JB STRAUBEL
                        GM?!  Are you kidding? If they failed,
                        what chance do we have?  

           Elon chuckles at hearing that concern again.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Did you call Valor? What'd they say?  

                                 ANTONIO GRACIAS
                        No.  They said no. 
                            (explaining)
                        There's no car to buy.  You're behind
                        delivery by 10 months. We spent $115
                        million more than we started with. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Roadster production is coming along,
                        but I can't make payroll next month.

                                 ANTONIO GRACIAS
                        Sell Model S "memberships" early.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        How do you suppose I sell cars now,
                        Antonio?  Try to imagine explaining
                        to someone that they should buy an
                        electric car.  Sure, everything you
                        read about us sounds like the car's
                        shit and we're doomed, and we're in
                        a recession so there's no credit for
                        you anywhere because banks everywhere
                        are going under, but yes, give me
                        $125,000 for a sports car in 2 years.  

                                 ANTONIO GRACIAS
                        Daimler would have an interest in
                        our battery. Sell that.  Sell the
                        I.P. to Ford. Sell Tesla outright. 
                        I don't really care. We're out of
                        options before this thing implodes. 

           INT. CAR SERVICE - DAY

           MB sits next to Elon with more problems to address.
                                 MARY BETH
                        Tim says he needs a new LOX tank. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Sure.  We need to just buy in bulk
                        at this point. Enough already. 

                                 MARY BETH
                        You can't afford it. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I know that, goddamnit.  What else?  

                                 MARY BETH
                        Goldman Sachs called. You'll max out
                        your credit extensions if you proceed. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                            (embarrassed)
                        Proceed. What else? 

           INT. JEFF SKOLL HOME, KITCHEN TABLE - NIGHT

           Jeff and Elon eat take-out burgers and fries for dinner. 
           Jeff eats relaxed, while Elon stuffs his face quickly.  

                                 JEFF SKOLL
                        If you could get the investors for
                        Tesla, how much would you need? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        $40,000,000. 

                                 JEFF SKOLL
                        Fuck me.  That's a lot of cheese. 

           Elon pulls a wad of his cheese fries and eats it. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Depends on your relative scale. 

           Jeff sees the stress on Elon's face as he gorges himself.   

                                 JEFF SKOLL
                        You bit off more than you could chew?  

           Elon has a mouth full of burger.  He masticates dramatically
           to show Jeff that he can chew anything.  He swallows it all.   

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I have to get back to work.  

           Elon puts his burger package in the trash and goes upstairs. 

           INT. SPACEX, FACTORY, HAWTHORNE - DAY

           Elon scolds engineers while reviewing their report.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        What is this?  I said the fuel must
                        test at 60% efficiency.  Run it again!
           Elon yells at helpless, nervous workers walking by.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Does the Max Q look right to you? 
                            (nobody responds)
                        Does it look right to anyone?!

           LATER, CUBICLES, NIGHT -- Everyone's gone, but Elon and MB. 

           MB's ready to leave.  She approaches Elon cautiously.  He's
           catatonic rewatching the #3 crash footage on his computer.  

                                 MARY BETH
                        Just a reminder tomorrow's call with
                        JB is at 7:30 a.m. and then pick up
                        at Jeff's at 8:15 a.m.  Did you pack? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Pack what? I don't have time.

           Elon continues watching.  MB exits momentarily.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        I didn't dismiss you.

           A few seconds and she comes back with a small carry-on bag. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        What's this? 

                                 MARY BETH
                        Your bag.  I packed for you. 

           He opens it, pulls out two of the bright blue shirts.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Can't wear these.  Toyota is blue. 
                        These have to be red. You know that. 

                                 MARY BETH
                        I've never needed to know that.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I don't want to hear that.  I want a
                        red fucking shirt! 

           He throws the shirts and they GENTLY FLOAT to the ground.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Pretend that looked dramatic. 

           The phone RINGS.  MB moves for it. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        I didn't dismiss you. 

                                 MARY BETH
                        But the phone...
                                 ELON MUSK
                        I don't give a shit who's on the
                        fucking phone when I am speaking. I
                        didn't dismiss you! I'm speaking!  

           The phone KEEPS RINGING.  Elon TRASHES the entire office
           space as MB stands petrified to move.  

           His YELLS turn soft. The whimpers of a man near his breaking
           point.  The phone STOPS RINGING.  He finally gives up and
           slumps into his chair.  

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        You're dismissed. 

           The phone again RINGS.  This time MB exits to answer it. 
           Permission or not, she is going to help him. 

                                 MARY BETH
                        Yes.  Elon's unavailable to handle
                        that, but email me right now. 
                            (sits down)
                        Uh-huh. We'll have that out in the
                        morning.  Great.  Thanks, Janet. 

           She doesn't leave him, choosing to go back to work. 

           INT. JEFF SKOLL HOME, ELON'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Elon stares at the ceiling. Blanket tightly grasped, head
           barely ducks out from the covers.  Regression settling in.

           EXT. ERROL MUSK HOME - DAY (1982)

           Elon is by himself building his model rocket. Nearby, Kimbal
           plays tag with some friends. He notices what Elon is doing.

                                 YOUNG KIMBAL
                        Don't. Dad's napping inside.  

           Elon is in his own world, not listening.  He places the rocket
           on the stand and lights the fuse. In seconds, it BLASTS OFF! 
           Elon stares in wonder as it soars high into the sky.  

           Then just as quickly, it falls back down, CRASHING into the
           gutters and KNOCKING an entire panel off of the roof.  

           The other kids see the crash and think it's awesome!  Elon,
           however, quickly worries about the repurcussions.

           INT. ERROL MUSK HOME - DAY (1982)

           Elon carefully enters hoping Errol didn't hear.  He rounds a
           corner.  And there, in the kitchen, is his father.

                                 ERROL MUSK
                        What were you building a rocket for?
                        You planning on going somewhere?

           Elon is too scared to speak.  Errol places a book on the
           table. Elon's Master Plan notebook.  
                                 ERROL MUSK (CONT'D)
                        You left this inside. 

           Elon's precious book in his father's control. Errol flips
           through it - stops on Elon's drawing of an American Flag.

                                 ERROL MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Oh, you want to go to America? Okay. 
                        Then let's play "America." 

           QUICK CUTS of Elon forced to do all the chores around the
           house: sweep the leaves; clean the gutters; scrub the floors
           with a toothbrush.  Errol screams in his ear the whole time. 

                                 ERROL MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Welcome to America, boy!  Isn't this
                        fun? Still wanna go? 

           Elon is reduced to a punished little boy. Elon tries his
           hardest to not cry in front of his father. 

                                 ERROL MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Do winners cry?  Answer me!  Do
                        winners cry?!

                                 ELON MUSK
                        No!

           Elon starts to break down.  Tears well up in his eyes. 

                                 ERROL MUSK
                        Are you sure? You sure look like
                        you're crying. You think you can do
                        anything you want.  But you can't. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Yes. I can...

                                 ERROL MUSK
                        What was that? 

           Elon's anger swallows every tear. He looks his father dead
           in the eyes. Pure fiery rage, like a lion.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        YES I CAN!!!

           Instead of shock, Errol is pleased with his pupil.  

                                 ERROL MUSK
                        Good. We might make a man outta you,
                        yet. 

           INT. JEFF SKOLL HOME, ELON'S ROOM - MORNING

           Elon still stares at the ceiling. The doorbell RINGS. Elon
           won't move. The doorbell RINGS 12 more times, like it's being
           rung by an annoying kid.

           EXT. JEFF SKOLL HOME - MORNING

           Elon opens the front door.  It's Kimbal!
                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        You look like shit.  Good thing I
                        brought reinforcements. 

           Elon peers through and sees Elon's boys!  They are playing
           on the front lawn with MB.  Elon finally smiles.  

                                 KIMBAL MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Take a shower and get dressed.  Now.

           Even in this stupor, Elon listens to Kimbal and goes upstairs.

           EXT. LOCAL YMCA - DAY

           Elon's boys play on the playground as the brothers talk. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I never thought of myself as someone
                        who could have a nervous breakdown. 
                        Like, what kind of pussy has a nervous
                        breakdown?  But this has been bad.

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        If you keep going this way, you're
                        going to end up alone with nothing. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        But I'm not alone. Even now I'm with
                        my brother, my kids, my assistant. 

           REVEAL -- MB stands a foot away; They smile to one another.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        I couldn't be less alone if I tried. 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Do you miss the old days at Zip? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I remember being broke. Taking showers
                        at this YMCA. I remember what it was
                        like to have nothing. I didn't forget. 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Okay -- but do you miss them? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Not at all. We weren't making a damn
                        bit of difference in the world.  If
                        we got hit by a bus, our legacy would
                        be GPS business programmers. 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        I miss them. Do you know why?  It's
                        because we made stuff.  No investors
                        or bottom lines or public image or
                        any of it.  All we had was the simple
                        joy of making stuff together.  
                            (points to sky)
                        That up there?  Not your legacy.
                            (points to the boys)
                        That right there is. 
                                 ELON MUSK
                        I know that. 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        So why put yourself through this? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        That rocket works.  When it flies,
                        I'll have done what was thought to
                        be impossible. And thus, impossible
                        will be disproven. Nothing will be
                        impossible any longer. For anyone. 
                        I'm doing this for them.  

           EXT. JEFF SKOLL HOME - LATER

           Kimbal drops off Elon and the boys.

                        You gonna be alright? 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'll survive. 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Good.  One last thing. 

           Kimbal hands Elon something.  Elon takes it. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        What's this?

           Elon looks at it. It's a check.  A $5 million check.

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        A lot of people depend on you for a
                        reason. They believe in you. I believe
                        in you.  You can do anything, E.  

           Elon hugs his brother tight, tears in his eyes.

           Elon spins around his twins. The triplets play with trucks.
           He displays a rare level of joy just playing with his kids,
           drawing strength from them. 

           INT. JEFF SKOLL HOME, EXTRA BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Elon kisses all his boys goodnight.  Xavier teases his Dad.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Most people think your Dad is a loser. 

                                 XAVIER MUSK
                        It's just sound, right?

                            (renewed strength)
                        Yes, it is. 

           INT. TESLA, BOARD ROOM - DAY

           Elon looks at his adversaries.  All are on the same side,
           but not for this battle.  Elon gathers his thoughts.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        If we're out of equity investors
                        then I'm asking this board for $40
                        million.  $40 million and I'll match
                        it, dollar for dollar.  

                                 ANTONIO GRACIAS
                        But you don't have anything anymore. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'll classify the round as debt. All
                        my assets as collateral. 
                            (stern)
                        We'll fail to make payroll and go
                        bankrupt on Christmas Day at 6:00pm.  

           The Board is stunned. Elon grabs his coat to leave. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        I'll leave you to it. I have to get
                        back to finishing these cars. 

           INT. SPACEX, FACTORY, HAWTHORNE - DAY

           Elon has gathered the entire staff.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I called you all here today to give
                        you some bad news. 

           INT. TESLA, FACTORY, SAN CARLOS, CA - DAY

           Elon continues the speech to the Tesla team as well. 

           INTERCUT:  Both factories (unless noted otherwise) 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        We are just about out of money. We've
                        got enough for one last shot...   

           - SPACEX, Gwynne knows but nobody else does. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        ...At LEO.

           - TESLA, JB knows but nobody else does.  

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        ...at delivering these cars.  

           Elon relaxes into accepting the possibility of the end. 
                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Now, I'm not stopping.  I don't quit.
                        I don't give up. Ever.  If I have to
                        build engines out of my garage, I
                        will.  But I can't succeed on my
                        own.  Not this time.  

           His humility only strengthens his conviction.  

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        If this is too much for you, I
                        understand.  You have families to
                        think of.  I'll personally call your
                        next employers.  

           Employees from every department consider his offer. 

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        But if you stay - If you choose to
                        endure the long hours and the hard
                        work and the stress and the sleepless
                        nights and the missed dinners and
                        follow this vision with me - I promise
                        you, we will survive...  

           It's as bold a promise as you could have, but all of his
           soul believes it. The workers feel it too.  

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        ... And we will succeed.  

           Elon waits for this to sink in.  Then, he simply asks -  

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Now, what are you gonna do?

                        We could remove the radio assembly. 

                                 TIM BUZZA
                        Would that lower enough weight?  

           Elon quietly attempts to answer the question.

           "MUSK LAND": various equations build around phrases - 'scale
           reductions', 'thrust varient', 'yaw turn'.  Then Elon stops.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Yes. 20% reduction would result in a
                        thrust need of 200lbs/second. Do it.  

                                 TIM BUZZA
                        How the hell did you know that?

                        You taught me.  

                                 TIM BUZZA

           Elon walks in and finds something on the counter: A BLOCK OF
           CHEESE, a CHECK for $2 million, and a NOTE that says, "You'll

                        We have something for that.  It's a

                        I appreciate it.

           Merlin, now attached to the Falcon 1, fires slightly as a

           Elon uses his jet only to/from Kwaj. He watches their joy.

           INTERCUT: Skype Video Conversation.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You guys are awesome. Thank you.

                                 TIM BUZZA
                        Did he just say, "Thank you?"

                                 TOM MUELLER
                        That's what I heard.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Don't get used to it.  

           He hangs up.  Elon can't celebrate. He reads Tesla reports...

           INT. TESLA, FACTORY, SAN CARLOS, CA - NIGHT

           Elon hands a binder back to JB.  He sees 3 more failed
           inspection cars.  For every two steps forward, another back. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Daily reports? 

           JB hands him a new, thicker binder.   Elon is visibly weak. 

                                 JB STRAUBEL
                        You need a break.  If you die, who
                        will throw their money away on us? 

           Elon is too tired to fully laugh. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Haven't you heard?  I'm Iron Man.

           As he leaves, he points to some active assembly machines.

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        If those machines aren't necessary,
                        shut them off and everything we don't
                        need until we make it through this.

           INT. SPACEX, CONFERENCE ROOM, HAWTHORNE - DAY

           Elon looks over the new daily reports. Any car guy would
           drown in this many details.  His eyes are bloodshot. 

           A HAND SLAMS a check on the table.  It's Gwynne. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        What's this for? 

                                 GWYNNE SHOTWELL
                        For you.  For taking us to the finish
                        line.  Now do the same for Tesla. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Gwynne, I can't.  
                                 GWYNNE SHOTWELL
                        You've never said "I can't" in your
                        whole life.  Yes. "You can." Pay me
                        back when #4 launches.  

           He smiles at her.  Chris enters.  He places a check down.

                                 CHRIS THOMPSON
                        Nobody has ever given me this kind
                        of autonomy before.  This is my way
                        of giving back.  

           Tim and Tom enter.  

                                 TIM BUZZA
                        We flew in coach, don't worry. 
                            (places check)
                        I figure once we colonize Mars, we're
                        gonna need electric cars up there. 

           Tom places his check down.

                                 TOM MUELLER
                        You believed in what I could do before
                        I even knew if I could.  I didn't
                        think it would work.  Now it's real. 

           MB enters and places the final check down. 

                                 MARY BETH
                        I'm at Tesla so much, I deserve a
                        car.  

           The original team is all together, ready to battle for Elon.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Why are you all doing this for me?  

                                 GWYNNE SHOTWELL
                        If you had the chance to go back in
                        time and work with Howard Hughes
                        when he was creating TWA.  If you
                        had a chance to be there at that
                        moment when it was the dawn of a
                        brand new era, wouldn't you want to
                        do that? That's why I'm here. 

                                 TIM BUZZA
                        That's why we're all here. 

           Elon has no words. A man so close to the edge of sanity, and
           now he can't help but think one thing - 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Is this legal? 

                                 GWYNNE SHOTWELL
                        No. I'll collect it and have SpaceX
                        "loan" it to you. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        There it is. 
           INT. TESLA, BOARD ROOM - DAY

           Elon signs over the last of his account. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        We delivered another 20 cars.

           While positive, it doesn't have an effect on Antonio. 

                                 ANTONIO GRACIAS
                        The board will review the debt round
                        and give you our response.   

           EXT. TESLA, FACTORY, SAN CARLOS, CA - DAY

           Elon gets in his Roadster,  MB joins him. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You're buying lunch. 

           INT. SPACEX, FACTORY, HAWTHORNE - EVENING

           Elon walks around the factory.  All of the employees have
           left. He stares at DRAGON on the test stand.  He hops in.    

           He grabs the controls and plays with it like he's in an arcade
           game, making rocket noises and yelling fake commands.  

           LOOKING THROUGH THE COCKPIT WINDOW, ELON IMAGINES

           The Capsule taking off, flying through the factory ceiling
           and heading into - 

           OUTER SPACE

           Stars whip past. It's the magic of space flight.  Elon's
           coffee floats in Zero G. The MOON passes by the window.

           He's now flying through deep space.  Mars is only a tiny red
           dot - but it's growing larger as he gets closer.

           REVERSE ANGLE AT ELON

           We're not in the Dragon Capsule anymore.  We're in -

           INT. ERROL MUSK HOME, BOYS' BEDROOM - NIGHT (1982)

           Young Elon lays on his back looking through a slanted skylight
           covered by sheets to look more like a hexagon cockpit.  

           He holds a video game controller as a command stick.  He's
           in his own world of imagination.  His happy place. 

           END OF IMAGINATION

           Elon smiles. Through all the stress, he cheers himself up. 

           Gwynne sees it, but doesn't disturb him.  Elon then speaks - 
                                 ELON MUSK
                        When I was 12, I made my first video
                        game, Blastar. Taught myself from
                        scratch how to do it.  Sold it for
                        $500. I was so proud, it made me
                        angry. I had an existential crisis. 
                            (explains)
                        I was reading Nietsche and
                        Shopenhouer, which you should not do
                        as a 12 year old, FYI.  
                            (continues)
                        Then I read Hitchhiker's Guide to
                        the Galaxy.  It's the question that
                        matters. The answer is the easy part.  
                            (he asks himself)
                        "What is the meaning of life?" 

           That was the question Elon would spend all his life answering.

                                 GWYNNE SHOTWELL
                        Get some rest. Big day tomorrow.

           Gwynne leaves him to his thoughts. 

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           The birds chirp.  The sun shines. 

           CHYRON: September 28th, 2008. Falcon 1, Test #4.

           INT. KWAJALEIN, BARRACKS - DAY

           An alarm RINGS!  Everyone is out of their bunks and moving
           to their battle stations. They are fired up. 

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           Engineers answer the call to action in every corner of the
           island. This is watching soldiers in the midst of war.  

           INT. KWAJALEIN, PAYLOAD HANGAR - DAY

           Technicians load the PAYLOAD into its casing.

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           The casing is placed onto a horizontal Falcon 1 that sits on
           a ROCKET RIG. The Rigs' hydraulics LIFT the rocket vertically
           and connect it to the stand. Workers connect the FUEL PUMP.

           LOX condensation shoots out the rocket's side vent valves. 
           They finally remove the fuel pump and leave the launch site. 

           A WELDER wearing a MICKEY MOUSE T-shirt walks toward us. 
           C/U on Mickey Mouse.  He has a devilish grin on his face. 

                                                                 CUT TO:
           EXT. DISNEYLAND, ANAHEIM, CA - DAY

           A VENDOR with the same shirt gives Elon and Kimbal churros. 
           The biggest day of his life and his brother took him to
           Disneyland to relax.  Elon is anything but calm. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        You took me to fucking Disneyland. 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        You needed to calm down today.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I don't know how to do that.

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        Look at it this way - You can't fix
                        what you already fucked up.  So you
                        either fucked up your whole life and
                        it was always going to end this way. 
                            (Elon buys that)
                        Or...you just so happened to do
                        everything right and it took until
                        this moment for you to succeed.  
                            (takes a bite)
                        Either way, enjoy a churro.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           SPACEX LIVE STREAMING WEBCAST

           A TITLE SCREEN with the SpaceX logo, like a movie studio. A
           Discovery Channel-style show on the Falcon 1 launch begins. 
           The webcast explains every part of the launch in detail.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The Falcon 1 provides the world's
                        lowest cost ride to orbit for small
                        payloads. It also acts as development
                        for the much larger Falcon 9 which
                        will take man to outer space. 

           It PLAYS throughout the following until the launch is ready:

           INT. SPACEX, FACTORY, HAWTHORNE - DAY

           The factory DOORS OPEN. PRESS floods in. Gwynne handles them.

                        for the entire world.  
           CAMERA ROOM -- Off to the side of the floor is a makeshift
           SpaceX Newsroom.  It's their own personal reporting team. 
           They will be live, broadcasting the play-by-play. 

           EXT. HAWAII AIRPORT - DAY

           Elon's jet arrives.  He is then guided to a HUEY HELICOPTOR.  

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           Workers close the vent valves when it's this close to launch.  

           INT./EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

           The Huey approaches Kwaj.  Elon stares out at his island. 
           His last chance.  He reminisces for a moment.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Now we look like Bond Villains. 
                        Sean Connery Bond Villains.

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - DAY

           The Huey lands. Elon sees all the hustle of his workers. 

           The crane pulls away from Falcon 1. It's the last step. 
           Falcon 1 is ready...

                        We are go in T-minus 15 minutes. 

           INT. KWAJALEIN, TEMPORARY MISSION CONTROL - DAY

           Elon meets Kimbal inside.  The team concludes prechecks.

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        I'm proud of you. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Really? 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        If it launches?  Sure, why not?

                                 SPACEX MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                        Falcon 1 precheck complete.  We are
                        go for launch. 

           They look at the monitor.  Falcon 1 stands all alone. Elon
           takes a personal moment and looks up to the heavens.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        I'm just wishing to any entities
                        listening.  Please bless this launch. 

           Elon grabs the controls.  It's time.  

                                 ELON MUSK (CONT'D)
                        Falcon 1 is a go.  Fire when ready.

           Elon stares intensely at the screen.  This is for everything
           he's worked towards.  He nods to control. 
                                 CONTROL ROOM

           EXT. KWAJALEIN, LAUNCH SITE - CONTINUOUS

           Falcon 1 BLASTS OFF the platform.  

           INT. KWAJALEIN, TEMPORARY MISSION CONTROL - DAY

           The room RUMBLES as the rocket rises above the tower. 

           EXT. SKY:

           Up in the sky, the rocket flies higher and higher, going
           Mach 1.  So far, so good.   

           INT. SPACEX, FACTORY, HAWTHORNE - CONTINUOUS

           The press now join the employees to watch through the window. 
           They all have the same awed look as the Apollo 11 crowds. 

           EXT. SKY:

           Stage 1 accelerates sideways to Max Q thrust.

                        T+ 2 min.  Commece Stage 1 Separation.

           The shackles on Stage 1 UNHINGE.   

                                 SPACEX MISSION CONTROL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Separation complete.  Fire Stage 2. 

           But Stage 1 doesn't fall away. The timing is off again. Stage
           1 ACCELERATES just like Launch #3.  Will it hit?!?

           INT. KWAJALEIN, TEMPORARY MISSION CONTROL - DAY

           Elon sees Stage 1 catching Stage 2 on the monitor.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Come on, baby.  You can do this.

           EXT. SKY:

           They are about to hit!  At the last moment, Stage 2 finds
           another gear and SPEEDS UP.  It keeps Stage 1 at bay long
           enough to thrust itself far away and into Low Earth Orbit. 

                                 SPACEX MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                        T+5 min, Stage 2 on target.

           INT. KWAJALEIN, TEMPORARY MISSION CONTROL - DAY

           Elon lets out a long held breath.  And then takes an even
           deeper breath. This is the final step...
           EXT. LOW EARTH ORBIT:

           Stage 2 pushes deeper into orbit. They have never gotten
           this far. No chance to fix errors. Anything could go wrong.   

                                 SPACEX MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                        Commence Fairing release. 

           The NOSE OPENS. Like peeling away a pistachio shell, the
           casing is released.  Time for deployment. 

                                 SPACEX MISSION CONTROL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Fairing released.  Deploy Payload. 

           The "dummy" Payload DISCONNECTS from Stage 2.  

           A tense beat.  Stage 2 throttles down but is right behind
           it.  So much can go wrong right here...   

           Then, as graceful as a butterfly, the Payload outstretches
           its solar wings and soaks in the sunlight. The Payload gets
           carried away into LEO. Stage 2 fades from view.  

           MISSION COMPLETE.  

                                 SPACEX MISSION CONTROL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Payload deployed. Mission success! 
                        Falcon 1 is a mission success!

           INT. SPACEX, FACTORY, HAWTHORNE - DAY

           Employees, friends, and family on the floor number in the

           INT. KWAJALEIN, TEMPORARY MISSION CONTROL - DAY

           The room screams with so much joy.  Champagne bottles pop! 
           Elon cries, his face buried in his hands.  Kimbal hugs him.   

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        I'm proud of you!  I'm proud of you!

           INT. KWAJALEIN, TEMPORARY MISSION CONTROL - DAY

           Elon is immediately escorted out to his helicopter.

                                 SPACEX WEBCAST REPORTER (O.S.)
                        We are getting word that CEO Elon
                        Musk will be joining momentarily.  

           INT. SPACEX, FACTORY, HAWTHORNE - DAY

           The celebration hasn't slowed down.  They can hear the
           helicopter touch down.  

           The BAY DOORS OPEN.  Elon enters. The company ERUPTS!  Even
           members of the press and NASA can't help but clap. 

           Elon stands in front of a raucous crowd.  He is the tried
           and true rock star - their leader. Cameras capture this moment
           for the world.  They quiet as Elon prepares to speak. 

                                 ELON MUSK
                        A lot of people thought we couldn't
                        do it.  A lot. But ya know the saying,
                        "Fourth times the charm." 
                            (laughs, then serious)
                        One of the most significant
                        achievements in the four billion
                        year history of Earth will be when
                        man becomes a multiplanetary species. 
                        For the first time, our rocket begins
                        the steps toward making that possible. 
                        This is a truly historic day. 

           Elon sees all the happy families. He checks his phone - his
           background is Justine and the kids. His sacrifice for mankind.  

           INT. NASA HQ, LOBBY - DAY

           Gwynne and Elon await their COTS fate.  NO SOUND except -

                                 RECEPTION
                        Mr. Musk?

           He follows her. We hear Elon's shoes KNOCK on the tile.

           INT. NASA HQ, MICHAEL GRIFFIN'S OFFICE - DAY

           STILL NO SOUND. Michael directs Elon to sit in a chair. 
           Michael speaks.  It's hard to tell if it's good or bad.  

           INT. NASA HQ, LOBBY - LATER

           STILL NO SOUND. Gwynne reads a magazine.  The KNOCKING grows
           closer as Elon re-enters.  Gwynne stands.  Elon, in full
           emotional outburst, hugs her.  As Gwynne pulls away, she
           smiles and laughs: Good!  

           INT. KIMBAL'S MOUNTAIN LODGE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           CHYRON: Colorado. 5:00pm Christmas Day, 2008.

           Kimbal cooks. Elon stares at two laptops.

                        A watched pot never boils.

           transfer of NASA's money.  

           Kimbal brings Elon a bowl of RED SKITTLES.  Elon passes, too
           distressed.  Kimbal peers at the second laptop. 

           LAPTOP #2 SCREEN -- Email for Tesla Bankruptcy proceedings.

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        They have an hour left. They'll call. 

           LATER -- All quiet. Kimbal builds a fire.  Elon sketches in
           a notebook at the table, nervously looking at the clock. 

           A phone RINGS, startling Kimbal and Elon.  It was Kimbal's.

                                 KIMBAL MUSK (CONT'D)
                        False alarm.  Turning it off.  

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Give a guy a heart attack why don't -

           Elon's phone RINGS. They freeze. Elon takes a big scoop of
           Skittles and scarfs them down. He picks up, but can't speak. 

                                 ANTONIO GRACIAS (O.S.)
                        Check your email.

                        Merry Christmas.  <Click>

           Elon, overcome with emotions, runs outside for air. 

           EXT. KIMBAL'S MOUNTAIN LODGE - NIGHT

           Elon's heart races as he stands on the patio in just his
           socks.  They quickly soak from the snow. He doesn't care. 
           He ROARS! Kimbal joins him, glad to see Elon free once more. 

                                 KIMBAL MUSK
                        So?  What's the next adventure?

           A COMET shoots across the sky.  Then another. Elon smirks.  

                                 KIMBAL MUSK (CONT'D)
                        You already started, didn't you?

           INT. KIMBAL'S MOUNTAIN LODGE - NIGHT

           On the table is a familiar composition notebook.  On the
           open page is a sketch for an air-powered rail system
           tentatively titled: HYPERLOOP. 
           He has already started indeed...   

                                                               FADE OUT:

           INT. STANFORD UNIVERSITY, HALL B, GRADUATION - DAY

           In full cap & gown, Elon receives a STANDING OVATION as he
           is presented with an honorary degree from the school he left
           (not quit) to chase his dreams.  

           From the front row, Kimbal shows his brother support - by
           holding out 2 fingers and mouthing, "2 days" on repeat.   

           The audience quiets down and takes their seats.  Elon begins
           his keynote speech to the graduating class.

                                 ELON MUSK
                        Life has to be about more than solving
                        problems. Be inspired. Do things. Be
                        proud to be a part of humanity. 

           EXT. TESLA SUPERCHARGING STATION, NEVADA - DAY

           A brand new MODEL S finishes charging at a Tesla Station.

                        And when you are inspired, work hard
                        at it. Every. Single. Day.

           CHYRON: Tesla released the Model S Sedan in 2012.  Motortrend
           unanimously voted it "Car of the Year". Consumer Reports
           gave it the highest rating of any car in its history. 99/100.

           The Model S PULLS OUT and hits the open road.

                        If you put in 100 hours of work and
                        your competitor puts in 50 hours...

           ON ONE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY -- miles of housing developments,
           all with SOLAR PANELS on their roofs. 

           CHYRON:  Solar City is the largest solar energy services
           provider in the U.S. and the 3rd largest in the world.

           ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY -- is the battery producing
           GIGAFACTORY, the largest man made structure in the world. 

           CHYRON: Tesla acquired Solar City in 2016 for $2 billion to
           become a one stop shop for clean, renewable energy.

                                 ELON MUSK (O.S.)
                        So what happens when things go wrong? 
                        When times get tough?  What do you
                        do when you're one misstep away from
                        total failure? Do you quit? 

           Below, the MACHINE SHOP is on FIRE. Elon watches the SpaceX

                        There's going to be a lot of noise -
                        a lot of sound - doubting you. 

           INT. SPACEX, EL SEGUNDO - (2002)

           The first time Elon stood inside his factory. It's empty.

                        DON'T LISTEN TO IT. 

           INT. SPACEX, HAWTHORNE - (FLIGHT #4 SUCCESS, 2008)

           SpaceX is filled with workers, rockets, and high-tech gear.

                        Stay focused and find your signal -
                        that sound only you can hear that
                        points you in a single direction.
                        Hear the signal, not the sound.

           On ELON'S CALENDAR, MB adds a new event: LAUNCH #5.

                        And when you hear it, and you will,
                        it will say one thing to you: Believe.

           EXT. LOW EARTH ORBIT, FALCON 9 FLIGHT (2016)

           As Falcon 9 hits Max Q, Stage 1 DISENGAGES. Stage 2 continues
           flying as Stage 1 falls back to Earth...until it REFIRES!

                                 ELON MUSK (O.S.)
                        Believe in the research, the theories,
                        the calculations, and the results. 

           Deftly, the booster's propulsion system guides it, targeting
           a BARGE in the Atlantic Ocean trying to "catch" the rocket.
           Stage 1 touches down softly, landing upright on the barge. 

           CHYRON: On April 8th, 2016 SpaceX's Falcon 9 booster became
           the first successful reusable rocket in space history. 

           EXT. PAD 39A, FALCON 9, CAPE CANAVERAL - AFTERNOON (2017)

                        Believe in the attempts, the failures,
                        the set backs, and the progress. 

           CHYRON: On February 19th, 2017, SpaceX successfully launched
           their first mission from NASA's Pad 39a to resupply the I.S.S. 
           INT. SPACEX, OFFICE, HAWTHORNE - NIGHT (2017)

           As the lights SHUT OFF, we stare down the end of a long

                        Believe in the vision.

           A Dragon Capsule ZOOMS through deep space.

           REVERSE ANGLE AT PILOT

           It's Elon in a full astronaut suit.  Stars reflect off his
