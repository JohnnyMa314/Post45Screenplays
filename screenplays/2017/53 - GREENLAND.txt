           FADE IN:

           EXT. HIGHWAY - PHILADELPHIA, PA - EVENING

           Congested with after-work TRAFFIC escaping downtown.

           The evening sun melts into the horizon. The fiery hues of 
           autumn glint against glass high-rises.

           INT. NISSAN MAXIMA - SAME

           JOHN GARRITY, (38), handsome, inscrutable, sits in silence. 
           His mind an uncanny distance away. Workplace casual in khakis 
           and an Oxford shirt, unbuttoned at the top. White gold 
           WEDDING RING. Nothing ostentatious.

           Files peek from his leather work bag, on the passenger seat. 
           Clients include: “DELTA”, “AMERICAN AIRLINES”, “CAPE AIR“, 
           etc.

           His contemplative mein acquires a hint of curiosity when --

           A military HUMVEE passes by in the eastbound lane. 

           A moment later -- two more MILITARY VEHICLES follow after. 

           Unusual, but nothing remarkable about it. John returns to his 
           thoughts, unconcerned. 

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - EVENING

           Difficult to differentiate from the other homes in this 
           homogenous middle-class neighborhood.

           A compact S.U.V. is parked in the open two-car GARAGE. John’s 
           car pulls into the driveway. He parks. Takes a moment.

           SEE that there are several suitcases in his backseat. 

           INT. SUBURBAN HOME - BASEMENT - EVENING

           Designed and furnished commensurately with the home’s well-
           crafted exterior.

           ALLISON GARRITY, (36), world-weary, jogs on a treadmill. 
           Sweating. Ear-buds in each ear. Pushing hard against 
           emotional headwinds.

           She lifts her feet from the runway when she sees someone 
           descending the basement stairs. Pulls the ear-buds.
           John stops a few steps before the bottom. Treading lightly, 
           it seems. 

           Beat. Silence but for the steady whir of the treadmill.

                                 ALLISON
                        You’re early.

                                 JOHN
                        I wanted be here for the bus.

           An uncomfortable beat. Then --

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                                (re: workout)
                        I’ll let you finish--

                                 ALLISON
                        --I’m done.

           She powers down the treadmill. Swipes her water bottle and 
           iPhone. 

           INT. GARRITY RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Allison towels off her brow. Swigs from her water bottle. 
           Dumps the excess water in a basil plant near the window. 

           Anything to keep her back to John.

                                 JOHN
                        How long are you going to ignore me 
                        for?

                                 ALLISON
                        I haven’t decided yet.

                                 JOHN
                        Then why did you agree to this?

           She cleans a kitchen counter that doesn’t need cleaning.

                                 ALLISON
                        Because of him.

                                 JOHN
                        What about us?

                                 ALLISON
                        I haven’t decided that yet, either.

           Allison runs out of things to do. Finally faces John...
           Sees he’s holding a PURPLE STUFFED ANIMAL CHEETAH, softening 
           her ever so slightly.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        He likes cheetahs.

                                 JOHN
                        I know.

           After a beat --

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        We can do this.

                                 ALLISON
                        We can try -- which is what this 
                        is. Don’t mistake it for anything 
                        more than that.

           Allison busies herself again. This time drying already dry 
           dishes.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        I can’t pretend everything’s fine 
                        just because you’re back. It’s not 
                        fine. 
                                (beat)
                        This is... this is going to take 
                        time. 

                                 JOHN
                        We have time.

           As Allison considers this, a SCHOOL BUS pulls up outside. 

           EXT. SCHOOL BUS - SAME

           NATHAN GARRITY, (7), is among the small group of elementary 
           school students who exit the bus.

           He’s mid-conversation with ELLIE FITZPATRICK, (9), his 
           neighbor and friend --

                                 NATHAN
                        ...and the ball was like, “boosh,” 
                        when it hit me. 

           Ellie laughs. 

                                 ELLIE FITZPATRICK
                        You’re lucky. We only got to play 
                        Freeze Tag.
                                 NATHAN
                        We played Freeze Tag last week--

           His face assumes a timid expression when he sees John’s car 
           in the driveway. Ellie’s slightly surprised as well.

                                 ELLIE FITZPATRICK
                        Isn’t that your dad’s car?

                                 NATHAN
                                (preoccupied)
                        Yeah.

           INT. GARRITY RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           The front door is heard opening. Aware who’s home, John and 
           Allison both put on good faces.

           NATHAN GARRITY, (7), enters the kitchen, his school backpack 
           slung across his shoulders.

                                 JOHN
                        Hi.

                                 NATHAN
                        Hi.

                                 ALLISON
                        How was school?

                                 NATHAN
                        Good.

           Nathan’s discomfiture is painfully apparent.

                                 JOHN
                                (re: stuffed animal)
                        Hey -- I got you this.

                                 NATHAN
                        Thanks.

           An uncomfortable beat. Allison wipes away a tear to hide it.

                                 ALLISON
                        Why don’t you go put your stuff 
                        away, okay?

           Nathan escapes upstairs to his room. John watches him go.

                                 JOHN
                        How have his numbers been?
                                 ALLISON
                        Terrible.

           John slowly nods his regret.

           INT. GARRITY RESIDENCE - NATHAN’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Nathan lies on his bed, drawing something with magic markers. 

           John taps at the open bedroom door. 

                                 JOHN
                        Can I come in?

                                 NATHAN
                        Yeah.

           John approaches with tact. Ganders at Nathan’s drawing.

                                 JOHN
                        I like all the colors. 

           SEE that Nathan draws a sun rising from behind a cloud-
           covered mountain, which Nathan has labeled: “MT. WASHINGTON.”

           John sits next to him on the bed. Looks at the picture. He 
           points to the three STICK FIGURES standing on top of Mt. 
           Washington: a man, a woman, and a boy.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Is that us?

           Nathan nods. Continues coloring in Mt. Washington.

                                 NATHAN
                                (re: Mt. Washington)
                        Do you think we can finally go 
                        there this year?

                                 JOHN
                        I’d like that.

                                 NATHAN
                        Can we go this weekend?

                                 JOHN
                        Um... it’s probably a little too 
                        snowy up there right now. Maybe in 
                        the spring.

           Off Nathan’s muted disappointment --
                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                                (joking)
                        We wouldn’t want our car to slip 
                        down the mountain.

                                 NATHAN
                        Would we die?

                                 JOHN
                        Well that got dark real fast.

                                 NATHAN
                        My teacher said your life flashes 
                        by your eyes right before you die.

                                 JOHN
                        Kind of a weird thing for a teacher 
                        to say, isn’t it?

                                 NATHAN
                                (shrugs)
                        She’s kinda weird. 
                                (beat)
                        But is it true?

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t know. Maybe.

                                 NATHAN
                        It would be better if it flashed by 
                        if you live. That way you could, 
                        like, see all those good memories 
                        and remember to be happy.

           John searches Nathan’s statement for subtext, but ultimately 
           accepts it at face value. Smiles a small smile.

                                 JOHN
                        I like that version better, too. 

           He continues to watch Nathan color...

           Until Nathan stops. The boy seems to want to say more.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        What?
                                (off Nathan’s hesitance)
                        What is it, buddy?

           Beat.

                                 NATHAN
                        Is Mom going to make you leave 
                        again?
           Unless that was the subtext. John sighs. Thinks carefully 
           before answering.

                                 JOHN
                        No.

           Nathan nods a small nod, though it’s clear he harbors doubt. 
           He gets back to coloring.

           Now it’s John who seems to want to say more... but he 
           replaces that urge by instead offering --

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Here, let me help you.

           He takes another GRAY marker from Nathan’s pencil case. Pops 
           the cap -- but the marker tip snaps off, staining part of 
           John’s hand. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                                (sotto)
                        Damn it...

           John looks for something to wipe his hand on. He ultimately 
           decides on his own sock. As he’s hunched over --

           Nathan wraps his arms around him. Breaks down in quiet tears. 
           John sits up and hugs him back. Rueful pangs of conscience.

           EXT. GARRITY RESIDENCE - EVENING

           John retrieves his suitcases and a few belongings from inside 
           his car and trunk.

           A car drives past. Its driver, ED PRUITT, (56), involuntarily 
           slows upon seeing John. An unexpected sight, apparently. 

           John offers a short wave, which Ed returns as he then 
           proceeds down the suburban street.

                                                                      CUT TO:

           INT. GARRITY RESIDENCE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Allison sleeps alone in a queen-size bed. The other half of 
           the bed is neatly tucked, clearly unused for quite some time.
           INT. GARRITY RESIDENCE - NATHAN’S BEDROOM - SAME

           A solar system mobile hovers above Nathan’s bed. Nathan 
           sleeps beneath it as his SOUND MACHINE gently hisses WHITE 
           NOISE.

           The peaceful sound persists... until the sound machine 
           unexpectedly falters. As if suddenly on the fritz. Seconds 
           later, it returns to normal. 

           INT. GARRITY RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - SAME

           Unable to sleep, John sits alone at the table. 

           His absent gaze registers the gray MARKER SMUDGE on his hand. 
           He shuffles over to the kitchen sink. Turns on the water, 
           about to wash off the stain...

           ...but he’s distracted by the distant sound of a BARKING DOG.

           John turns off the sink to listen closer. There’s something 
           peculiar about it. A strange sense of urgency.

           EXT. GARRITY RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           The front door yawns open. John peeks outside -- but sees 
           nothing. He’s about to go back inside when...

           He hears more BARKING. This time more proximate.

           He leaves his doorstep. Drifts to the middle of the otherwise 
           silent, hazy street...

           Streetlights spill individual pools of light, set against 
           stretches of darkness in between. An unsettling etherealness.

           Just then --

           A large GERMAN SHEPHERD bursts from the shadows. Its claws 
           clack against the pavement, its BROKEN CHAIN drags behind as 
           it charges toward John. 

                                 JOHN
                        Roscoe...?

           But this dog, ROSCOE, shows no sign of slowing down. It 
           closes in, spittle flying from its grunting mouth.

           Confusion gives way to fear as John backs up -- prepares to 
           turn and run --

           -- but Roscoe speeds right past him.
           John spins, watches the dog disappear back into the darkness 
           further down the street.

           Silence returns. John shakes off his confusion. Turns to walk 
           back to his house when --

           ANOTHER DOG speeds past him... and then ANOTHER -- 

           And then FOUR MORE. All with broken leashes or torn collars.

           And then -- 

           Over a DOZEN barking dogs race down the street, all fleeing 
           past John like a migrating herd. Only, it's clear they're not 
           running toward something.

           They're running AWAY from something. 

           But what?

           And then, just as suddenly as this all began... it ends. 

           John remains in the street, confounded. 

                                                                     FADE TO:

           INT. GARRITY RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Alison cooks eggs for Nathan, who has already started eating 
           his toast. 

                                 ALLISON
                        Make sure you take a unit for that 
                        (toast).

                                 NATHAN
                                (over)
                        I did.

           Allison levels a skeptical look...

           Nathan groans, presses a few buttons on his INSULIN PUMP -- a 
           pager-size medical device clipped to the waistband of his 
           pants. A long, thin tube extends from it and attaches to his 
           abdomen. He administers himself ONE UNIT of insulin.

           A moment later, John enters, tired-eyed.

                                 JOHN
                        Morning.

                                 NATHAN
                        Hi.
           John looks to Allison, as if hoping she might greet him. But 
           alas, she busies herself at the stove.

                                 JOHN
                        What time is it?

                                 ALLISON
                        Quarter past nine.

                                 JOHN
                                (to Nathan)
                        Why aren’t you at school?

           Nathan shrugs.

                                 ALLISON
                        The bus never came, for some 
                        reason.

           John’s forehead creases when he sees Nathan’s insulin pump. 
           Allison is immediately frustrated by his lack of familiarity. 

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        It’s an insulin pump.

                                 JOHN
                                (to Nathan)
                        When did you stop using shots?

                                 ALLISON
                                (pointedly)
                        Over a month ago.

                                 NATHAN
                        I hate it.

                                 ALLISON
                        You hated taking shots even more.

                                 NATHAN
                        You try wearing it. See how you 
                        like it.

           Allison’s sympathy overrides her desire to address Nathan’s 
           disrespectful tone. She sighs, gets back to the eggs sizzling 
           on the pan. 

                                 JOHN
                        Well... I can drive him to school.
                                (then to Nathan)
                        Or... to the movies?

           Nathan smiles discreetly at what John is intimating.
                                 ALLISON
                        He can’t miss school.

                                 JOHN
                        It’s only one day, Allison.

                                 ALLISON
                        He’s already missed ten days for 
                        endocrinologist appointments.
                                (beat)
                        But how would you know that?

                                 JOHN
                        Don’t purposely make this harder.

                                 ALLISON
                        It’s really hard not to. --

                                 JOHN
                        -- It’s not fair.

                                 ALLISON
                        You’re seriously telling me about 
                        what’s fair?

           Allison takes a moment to collect herself. The sizzling pan 
           crackles through the silence.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        I told you... This is going to take 
                        time.

           A beat. Then John and Allison notice Nathan... 

           ...standing at the DINING ROOM window, his back to them. 
           Looking to the street. Deeply perplexed by what he sees.

                                 JOHN
                        Nathan...?

           John joins him at the window. His own confusion rises in 
           equal measure.

           SEE that several of their NEIGHBORS are outside their homes.

           They all stare skyward. 

           EXT. GARRITY RESIDENCE - MORNING

           John, Allison, and Nathan exit their home to investigate. 

           MILITARY HELICOPTERS whir by overhead, proceeding with 
           dispatch in the same direction. 
           KENNY FITZPATRICK, (40), amiability predictable on sight, is 
           among the crowd of neighbors. Kenny’s daughter, Ellie 
           Fitzpatrick, tugs at his sleeve --

                                 ELLIE FITZPATRICK
                        ...He wasn’t in the backyard, 
                        either.

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK
                        I don’t know, Ellie, we’ll find 
                        him.

                                 JOHN
                                (calling over)
                        Kenny.

           Kenny double-takes at John. Surprised to see him.

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK
                        John?

                                 JOHN
                        What the hell’s going on?

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK
                        Nobody knows. 

           John notices the judgemental squint that Kenny’s wife, DEBRA 
           FITZPATRICK, (39), levels at him.

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK (CONT’D)
                        Nobody’s Internet’s working.

                                 ALLISON
                        Nobody in the neighborhood?

           Another NERVOUS NEIGHBOR, (55), interjects --

                                 NERVOUS NEIGHBOR
                        Nobody anywhere.

           More MILITARY HELICOPTERS buzz by overhead.

           John steps away. Dials his cell phone, drawing an askance 
           look from Allison.

                                 ALLISON
                        Who are you calling?

                                 JOHN
                        Work. Someone there might know what 
                        this is about.

           Allison’s beetled brows bespeak her lingering suspicion.
                                 NERVOUS NEIGHBOR
                        Is there a military base around 
                        here?

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK
                        Not that I know of.

                                 DEBRA FITZPATRICK
                                (re: helicopters)
                        Then where are they going?

           Nathan wanders closer to Ellie Fitzpatrick... 

                                 NATHAN
                        Why are you crying, Ellie?

                                 ELLIE FITZPATRICK
                        Roscoe ran away.

           His cell phone to his ear, waiting for his call to connect, 
           John looks over upon overhearing Ellie.

                                 JOHN
                        I saw him.

                                 ELLIE FITZPATRICK
                        When?

           John is given pause. 

                                 JOHN
                        Last night...

           His call connects, instantly bringing him back to ground 
           level.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                                (into phone)
                        Walter, it’s John.
                                (listens)
                        Yeah, yeah-yeah, same here.
                                (listens)
                        What about our guy at Boeing-- 
                        Well, what did he say?

           John is taken aback by the response he receives. He conveys 
           this new information to the group --

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        The government’s grounded all non-
                        military aircraft.

                                 NERVOUS NEIGHBOR
                        Why?
           John shakes his head, “I don’t know.”

                                 JOHN
                                (back on phone)
                        Did you talk to anyone from--?

           WOMP!!-WOMP!!-WOMP!! .... WOMP!!-WOMP!!-WOMP!! .... 

           Everyone’s cell phone RINGS OUT a jarring ALARM as the 
           phones’ flashlights simultaneously FLASH. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Owww!

           The alarm blares against John’s ear, causes him to drop the 
           phone. The screen CRACKS when it strikes the ground.

           WOMP-WOMP-WOMP!! .... WOMP-WOMP-WOMP!! ....

           He picks it up. Confounded by what he reads its splintered 
           display --

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        The hell...?

           WOMP-WOMP-WOMP!! .... WOMP-WOMP-WOMP!!... (*NOTE: The alarm 
           will continue throughout the remainder of the scene).

           Allison unearths her phone from her pocket. 

                                 ALLISON
                                (re: phone display)
                        What’s a W.E.A. alert?

           Everyone looks to their phones. An EMERGENCY MESSAGE has been 
           delivered --

                                 DEBRA FITZPATRICK
                                (reading her phone)
                        “By order of the President of the 
                        United States and U.S. Central 
                        Command, all citizens are ordered 
                        to tune in to A.M. radio 88.3 at

                        from FEMA. This is not a test.” 

                                 NERVOUS NEIGHBOR
                        Mine says the same thing.

           A middle-aged LESS NERVOUS NEIGHBOR tries to calm everyone --
                                 LESS NERVOUS NEIGHBOR
                        Let’s all try to relax, okay? This 
                        could be anything.

           Beat.

                                 ED PRUITT (O.S.)
                        We’re under attack.

           Heads whip around, finding more NEIGHBORS bustling onto the 
           scene, including --

           Ed Pruitt (the man who drove past John the day prior and 
           sheepishly waved) and his wife, PEGGY PRUITT, (52).

                                 ED PRUITT (CONT’D)
                        The country’s under attack. That’s 
                        what everyone’s saying.

                                 JOHN
                        Who?

                                 ED PRUITT
                        I don’t know. North Korea, maybe.

                                 JOHN
                        No, who’s saying that?

                                 ED PRUITT
                        That’s what it said online.

                                 LESS NERVOUS NEIGHBOR
                                (dismissive)
                        We’re not under attack. For God’s 
                        sake, Ed.

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK
                                (to Ed Pruitt)
                        Your Internet’s working?

                                 PEGGY PRUITT
                        It was about two hours ago. 

                                 ED PRUITT
                        Then it stopped completely.

                                 NERVOUS NEIGHBOR
                        Same with us.

           John shakes some glass loose from his cracked phone screen.

                                 ALLISON
                        It’s almost ten o’clock now.
                                 NERVOUS NEIGHBOR
                                (to her husband)
                        We don’t have a radio. 

                                 ED PRUITT
                        Our car radios.
                                (to his family)
                        Come on.

           Ed Pruitt turns, about to walk away.

                                 NERVOUS NEIGHBOR
                        No, Ed, wait. Maybe we shouldn’t 
                        split up.

                                 LESS NERVOUS NEIGHBOR
                        You’re blowing this way out of 
                        proportion.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah. I’m sure it’s... 

           John second-guesses himself when two F-16 FIGHTER JETS scorch 
           by overhead.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        ...nothing.

           After a beat... the W.E.A. Alarm finally stops.

           Ellie Fizpatrick breaks the protracted silence --

                                 ELLIE FITZPATRICK
                        I’ve got a radio. 

           INT. FITZPATRICK RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Click.

           The FLATSCREEN T.V. powers on. An EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYSTEM 
           WARNING blares out. FEMA LOGO on screen.

           Over twenty neighbors crowd the LIVING ROOM. Nervous murmurs. 
           Varying degrees of concern.

           Kenny Fitzpatrick lowers the T.V. volume. Clicks through 
           several channels. All have been overtaken by this emergency 
           broadcast.

           John stands next to Nathan, a comforting hand on his 
           shoulder. Allison finds herself standing alongside Debra 
           Fitzpatrick, who leans in to speak quietly --
                                 DEBRA FITZPATRICK
                                (re: John)
                        He moved back in?

                                 ALLISON
                        His stuff’s back. 

                                 DEBRA FITZPATRICK
                        It’s a mistake, Allison.

           Allison looks over at John. Regards his care for Nathan.

                                 ALLISON
                        Nathan misses him.

                                 DEBRA FITZPATRICK
                        Of course he does, he’s seven. But 
                        you’re thirty-six... 
                                (beat)
                        And she’s not.

           Allison considers this. John looks over at her, weighing her 
           regard.

           Ellie Fitzpatrick hurries into the living room, carrying her 
           TRANSISTOR RADIO. She hands it off to her father, Kenny, 
           before settling in next to Nathan. The two children trade 
           uneasy glances as --

           Kenny places the radio on the coffee table. Turns it on...

           Squeals, chirps, and hissing static as Kenny spins through 
           A.M. stations -- soon finding a steady, eerie HUM...

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK
                        Quiet, quiet...

           Everyone huddles closer, surrounding the antiquated piece of 
           technology in a hunching circle. 

           As the steady HUM persists --

                                 ED PRUITT
                        You have it on the right station?

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK
                        Eighty-eight point three.

                                 NERVOUS NEIGHBOR
                        What’s that humming?

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK
                        I don’t--
           The hum abruptly ends, stopping Kenny mid-sentence. White 
           noise comes through the radio’s tinny speakers. 

           People exchange nervous looks. Swallow hard. Fear creeps in.

           A short feedback SQUELCH proceeds the voice of the FEMA 
           OFFICIAL who commands the microphone --

                                 FEMA OFFICIAL (V.O.)
                        Approximately two years ago, NASA 
                        identified a massive object 
                        following a path directed at our 
                        planet. World leaders met to 
                        discuss this extremely urgent 
                        matter, and plans were immediately 
                        put in place to redirect or destroy 
                        the object. 
                                (beat)
                        I regret to inform you that all 
                        deflection and destruction efforts -
                        - the last of which was conducted 
                        forty-eight hours ago -- were 
                        unsuccessful.
                                (beat)
                        This object -- an asteroid 
                        approximately nine miles in length -
                        -  will strike earth in four days. 
                        The impact will register on the 
                        highest level of the Torino Scale 
                        and will destroy our planet. What 
                        little life remains after impact 
                        will perish under conditions 
                        unsuitable for sustaining life.

           Everyone’s breath catches in their throat. Incoherent, 
           fearful murmurs. 

                                 FEMA OFFICIAL (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        As a precautionary measure, 
                        construction of underground bunkers 
                        began shortly after the asteroid 
                        was first identified. These bunkers 
                        -- which recent models indicate 
                        could withstand the impact -- are 
                        ready for habitation for those 
                        selected for relocation. 

                                 ED PRUITT
                        Those selected...?

                        Shhh!
                                 FEMA OFFICIAL (V.O.)
                        A lottery system has been 
                        established and random selections 
                        have already been made. Those 
                        chosen for relocation will be 
                        notified, in person, within twenty-
                        four hours.

                        imposed as of 11:00 A.M. Eastern 
                        Standard Time today. This is not a 
                        test. This is not a drill. This... 
                        is happening.
                                (beat)
                        God bless us all.

           A final squelch of microphone feedback. The message abruptly 
           ends and turns to static.

           Everyone is stunned into absolute silence. 

                                                                      CUT TO:

           INT. GARRITY RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           John’s fingers fly across a laptop keyboard as Allison speaks 
           frantically on the LAND LINE phone. 

                                 ALLISON
                        ...I don’t know, Dad, I don’t know! 
                        That’s all he said. 

           WE SEE that no matter what John types into the Internet 
           search bar (i.e., Google, Twitter, CNN.com, etc.), everything 
           gets redirected to the same FEMA website. It’s quite spare. 

           Glimpses reveal:

           “ENTER ZIP CODE TO FIND LOCAL PLACES OF WORSHIP”

           “METHODS FOR COPING WITH FEAR AND GRIEF”

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                                (listens)
                        No, it’s not. Because -- it’s not, 
                        I’m telling you, Dad, it’s not a 
                        hoax. If you had listened to it--
                                (listens)
                        He was from NASA.
                                 JOHN
                        FEMA.

                                 ALLISON
                                (to John)
                        What?

                                 JOHN
                        He was from FEMA, not NASA.

                                 ALLISON
                                (into phone)
                        He was from FEMA.
                                (listens, then)
                        Yeah. Yeah, he’s... here.

           Overhearing this, John looks at Allison. Her eyes flick over 
           at him. But she’s distracted when she notices Nathan...

           He sits at the kitchen table, across from John. A thick, 
           single tear crawls down his cheek.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        I have to go-I’ll call you back, I 
                        have to go. 

           Allison hangs up. Hurries over to Nathan. 

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                                (to John, re: Nathan)
                        Didn’t you notice him?

                                 JOHN
                        I was looking at the computer.

           John stands, prepared to comfort Nathan -- but Allison is 
           there for him first. 

                                 ALLISON
                        Everything’s okay. Don’t worry.

                                 NATHAN
                        Is Grandpa going to help us?

                                 ALLISON
                        Of course he is.

                                 NATHAN
                        How?

           Allison pulls Nathan closer. Hides her fear from him.
                                 ALLISON
                        You hungry? You must be hungry. 
                        Right? Tell you what -- go upstairs 
                        and wash your face. I’ll make you 
                        something, okay? Okay, go ahead. 

           Allison directs Nathan toward the stairs. She and John both 
           wait until he’s out of earshot. 

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        This is crazy, this is fucking 
                        crazy...

           John places a gentle hand on Allison’s shoulder. 

           She accepts it for a moment -- but then stands up, purposely 
           causing it to fall away. 

           She picks up her cell phone. Dials.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        We need to go there.

                                 JOHN
                        No we don’t. Your father--

                                 ALLISON
                        I’m calling him back.

           She’s met by a VOICE MESSAGE from the cell provider:

                                 VOICE MESSAGE (V.O.)
                        We’re sorry, all circuits are busy 
                        at this time. Please hang up and 
                        try--

           She kills the call with her thumb. Slaps her cell phone onto 
           the counter, swipes the land line phone once again.

                                 JOHN
                        It’s not going to do anything.

                                 ALLISON
                        Maybe it will.

                                 JOHN
                        It’s a God damn shipping container 
                        he buried in the ground.

                                 ALLISON
                        It’s something.

                                 JOHN
                        No it’s not. Not for this.
                                 ALLISON
                        It’s more than you’ve done.

                                 JOHN
                        What the hell could I have done?!

                                 ALLISON
                        I don’t know. I don’t know!!

                                 JOHN
                        We can’t go all the way to Maine.

                                 ALLISON
                        You just don’t want to have to face 
                        him.

                                 JOHN
                        That’s not it --

                                 ALLISON
                        Bullshit, it’s not. 

                                 JOHN
                        We need to stay here until we 
                        figure out what the hell’s going 
                        on.

                                 ALLISON
                        We know what’s going on!
                                (calms herself)
                        I’m scared. Do you understand? I 
                        want someone to make me feel safe.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m right here, Allison.

           Allison’s lack of confidence in John is laid bare by her 
           silence.

           They both notice Nathan has returned. He listens from the 
           stairs. How long has he been there? How much did he hear?

           As these questions are quietly considered --

           KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK!!

           John walks to where he can get a view through the DINING ROOM 
           window. 

           Allison joins him. Sees what has given rise to his concern --

           Several MILITARY VEHICLES are parked outside their home. 
           Heavily-armed SOLDIERS stand guard, like Sentries, along the 
           perimeter of their yard.
           FRONT DOOR - SECONDS LATER

           John opens the door. Finds two SOLDIERS in full battle-
           rattle. All business. One holds an empty RED DUFFEL BAG. 

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        John Garrity?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah...

           Allison and Nathan have filed in behind John. Soldier #1 
           regards them --

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        Allison and Nathan Garrity?

                                 ALLISON
                        Yes. What is this?

           John peers past the Soldiers on his doorstep. Sees that Kenny 
           Fitzpatrick, Ed Pruitt, and several other neighbors approach 
           his property. More than curious.

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        Your family’s been selected for 
                        relocation.

                                 ALLISON
                        Oh my God.

           Soldier #1 steals a quick glance back at the onlooking 
           neighbors. 

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        I recommend you keep this to 
                        yourselves. 

           John nods a hurried nod. Still trying to process all of this.

                                 JOHN
                        What do we need to do?

           Soldier #1 gestures to Soldier #2, who hands over the empty 
           Red Duffel Bag.

                                 SOLDIER #1
                                (re: duffel bag)
                        Pack only what you can fit in here. 
                        Nothing else. There’s an 
                        information booklet inside.
                                (then)
                        You’re on Ship Three-Three-A. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SOLDIER #1 (CONT'D)
                        It’s a commercial cruise liner 
                        that’s been commandeered, leaving 
                        from Boston Harbor tomorrow at 
                        eight o’clock A.M., sharp. It sails 
                        with our without you.

                                 ALLISON
                        To where?

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        Where not at liberty to say.

           ANGLE ON 

           Kenny Fitzpatrick and the other neighbors, all of who watch 
           John from the street. SENTRY #1 keeps the crowd back.

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK
                        What are they doing over there? 
                        What’s that bag for?
                                (yelling over)
                        Hey, John. John!

                                 SENTRY #1
                        Back up --

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK
                        -- I wanna know what’s--

                                 SENTRY #1
                        -- I said, back up!

           BACK TO SCENE - FRONT DOOR

           Moving briskly, Soldier #2 produces three hard-shell plastic 
           cases, each tagged with its intended recipient’s name, date 
           of birth, and Social Security Number.

           Using the pliers on his Leatherman, Soldier #2 snips the zip-
           ties securing the cases shut. Opens them, revealing --

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        Give me your wrists.

           -- ELECTRONIC I.D. BRACELETS, similar in design to a Fit-Bit. 

           John extends his wrist. Soldier #2 wraps the I.D. bracelet 
           around it. John regards Nathan’s hesitation.

                                 JOHN
                                (to Nathan)
                        It’s okay.
           Nathan extends his wrist. Has his I.D. bracelet fastened, as 
           does Allison.

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Do not take them off for any 
                        reason. You won’t be allowed to 
                        board without them.

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        Look here --

           Soldier #1 aims a TOUGH-CASE-covered iPad CAMERA at John. 

           Snap. A close-up of John’s face is photographed. UPLOADED. 
           All completed in a matter of seconds.

                                 SOLDIER #1 (CONT’D)
                        Now you and you.

           Snap. Allison’s photo. Snap. Nathan’s photo. UPLOADED. 

                                 SOLDIER #1 (CONT’D)
                        Eight o’clock A.M. I’d start moving 
                        now.
                                (to Soldier #2)
                        Let’s go.

                                 JOHN
                        Wait...

           The Soldiers turn but never discontinue their departure.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                                (re: neighbors)
                        What about them?

           The Soldiers offer no reply. The Sentries fall in line behind 
           them, take to their vehicles.

           The hulking vehicles rumble away in a hurry.

           Kenny Fitzpatrick, Ed Pruitt, and the other neighbors migrate 
           across John’s lawn. Approach his doorstep like an incoming 
           tide.

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK
                        What was all that? John?

           The neighbors draw closer. Their pace picks up. The mental 
           pieces starting to come together.

                                 DEBRA FITZPATRICK
                        What’s on their wrists? 
           The picture fully takes form.

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK
                        Holy shit.

                                 ALLISON
                        Shut the door.

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK
                        Hey --

                                 ALLISON
                        John!

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK
                        Hey!

           John shuts and locks the door. 

           KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           The doorbell RINGS incessantly. HOLLERS and angry KNOCKS on 
           the front door in the b.g.

           Their jackets already on, John and Allison move at a frantic 
           clip. John scans the INFORMATIONAL BOOKLET.

           Allison stuffs an overabundance of Nathan’s DIABETES SUPPLIES 
           (primarily his INSULIN) into the red duffel bag.

                                 JOHN
                        Are those all his supplies?

                                 ALLISON
                        Years worth.

           John calls upstairs --

                                 JOHN
                        Nathan, we’ve gotta hurry!

                                 NATHAN (O.S.)
                        I can’t find Nubbs.

                                 JOHN
                        What?

                                 ALLISON
                        His blanket--
                                (yelling to Nathan)
                        We can’t bring it. Come on!

           Allison’s cell phone RINGS. Allison takes a quick glance at 
           the CALLER I.D. -- “FITZPATRICK, KENNY.”
                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        It’s Kenny.

                                 JOHN
                        Shit. Don’t answer it.

           Nathan hurries downstairs, his blanket it tow.

                                 ALLISON
                                (re: blanket)
                        We don’t have room for it in the 
                        bag.

                                 JOHN
                        Just carry it.
                                (then to Allison)
                        Do you have his glucose tabs?

                                 ALLISON
                        In the bag.

           The doorbell keeps ringing; the knocks on the door are 
           getting louder. The land line and their cell phones ring off 
           the hook.

                                 JOHN
                        We’ve gotta go.

                                 ALLISON
                        Where are my keys?

                                 JOHN
                        I’ve got them. Come on!

           John, Allison, and Nathan make for the attached garage. The 
           red duffel bag in tow.

                                 NATHAN
                        Wait...

                                 ALLISON
                        No, Nathan --

           Nathan hurries back around the corner, out of sight for a 
           moment --

                                 JOHN
                        Nathan, we’ve gotta go!

           -- and then returns, holding the purple cheetah stuffed 
           animal. This is not lost on John. 

           Beat.
                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Come on.

           They make a hasty exit through a door leading to the attached 
           garage.

           INT. GARRITY RESIDENCE - GARAGE/INT. ALLISON’S HONDA - NIGHT

           The doors slam to Allison’s Honda CRV compact S.U.V. John 
           starts the ignition. The headlights flick on.

           He stares over the driver’s wheel, at the closed garage door, 
           preparing for what might await them on the other side.

                                 JOHN
                        Nathan... close your eyes. Cover 
                        your ears, too.

           Nathan, seated in the backseat, does as he’s told.

           John and Allison exchange a look of trepidation... then John 
           presses the garage door remote. The door grinds to life. 

           Dozens of legs become visible as the door slowly rises...

           The Honda CRV is swarmed by neighbors as it slowly emerges 
           from the garage. They BANG on the windows, YANK desperately 
           at the locked doors.

           Chaos. Dialogue bleeds together --

                                 ED PRUITT
                        John! Hey!!

                                 DEBRA FITZPATRICK
                        Please, take Ellie!

           In the backseat, Nathan peeks outside, just long enough to 
           see Ellie Fitzpatrick.

                                 NATHAN
                                (re: Ellie)
                        No, wait!

                                 ALLISON
                        Close your eyes, Nathan!

                                 NATHAN
                        We have room for her!

                                 JOHN
                        We can’t!
                                 ELLIE FITZPATRICK
                        Nathan!

                                 NATHAN
                        We have room!

           Nathan unlocks his door. Starts to open it.

                                 JOHN
                        No-no-no, Nathan!

           The door is barely open an inch before it’s being pulled open 
           wider by the neighbors.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Shut the door! Shut the--

           Allison heaves herself halfway into the backseat. Pulls 
           Nathan’s door. It’s almost closed... Almost... 

           She gets hooked into Debra Fitzpatrick’s pleading stare.

                                 DEBRA FITZPATRICK
                        Take her! Please, Allison, take 
                        Ellie with you!!

                                 NATHAN
                        Mom, let her in!

           Allison is torn -- but ultimately looks away, wracked with 
           guilt, and fully closes and locks the door.

                                 DEBRA FITZPATRICK
                        No!!

           The vehicle sways from side to side as neighbors slap against 
           the glass and yank on the doors.

           The back window SPLINTERS. Nathan SCREAMS.

           John rounds out of the driveway. His headlights cut across 
           Kenny Fitzpatrick, his dismay unambiguous.

           John and his family speed out of their suburban neighborhood, 
           their despairing neighbors left in their wake.

           INT./EXT. ALLISON’S HONDA CRV - NIGHT

           POLICE CARS speed past in the opposite direction.

           Allison looks to her side mirror to see Nathan, who holds his 
           tear-filled stare out his backseat window.
           John disregards a RED LIGHT. Speeds right through it.

           INT./EXT. ALLISON’S HONDA - NIGHT

           The vehicle starts up a highway ON-RAMP. Encounters gridlock 
           traffic halfway up its length.

                                 JOHN
                        No... No-no-no.

           Allison climbs out of the car --

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

           -- and hurries further up the ramp, on foot. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Allison?!

           Traffic is backed for as far as Allison can see.

                                 ALLISON
                        Shit.

           She hurries back to the vehicle. Jumps inside.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        It’s backed up for miles.

           John reacts with no delay. Throws the vehicle into REVERSE. 
           Speeds backwards down the on-ramp.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Watch out!

           He SWERVES hard to avoid a fast-approaching Jeep Wrangler. 
           SCRAPES the side of their CRV against a jersey barrier.

           They reach the bottom of the on-ramp. John shifts into DRIVE. 

           WIDE SHOT 

           of the white Honda CRV as it disappears down a long 
           straightaway of empty road.

           EXT. BOSTON, MA - SEAPORT - MORNING

           Eight CRUISE SHIPS are anchored just offshore, flanked by 
           NAVY GUNSHIPS. Smaller COAST GUARD and Navy crafts crisscross 
           the harbor.
           AT THE PORT

           TENS OF THOUSANDS of DESPERATE PEOPLE crowd, all held back by 
           military barricades and armed soldiers.

           EXT. BOSTON, MA - CITY STREET - MORNING

           Gridlock traffic. HORNS blare. People HOLLER. LOOTERS smash 
           in and out from stores.

           SEE Allison’s white Honda CRV wedged in the unending line of 
           vehicles.

           INT. ALLISON’S HONDA CRV - SAME

           The Seaport is visible far in the distance. John nervously 
           taps his fingers against the steering wheel. 

                                 JOHN
                        Come on-come on...

           Nathan sleeps in the backseat, clutching his stuffed animal.

           John glances at the dashboard clock: 7:21 A.M. 

           He looks around, in search of a solution. He evidently lands 
           on one. Angles past the cars in front of him --

                                 ALLISON
                        What are you doing?

           -- and pulls down an ALLEY. Stops abruptly. Parks. Pockets 
           the keys.

                                 JOHN
                        Nathan, wake up. Wake up.

           Nathan rouses. Allison requires no explanation; she knows 
           what the plan is. 

                                 ALLISON
                                (to Nathan)
                        Put your jacket on.

           John grabs the red duffel bag. The Garritys hurry out of the 
           CRV.

           SEE that John has left his splintered-screen cell phone 
           charging in the cup holder.

                                 JOHN
                        Let’s go. 
           They make their way on foot, abandoning their vehicle.

                                 ALLISON
                                (to Nathan)
                        Give me your hand.

           They round the alleyway. Immediately hit by the crush of 
           chaos that fills the streets.

                                 JOHN
                        Stay close.

           EXT. BOSTON, MA - SEAPORT - MORNING

           GANGWAYS stretch to three of the cruise ships. The other 
           ships queue behind them. 

           The fortunate board the ships. The less fortunate clamor for 
           survival, held behind a BLOCKADE. A painful portrait of 
           humanity.

           John leads Allison and Nathan, threading them through the 
           unruly crowd. Buffeted by the wave of collected bodies.

           Knocked off balance, John loses grip of the red duffel bag. 
           It falls to the ground, instantly absorbed by trampling legs. 

                                 JOHN
                        Shit!

           He pushes and shoves his way over to the bag. Lowers to the 
           ground, catching a KNEE to the head as he stretches --

           -- until his fingers finally make purchase. He rips the bag 
           back into his possession.

           With no time to waste, the Garritys forge ahead. Closer to 
           their designated CHECKPOINT. 

           Armed GUARDS bark at them upon their arrival, fighting for 
           audibility over the din --

                                 GUARD #1
                        Bracelets.

           Guard #1 scans their bracelets with a smart-phone-like 
           device.

           Their pictures (taken in their doorway the night prior) 
           appear on the device screen. Two short beeps, a GREEN LIGHT 
           appears. 

           Guard #1 addresses Guard #2, who mans the fence gate --
                                 GUARD
                        Let them through.
                                (to the Garritys)
                        You’re on Ship Three-Three-A. 
                        There. Go.

           John ushers his family through the narrowly open gate. Guard 
           #2 slams it shut immediately after them.

           They RACE toward the docked cruise ships. Charcoal smoke 
           spirals from their stacks. Departure is imminent.

           EXT. BOSTON, MA - SEAPORT - GANGWAY - MORNING

           Bedlam as hundreds of selectees file toward the cruise ship’s 
           main point of ingress. A first-world refugee crisis. 

           INT. CRUISE SHIP - MAIN LOBBY - MORNING

           Teeming with scared people of all ages and from all walks of 
           life. MILITARY PERSONNEL maintain some semblance of order.

           THREE LINES split at the final CHECKPOINT, situated just 
           inside the ship’s main entryway. Like airport security, only 
           moving very swiftly.

           The Garritys close in on the start of LINE THREE. 

           An African-American STAFF SERGEANT enforces expedition --

                                 STAFF SERGEANT
                        Have your bracelets ready. All you, 
                        no, this line over here. Go.

           Reacting to the Staff Sergeant’s orders, SEVERAL PEOPLE cut 
           in between the Garritys, creating a divide between John and 
           Allison and Nathan -- unbeknownst to John.

                                 ALLISON
                        John! John!

           John proceeds forward in LINE THREE, still assuming his 
           family is right behind him. Unable to hear Allison over the 
           chaos.

           The Staff Sergeant directs Allison and Nathan toward the 
           first of the three checkpoint lines.

                                 STAFF SERGEANT
                        Line number one, Ma’am.
                                 ALLISON
                        My husband’s in that line.

                                 STAFF SERGEANT
                        Line one, Ma’am.

                                 ALLISON
                        But--

                                 STAFF SERGEANT
                        Meet him once you’re through. Go.
                                (to someone else)
                        Line two, sir. Bracelets ready.

           Allison does not argue any further. 

                                 ALLISON
                        John!

           She waves her arms over her head. John finally realizes 
           they’re not behind him -- sees Allison from afar. 

           Allison gestures that she and Nathan will be going through 
           Line One. John notices a RED-HAIRED SOLDIER among those 
           manning that line.

           John signals to Allison that he’ll meet her inside the Main 
           Lobby. She nods back. Their unspoken, impromptu plan set.

           ON JOHN

           His bracelet is scanned at the checkpoint. He’s patted-down 
           by a YOUNG SOLDIER. 

           John cranes backwards during his pat-down, trying to keep 
           tabs on Alison and Nathan -- but the sheer chaos makes it 
           difficult.

                                 YOUNG SOLDIER
                        Do you have any weapons on you, 
                        sir?

                                 JOHN
                                (distracted)
                        What?

                                 YOUNG SOLDIER
                        Do you have any (weapons)?

                                 JOHN
                                (over)
                        No, no.
                                 YOUNG SOLDIER
                                (to Commander)
                        He’s good.
                                (to John)
                        Keep moving inside.

           John proceeds through the checkpoint, into the ship’s Main 
           Lobby.

           ON ALLISON AND NATHAN

           Their bracelets are scanned at the Line One checkpoint by the 
           Red-Haired Soldier. 

           They’re then patted-down by an HISPANIC SOLDIER.

           He’s about to give the “all clear,” when he happens upon 
           Nathan’s INSULIN PUMP, clipped to the boy’s waistband.

                                 HISPANIC SOLDIER
                        What’s this?

                                 ALLISON
                        His pump, his insulin pump.

                                 HISPANIC SOLDIER
                                (calling over)
                        Lieutenant.

           ON JOHN

           He struggles to see Line One at the checkpoint. He’s knocked 
           asunder as nervous passengers bump past him. 

           A visibly DISTRESSED SOLDIER tries to unclog the bottleneck --

                                 DISTRESSED SOLDIER
                        Keep moving. Inside.

                                 JOHN
                        My wife and son are (over there).

                                 DISTRESSED SOLDIER
                                (over)
                        Inside, sir. This area has to stay 
                        clear.

           Soldiers steer the collected mass of people like cattle. John 
           is swept away, craning back. Can’t locate his wife or son.

                                 JOHN
                        Allison?!

           ON ALLISON AND NATHAN
           Allison pleads with the LIEUTENANT --

                                 ALLISON
                                (re: insulin pump)
                        -- We can leave it. He has shots he 
                        can use instead.

                                 LIEUTENANT
                        That’s not the issue, ma’am.

                                 ALLISON
                        We have bracelets! We have--

           The Lieutenant speaks into his SHOULDER WALKIE --

                                 LIEUTENANT
                                (into walkie)
                        Over at Line One.

                                 ALLISON
                                (re: Hispanic Soldier)
                        He scanned them!

                                 LIEUTENANT
                        That’s not the issue, either.
                                (listens to walkie, then)
                        Copy that.
                                (to Allison and Nathan)
                        Let’s go.

                                 ALLISON
                        What?! Wait--

                                 LIEUTENANT
                        Follow me, please.

           Allison’s face forms a rictus of fear as the Lieutenant 
           directs her and Nathan out from the line.

           SEE that the Red-Haired Soldier wants to protest on their 
           behalf... but ultimately resigns himself to his duty. 

           ON JOHN

           Corralled along the perimeter of the Main Lobby -- but now 
           without a clear view of the checkpoint.

                                 DISTRESSED SOLDIER
                                (to everyone)
                        Keep filing in. Keep moving.

           John breaks ranks. Hurries back toward the checkpoint.
                                 DISTRESSED SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           John shoulders past passengers and Soldiers alike.

           He’s stopped by the stiff arm of a STOCKY SOLDIER --

                                 STOCKY SOLDIER
                        Whoa-hey!

           John peers past him, still unable to locate Nathan or 
           Allison. Just an array of unfamiliar faces.

                                 JOHN
                        I need to know if my wife and son 
                        boarded.

                                 STOCKY SOLDIER
                        Please get back where you were.

                                 JOHN
                        My son’s seven. He had a blue 
                        jacket on. My wife has blonde hair; 
                        she’s about five-six--

                                 STOCKY SOLDIER
                        -- Sir --

                                 JOHN
                        Did you see them come through?

                                 STOCKY SOLDIER
                        I don’t know. Please get back.

           INT. BOSTON, MA - SEAPORT - FEMA TRAILER - MORNING

           One of several makeshift COMMAND CENTERS located inside the 
           fenced-in area. The noise of the unruly crowd just outside.

           Allison and Nathan sit across the desk of MAJOR BREEN, (50), 
           pleading their case. The Hispanic Soldier stands by.

                                 ALLISON
                                (re: Nathan)
                        His father’s onboard. Please.

                                 MAJOR BREEN
                        You can board --
                                (re: Nathan)
                        -- but he can’t.

                                 NATHAN
                        No, Mom, no--
                                 ALLISON
                                (to Nathan)
                        Nathan--
                                (to Major Breen )
                        I’m not leaving my son behind. 

                                 MAJOR BREEN
                        There’s nothing more I can do.

           INT. CRUISE SHIP - MAIN LOBBY - SAME

           John’s appeal to the Stocky Soldier continues --

                                 JOHN
                        Where’s the other guy-- the red-
                        headed guy? The soldier. He was at 
                        the checkpoint when they were.

                                 STOCKY SOLDIER
                        I don’t know who you’re (talking 
                        about).

                                 JOHN
                                (over)
                        I need to know if they made it 
                        through the checkpoint. I couldn’t 
                        see (if they made it).

                                 STOCKY SOLDIER
                                (over)
                        Did they have credentials? 

                                 JOHN
                        What credentials?

                                 STOCKY SOLDIER
                        I.D. bracelets. Did they--

                                 JOHN
                        Yes, yes. We all (have them).

                                 STOCKY SOLDIER
                                (over)
                        Then they’re on board. Now back up.

           John’s worried, wandering gaze hooks onto a young boy wearing 
           a blue jacket, who walks alone up a winding GRAND STAIRCASE.

                                 JOHN
                        Nathan!

           John rushes across the Main Lobby, bumps past crisscrossing 
           passengers. 
           He bounds the stairs two at a time. Rounds the staircase’s 
           curve, catches up with the boy. Only to discover --

           -- it’s not Nathan. 

           Gripped with panic, John descends several stairs, allowing 
           him an elevated view of the hundreds and hundreds of people 
           overcrowding the Main Lobby.

           His eyes dart everywhere in desperate search for his family.

           SEE that he still holds the red duffel bag full of Nathan’s 
           diabetes supplies.

           A beat. Then he races up the stairs.

           EXT. CRUISE SHIP - FORECASTLE - MORNING

           The outdoor corridors brim with worried passengers.

           John marches past them, searching. He peers inside windows, 
           opens doors. His eyes oscillate between passengers onboard 
           and the mass of humanity gathered back at the seaport.

           INT. BOSTON, MA - SEAPORT - FEMA TRAILER - SAME

           Allison continues her desperate plea with Major Breen --

                                 ALLISON
                                (re: Nathan)
                        He has a bracelet. He was selected 
                        to go!

                                 MAJOR BREEN
                        He shouldn’t have been. He has--

                                 ALLISON
                        --Why?

                                 MAJOR BREEN
                        -- He has type-one diabetes. I 
                        don’t know how that went unnoticed 
                        when his medical records were 
                        pulled for pre-screening--

                                 ALLISON
                        --So what? So what?!

                                 MAJOR BREEN
                        It was outlined in the 
                        informational booklet. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAJOR BREEN (CONT'D)
                        We can’t accept anyone with a 
                        chronic medical condition.

                                 ALLISON
                        But he was almost onboard!

                                 MAJOR BREEN
                        It was an oversight.

                                 ALLISON
                                (re: Hispanic Soldier)
                        If he hadn’t seen the pump, we’d be 
                        on that ship right now. 

           The Hispanic Soldier averts his eyes.

                                 MAJOR BREEN
                        I told you, there’s nothing more I 
                        can do.

                                 ALLISON
                        Fuck you, fuck you! You can do 
                        everything! He has a bracelet; just 
                        pretend you never saw the fucking 
                        pump!

                                 MAJOR BREEN
                        We have a protocol--

                                 ALLISON
                        Then--then change it. He’s just a 
                        kid! Change it! Do something!

                                 MAJOR BREEN
                        No.

           Major Breen stands from his desk. Turns to walk away. Allison 
           is stunned by his callousness. 

                                 ALLISON
                        What if it were you?! What if you 
                        couldn’t bring your family?

           Major Breen stops. Looks at her, struck by her statement. 
           Suddenly betraying his humanity.

                                 MAJOR BREEN
                        I can’t.

           A beat, then he walks away. Allison is dumbstruck.
           EXT. CRUISE SHIP - TOP DECK - SAME

           Filled five times over capacity. Almost every square inch 
           occupied. People even crowd in the emptied swimming pool.

           John shoulders through the crowd. 

                                 JOHN
                        Allison!! ... Nathan!!

           His shouts are all but consumed by the cacophony.

           EXT. BOSTON, MA - SEAPORT - MORNING

           Outside the FEMA blockade. Allison holds Nathan by the hand 
           as they weave through the crowd, away from the seaport.

           They soon escape the masses -- only to take in a wider view 
           of the city at large. Turmoil spreads. Looting. Violence.

           She notices Nathan’s sudden disorientation.

                                 ALLISON
                        You okay?

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

           He nods a small nod. She clearly has her doubts.

           Allison then sees that, nearby, a sprawling CONSTRUCTION WALL 
           has been transformed into a collage of desperation. Covered 
           with hand-written notes, photos, missing person flyers, etc.

           She grabs a Styrofoam container from a garbage bin. Tears off 
           its lid. 

           INT. CRUISE SHIP - INTERIOR HALLWAY - MORNING

           Every cabin is triple-occupied. Many families encamp in the 
           hallway. Sweat dripping, John pads down the carpeted 
           straightaway. 

           Observing the faces he passes: 

           The disconsolate mother. The confused four-year-old. The 
           shell-shocked family of four. 

           Everyday people, all. Failing to make sense of any of this.

           WOOOOOOOOT!!
           The ship HORN blares. John quickens his pace.

           INT. CRUISE SHIP - MAIN LOBBY - MORNING

           John descends the grand staircase. His increasing 
           hopelessness and despair evident.

           He stops at a LANDING. Observes the now slightly less crowded 
           Main Lobby from this elevated view. 

                                 JOHN
                                (sotto)
                        No...

           WE SEE what John observed: a Soldier closing the ship’s main 
           door.

           John’s paralyzed... until he sees -- the familiar Red-Haired 
           Soldier. John hurries down the stairs. Crosses the crowded 
           Main Lobby --

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Wait. Wait!! 

           The Red-Haired Soldier stops.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You were at the checkpoint before. 
                        Near the door.

                                 RED-HAIRED SOLDIER
                        Yeah.

                                 JOHN
                        My wife and my son -- I need to 
                        know if they got on board. I can’t 
                        find them--

                                 RED-HAIRED SOLDIER
                        A Location Center’s been set up on 
                        the Lido Deck. Check in with (them 
                        and see if--)

                                 JOHN
                                (over)
                        No-no, listen to me-listen to me! I 
                        don’t think they made it through 
                        the checkpoint. My son had a blue 
                        jacket on. His name’s Nathan 
                        Garrity. He was holding a stuffed 
                        animal. A purple cheetah. He has 
                        blonde hai--
           Regret crosses Red-Haired soldier’s face.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                                (off his regret)
                        What?

                                 RED-HAIRED SOLDIER
                        The kid -- your son -- he has a 
                        medical device of some (kind)?

                                 JOHN
                                (over)
                        An insulin pump-- Where are they?!

                                 RED-HAIRED SOLDIER
                        They got pulled.

                                 JOHN
                        Wait-wait -- they’re not on the 
                        boat?! They didn’t...?

           The Red-Haired Soldier solemnly shakes his head, “No.”

                                 RED-HAIRED SOLDIER
                        I’m sorry. 

           John’s mind swims. The Red-Haired Soldier walks on.

           A beat. Then John’s thousand-yard stare slowly takes focus 
           on... the now closed main door.

           He rushes over to it. Wrestles with its hefty components, 
           struggling to turn the fly-wheel.

           The African-American Staff Sergeant takes notice --

                                 STAFF SERGEANT
                        Hey! 

           He pulls his FIREARM as he stalks closer. But John refuses to 
           stop. 

                                 STAFF SERGEANT (CONT’D)
                        Get away from the door. 

                                 JOHN
                        I need to get off this ship.

                                 STAFF SERGEANT
                        Sir, let go of the door. Now!

           John is seconds away from being shot. He finally lets go. 
           Half-raises his hands.
                                 JOHN
                        Listen to me -- please. My wife and 
                        son were taken off this ship. I 
                        need to get off.

                                 STAFF SERGEANT
                        I... We’re leaving any minute.

                                 JOHN
                        Please.
                                (beat)
                        I can’t leave them. 

           OFF THE Staff Sergeant’s ambivalence --

           EXT. BOSTON, MA - CITY STREET - MORNING

           Fraught with danger. Abandoned vehicles. Police cars SPEED 
           past. Fear and panic spread like a pox.

           Allison and Nathan navigate through the anarchic environs.

           A large BOX TRUCK jumps the curb --

                                 ALLISON
                        Watch out!!

           -- and COLLIDES with a parked car, PILE-DRIVING it forward, 
           missing Nathan by inches.

           Allison scoops her son into her arms. Forges ahead.

           EXT. BOSTON, MA - ALLEY - MORNING

           Allison and Nathan round a familiar corner, leading them to 
           their Honda CRV. Allison’s relieved to see it’s still there.

           They hurry to it, climb inside. But what little hope she 
           clings to evaporates...

                                 ALLISON
                        No...

           The keys aren’t in the ignition. 

           She slaps at her jacket pockets to no avail. Checks the 
           visors -- no luck.

                                 NATHAN
                        What’s wrong?

           Allison collapses back into the seat. Overwhelmed.
                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Mom?

           She doesn’t respond. Slowly shakes her head. 

           Bzzzzzz... Bzzzzzz... Bzzzzzz...

           Allison’s eyes track the sound to the cup holder, where 
           John’s cracked-screen cell phone vibrates.

           Bzzzzz.... Bzzzzzz....

           Looking at the display, she’s given pause upon seeing it’s an 
           incoming call from:

           “MEGAN FOSTER”

           Allison considers answering. And then she does.

                                 ALLISON
                        Hello?
                                (listens)
                        This is his wife.
                                (listens)
                        I know who you are.

           OUTSIDE VEHICLE

           Allison continues her conversation. And though we can no 
           longer hear her, her discomposure is no less apparent.

           After a moment, PRE-LAP: a FIRE TRUCK SIREN.

           EXT. BOSTON, MA - CITY STREET - MORNING

           A city FIRE TRUCK speeds down the street. Allison and Nathan 
           allow it to pass before crossing. 

                                 NATHAN
                                (weakly)
                        Mom...

           Allison doesn’t hear him as she leads him to the other side 
           of the street. 

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Mom.

           The urgency in his voice stops her dead. His skin has fallen 
           ashen, his eyes glassy.

                                 ALLISON
                        Are you low?
           She fishes through her jacket pocket. Retrieves several HARD 
           CANDIES. A continuous stream of random people pass by.

                                 NATHAN
                        I... I don’t know...

                                 ALLISON
                        Did you test your blood sugar? 
                        Where’s your meter?

                                 NATHAN
                        In that bag. 

           She flusters in the face of this dilemma. 

                                 ALLISON
                        I can’t -- I can’t give you a bunch 
                        of candy if your blood sugar’s 
                        already through the roof. 

           Allison scans her surroundings. Notices a C.V.S. two blocks 
           away.

           EXT. C.V.S. - MORNING

           Shattered double-doors. Cubes of glass litter the concrete. 
           People flood in and out carrying pilfered medicine, packaged 
           food, bottled water, etc.

           Allison and Nathan step back from the entrance as an ELDERLY 
           MAN pushes his wheelchair-bound ELDERLY WIFE out of the 
           store. The woman, clearly unwell, clutches medication.

           As they pass, Allison sees that the Elderly Man is carrying a 
           HANDGUN.

                                 ELDERLY WIFE
                        Wait... My blood pressure meds.

           INT. C.V.S. - MORNING

           It's a mob scene inside. People raid the PHARMACY. Two MEN 
           fight violently over a prescription. 

           Allison and Nathan move with caution down the aisle marked: 
           “DIABETES SUPPLIES”.

           She locates her intended item: a BLOOD GLUCOSE METER and a 
           box of TEST STRIPS.

           Allison tears open the boxes. Rips through the plastic 
           packaging with her teeth. Removes each item.
                                 ALLISON
                        Give me--

           Nathan needs no further explanation. Offers his finger.

           Allison pricks it with the enclosed LANCET. Absorbs the 
           droplet of blood with a TEST STRIP. The blood sugar meter 
           reads: 

           “BG: 303 - HIGH”

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, you’re three hundred.

           Allison un-clips Nathan’s insulin pump from his waistband. 
           Presses a few buttons to deliver two units of insulin.

           She’s about to clip it back to his waistband when she 
           notices...

           ...the pump’s insulin reservoir is nearly empty.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                                (sotto)
                        Shit...

           A beat, then she clips the pump back to Nathan’s waistband. 
           Looks across the store, at the PHARMACY.

           INT. C.V.S. - PHARMACY - MORNING

           People hop the counter. Ransack shelves, steal medication. 

           Allison and Nathan scour the bare shelves of a glass-door 
           pharmacy refrigerator, in search of --

           “INSULIN - 100 UNITS PER ML”

           Only one vial remains. Just as Allison’s about to grab it --

           BANG!! BANG-BANG!!

           GUNSHOTS pop inside the store. People reflexively drop low, 
           scatter like ants. 

           Allison shields Nathan with her body. SHOUTING is heard.

           BANG!!

           An errant bullet SHATTERS the pharmacy refrigerator’s glass 
           door.
           Allison and Nathan fast-crawl around the counter -- then down 
           the COSMETICS AISLE. Chaos persists nearby.

           Allison peers around the edge. The front door of the store is 
           in sight. 

           BANG!!

           An OVERWEIGHT MAN is SHOT in the chest. He stumbles over a 
           display, fighting for survival before collapsing.

           The familiar Elderly Man appears soon thereafter... 

           Tracking down his fallen prey. He steals a stolen bottle of 
           HEART MEDICATION from the Overweight Man’s moribund grasp. 

           Allison cranes toward the pharmacy, now far in the rear of 
           the store... then up ahead to the exit, which is much closer.

           After brief deliberation -- she seems to decide on a second 
           go at the pharmacy.

           Just as she’s about to move in that direction --

                                 LOUD VOICE (O.S.)
                        Get on the ground!! 

           Eight SOLDIERS storm the store, M-16s drawn. Seconds later --

                                 LOUD SOLDIER
                        Put down the--!

           BANG!! / RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!!

           Staccato bursts of MACHINE GUNFIRE. Gunsmoke hazes the air. 

           Allison and Nathan make for the exit. 

           Gunshots continue. Glass shatters. People scream. 

           EXT. C.V.S. - CONTINUOUS

           A second National Guard HUMVEE screeches onto the scene just 
           as Allison and Nathan make their narrow escape. 

           EXT. BOSTON, MA - SEAPORT - MORNING

           The massive crowd’s desperation and anger intensifies as the 
           convoy of cruise ships departs alongside Navy warships. 

           The hostile masses push harder against the barriers and fence 
           barricade. The military resists commensurately. 
           From out of the throng emerges a lone FIGURE endeavoring to 
           move away from the barricades --

           John. His pleas to exit the ship having evidently gone 
           answered.

           Once free from the tangled mass of humanity, he stops --

                                 JOHN
                        Nathan!! .... Allison!!

           It’s then, from afar, he notices the CONSTRUCTION WALL 
           covered with posted letters, etc. 

           WALL - MOMENTS LATER

           John cursorily scans the wall. Just as he's about to move on, 
           he notices...

           ...Nathan’s stuffed animal cheetah. John reads the note to 
           which it’s attached, written on a Styrofoam container lid:

           “JOHN GARRITY, I HAVE NATHAN. COULD NOT GET ON SHIP. GOING TO 
           MY FATHER’S. - ALLISON”

           As he absorbs this --

           BOOOOOSH!!

           A military vehicle is struck by a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL. The 
           rebellious act catalyzes the masses. 

           Thousands of people rush the military barricades at once. The 
           military responds with GUNFIRE. 

           EXT. GAS STATION - MORNING

           A line of vehicles snakes around the corner. HORNS blare at 
           line-jumpers. Threats are issued.

           Allison and Nathan pace past the row of cars. She stops at 
           every vehicle. Frantic. Receives mixed reactions.

                                 ALLISON
                        Excuse me, are you heading north? 
                        We need a ride--
                                (to next car)
                        Sir, sir --

           This person doesn’t lower their window. Allison slaps the 
           window out of frustration.
           She moves on to a KIA OPTIMA currently being filled with 
           fuel. Approaches its owner, RALPH VENTO, (56). His wife, JUDY 
           VENTO, (54), nervously waits in the passenger seat.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Are you going north?

                                 RALPH VENTO
                        Everybody is.

           Allison doesn’t quite understand his response. Ralph, 
           meanwhile, tries to will the gas tank to fill faster --

                                 RALPH VENTO (CONT’D)
                                (sotto)
                        Come on, come on...

           Allison leans in the window, addresses Judy Vento directly --

                                 ALLISON
                        Ma’am, please. We need to get to 
                        Maine. 

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        Um... 

           Judy Vento looks Allison and Nathan over, her resolve fading 
           by inches.

                                 ALLISON
                        Please.
                                (re: Nathan)
                        His grandfather -- he lives in 
                        Brunswick.

                                 RALPH VENTO
                                (surprised)
                        You’re not going to Portland?

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        Ralph...

           Allison looks to Ralph, confused.

                                 ALLISON
                        No, why?

                                 RALPH VENTO
                        There are ships leaving out of 
                        Portland, too. 

           Allison is struck by this unexpected revelation.

           Beat. Judy acquiesces. 
                                 JUDY VENTO
                        Yeah, okay, get in.

                                 ALLISON
                        Thank you. Thank you.

           Allison and Nathan clamber into the backseat as Ralph screws 
           on the gas cap.

           EXT. BOSTON, MA - ALLEY - MORNING

           John rounds the corner. Relieved to see Allison’s Honda CRV. 

           INT. ALLISON’S HONDA CRV - MORNING

           John climbs into the vehicle. Goes for his cell phone -- only 
           to find it is no longer there. Only an empty charger remains.

           He nevertheless produces the key from his pocket. Starts the 
           engine. THROWS the CRV into gear. 

           He SPEEDS toward the other end of the alley and, without 
           stopping, turns onto -- 

           EXT. BOSTON, MA - CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

           -- but then SLAMS on the brakes!!

           SMASH!!!

           The Honda CRV is T-BONED by a speeding Ford Taurus. 

           Glass flies. Metal twists. Airbags deploy. Both vehicles are 
           destroyed.

           The world loses most of its sharp edges as John fights to 
           remain conscious. Blood spills from his nose.

           He lumbers out of the passenger side. Staggers closer to the 
           other vehicle...

                                 JOHN
                        Hey... hey, are you alri--?

           ...and sees its college-age driver and passenger are bloodied 
           and disfigured. John turns away, nauseated.

           He limps a few strides to a newspaper box. Leans on it to 
           prevent his collapse.

           His chin slumps to his chest. His eyes close with defeat.
                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey! Yo, hey! You okay?

           John’s grief-stricken gaze lifts. Sees a BLUE-COLLAR MAN 
           calling from inside his company pickup truck...

           “DOWNEAST HOME CONSTRUCTION” painted on its rust-freckled 
           door. A truck CAP covering its cargo area.

           John ekes out a small nod.

                                 BLUE-COLLAR MAN
                        We’ve got room.

                                 JOHN
                        Wha...?

                                 BLUE-COLLAR MAN
                        We gotta go now, man!

           Still addled, it takes John a moment to notice the truck’s 
           MAINE license plate.

                                 JOHN
                        You’re from Maine.

                                 BLUE-COLLAR MAN
                        Yeah, man, we gotta get back there. 
                        Come on!

           John starts for the pickup truck -- but stops suddenly. He 
           turns and hurries back toward his crashed CRV.

                                 BLUE-COLLAR MAN (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?!

           He reaches inside the CRV’s shattered window. Retrieves the 
           red duffel bag. He’s about to hurry off, but stops once again 
           at the sight of --

           -- Nathan’s stuffed animal. He leans back in for that as 
           well.

           Unable to wait any longer, the pickup truck starts to pull 
           away.

                                 JOHN
                        No, wait-wait-wait!

           The pickup truck stops. John catches up and climbs into its --

           BACK CARGO AREA
           Covered by a CARGO CAP and overfilled with PASSENGERS. John 
           squeezes in. 

           He rests his aching head against the cargo cap as the truck 
           resumes its brisk departure.

                                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. RALPH VENTO’S CAR - DAY

           The sedan traverses a scarcely occupied country road. 
           Emotional exhaustion has ushered in a welcome quietude.

           Allison and Nathan sit in respite in the backseat, watching 
           the pastoral New England landscape roll by.

           The car radio is set quietly to the A.M. dial. An earnest 
           TALK RADIO HOST speaks to CALLERS --

                                 TALK RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        ...We’ll get through this. Somehow, 
                        some way. Stay strong, my friend.

                                 MALE CALLER (V.O.)
                        I’ll try. Thanks. And thank you for 
                        staying on the air.

                                 TALK RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        Okay. Take care.
                                (new caller)
                        Jennifer in Vermont. Go ahead.

                                 CALLER JENNIFER (V.O.)
                        I’m scared. That’s all. I don’t 
                        know why I’m calling to say that. 

                                 TALK RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        We all are, Jennifer.

                                 CALLER JENNIFER (V.O.)
                        Why did they wait so long?

                                 TALK RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        Who?

                                 CALLER JENNIFER (V.O.)
                        The government. Why didn’t they 
                        tell us months ago? 

                                 TALK RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        It seems they thought they could 
                        stop it somehow.
                                 CALLER JENNIFER (V.O.)
                        I’m sure they’re all going to those 
                        bunkers, with their families. Them 
                        and all the rich people -- I’m sure 
                        they all got selected. 
                                (crying)
                        I have three kids. I don’t know 
                        what to tell them.

                                 TALK RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        Tell them you love them.

                                 CALLER JENNIFER (V.O.)
                        I will. I will. 

                                 TALK RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        Next caller. From Louisiana. Go 
                        ahead, caller.

                                 FEMALE CALLER (V.O.)
                        My land-line’s all I’ve got 
                        working. 

                                 TALK RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        It’s the cell towers -- a lot of 
                        them are overloaded. 

                                 FEMALE CALLER (V.O.)
                        My mother, she lives in Dallas, 
                        she’s only got a cell phone. I 
                        can’t reach her. I don’t know if 
                        she listens to your program, but 
                        Mama, if you hear me, I love you. I 
                        love you so much, Mama.

           Ralph Vento turns off the radio, ushering in silence. He 
           peeks in the rearview mirror.

                                 RALPH VENTO
                        You two okay back there?

                                 ALLISON
                        Yeah. Thanks.

                                 RALPH VENTO
                        How about you, young man?

           Nathan offers a small, unconvincing nod.

           Silence follows. No one says a word. Something seems to be 
           gnawing at Judy Vento. She finally breaks the silence --
                                 JUDY VENTO
                                (to Allison)
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 ALLISON
                        For what?

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        For not wanting to tell you about 
                        Portland. 

                                 ALLISON
                        It’s okay. 

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        Thought it’d might better our 
                        chances of getting on board, 
                        somehow. It was wrong.

           Silence. Ralph regards Nathan in his rearview mirror.

                                 RALPH VENTO
                        Where’s his father?

                                 ALLISON
                        On the ship.

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        How did he get...?

           Judy, for the first time, notices that Allison and Nathan 
           both have I.D. bracelets. 

                                 RALPH VENTO
                                (incredulous)
                        He left you two behind?

                                 ALLISON
                        He... I don’t know.

           INT. PICKUP TRUCK CARGO AREA / EXT. BACK ROAD - DAY

           Under the cover of the cargo cap. Its narrow windows allow 
           only a paucity of light.

           John surveys the downhearted, disparate people wedged into 
           this unsuitably small cargo area -- including the YOUNG MAN 
           seated in the corner, resting his hoodie-covered head on his 
           pulled-up knees.

           Despair deepens. 
           INT. RALPH VENTO’S CAR / EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           Allison holds John’s cracked-screen cell phone. Privately 
           pondering its display: “(1) RECENT CALL: MEGAN FOSTER”. 

           The afternoon sun washes over Nathan. His eyelids flutter, 
           his head slowly dips.

           Allison notices. Speaks quietly to him --

                                 ALLISON
                        Hey. You okay?

                                 NATHAN
                        I’m tired.

                                 ALLISON
                        You should check your blood sugar.

                                 NATHAN
                        I’m just tired, I said.

           Allison tries accepting this, but ultimately can’t. 

                                 ALLISON
                        Where’s that meter -- ?

                                 NATHAN
                        Mom --

                                 ALLISON
                        You need to check--

                                 NATHAN
                        Fine.

                                 ALLISON
                        Fine. 

           Nathan retrieves his blood-glucose meter from his pocket.

           As he does, Ralph Vento takes notice in his rearview.

                                 RALPH VENTO
                        What’s he got, the sugar? At his 
                        age?

           Allison’s only partly tuned-in. Her focus is more on Nathan.

                                 ALLISON
                        He’s type-one, it’s different. He 
                        was diagnosed last year.
                                 RALPH VENTO
                        Will it ever go away?

           Nathan pricks his fingertip with his Lancet. Squeezes a drop 
           of blood from it onto a test strip.

                                 ALLISON
                        No.

           Judy seems to be putting pieces together in her mind. 

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        That’s why he wasn’t able to get on 
                        the ship.

                                 ALLISON
                                (sighs)
                        Yeah.

           Judy nods a slow nod. It takes a second, but something 
           strikes Ralph --

                                 RALPH VENTO
                        Wait... How did you get past the 
                        checkpoints?

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        They have bracelets.

           Ralph confirms this with a quick glance in the rearview 
           mirror.

           Nathan, meanwhile, inserts the test strip into his blood-
           glucose meter. The results appear seconds later: 

           “B.G.: 342 - HIGH BLOOD SUGAR”.

                                 ALLISON
                        Two and a half.

                                 NATHAN
                        I know, I know...

           Nathan presses a few buttons on his insulin pump... but then 
           stops. Suddenly concerned.

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Mom...?
                                (beat)
                        I don’t have enough.

           She takes Nathan’s insulin pump for closer inspection. Sees 
           that it only has one unit of insulin left in its reservoir. 
                                 ALLISON
                                (sotto)
                        Shit...
                                (beat, then)
                        Just, just use half a unit.

                                 NATHAN
                        Half of one? But I need--

                                 ALLISON
                        I know, I know -- but it has to 
                        last.
                                (beat)
                        We’ll figure something out. 

           Nathan self-administers a half of a unit of insulin. 

           Allison leans back in her seat. The crisis not averted, 
           merely postponed.

           Silence returns...

           But Judy waits for the right moment to break it.

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        So your father’s in Brunswick?

                                 ALLISON
                                (nodding absently)
                        It’s where I grew up.

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        Beautiful up there.

                                 ALLISON
                        Yeah. It’s... it was nice.

           Silence.

                                 RALPH VENTO
                        He’s gonna stay there through this?

                                 ALLISON
                        My father’s not the running type. 

           Beat.

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        Maybe you should go to Brunswick 
                        after all. To be with him through 
                        this. 

                                 ALLISON
                        He’d want me to go to Portland.
                                 JUDY VENTO
                                (re: Nathan)
                        Even though he was turned away in 
                        Boston?

                                 ALLISON
                        Maybe... hopefully they’ll let him 
                        on this time.

           Judy smiles. Something suspiciously artificial about it.

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        How could you turn away a face like 
                        that?

           Allison smiles thinly.

                                 JUDY VENTO (CONT’D)
                        I mean, how cruel can you be? 
                        Nobody’s that cruel. 

           Allison nods a small nod, slightly confused that Judy is 
           still carrying on.

                                 JUDY VENTO (CONT’D)
                        Imagine if you were the soldier at 
                        the gate, and a child like him 
                        showed up -- with his family. 
                        Maybe... his grandparents, say. 

           Judy and Ralph exchange a furtive glance.

                                 JUDY VENTO (CONT’D)
                        I mean, even if only two out of 
                        three of them had bracelets -- you 
                        have to imagine that soldier would 
                        take pity and let them all on 
                        board.
                                (beat)
                        Right?

           After a long beat...

           Ralph slowly pulls the car over on the shoulder of the road. 

           Allison discreetly reaches for Nathan’s hand. Her quiet 
           concern rising. 

                                 ALLISON
                        Why are we stopping?

           Ralph and Judy both remain facing forward. Neither says a 
           word. The car thrums with tension. 
                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                                (quietly)
                        Get out of the car, Nathan.

           Judy and Ralph steal a side-eyed look at each other. Fighting 
           against the tug of morality.

           CLICK. The doors lock.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Get out-get out-get out!

           Allison pulls at the handle -- it’s LOCKED -- Nathan’s 
           confused -- Allison unlocks her door -- swings it open --

           -- but Ralph’s already outside the car -- he GRABS Allison -- 
           Judy reaches over the seat and PINS Nathan.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Get-- No-- Nathan!

           Ralph DRAGS Allison halfway out of the car. She fights with 
           everything she has. Flails, KICKS.

                                 NATHAN
                        Mommy!!

           Nathan struggles, reaches for his mother -- grabs her shirt -- 
           but Judy YANKS his hand free.

           Ralph clasps a thick handful of Allison’s hair -- gets 
           leverage with his foot against the door jam -- and PULLS!

           Allison slides from the backseat -- and LANDS HARD onto the 
           road. Her head BOUNCES against the concrete. She’s stunned  
           but unwilling to give up.

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        Come on-come on! 

           Ralph FORCIBLY REMOVES Allison’s I.D. bracelet from her 
           wrist. Its strap SNAPS, but he takes it anyway.

                                 NATHAN
                        Mommy!!

           Ralph crosses past Allison --

                                 RALPH VENTO
                        I’m sorry.

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        Hurry!
                                 RALPH VENTO
                        I’m sorry-I’m sorry...

           -- and hurries back into the car. Slams the door shut. Throws 
           the car into DRIVE.

                                 ALLISON
                        No! Please!

           The WHEELS grip the ground after a few spins. 

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Nathan!!

           Allison futilely grabs at the car as it pulls away. PULLS at 
           the locked doors. Her horrified eyes locked with Nathan’s.

           The car pulls away. Allison RUNS and RUNS... 

           And then he’s gone. 

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        NO!!! NATHAN!!!

           Allison watches, in horror, as the car speeds further from 
           sight. Oblivious to the blood matting her mussed hair.

           INT. PICKUP TRUCK CARGO AREA / EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - EVENING

           The sun begins its descent, bringing colder temperatures. The 
           truck’s cap does little to mitigate this.

           John shivers. Blows into his hands for warmth. Dried blood 
           stains his upper lip and chin.

           The Young Man wearing a hoodie, who we will come to know as 
           COLIN, regards John’s weakening condition.

                                 COLIN
                        Hey. You okay, man?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah.

           Colin notices the red duffel bag John holds. The stuffed 
           animal cheetah as well.

                                 COLIN
                        You into stuffed animals?

                                 JOHN
                        It’s my son’s. 
                                 COLIN
                        What is it, a leopard?

                                 JOHN
                        Cheetah.

                                 COLIN
                        Right on.

           Beat.

           Colin discreetly points to John’s I.D. bracelet --

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        My family got selected, too.

                                 JOHN
                        Why aren’t you with them?

                                 COLIN
                        I didn’t even know. I only found 
                        out ‘cause my little sister called 
                        to say goodbye.

                                 JOHN
                        Your parents didn’t tell you?

                                 COLIN
                        They don’t agree with... my 
                        lifestyle. So, yeah, we don’t talk. 
                                (beat)
                        What about you? Your parents...?

                                 JOHN
                        They both passed away. My mother 
                        had cancer, my father had a heart 
                        attack.

                                 COLIN
                        That’s crazy.

                                 JOHN
                        Not really. Statistically, they’re 
                        the most common ways for people 
                        over sixty to die. 

                                 COLIN
                        You sound like a really sentimental 
                        dude.

           A spare smirk touches John’s face.

                                 JOHN
                        I work in insurance. It’s a habit.
                                 COLIN
                        Car insurance?

                                 JOHN
                        Aviation insurance.

                                 COLIN
                        Good. I’m late on my paying Geico 
                        bill.

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t think that matters anymore.

                                 COLIN
                        I know, man, I’m trying to be funny 
                        ‘cause I’m scared as shit.

           Colin wipes away his sudden tears. His lip quivers, hands 
           tremble.

                                 JOHN
                        I am, too.

           After a long beat...

                                 COLIN
                        Cancer. Heart attack. Car accident. 
                        Whatever. There’s always something 
                        out there about to hit us. Only 
                        difference now is we know when.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah...

           John regards the gray MARKER STAIN on his own hand, setting 
           his mind adrift.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        We always wanted to drive up Mount 
                        Washington to see the sunrise. My 
                        wife and I used to talk about it 
                        all the time when we were younger. 
                        We held off from going for a little 
                        while, though -- mostly because we 
                        weren’t sure either of our cars 
                        would be able to make the drive. 
                        They probably would have, but I 
                        guess it was more convenient to 
                        think they wouldn’t. Then, I got a 
                        new car; a company car from my 
                        first real job. 

                                 COLIN
                        Sweet.
                                 JOHN
                        It was beige.

           Colin reacts. “Okay, maybe not.”

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, we were so excited. Now we 
                        could finally go. But then 
                        something came up; a work thing, I 
                        don’t remember what, exactly. So we 
                        pushed the trip off for a few 
                        weeks. Then a few more. But we were 
                        definitely going to go, so it was 
                        okay. Then, after our son, Nathan, 
                        was born, I remember money got 
                        tight for a little bit. It wouldn’t 
                        have broken the bank to still go, 
                        but holding off seemed like the 
                        smart thing to do at the time. Then 
                        a few more months passed. Then a 
                        few years. And then a few more. 
                        There was always something. But it 
                        was still okay, because we knew 
                        we’d eventually get there; we had 
                        time. Maybe not in a week, maybe 
                        not in a month. But someday.
                                (beat)
                        Except someday never came. And now 
                        it never will.
                                (beat)
                        It’s strange, really. We act like 
                        we have all the time in the world, 
                        even though we know that’s not 
                        true. 

                                 COLIN
                        Where’s your family now?

                                 JOHN
                        I’m hoping, up in Brunswick.

                                 COLIN
                        So you’re the only one going?

                                 JOHN
                                (confused)
                        Going where?

                                 COLIN
                        On the ship.

                                 JOHN
                        There are more ships?
                                 COLIN
                        Yeah, man. That’s why we’re going 
                        to Portland. They’re leaving in a 
                        few hours from there. I mean, it’s 
                        a long shot we’ll get on, but 
                        still. Worth trying.
                                (re: I.D. bracelet)
                        Especially you, since you got that.

           After a long beat --

           John wriggles off his I.D. bracelet. Offers it to Colin, 
           who’s confused at first.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        What...?

                                 JOHN
                        Maybe it will work, I don’t know...

                                 COLIN
                        You for real?

                                 JOHN
                        Take it. I’m not going to Portland.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - EVENING

           Allison lumbers up the shoulder of the mostly empty road. A 
           car eventually approaches. She tries to flag it down...

                                 ALLISON
                        Hey. Hey! 

           ...but it speeds past her. 

           She journeys on. Scraped, bruised. Crestfallen.

           Her feet pad against the road... but slowly come to a stop 
           when she hears lightly squealing brakes.

           She turns to find a rusted-out and overfilled 1994 CHRYSLER 
           MIN-VAN has pulled over. Its horn BEEPS, signaling her. 

           The side door slides open. She climbs inside --

           INT. MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUS

           -- and squeezes in amongst the MEXICAN FAMILY who occupies 
           the vehicle.
                                 ALLISON
                        Thank you. Thank you.

           The DRIVER signals to his family to make room for Allison.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Portland? Are you going to--

                                 DRIVER
                        Si, si, Portland.

           The door closes. The journey continues.

           INT. MINI-VAN - EVENING

           Moments later. Allison sits in silence. Her emotional dam 
           breaches. The full weight of her head falls into her hands. 

           The MATRIARCH of the family hands Allison a tissue.

           Allison musters a thin “thank you” smile.

           SEE that, unbeknownst to Allison, the “DOWNEAST CONSTRUCTION” 
           pickup truck pulls up alongside the mini-van. 

           INT. PICKUP TRUCK CARGO AREA - SAME

           John remains underneath the cargo cap, seated near one of its 
           narrow windows. 

           If either he or Allison just looked, they might see each 
           other.

           But alas... 

           The pickup truck powers down the road, spreading more and 
           more distance from the mini-van. 

           EXT. PORTLAND, ME - SHIPYARD - EVENING

           The first of three queued CRUISE SHIPS pulls away from port. 
           PASSENGERS flood the gangway of the next ship in line.

           Thousands of hostile ONLOOKERS watch from behind a military 
           barricade. It’s even more chaotic than Boston. Soldiers 
           struggle to maintain order.

           Time is running out.
           Judy and Ralph Vento push their way through the crowd, 
           dragging Nathan in tow. The boy appears disoriented. His skin 
           has fallen pale.

           As they get close to the first CHECKPOINT --

                                 JUDY VENTO
                                (to Ralph)
                        I’ll show my bracelet and his. Just 
                        walk past like you have one, too!

                                 RALPH VENTO
                        Alright, alright. Keep going!

           Judy Vento approaches a DISTRACTED SOLDIER. Shows “her” I.D. 
           bracelet. Points to Nathan’s as well.

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        Which line?

                                 DISTRACTED SOLDIER
                        What-either-any of them --
                                (to someone else)
                        Get back!

           Ralph, Judy, and Nathan push through the first checkpoint. 
           But then --

                                 DISTRACTED SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        Wait -- where’s his?

           The Distracted Soldier is distracted no more.

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        What?

                                 DISTRACTED SOLDIER
                                (re: Ralph)
                        Where’s his I.D. bracelet?

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        Someone stole it from him.

                                 RALPH VENTO
                        I’m his grandfather. Please.

                                 DISTRACTED SOLDIER
                        You all need bracelets.
                                (to OTHER SOLDIER)
                        Scan hers.

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        We have to get on!
                                 OTHER SOLDIER
                        Give me your wrist. Give me--

           In grabbing Judy’s wrist, the Other Soldier sees that its 
           broken strap has been reconnected with DUCT TAPE. 

           A quick SCAN of the bracelet produces a photo of Allison on 
           his iPad screen.

                                 OTHER SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                                (to Distracted Soldier)
                        It’s not hers.

           The Distressed Soldier signals over to MILITARY POLICEMEN. 

                                 DISTRESSED SOLDIER
                        Put them in holding.

           Two Military Policemen force Judy and Ralph out of the line. 
           Judy clings to Nathan’s shirt, dragging him with her.

                                 JUDY VENTO
                        We have to get-- Please!

           The Military Policeman tears free Judy’s grip on Nathan. 

           Her arms are forced behind her and ZIP-TIED. Ralph is 
           similarly restrained. They’re moved through the shoulder-to-
           shoulder crowd, away from the checkpoint.

           Judy cranes back. Sees Nathan left behind. Vulnerable.

                                 JUDY VENTO (CONT’D)
                        Let the boy go. He has a bracelet! 
                        It’s his, he has...

           Her words fade as she and Ralph vanish amidst the swarming 
           crowd.

           Nathan steps off to the side, away from the horde. Alone and 
           scared. 

           INT. PICKUP TRUCK - FRONT CAB / EXT. BACK ROAD - EVENING

           The truck continues its urgent northbound journey. 

           The Blue-Collar Worker and his front seat PASSENGERS stare 
           ahead at the open road, aware of their race against the 
           clock.

           Their anxious visages atomize as, one by one, they notice 
           something up ahead --
           Over a thousand CROWS. Spiraling inelegantly, moving pell-
           mell through the sky, as if unable to navigate.

           INT. PICKUP TRUCK CARGO AREA - SAME

           John is distracted by a passing ROAD SIGN: “BRUNSWICK - EXIT 
           52B - 1/2 MILE.” 

           He angles his way to the truck’s cab. Knocks on the small 
           window. It slides open. 

                                 JOHN
                        I need to get off at the next exit.

                                 BLUE-COLLAR MAN
                        What are you-- no, man, we gotta 
                        keep going.

           John, now also able to see the flurry of birds in the sky, is 
           moved to distraction. 

           But his return to more pertinent matters is swift --

                                 JOHN
                        Please, just pull over.

                                 BLUE-COLLAR MAN
                        I can’t. We’re running out of time!

                                 JOHN
                        The exit’s coming up. Please, I 
                        need to (get to Brunswick).

                                 BLUE-COLLAR MAN
                                (over)
                        Damn it, okay-okay.

           The pickup truck starts to slow -- but never fully stops -- 
           along the side of the road, near the Brunswick exit.

                                 BLUE-COLLAR MAN (CONT’D)
                        Go if you’re gonna go!

                                 JOHN
                        Shit...

           John crawls across the cargo area --

                                 COLIN
                                (to John)
                        Hey, man. Good luck.
                                 JOHN
                        You too.

           -- and to the rear of the truck. The red duffel bag in one 
           hand, Nathan’s stuffed animal cheetah in the other.

           He opens the cargo area’s up-folding window. Lifts his leg 
           over the closed gate. Climbs out, onto the back bumper, 
           preparing to jump, when --

           ANGLE ON - FRONT CAB

           SMASH!!!

           A crow flies head-first into the truck’s windshield, 
           EXPLODING on impact and SPLINTERING the glass.

                                 BLUE-COLLAR MAN
                        Shit!!

           The Blue-Collar Man reflexively JERKS the wheel --

           BACK TO SCENE

           John loses purchase of the red duffel bag as he’s FLUNG from 
           the back of the truck. He lands with wind-stealing force on 
           the grass median. 

           The pickup truck rights itself. Resumes its normal speed. 
           Continues down the road, further and further from view.

           John lumbers to his feet. And then he’s struck with panic --

                                 JOHN
                        No... no-no. WAIT!!

           INSERT - PICKUP TRUCK CARGO AREA

           The red duffel bag apparently fell back inside the truck. And 
           there it remains, unnoticed by other passengers.

           BACK TO SCENE

           The pickup truck is already a quarter mile down the road.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        FUCK!!!!

           Beat.

           John looks to the sky, where the crows continue their 
           dizzying flight, before retrieving the stuffed animal cheetah 
           from the ground. 
           He starts, on foot, for the exit to Brunswick. 

           EXT. PORTLAND, ME - SHIPYARD - EVENING

           Only one cruise ship remains in port. Chaos intensifies. 

           Nathan wanders further away from the collected masses, where 
           hundreds of people take to smaller vessels lined along a 
           DOCK. Fishing boats, small sailboats, etc.

           He’s scared. Sweaty. Glassing over. 

           He pricks his finger. Tests his blood sugar. Not good. It’s 
           climbed even higher: “B.G.: 402 - HIGH BLOOD SUGAR”. 

           His tiny body sways as he fights for clarity. 

           A beat. Then he administers himself the last of his insulin. 

           SEE the reservoir of his insulin pump go dry.

           EXT. PORTLAND, ME - CITY STREET - EVENING

           Congested with vehicles. Horns blare. Standstill traffic. The 
           Shipyard observable in the distance.

           The Chrysler mini-van pulls up. Immediately gets stuck in the 
           logjam. 

           INT. MINI-VAN - SAME

           The Mexican family speak nervously to one another, clamoring 
           to come up with their best course of action.

           Allison slides open the side door. Jumps out. RUNS toward the 
           Shipyard. 

           EXT. PORTLAND, ME - SHIPYARD - EVENING

           Nathan cries thick, silent tears. People rush by him, 
           concerned only for themselves. 

           An assemblage of small VESSELS depart from a private DOCK. 
           All dangerously overfilled with passengers. 

           As a YOUNG WOMAN hurries by with her HUSBAND, she looks twice 
           at Nathan when their eyes meet. His sorrow and fear manifest.
                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                                (to her Husband)
                        Wait...
                                (approaching Nathan)
                        Are you okay? Where’s your family?

                                 NATHAN
                        They’re gone.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        You’re all alone?

           Nathan nods. Breaks down in heartrending tears.

                                 HUSBAND
                                (calling over)
                        Nadine!

           The Young Woman gently takes Nathan by the shoulders.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        We’re getting on one of those 
                        boats. We’re going to follow the 
                        cruise ships. You should come with 
                        us.

           Nathan is unsure and confused... but eventually ekes out a 
           small nod.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Come on.

           She takes Nathan by the hand. Hurries to catch up with her 
           Husband.

           EXT. PORTLAND, ME - SHIPYARD - EVENING

           Allison rounds a corner, putting the sheer bedlam of the 
           Shipyard in full view.

                                 ALLISON
                        Nathan!! ... Naaaaathaaan!!

           Her heartfelt cries don’t even register for people within 
           earshot. Self-preservation supplants the needs of others.

           Eyes darting fervently, Allison sees something that gives 
           rise to tremendous concern --

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                                (sotto)
                        Oh God...
           REVEAL 

           Nathan, a good distance away, being led aboard a dangerously 
           overcrowded SAILBOAT. 

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Nathan!

           She RACES headlong into the crowd, pushing her way through.

           EXT. SAILBOAT - EVENING

           Teeming with over twenty PEOPLE. The twenty-five-foot vessel 
           inadequately built for this payload. 

           The Young Woman, her Husband, and Nathan hang on tightly, 
           dangling port-side. The small outboard motor wobbles the 
           vessel thirty feet from the dock.

           A makeshift CONVOY of similarly undersized and overfilled 
           boats clusters just away from shore. Panicked departures lead 
           to a logjam. 

           The voice of a WORRIED PASSENGER aboard Nathan’s boat --

                                 WORRIED PASSENGER #1
                        Whoa-whoa-- Move up!

           -- turns heads. Nathan and the others see that their severely 
           listing ship is now taking on water.

           Passengers scurry toward the bow to correct the weight 
           imbalance -- but there are simply too many people on board.

           Bodies crush closer. Seawater floods the stern.

           The ship lists dramatically to one side. Capsizing. Screams. 
           Panic. Bodies CRASH into each other. People FALL OVERBOARD.

           The Young Woman holds Nathan. 

                                 WORRIED PASSENGER #2
                        Watch out!!

           The Young Woman’s Husband whips around. His eyes widen --

           SMASH!

           The sail’s heavy BOOM swings free and STRIKES him directly in 
           the face. He crumbles, falls overboard.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Robert!!
           Some passengers jump into the water. Others make desperate 
           attempts to leap onto nearby vessels.

           The Young Woman dives after her Husband. Nathan is left to 
           fend for himself. 

           EXT. PORTLAND, ME - SHIPYARD - DOCK - SAME

           Allison races down the dock, her feet pounding against the 
           sea-soaked timber. 

           She watches, with abject terror, as Nathan dangles off the 
           side of the capsizing sailboat. 

                                 ALLISON
                        Nathan!!

           EXT. SAILBOAT - SAME

           The sail, now partially submerged, collects water. And, 
           therefore, weight. 

           An audible GROAN as the mast’s integrity is tested...

           SNAP!

           The massive SPIRE splits. CRASHES into the water, pulling the 
           rest of its sail with it.

           The thick carbon fiber sheet drapes over Nathan and other 
           passengers. Drags them overboard. 

           UNDERWATER

           Nathan SPLASHES beneath the surface. 

           Finds himself in a watery hell alongside a crush of other 
           kicking-and-flailing passengers. They fight to reach the 
           surface, pulling against one another like animals. 

           The sinking mast drapes its heavy sail over them, trapping 
           them underneath like a pool cover.

           EXT. PORTLAND, ME - SHIPYARD - DOCK - SAME

           Allison approaches the end. Without slowing even slightly, 
           she LEAPS off the dock. PLUNGES into the frigid water. 

           She bursts to the surface. Swims with all her strength toward 
           where she last saw Nathan. 
           ON NATHAN - UNDERWATER

           As he pushes against the sail, only to become more entangled 
           in it.

           ON ALLISON - ABOVE WATER

           Still swimming. Taking in mouthfuls of seawater.

           ON NATHAN - UNDERWATER

           Completely enveloped by the sail. And now being dragged down 
           by it.

           ON ALLISON - ABOVE WATER

           Still with twenty feet to go, she dives underwater.

           ON NATHAN - UNDERWATER

           His small limbs flail. His big screams bubble.

           Suddenly -- 

           Allison’s HAND thrusts through the sail, cutting her forearm 
           against a torn segment of the mast. Blood escapes like a puff 
           of red smoke.

           She untangles and hauls him toward a patch of sunlight above.

           ABOVE WATER - SECONDS LATER

           Allison and Nathan break the surface. Both gasp for air.

                                 ALLISON
                        Are you-- are you okay?

           He nods. Cries. She squeezes him close while treading water.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Hold-- hold onto me.

           Nathan clings to her. She tries to swim -- but her body has 
           reached its physical limits.

                                 HEAVYSET MAN (O.S.)
                        Hey! Grab on! Hey!

           Allison sees that this Heavyset Man at the edge of the dock, 
           holding the end of a ROPE he just threw her. The other end 
           bobs on the surface of the water, about twenty feet away.

           With Nathan clinging to her back, Allison inches closer to 
           the rope... closer... until she finally reaches it.
           The Heavyset Man reels her in.

           EXT. PORTLAND, ME - SHIPYARD - DOCK - EVENING

           The Heavyset Man helps Nathan and Allison onto the dock. He 
           runs off, without a word, to help others in need.

                                 ALLISON
                                (to Nathan)
                        I’m sorry. 

           She pulls Nathan into her warm embrace. 

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry.

           WOOOOOT!!

           Echoing from a distance. Allison sees the last of the cruise 
           ships departing from the Seaport. Her eyes fall with defeat.

           INT. BRUNSWICK, ME - RURAL HOME - NIGHT

           Furnished on workman’s wages. Suited to sustain a basic life. 
           A single light glowing over the outdated gas range is all 
           that prevents total darkness. 

           The door opens. John enters.

                                 JOHN
                        Allison?

           No reply. Silence but for the sound of wind rustling through 
           the trees.

           Peeking into the LIVING ROOM, John sees that it, too, is 
           empty.

           He calls out toward the rooms at the end of the hall...

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Dale?

           ...only to again be met with silence. But then, John’s ear 
           catches a faint WHIRRING sound.

           He peers out the window. Sees a small, homemade WIND TURBINE 
           in the yard, its small blades catching the passing breeze.

           PRE-LAP: The sharp SQUEAL of a metal bulkhead door opening.
           INT. EMERGENCY SHELTER - NIGHT

           John descends a short set of wooden stairs, accessed through 
           the bulkhead.

           As he does, the sound of an embittered RIGHT-WING TALK RADIO 
           HOST comes into greater relief --

                                 RIGHT-WING TALK RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        ...this is all about control -- 
                        Bottom line. Why else would they 
                        ground all the flights? “For our 
                        safety”, or whatever mamby-pamby. 
                        B.S. reason they put on that FEMA 
                        website? Please... This is just 
                        another smokescreen. And mark my 
                        words, about an hour before this 
                        thing’s supposed to hit, they’ll 
                        put on another press conference -- 
                        only this time they’ll say it’s 
                        gonna miss us after all. 

           The shelter, crudely fashioned from a reinforced SHIPPING 
           CONTAINER, sources limited electrical power from the D.I.Y. 
           wind turbine. A “DON’T TREAD ON ME” flag hangs from the wall. 
           Stockpiled supplies and canned goods fill wire-rack shelves. 

                                 RIGHT-WING TALK RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        But you think they’ll roll back the 
                        Humvees and the tanks from our 
                        neighborhoods? Not a chance.

           DALE CLARK, (65), cantankerous, broad shouldered but 
           potbellied, sits with his back facing John. Not yet ready to 
           afford him the courtesy of his attention.

                                 JOHN
                        Where’s Allison?

           Beat.

           Dale slowly rises from his chair. Requires a cane to assist 
           him over to the radio. Turns it off.

           Finally regards John.

                                 DALE
                        She called about an hour ago. She’s 
                        on her way.

                                 JOHN
                        Is Nathan with her?

           Dale doesn’t answer. Maintains an interminable stare. 
                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        God damnit, Dale, is my son with 
                        her?!

                                 DALE
                        Yeah.

           John sighs his relief. But Dale is far from finished with 
           him.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        I been collecting this shit for 
                        years. Building up, prepping, 
                        getting ready for things to go 
                        south. If there was ever a problem -
                        - hurricane, the economy, whatever -
                        - I’d be prepared. I’d be able to 
                        stay right where I am. I wouldn’t 
                        forget about my obligations, go 
                        find... shelter somewhere else. No, 
                        I’d stay right here, where I 
                        belong. With my family.
                                (beat)
                        That’s what men do.

           John looks away. Stung. But not capitulating.

                                 JOHN
                        We were going to try to work it 
                        out.

                                 DALE
                        You act like you deserved that 
                        chance.

                                 JOHN
                        Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t--

                                 DALE
                        No, you didn’t. There’s no maybe 
                        nothing.

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t think you’re in any 
                        position to judge.

                                 DALE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JOHN
                        You know what I’m talking about. I 
                        remember what you used to do to 
                        Allison’s mother.
                                 DALE
                        Don’t you dare talk about my wife.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m not, I’m talking about you. 
                        Coming home drunk, knocking her 
                        around a little. You know, doing 
                        what men do. 

           Dale’s face hardens.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        There’s no storm coming, Dale. No 
                        government tyranny you and your 
                        militia buddies can fantasize 
                        about. And your tin can in the 
                        ground here isn’t going to--

                                 DALE
                        I know it ain’t.

           Beat. 

                                 JOHN
                        You spent your life preparing -- 
                        and you’re not. I should’ve never 
                        done what I did -- but I did. If 
                        you know a way to go back and 
                        change either of those things, or 
                        anything else, I’ll gladly let you. 

           Dale glares at John... but softens his resolve. Recognizing 
           the futility in arguing.

           In the b.g., approaching car tires are heard crunching over 
           leaves and twigs. 

           EXT. BRUNSWICK, ME - RURAL HOME 

           Allison pulls up in a TOYOTA CAMRY, parks alongside Dale’s 
           CHEVY SILVERADO pickup truck. John appears in the Camry’s 
           headlights as he climbs from the shelter’s bulkhead.

           Allison turns off the car. Hurriedly climbs out, swings open 
           the rear door.

                                 JOHN
                        Where’s--

           John sees Nathan lying in the backseat, clearly unwell. He 
           scoops Nathan’s rag-doll frame into his arms. 
                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Nathan? Nathan! What’s wrong--?

                                 ALLISON
                        Where’s the bag? 

                                 JOHN
                        It’s gone.

                                 ALLISON
                        What?! It had (his insulin)!

                                 JOHN
                                (over)
                        I know-I know. I’m sorry-I know.
                                (rousing Nathan)
                        Hey, buddy, wake up. Wake up, 
                        buddy.

           Nathan rouses, but remains quite foggy. 

                                 DALE (O.S.)
                        Bring him inside.

           John and Allison see Dale has just emerged from the shelter. 
           He canes toward his house. They follow behind him. Enter --

           INT. BRUNSWICK, ME - RURAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Dale makes for the refrigerator. John catches the swaying 
           storm door with his foot, slides inside with Nathan drooping 
           in his arms. 

           Allison is just behind. She calls past John, to her father --

                                 ALLISON
                        Dad, do you have your--

           Dale opens the refrigerator.

                                 DALE
                        I’m getting it now.

           SEE that has three vials of INSULIN lined in the butter rack. 
           The prescription labels: “CLARK, DALE”

           John swipes everything off the table. Unfurls Nathan’s body 
           on top of it. Places a balled-up dish towel under his head.

           Allison wets some paper towels. Pats them over Nathan’s 
           sweaty brow. 
           Dale opens a cabinet. Removes packages of SYRINGES. Tears one 
           open. Hands it over to Allison.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        My diabetes ain’t the same as his.

           Allison draws-up the needle with insulin. 

                                 ALLISON
                        Insulin’s insulin; we’ll figure out 
                        the dosage.

           She taps air bubbles from the syringe. Lifts the bottom of 
           Nathan’s shirt, injects the needle into his abdomen. 

           John stands behind Allison and Dale as they hover over 
           Nathan, suddenly feeling like an uninvolved spectator.

           Allison brushes Nathan’s hair back from his face. Sighs her 
           relief. 

           John digs into his jacket pocket. Removes the stuffed animal, 
           places it next to Nathan.

           Allison looks at John... but then her eyes slip from his.

                                                                      CUT TO:

           EXT. BRUNSWICK, ME - RURAL HOME - NIGHT

           Stripped tree limbs rattle in the slight breeze. John sits on 
           the front porch. Lost in cogitation under the dripping-black 
           sky. 

           The screen door creaks open. Allison steps outside, dressed 
           in dry clothes. Arms folded, huddled close for warmth.

                                 JOHN
                        How is he?

                                 ALLISON
                        Asleep. 

           John nods a small nod. 

                                 JOHN
                        I had it. The whole time.
                                (off her confusion)
                        The bag -- it fell...
                                 ALLISON
                        It doesn’t matter. My father has 
                        enough insulin to last him through 
                        this.

                                 JOHN
                        Through this.

           John shakes his head. It’s all too much to take. 

           Allison sits down. Close to him, but not. John regards the 
           Toyota Camry.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Who’s car is that?

                                 ALLISON
                                (shrugs)
                        Someone left it.

           She places John’s cell phone on the front porch.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        And you left this.

           John picks it up. Taps at the cracked screen.

                                 JOHN
                        Is it working?

                                 ALLISON
                        It was. But it was in my pocket 
                        when I jumped in the water.

                                 JOHN
                        What water...?

           Allison waves a “never mind” gesture. She’s too tired to get 
           into it.

           After a long beat...

                                 ALLISON
                        She called, you know. 

           John stops tinkering with his phone.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Earlier today. I spoke to her.

                                 JOHN
                        What... what did you say?
                                 ALLISON
                        That I hope she’ll be okay.

                                 JOHN
                        Really?

                                 ALLISON
                        Yeah, really.

                                 JOHN
                        Was, um... was she selected?

                                 ALLISON
                        No.

           John tries to conceal his disquiet.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay that you care. It would 
                        be weird if you didn’t.

           Beat.

                                 JOHN
                        Why did you answer?

                                 ALLISON
                        I wanted to hear what she sounded 
                        like. I wanted to know what made 
                        her so special.

           John sighs.

                                 JOHN
                        It just all happened at once. 
                        Nathan’s diagnosis. Work. Getting 
                        older...

           Allison bridles at the implication.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I mean both of us. Everyone. Our 
                        friends, my coworkers. I felt like 
                        everywhere I looked, there was 
                        something reminding me that time 
                        was running out. 
                                (beat)
                        She made it slow down.

                                 ALLISON
                        Isn’t she amazing.
                                (beat, then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALLISON (CONT'D)
                        You know what, no, I shouldn’t even 
                        say that, because the truth is, I 
                        can get past all that. Our marriage 
                        was far from perfect; I can’t 
                        pretend it was. And some of that 
                        was my fault. Maybe a lot of it.
                                (beat)
                        But you... you let our son hate me, 
                        John. 

                                 JOHN
                        I didn’t ask you to lie.

                                 ALLISON
                        Should I have let him know the 
                        truth? 

           John looks away.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        No, no, no -- look at me. Should I 
                        have told him, “No, honey, I didn’t 
                        kick Daddy out.”
                                (pointedly)
                        “He left us.”

           John doesn’t bother to protest. This is the truth.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        He worships you. It would have 
                        crushed him. And he would have 
                        hated you for it.
                                (beat)
                        So I let him hate me instead.
                                (beat)
                        And so did you.

           John sags under his profound regret.

           Allison shakes her head. Anger and disappointment again on 
           the rise. She climbs to her feet, opens the door...

                                 JOHN
                        We were supposed to have time.

                                 ALLISON
                        For what?

                                 JOHN
                        To try.

                                 ALLISON
                        The end of the world didn’t change 
                        that. You did.
           She enters the house. Closes and locks the door behind her.

           INT. BRUNSWICK, ME - RURAL HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Later that night. Peaceful. Allison sleeps alongside Nathan 
           on the couch, her arm draped across him.

           INT. TOYOTA CAMRY - NIGHT

           John sits in the driver’s seat. Uses his jacket as a 
           makeshift blanket, trying to sleep. He stirs, unable to find 
           comfort. 

           All the while, the nighttime BUGS form a choir of white 
           noise... 

           Until they suddenly stop.

           Eerie, unnatural silence.

           John’s closed eyes unlace. His brow creases.

           The silence persists.

           He slowly sits upright. Concern rising. 

           Something’s definitely off...........

           BOOOOOOM!!!

           John is HEAVED ACROSS the car, again and again, like a shoe 
           in a dryer, as EARTHQUAKE-LIKE SHOCK WAVES toss the vehicle 
           asunder.

           The front end of the car SPINS -- CRASHES against a tree -- 
           the AIRBAGS DEPLOY -- John CRACKS his head against the side 
           windshield. 

           And then, just as suddenly as it started -- it stops.

           The car comes to rest. Completely destroyed. ALARM sounding, 
           echoing out in the vacuousness of the surrounding forest.

           Injured and disoriented, John peels himself off the floor. 

           The car keys dangle from the ignition. It takes John’s 
           rattled mind a moment, but he finally thinks to press the 
           alarm button, silencing it. 

           He rights himself, grimaces in pain. Clutches his ribs.
           But his anguish evaporates from his face, replaced by a look 
           of grave concern when he sees --

           -- Dale’s house is crushed beneath a fallen tree.

                                 JOHN
                        No...

           He hauls himself from the wreckage, disregarding his pain. 

           INT. BRUNSWICK, ME - RURAL HOME - NIGHT

           John kicks his way through the unhinged front door. The 
           tree’s thick limbs consume the majority of the small house.

                                 JOHN
                        Allison!

                                 ALLISON (O.S.)
                        In here!

           John rushes toward her. Pushes through branches and 
           splintered tree limbs, into --

           INT. BRUNSWICK, ME - RURAL HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Allison holds Nathan close. They’ve both gone unscathed; the 
           tree missed most of the living room.

           John rushes over. Hastily examines Nathan for injuries.

                                 ALLISON
                                (short of breath)
                        What was that?

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t know-are you okay?

           She nods. They begin to calm down. But then --

                                 ALLISON
                        Wait... Where’s my father?

           John has no answer. Allison is struck with worry.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        Dad?!

           She hurries out of the Living Room.

                                 JOHN
                        No, wait...
                                 ALLISON
                        Dad!!

                                 JOHN
                                (to Nathan)
                        Stay here.
                                (then)
                        Allison!

           John rushes to catch up with her.

           INT. BRUNSWICK, ME - RURAL HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Tree branches form a nearly impenetrable wall. The bedroom 
           bears the brunt of the tree’s impact.

                                 ALLISON
                        Dad?!

           Allison forces her way through. Clears a view of Dale’s bed -- 

           It’s empty.

           John catches up to her. Sees this as well.

           EXT. BRUNSWICK, ME - RURAL HOME - NIGHT

           John, Allison, and Nathan exit. They see the destroyed Toyota 
           Camry, steam hissing under its hood.

           They round the side of the house, scanning the dark forest.

                                 ALLISON
                        Dad!

                                 NATHAN
                        Grandpa!

           Their cries go unanswered. There’s no sign of Dale anywhere.

           Until a faint, familiar sound slowly captures John’s 
           attention...

           He follows toward it, like a dog hunting a scent. Rounding 
           the other side of the house, he sees its source...

           The homemade wind turbine. 

           Damaged but still operable. But the emergency shelter to 
           which it provides electricity has suffered partial collapse. 
           Crushed under a landslip, the shelter’s reinforced walls are 
           bent and twisted like aluminium foil.

           Anguished moans are faintly heard from inside, as is the 
           static HISS of a de-tuned radio. 

                                 JOHN
                        Oh God...

           John slowly approaches the unencumbered bulkhead. Its doors 
           are already open. The pained moans come into greater relief.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Dale?

           Allison sees John crouching at the bulkhead...

                                 ALLISON
                        Is he in there? 
                                (arriving)
                        Dad?!

           ...and then sees the full extent of the shelter’s damage. 

                                 DALE (O.S.)
                                (firm)
                        Stay up there, Allison!

                                 ALLISON
                        Why? What’s--

                                 DALE (O.S.)
                        Just stay where you are. Don’t 
                        come... [coughs] don’t come down 
                        here.

           John regards the twisted mess of metal and earth before him 
           with quiet despair.

                                 DALE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Is Nathan with you?

                                 ALLISON
                        Yes. 

                                 DALE (O.S.)
                        Move.... [coughs] ...move him away.

                                 ALLISON
                        Dad, what’s happening--

                                 DALE (O.S.)
                        Do it!
           The exertion causes Dale pain in his voice.

                                 ALLISON
                        Go over there, sweetie.

                                 NATHAN
                        I want to make sure Grandpa’s okay.

                                 DALE (O.S.)
                        Grandpa’s fine, partner. Like 
                        always. Now go ahead.

           Allison nods her affirmation to Nathan. 

                                 ALLISON
                        Go over by Grandpa’s truck. It’s 
                        okay.

           Scared, Nathan nevertheless does as he’s told. Stands 
           alongside Dale’s unmarred Chevy Silverado.

                                 DALE (O.S.)
                        Allison...

                                 ALLISON
                        Yeah. I’m here, Dad. I’m here--

                                 DALE (O.S.)
                        Stay up there. Please. Please...

           After a few slow, labored breaths... 

                                 DALE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        John? 

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, I’m here. I’m with Allison.

                                 DALE (O.S.)
                        Good. Good...
                                (beat)
                        You’re gonna come down here. 

           INT. EMERGENCY SHELTER - NIGHT

           John’s foot lands slowly on the first of the wooden stairs... 
           followed cautiously by the next. 

           Ducking into the shelter... John takes in the claustrophobic 
           space. 

           Items are strewn, overturned. Nearly all of the back half of 
           the shelter is caved in, its metal walls crumbled.
           The de-tuned radio, knocked to the floor, continues to hiss.

           A collapsed section of the shelter partially blocks Dale from 
           John’s view -- though Dale’s agony is clearer than ever.

           Inching around the obstruction, John finally sees...

           Dale splayed across his chair. A torn-away section of the 
           metal shelter has IMPALED him through his stomach. 

           A crimson stain spreads across the belly of his flannel 
           shirt. Coughed-up blood paints his teeth and chin.

           John is paralyzed at the sight. Dale lifts his head, just 
           enough to meet John’s stunned eyes. 

           ABOVE THE SHELTER

           Allison stands alone. Her cold, nervous breaths congeal in 
           the nighttime cold. 

                                 ALLISON
                        John? What’s happening?

           INSIDE THE SHELTER

           John does not register Allison at first. Still overcome.

                                 ALLISON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        John?!

           He finally musters a response --

                                 JOHN
                        He’s... he’s here. I see him.

                                 DALE
                                (to Allison)
                        It’s okay. Did you move Nathan 
                        away? 

           INTERCUT - ABOVE THE SHELTER / INSIDE THE SHELTER

                                 ALLISON
                        He’s over by your truck.
                                (then)
                        John, what’s wrong? Is he hurt?!

           John can’t produce an adequate answer.

                                 DALE
                        Your daddy’s in a bad spot, 
                        Sunflower.
                                 ALLISON
                        I’m coming down--

                                 DALE
                        No --

                                 JOHN
                        No!

           John’s reflexive assertiveness finally awakens him from his 
           shock.

           Allison stops. Fearful tears filling her eyes.

           INSERT - A small but steady stream of dirt flows like 
           hourglass sand from above the crushed shelter, pooling on the 
           torn section of metal.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        We need to get you to a hospital, 
                        Dale.

           Dale ignores this. Lifts a trembling, bloody finger... points 
           at a toppled over FOOT LOCKER --

                                 DALE
                        Open it.

           A beat. John reluctantly opens the foot locker -- finds a 
           GLOCK 9MM inside.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Put the clip in.

                                 JOHN
                        Dale...

                                 DALE
                        Do it.

           John hesitates.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        God damn it...

           Dale’s chin drops in defeat. Unable to bear the pain, he 
           starts to sob.

                                 ALLISON
                        Why’s he crying?! Daddy?!
                                 DALE
                                (unconvincing)
                        I’m okay. I’m alright...

                                 ALLISON
                        John, help him! Please...

           This is all too much for Allison to take. 

           INSERT - The pool of spilling dirt weighs down the section of 
           torn metal, causing it to bend under the increasing weight.

           BACK TO SCENE

           John swallows hard. Stuffs the MAGAZINE into the gun’s CLIP.

           Dale nods a small, weak nod. His face growing wan.

                                 DALE
                        Chamber it. 

           John’s shaking hands fumble through the process, but 
           ultimately complete the task.

           SHUNK-SHUNK. 

           Allison’s head uprights at the unmistakable sound. Her 
           concern instantly redoubled.

                                 ALLISON
                        John...?

                                 DALE
                        It’s okay. John’s gonna do what 
                        he’s gotta do. For once. 

                                 ALLISON
                        What does that mean? John, what...

           Allison knows what it means. Denial only lasts so long.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        No. No. We can get you to a 
                        hospital.

                                 DALE
                        It’s too late for that, Sunflower. 
                        Time I met back up with your 
                        mother, anyhow. I’ve got some 
                        things to say sorry for.

           A great sorrow drapes its boughs over Allison’s shoulders.
                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        You should go join Nathan now.

                                 ALLISON
                        I... I don’t, I can’t --

                                 DALE
                        Please, honey. Please.

           Tears cascade down Allison’s face.

                                 ALLISON
                        I love you so much, Dad.

                                 DALE
                        I love you too. Now go ahead.

           Allison is crushed with grief. Her final goodbye. She roams 
           over to Nathan. Hugs him.

                                 JOHN
                        I... I can’t do this, Dale.

           Dale firmly grabs onto John’s hand, startling him.

                                 DALE
                        You ain’t gonna leave me suffering, 
                        you son of a bitch. 

           Dale’s grip gradually loosens... until it becomes a genuinely 
           tender moment shared between these two men.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Please.

           After a long beat, John slowly lifts the gun. Takes aim at 
           Dale’s head. His trigger-finger shakes with uncertainty.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Do it.

           Beat.

           INSERT - The torn-away metal finally gives under the weight 
           of the pooling dirt. It collapses partially but abruptly.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Dale HOWLS in pain as the collapse drives deeper the metal 
           spiking through him.

           Overhearing his shriek, Allison reacts from a distance.
                                 ALLISON
                        No...

           Dale eventually acclimates to this new baseline of agony.

                                 DALE
                        Do it. Please do it!

           John’s hand quivers. The barrel shakes.

           The torn-away metal suffers yet another short but jarring 
           collapse. Dale SCREAMS a blood-curdling scream.

                                 ALLISON
                        Do it!!!

           BANG!!! A flash of light burst from inside the dimly lit 
           shelter.

           SECONDS LATER

           Stillness. Unsettling silence. Allison clutches Nathan 
           tightly.

           Slow footsteps are heard plodding up the wooden stairs. From 
           a distance, Allison watches as...

           ...John slowly emerges. A blood-spattered rictus of shock.

           His eyes find Allison’s.

                                                                      CUT TO:

           EXT. BRUNSWICK, ME - RURAL HOME - DAWN

           The morning sun creeps above the horizon. Allison, Nathan, 
           and John stand before a freshly mounded pile of dirt. Dale’s 
           place of rest.

           Dried tears have cleansed narrow paths across Alison’s 
           begrimed cheeks. Nathan’s emotionally exhausted visage 
           bespeaks a similarly long night of sorrow. 

           Fearing rejection, even in this moment, John places a 
           comforting hand on Allison’s shoulder...

           Her glazed eyes peer over at his hand. Considering it. 
           Considering him.

           After a beat...
           Allison leans her cheek into his hand... then buries her face 
           against his chest. John’s eyes pearl with tears as Nathan 
           joins them in deep embrace.

           He finally has his family back.

           Allison slowly lifts her head. Looks directly at John...

                                 ALLISON
                        Let’s go home.

           John slowly nods. The beleaguered Garrity family resumes its 
           heartbreaking embrace.

           INT. DALE’S CHEVY SILVERADO - MORNING

           Nathan sits between his parents in the truck’s front cab. All 
           three of them are silent, staring ahead.

           The pickup truck traverses a pin-straight line of densely 
           WOODED ROAD. No other vehicle in sight in either direction.

           LATER

           The sun has finally finished its rise. Pastel blue skies.

           Nathan sleeps against his father’s shoulder. Allison gazes 
           out her window, dappled by sunlight.

           John soon reaches an ON-RAMP for a southbound HIGHWAY. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           The highway is congested with OVERTURNED and INOPERABLE 
           vehicles. Others are simply boxed-in and since abandoned. 

           John drives along the one CLEAR LANE. The only vehicle doing 
           so.

           Across the GRASS MEDIAN -- SEE a seemingly never-ending, 
           snaking line of REFUGEES trekking along the shoulder of the 
           equally congested NORTHBOUND lanes:

           - A woman pushing a BABY CARRIAGE...

           - An ELDERLY MAN wearing what’s clearly someone else’s North 
           Face jacket...

           - A hijab-wearing ARAB WOMAN with her woebegone family.

           Allison surveys all the wreckage. The overturned, damaged 
           vehicles --
                                 ALLISON
                        What do you think it was?
                                (off John’s confusion)
                        The shaking last night.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m not sure. Earthquake?

                                 ALLISON
                        Maine doesn’t get earthquakes.

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t know. Maybe it does.

           The Chevy Silverado crosses past the final cluster of empty 
           vehicles, opening to a lonely stretch of highway.

           Allison still mentally chews on something...

           She turns on the truck’s radio. Cycles through the static-
           filled stations -- until finally tuning-in to a BBC AMERICA 
           REPORTER. 

                                 BBC REPORTER (V.O.)
                        ...reports continue to come in from 
                        North Africa, where the death toll 
                        is believed to be in the hundreds 
                        of thousands. The Chinese Space 
                        Agency was first to confirm the 
                        fragment’s existence, and that it 
                        was known for two months to be on 
                        course with the African continent, 
                        contradicting statements made 
                        earlier today by both U.S. and U.K. 
                        officials.

                                 ALLISON
                        What fragment? What’s she...?

           John shakes his head, “I don’t know”. His interest and 
           concern piqued, he turns up the radio.

                                 BBC REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Since then, NASA has released a 
                        statement claiming that efforts to 
                        detonate explosives on the asteroid 
                        caused a sizeable portion to break 
                        apart and drift ahead. Per 
                        officials, it was believed that 
                        this smaller fragment would burn up 
                        in our atmosphere, which is why no 
                        advance notice was given to the 
                        public. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BBC REPORTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        The fragment, estimated to have 
                        been over a quarter-mile wide, 
                        struck Tunisia at 2:32 A.M. Eastern 
                        Standard Time. Rescue efforts have 
                        been slow, as many aid workers 
                        around the globe have stopped 
                        reporting for work to instead spend 
                        these final days with their loved 
                        ones...

           John’s tight expression, focused intently on what he’s 
           listening to, suddenly falls slack... as his eyes peer high 
           on the horizon.

           He slows the pickup truck to a dead stop in the middle of the 
           desolate highway.

                                 ALLISON
                                (confused)
                        What are you doing...?

           John’s finger slowly raises. Points ahead. Allison leans 
           forward and sees --

           -- a COMMERCIAL AIRLINER flying at a high altitude, overhead. 

           John’s bewilderment deepens. He climbs from the pickup truck. 
           The sound of him closing the door awakens Nathan.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING

           After a few steps he likely doesn’t recall even taking, John 
           comes to a stop -- still staring skyward.

           Allison and Nathan file next to him -- both bearing 
           countenances of similar perplexity...

           REVEAL

           ANOTHER COMMERCIAL AIRLINER...

           And then ANOTHER... and ANOTHER... and ANOTHER...

           CLOSE TO ONE HUNDRED PASSENGER PLANES FILL THE SKY.

           AMERICAN AIRLINES, SOUTHWEST, UNITED, DELTA, VIRGIN AMERICA, 
           etc. All at different elevations and at different speeds, but 
           all proceeding in the same NORTHBOUND direction.

                                 ALLISON
                        What’s happening?

           John shakes his head, still stupefied. 
           An increase in urgency on the part of the refugees hauls John 
           from his bewilderment. 

                                 JOHN
                        Stay here.

           He crosses the sizeable GRASS MEDIAN... onto the northbound 
           lane. Approaches a random portion of the seemingly never-
           ending line of people.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        What’s happening? Hey...

           Most people ignore him, concerned with their own well-being. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Hey! What’s--? 

           He stops, observes the crowd as it passes by.

           A faraway MALE VOICE suddenly comes into greater relief --

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        John? John!

           John turns to find his neighbor, Kenny Fitzpatrick, with his 
           wife and daughter, a good distance down the line.

                                 JOHN
                        Holy shit, Kenny.

           John rushes to them.

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK 
                        What the hell are you doing here?

                                 JOHN
                        We didn’t make it on the ship.

                                 DEBRA FITZPATRICK
                        That’s a shame.

           John’s confused by Debra’s acerbity.

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK
                        The ships didn’t make it. Tidal 
                        wave sunk them after that fragment 
                        hit.

                                 JOHN
                        What’s... where’s everyone going, 
                        then?
                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK
                        The military reopened the airspace. 
                        They’re taking anybody now. No 
                        lottery, no nothing. You just have 
                        to get there.

                                 JOHN
                        Get where?

                                 KENNY FITZPATRICK
                        To a plane.

           John processes this flood information as quickly as he can.

                                 JOHN
                        Come with me.

                                 DEBRA FITZPATRICK
                                (to Kenny)
                        No, we have to keep going.

                                 JOHN
                        God damn it, come on! I have a car!

           John regards other people in line near the Fitzpatricks. 
           Young people, old people, children. He frantically urges them 
           as well --

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You too. All of you, come on!

           MOMENTS LATER - BACK AT THE CHEVY SILVERADO

           John and Allison hurriedly help load people into the truck’s 
           cargo area.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Keep going, keep going...

           Allison finds herself face to face with Debra Fitzpatrick. A 
           moment of judgement.

                                 ALLISON
                        We’ve got to go, Debra.

           Debra is unable to fully relinquish her anger, but recognizes 
           the urgency of the moment. She and Ellie climb into the 
           truck’s cargo area, joining Kenny.

           INT. CHEVY SILVERADO - DAY

           The cargo area brims with PASSENGERS. John jumps into the 
           truck’s cab.
           THROWS the truck into DRIVE. The tires BURN then catch the 
           road as the truck SPEEDS forward -- heading SOUTHBOUND?

                                 ALLISON
                        What are you doing? Turn around! 

           Passengers in the cargo area, also aware they’re heading in 
           the wrong direction, bang against the cab’s hood and back 
           window. John ignores them.

                                 JOHN
                        We’re not going to Philadelphia.

                                 ALLISON
                        What, why?! The airport’s only 
                        twenty minutes away.

           John peers skyward once again, through the windshield. More 
           planes pass by overhead.

                                 JOHN
                        That’s an A340. So is that. That’s 
                        a 777...

                                 ALLISON
                        So what?

                                 JOHN
                        Planes that big only fly out of 
                        P.H.L. around here.

           Allison starts to piece it together.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        There wouldn’t be any planes left 
                        by the time we got there.

                                 NATHAN
                        Are we going to be left behind?

           John looks squarely at Nathan. 

                                 JOHN
                        No.

           With that, John’s foot STOMPS down on the accelerator. 

           EXT. WILMINGTON, DE - DELAWARE MEMORIAL BRIDGE - EVENING

           The Chevy Silverado BLOWS PAST the unmanned TOLL BOOTHS.

           MOMENTS LATER
           The Chevy Silverado SWERVES in between other vehicles. 
           Ascending the apex of the suspension bridge.

           Passengers in the truck’s cargo area cling to the ladder 
           rack, whipsawed by wind. The Fitzpatricks huddle close 
           together, finding cover against the cab.

           INT. CHEVY SILVERADO - SAME

           John’s knuckles whiten around the wheel. He’s stolen from his 
           concentration when, to the right of the bridge, he sees --

           -- several COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES taking off, in fairly rapid 
           succession, from a faraway airstrip. 

                                 JOHN
                                (sotto)
                        Shit.

           Time is running out. He floors it.

           EXT. WILMINGTON, DE - HIGHWAY - EVENING

           Moments later. The suspension bridge now far in the b.g.

           The Chevy Silverado SPEEDS underneath a highway sign: “ 
           WILMINGTON AIRPORT - EXIT 24B - 1/2 MILE”.

           John CUTS across two lanes toward the exit ramp.

           EXT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - EVENING

           Relatively small, servicing only a limited number of major 
           carriers. The American flag waves next to the Delaware state 
           flag.

           A crush of PEOPLE. Strong MILITARY PRESENCE. Commercial 
           airplanes take to the sky.

           The Chevy Silverado ROUNDS a tight corner -- faces upcoming 
           traffic on the DEPARTURES LANE -- SWERVES toward ARRIVALS. 

           ARRIVALS LANE - MOMENTS LATER

           The pickup truck weaves between vehicles, some abandoned. 

           A relatively clear lane opens to TRAFFIC up ahead. Many other 
           vehicles JUMP the curb and DRIVE across the expansive grass 
           lawn. 
                                 JOHN
                        Hold on!

           John does this as well. The race is on.

           John SPEEDS closer to the AIRPORT ENTRANCE -- TEARS THROUGH a 
           decorative row of bushes -- deftly avoids a STONE MONUMENT.

           But this is as close to the entrance as he’s going to get.

           A jumbled assemblage of vehicles, both civilian and military, 
           clusters around the entrance. 

           INT. CHEVY SILVERADO - SAME

           John brings the truck to an abrupt stop. Everyone floods from 
           the vehicle. 

                                 ALLISON
                        Hurry!

           EXT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - EVENING

           John, Allison, and Nathan RACE across the grass field, on 
           foot, toward the airport entrance. The Fitzpatricks do the 
           same, as do dozens of other desperate people.

           SEE that airplanes continue to depart. 

           Observing Nathan’s struggle to keep up, John scoops him into 
           his arms. Carries him, never once breaking stride.

           A distant view of the airstrip reveals that there are very 
           few planes remaining. 

                                 JOHN
                        Keep going!

           MOMENTS LATER

           John, Allison, and Nathan hurry through the logjam of 
           abandoned vehicles near the entrance.

           As they do, John double-takes at a familiar sight --

           The “DOWNEAST CONSTRUCTION” truck. Wedged amongst a sea of 
           other abandoned vehicles, about a hundred feet away.

           John’s pace slows nearly to a stop. Considering the vehicle.

                                 ALLISON
                        John!
           John snaps back to ground level. He catches up with Allison, 
           but flicks another quick look back at the truck.

           INT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - ARRIVALS - EVENING

           No order whatsoever. Rules no longer apply. Dozens of people 
           HURRY up the descending escalators.

           John, still carrying Nathan, takes the stairs. Allison right 
           beside them. The Fitzpatricks nearby as well.

           INT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - HALLWAY - EVENING

           A long straightaway adorned with vacation posters.

           John puts Nathan down. They run hand-in-hand.

           INT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - DEPARTURE GATES - EVENING

           Flooded with people. SOLDIERS enforce some semblance of 
           order. The dying evening light floods through runway-facing 
           windows. 

           John, Allison, and Nathan hurry onto the scene. Sweaty, 
           flustered. Eyes darting in every direction.

                                 ALLISON
                        Where do we go?

           Unsure, John stops a PASSING SOLDIER --

                                 JOHN
                        Hey-how do we get (on board)?

                                 PASSING SOLDIER
                                (over)
                        There and there -- get in any of 
                        those lines.

                                 ALLISON
                        How many planes are left?

                                 PASSING SOLDIER
                        Not many. 

           The Passing Soldier regards the massive amount of people who 
           continue to fill the area. 

                                 PASSING SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        You better get in line.
           John wastes little time.

                                 JOHN
                        Let’s go-come on.

           They hurry in the direction of where two LINES are formed, 
           over at GATE 12.

           INT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - GATE 12 - EVENING

           John, Allison, and Nathan stand in line, marching closer to 
           the departure gate door. 

           An ARMED SOLDIER paces the line, shouting out instructions --

                                 ARMED SOLDIER
                        Do not get out of line; you will 
                        not be allowed back and you will 
                        forfeit your spot.

           John looks at Nathan. Notices his glassiness. 

                                 JOHN
                        Nathan?
                                (to Allison)
                        I think he’s low.

                                 NATHAN
                        I’m... okay.

           Allison removes the blood sugar meter from a plastic bag 
           she’s brought with her. Tests Nathan’s blood sugar:

           “B.G.: 65 - LOW BLOOD SUGAR”

           Not overly concerned by that number, Allison retrieves some 
           Skittles from the plastic bag.

                                 ALLISON
                        Have these.

           Nathan eats the Skittles. Allison puts the remainder of them 
           back in the plastic bag. As she does --

           John notices the limited amount of insulin vials inside.

                                 JOHN
                        How much insulin did you get from 
                        your father?

                                 ALLISON
                        He had about a month’s supply.
                                 JOHN
                                (re: Nathan)
                        What... what’s he going to do after 
                        that?

                                 ALLISON
                        I don’t know -- they’ll, they must 
                        have medical supplies.

                                 JOHN
                        Enough for everybody?

           Allison falls numb as a cold realization washes over her.

                                 ALLISON
                        Oh God, oh God. How did I not think 
                        about that --

                                 JOHN
                        -- It’s okay --

                                 ALLISON
                        We should have stopped -- found a 
                        pharmacy before we got here --

                                 JOHN
                        Allison, listen, listen --

                                 ALLISON
                        -- Oh God --

                                 JOHN
                        Please, listen -- there’s a truck, 
                        we passed it outside. It might have 
                        all his supplies in it.

                                 ALLISON
                        What truck? What are you (talking 
                        about)?

                                 JOHN
                                (over)
                        Just trust me. Please.

           John looks ahead. Sees that it won’t be long until they’re 
           crossing through the gate’s departure door. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I have to go get it.

                                 ALLISON
                        No --
                                 JOHN
                        Yes, Allison --

                                 ALLISON
                        They won’t let you back in line.

           John tries to remain stoic, but the tears that pearl in the 
           corners of his eyes reveal him. 

           The full weight of this falls heavy on Allison. She starts to 
           cry.

                                 JOHN
                        It’s okay.

                                 ALLISON
                        John...

                                 JOHN
                        It’s okay.

           John starts to cry as well. Their foreheads kiss. He touches 
           her face. Their last goodbye. 

                                 NATHAN
                        Dad, no...

           John kneels down. Takes Nathan by the shoulders.

                                 JOHN
                        Nathan, listen to me...

                                 NATHAN
                        No!

                                 JOHN
                        Please, buddy. Please -- I need you 
                        to be okay. I need your mom to be 
                        okay. Do you understand?

                                 NATHAN
                        Why is she making you leave again?

           John casts his eyes upon Allison, then back on Nathan --

                                 JOHN
                        She’s not. She never did. I left. 
                        It was my decision, not you mom’s. 

                                 NATHAN
                        No --
                                 JOHN
                        Yes. That’s the truth. There is no 
                        excuse in the whole world for what 
                        I did, and I’m so, so, sorry.
                                (beat)
                        You need to be a good man. Better 
                        than... better than I was. Do you 
                        understand me? So much better than 
                        I was. I know you will be, Nathan. 
                        I know it.
                                (beat)
                        I’m gonna go get your insulin --

                                 NATHAN
                        -- I don’t want it.

                                 JOHN
                        -- You need it. I can’t change 
                        that. I wish I could.

           The line, unable to proceed, backs up around John.

                                 ARMED SOLDIER
                        Sir, you need to keep moving!

           John nods quickly then returns his focus to Nathan.

                                 JOHN
                        Please let your mom take care of 
                        you, and then, you need to take 
                        care of her.

           Nathan nods a small, tear-filled nod. John wipes away the 
           boy’s tears with his thumb. Stares deep into the boy’s eyes, 
           and then loses it.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I love you so much.

           John hugs Nathan tightly. Like he never wants to let him go.

           But he has to.

           John sniffs away his tears. Rises to meet Allison.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I love you too. That never changed.

           She takes his hand in hers.

                                 ALLISON
                        It never changed for me, either.

           Their pursed lips form sad smiles.
                                 ARMED SOLDIER
                        Sir, keep moving!

           John never breaks his eyes from Allison... until their hands 
           slip apart as he hurries off.

           INT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - HALLWAY - EVENING

           John backtracks the route he recently took. Races headlong in 
           the opposite direction as everyone else, pushing and dodging 
           his way through.

           INT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - ARRIVALS - EVENING

           He descends the staircase with dispatch. Bumping past the 
           oncoming, frantic masses. 

           EXT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - EVENING

           He bursts from the entrance/exit. Pushes his way through the 
           throng. Searches for the “Downeast Construction” truck.

                                 JOHN
                        Shit! Where is it-where is--

           His breath catches sharply when he finally spots it.

           Wasting no time, he runs toward the cluster of abandoned 
           vehicles, climbing over car hoods as necessary.

           INT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - GATE 12 - EVENING

           The Armed Soldier signals to other Soldiers --

                                 ARMED SOLDIER
                        That’s it. No more.

           Two SOLDIERS respond by closing off the line, while many more 
           force back the mass of hostile people who will not be able to 
           board. 

           The last of the passengers file by Allison and Nathan, who 
           remain at the gate door, anxiously awaiting John’s return.

                                 ARMED SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        Ma’am, the door’s closing.

                                 ALLISON
                        My husband’s getting my son’s 
                        (medication). 
                                 ARMED SOLDIER
                                (over)
                        You leave now or you don’t.

           Allison is torn.

           EXT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - EVENING

           John finally reaches the “Downeast Construction” truck.

           He tears open the cargo cap door. Leans inside --

           -- but the duffel bag isn’t there.

           Only a few random, left-behind items remain.

                                 JOHN
                        No...

           He frantically slaps aside these items, searching. Pulling 
           back a left-behind jacket -- he uncovers the duffel bag.

           A short sigh of relief. He swipes the bag by its straps.

           INT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - DEPARTURE GATES - EVENING

           The duffel bag in tow, John motors past gate after gate. Most 
           of which are now completely empty.

           INT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - GATE 12 - EVENING

           John arrives on gales of heavy breaths -- only to find the 
           door to that gate closed. 

           Where are they?!!

           He rounds to the large windows overlooking the TARMAC.

           Outside, SOLDIERS efficiently marshal commercial airlines 
           using hand signals and BEACON WANDS. 

           A line of PASSENGERS proceeds toward the ROLLING STAIRS of 
           the last remaining plane -- a Southwest 737. It takes a 
           moment, but John spots Allison and Nathan in this line.

           John BANGS against the glass.

                                 JOHN
                        Allison!!
           EXT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - TARMAC - SAME

           The jet’s engines are deafening. Allison and Nathan huddle 
           close as they march toward the aircraft. 

           Completely unaware that John is at the window behind them.

           INT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - GATE 12 - SAME

           Unwilling to give up, John pushes his way over to the maze of 
           retractable belts. 

           He grabs one of the metal POSTS. Stalks over to the window --

           -- and SMASHES the weighted bottom of the post against it. 
           Again. And again.

           Soldiers rush over to subdue John.

           SMASH!

           The post punches a sizeable hole in the window. John yells 
           through it --

                                 JOHN
                        Allison!!!

           But she still can’t hear him. 

           John again picks up the metal post, rears it back --

           -- but he’s GRABBED by three Soldiers. He FIGHTS with all he 
           has as they attempt to drag him away.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Let go--! He needs-- I need to get 
                        him the bag!!

           INT./EXT. AIRPLANE - SAME

           One by one, passengers are hurried into the overfilled 737 as 
           camo-wearing MILITARY PILOTS ready the cockpit.

           Allison and Nathan climb the final steps of the rolling 
           stairs.

           Nathan boards. Allison is just about to board, but stops...
           INT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - GATE 12 - SAME

           The Soldiers PULL at John, but he resists. He GRABS onto the 
           jagged rim of the hole in the glass. The sharp edges tear 
           into his palm and fingers.

           He sees that Allison has stopped atop the rolling stairs. He 
           wills himself closer to the hole in the window --

                                 JOHN
                        Allison!! 

           -- and then tries to stuff the duffel bag through it. The 
           bag’s almost through... Almost... 

           But then --

           His blood-soaked fingers finally lose purchase on the glass. 
           He’s YANKED from the window and dragged away.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        No!! No!!

           The duffle bag falls to the floor. 

           EXT. AIRPLANE - SAME

           Allison turns and looks back to the airport... but all she 
           sees is an empty, broken window.

           The FEMALE SOLDIER standing at the airplane’s door --

                                 FEMALE SOLDIER
                        Ma’am, you have to get on board!

           INTERCUT - GATE 12 / AIRPLANE

           As John is being dragged away, he can still see Allison. 
           She’s about to board the plane. Without the bag.

           One last look... then she boards. 

           INT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - DEPARTURE GATES - EVENING

           Moments later. Turmoil persists throughout the airport.

           The Soldiers give John one final shove back, like a patron 
           being tossed from a bar who no longer puts up any resistance. 

           The Soldiers leave him, address a situation elsewhere.
           John’s downcast gaze lifts. He looks to the once-crowded gate 
           at which he formerly stood. It’s now all but empty.

           INT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - GATE 12 - EVENING

           John slowly approaches the broken window. 

           There he stands, the red duffel bag at his feet, blood 
           dripping from his hand, and watches as --

           EXT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - TARMAC - SAME

           The airplane rolls away from the gate, awash in the glow of 
           orange-yellow sunset.

           INT. AIRPLANE - SAME

           Every seat occupied, many with more passengers than intended. 
           Other passengers crowd the aisle, seated on the floor. 

           Kenny Fitzpatrick holds his wife and daughter, Ellie, close. 
           Ellie smiles a small smile at someone up ahead --

           Nathan. 

           He peers down the aisle at her. Smiles a small smile back. 
           Allison sits next to Nathan. Her mind manifestly unmoored.

           SEE that Colin, the young man John met in the pickup truck, 
           sits several seats back. He notices the purple stuffed animal 
           cheetah Nathan clings to, bringing a spare smile to his face.

           Everyone lurches back when the aircraft gains speed.

           INT. WILMINGTON AIRPORT - DEPARTURE GATES - SAME

           John stands vigil at the broken window. 

           The aircraft takes to the sky, its phantom-like reflection 
           gliding across the opposite side of the fractured glass.

           John’s eyes gently close as he’s consumed by a complex 
           mixture of emotions.

           Beat.

           A nearby escalation in commotion. In degrees, John registers 
           this. He looks across the hall to the opposite GATE...
           Dozens of people suddenly rush toward it. 

                                                              CUT TO MONTAGE:

           INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT (MONTAGE)

           The in-flight cabin lights turn on. Passengers rouse from 
           their restless slumber. 

           MILITARY PERSONNEL request that everyone lock arms with the 
           person next to them in preparation for landing. Allison and 
           Nathan do as instructed.

           EXT. MILITARY AIRSTRIP - NIGHT (MONTAGE)

           The aircraft touches down on an isolated runway. Heavy winds 
           buffet the craft, making for a difficult landing. 

           INT. AIRPLANE - SAME (MONTAGE)

           Passengers are jostled but none suffer injury as the aircraft 
           lands. The aircraft begins a rapid deceleration.  

           EXT. MILITARY AIRSTRIP - NIGHT (MONTAGE)

           Numerous aircraft continue to land on the airstrip.

           Soldiers hurry Allison, Nathan, and other passengers across 
           the TARMAC, to where they will board one of the many MILITARY 
           BUSES prepared for departure.

           A posted U.S. AIR FORCE sign indicates their location: “THULE 
           AIR BASE - GREENLAND”. 

           EXT. GREENLAND - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAWN (MONTAGE)

           Blue light creeps over the inky-black horizon.

           A convoy of MILITARY BUSES speed down a one-lane road carved 
           through Greenland’s icy, Mars-like topography. 

           INT. MILITARY BUS - SAME (MONTAGE)

           Allison, Nathan, and over a hundred other passengers bounce 
           and sway. Cold breaths escape in misty coils of vapor. 
           EXT. GREENLAND - MILITARY INSTALLATION - DAWN (MONTAGE)

           The military buses approach a truly massive entrance to one 
           of many UNDERGROUND BUNKERS, hewn into the earth itself. 

           The buses continue, unabated, swallowed whole by the bunker’s 
           sheer enormity.

           INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAWN (MONTAGE)

           Allison and Nathan are corralled into a cavernous room 
           teeming with THOUSANDS OF DISPLACED PEOPLE. 

           A large DIGITAL CLOCK, affixed high on the wall, counts down 
           to the time of impact: 

           “00:27:16... 00:27:15... 00:27:14...”

           EXT. GREENLAND - MILITARY INSTALLATION - DAWN (MONTAGE)

           The last of all buses, military personnel, and equipment are 
           rushed inside the bunker. 

           A YOUNG CORPORAL looks to the sky. His jaw slackens... he 
           sees it.

           For the very first time, the ASTEROID appears. A streak of 
           WHITE LIGHT slicing through the sky.

           The Young Corporal hurries inside as the bunker’s colossal 
           STEEL DOOR closes and SEALS SHUT.

           INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAWN (MONTAGE)

           RED LIGHTS FLASH as the countdown reaches the ONE-MINUTE 
           MARK. Allison and Nathan join everyone in a CRASH POSITION.

           “00:00:59... 00:00:58... 00:00:57...”

           Allison reaches for Nathan’s hand.

           EXT. GREENLAND - MILITARY INSTALLATION - DAWN (MONTAGE)

           The asteroid grows in luminosity as it draws even closer to 
           earth. Brilliant white light spreads across the sky.

           INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAWN (MONTAGE)

           “00:00:36... 00:00:35... 00:00:34...”
           Their faces pressed against the ground, braced for impact, 
           Allison and Nathan stare into each others’ eyes.

           Until Nathan’s gaze slowly lifts. Astonished when he sees --

                                 NATHAN
                        DAD!!!

           John scours the huddled masses. He snaps toward the distant 
           sound of Nathan’s voice --

                                 NATHAN (CONT’D)
                        Dad!!

           -- and sees his son. 

                                 JOHN
                        Nathan!!

                                 ALLISON
                        John!

           John runs across the bunker, the red duffel bag in hand. 
           Allison and Nathan leap to their feet. Race to meet him 
           halfway.

           “00:00:23... 00:00:22... 00:00:21...”

           They connect into each others’ tight embrace. Tears cascade 
           down their cheeks. Joyful relief steals over Allison as she 
           regards the duffel bag.

           They all assume crash positions, huddled together as one.

           “00:00:16... 00:00:15... 00:00:14...”

           Eyes wet with tears, John and Allison stare deeply at each 
           other. Their smiles broaden. Their fingers interlace.

           And then they gently close their eyes...

           FLASH TO --

           - Nathan’s birth. John is handed his newborn son by the 
           doctor.

           - John and Allison in the recovery room, holding their 
           swaddled newborn baby.

           FLASH TO --

           - John scoops up Nathan, who’s about two years old, runs 
           through a sprinkler. Allison does as well, fully dressed.
           FLASH TO --

           - Nathan, about three years old, rides a carousel horse. John 
           stands next to him, admiring his son.

           BACK TO SCENE 

           Their interlaced fingers tighten. John holds Nathan closer.

           “00:00:10... 00:00:09... 00:00:08...”

           FLASH TO --

           - Nathan runs across an empty beach, a kite rising into the 
           sky behind him.

           - John and Allison, both in their late twenties, trying wine 
           at a fancy wine tasting. John makes a face, Allison snorts 
           and nearly shoots wine out of her nose.

           - John and Allison, early thirties. John kisses Allison on 
           the cheek, from behind, as she brushes her teeth.

           - Nathan draws a picture with crayons. He looks up, directly 
           into camera.

           - Nathan blows out the four candles on his birthday cake.

           BACK TO SCENE

           “00:00:06... 00:00:05...”

           FLASH TO --

           ***The images are faster now. Some barely lasting a half-
           second. The MUSIC SWELLS.***

           - Nathan and other kids with sparklers on the Fourth of July.

           - Allison hangs an ornament on the Christmas tree.

           - John pushes Nathan on a playground swing.

           BACK TO SCENE

           “00:00:04... 00:00:03...” 

           FLASH TO --

           - Allison returns home from a work trip to a hug.

           - Nathan riding wobbly his bike.

           - John kissing Nathan good night.
           ***Images appearing faster, faster. Music swelling.***

           - Jumping.

           - Singing.

           - Playing.

           - A look.

           - A touch.

           - A laugh.

           - A smile.
