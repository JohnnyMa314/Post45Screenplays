                                                          November 26, 2016
           INT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO THEATER, 1955 - NIGHT

           The play is terrible. But its star, MIKE NICHOLS (24), 
           dressed as a butler, is trying very hard.

                                 MIKE
                        I might love you? Yes, no doubt 
                        about it, you're pretty, you're 
                        refined. Nice, when you want to be. 
                        You are like burning wine.

           He is playing opposite ANN PETRY (22), equally awful.

                                 ANN
                        Let me alone! That's not the way to 
                        win me!

           In the second row, a WOMAN doesn’t even try to hide her 
           eyeroll. She brings her hand to her mouth, stifling a laugh.

           As he continues his performance, Mike NOTICES her.

                                 MIKE
                        In what way then? Not with caresses 
                        and pretty words, not with 
                        forethought for the future, escape 
                        from disgrace? In what way then?

           His eyes dart between the woman and Ann. Embarrassment and 
           shame cross his mind, but mostly ... he knows. 

                                 ANN
                        I don't know! I loathe you like 
                        vermin, but I can't be without you. 

           Mike gets distracted. For a brief second, he makes eye 
           contact with the stranger. Gulps down a breath.

           She is ELAINE MAY (24), shoulders shaking in silent laughter.

                                 MIKE
                        Run away with me!

           His face shows guilt -- he’s going to be distracted for the 
           rest of the performance. Hers shows none.

           EXT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO CAMPUS - MORNING

           Mike walks with a fellow student, SUSAN, between classes.

                                 SUSAN
                        I didn’t hear your radio show this 
                        morning.
                                 MIKE
                        I got sacked again.

                                 SUSAN
                        What? Why?

                                 MIKE
                        They really prefer it when you show 
                        up for your shift.

                                 SUSAN
                        I think your landlord really 
                        prefers it when you pay rent.

                                 MIKE
                             (shrugs)
                        Don’t worry about me. The station 
                        always ends up taking me back.

           A NEWSPAPER VENDOR drops today’s copies of the CHICAGO DAILY 
           NEWS into a machine. Mike GRABS ONE, leaving only a casual--

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks, fella.

           --as he keeps walking.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Sidney Harris came to the show last 
                        night. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Oh, shit. Are you sure you want to 
                        read his review?

           Mike frantically flips through the pages. She scans his face 
           and is surprised when he LIGHTS UP.

                                 MIKE
                        I gotta run.

           He takes off, DARTING toward--

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - MINUTES LATER

           Out of breath, Mike runs in, waving the paper--

                                 MIKE
                        Paul, Paul!

           His friend PAUL SILLS (24), in an apron, looks up from his 
           conversation with a girl, whose back is to Mike.
                                 PAUL
                        The review?

           Paul starts reading. The girl SPINS to read over Paul’s 
           shoulder, and Mike realizes it’s the girl from the front row.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                             (reading)
                        “As Jean the valet, Mike Nichols is-
                        -”

                                 MIKE
                        “--magnificent.”

                                 ELAINE
                        Ha!

           Paul tries to cover--

                                 PAUL
                        Sorry. Mike Nichols, Elaine May. 
                        Mike’s one of the best actors at 
                        UC, and Elaine’s in my company 
                        downtown. She’s the only person on 
                        campus as hostile as you. 

           They shake hands, but--

                                 ELAINE
                        I’m not hostile.

                                 PAUL
                        Really? ‘Cause I know about 
                        thirteen guys who’d beg to differ.

                                 MIKE
                        Fourteen. I saw you last night in 
                        the second row. Your face was 100 
                        percent hostile.

                                 ELAINE
                        I can’t help it if my face has an 
                        opinion about offensive theater.

           Mike is taken aback by this confident, openly mean stranger.

                                 MIKE
                        Paul’s your friend. He directed it.

                                 ELAINE
                        He knows it’s shit just as well as 
                        I do. And you know it, too. 
                        Strindberg couldn’t write a woman 
                        if his life depended on it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELAINE (CONT'D)
                        And look at you -- look at your 
                        nose. You can’t play a servant with 
                        a nose like that. Also it was just 
                        bad. But anyway, Harris has called 
                        you magnificent, so why do you care 
                        what I think?

           Mike doesn’t have an answer. With an kind-hearted laugh--

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        I gotta go. 

           And with that, she LEAVES, as Mike WATCHES.

                                 PAUL
                        Don’t.

                                 MIKE
                        What?

                                 PAUL
                        Elaine’s a bit of a black widow. 
                        She goes through guys almost as 
                        fast as she goes through 
                        Parliaments.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s not necessarily a 
                        dealbreaker.

                                 PAUL
                        Every guy at Compass is in love 
                        with her. You’d be a little stupid 
                        not to be in love with Elaine. But 
                        I’m telling you -- it never turns 
                        out good.

           The idea, though, is already in his mind.

           EXT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO CAMPUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Elaine stands a little less tall now, leaning against the 
           wall of a PHONE BOOTH, mid-argument.

                                 ELAINE
                        What do you mean, she doesn’t want 
                        to talk to me?
                        Mother, I--
                        She’s six. What could she possibly 
                        be busy with?
                        You’re right, how would I know. 
                        Fine. Just -- tell Jeannie I love 
                        her. Tell her Mommy loves her.
           She hangs up. The dime clanks on the pile of other dimes. She 
           pushes off the phone booth and leaves.

           A GUY (20s) notices her on the street--

                                 GUY
                        Hey, Elaine! Where’s your 
                        broomstick today?

                                 ELAINE
                        Why? You want to shove something up 
                        your ass?

           He’s silenced, and she keeps going. 

           INT. COMPASS THEATER - NIGHT

           Elaine stands onstage with SHELLEY BERMAN (30). 

                                 SHELLEY
                        To start, we’ll take a suggestion 
                        from the audience. Throw out a word 
                        or a situation, and we’ll turn it 
                        into a scene on the spot.

           The crowd is largely quiet, save for a couple MURMURS -- we 
           CHANGE PERSPECTIVE to see that the audience is about eight 
           people, including a guy who might be jerking off in the back.

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER
                        Heart attack!

                                 SHELLEY
                        Heart attack. Beautiful. I’m going 
                        to take it to mean you’re 
                        suggesting a scene about a heart 
                        attack, not announcing your own.

           Shelley brings a pantomime PHONE to his face; Elaine follows. 
           His comedy is all facial expressions. Elaine’s is all verbal.

                                 SHELLEY (CONT’D)
                        Hello, Operator? I need an 
                        ambulance right away. I think my 
                        sister-in-law is having a heart 
                        attack.

                                 ELAINE
                        Oh, that sounds bad. What’s your 
                        address?

                                 SHELLEY
                        7575 Blunderbuss Avenue.
                                 ELAINE
                        That’s a nice neighborhood. Do you 
                        live there? You must do pretty well 
                        for yourself.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Are the paramedics on their way? 
                        She’s not breathing.

                                 ELAINE
                        Yes, yes. So is this your wife’s 
                        sister or your brother’s wife? 

                                 SHELLEY
                             (increasingly agitated)
                        My brother’s wife. Why would that 
                        matter? Madam, I am in desperate 
                        need of an ambulance. I do not have 
                        time for--

                                 ELAINE
                        Sir, I’ve alerted the authorities. 
                        The ambulance is on its way. But 
                        you must stay on the line until 
                        they arrive.

                                 SHELLEY
                             (relieved)
                        All right.

                                 ELAINE
                        You sound very nice.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Thank you.

                                 ELAINE
                        What do you look like?

                                 SHELLEY
                        I’m sorry?

                                 ELAINE
                        What do you look like? I’m trying 
                        to distract you from a stressful 
                        situation with chit-chat. What do 
                        you look like?

                                 SHELLEY
                        I don’t really want to chit-chat 
                        right now. Should we be doing 
                        compressions or something? 
                                 ELAINE
                        Can you do them correctly? Are you 
                        a doctor?!

           INT. COMPASS THEATER - LATER

           The HOUSE LIGHTS are up, and the COMPANY -- Elaine, Shelley, 
           Paul, DAVID SHEPHERD (28), and BARBARA HARRIS (21), among 
           others -- is smoking and drinking after the show.

                                 PAUL
                        We took in $38 tonight.

                        So this is less.

                                 SHELLEY
                        We could raise ticket prices.

                                 DAVID
                        We’ve got a demand problem. Raising 
                        prices isn’t going to solve that.

                                 ELAINE
                        We could beg.

                                 SHELLEY
                        That’s embarrassing.

                                 PAUL
                        We need new blood. I’m going to 
                        invite some actors from UC down.

           There’s some mild groaning-- 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        And from now on, you gotta pay for 
                        your drinks.

           --but that gets more than a groan.

           INT. APARTMENT - MORNING

           Close on a HAND as an ALARM CLOCK goes off. The hand TWITCHES 
           briefly as it wakes, and it sleepily rubs its owners face. 

           The sleeper is only still for a moment before jumping out of 
           bed and padding quickly to the BATHROOM. 
           He reaches for a WIG, resting on a stand, and briefly we see 
           MIKE’S BALD HEAD in the mirror as he puts the wig on.

           Fastidiously, routine, he AFFIXES EYEBROWS to his face -- 
           gluing them, positioning them, checking their hold.

           He checks the wig again.

           Once satisfied, he reaches for his toothbrush.

           INT. LECTURE HALL - EVENING

           Mike and Susan are bored while a PROFESSOR (50s) drones on. 

                                 PROFESSOR
                        Although working from different 
                        perspectives, both Schweitzer and 
                        Freud came to the conclusion that 
                        humans have a desire to protect and 
                        propagate life...

           Mike nudges Susan.

                                 MIKE
                        This is bullshit.

                                 SUSAN
                        Shh.

                                 PROFESSOR
                        Were you saying something, Nichols?

                                 MIKE
                        I said this is bullshit, Sir. 

                                 PROFESSOR
                        Would you care to expand on that?

                                 MIKE
                        First of all, this is Psychology 
                        105, and as a philosopher, 
                        Schweitzer has no place here. 
                        Schweitzer is concerned with 
                        civilizations: “The ethical 
                        perfecting of the individual as 
                        well as society.” Freud couldn’t 
                        give two shits about society. The 
                        life instinct is about self-
                        preservation. Food, sleep, sex. 
                        Period.

           Susan sinks down in her chair, pretending not to notice him. 
           Another STUDENT raises a hand, is called on, under--
                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I should be paying myself $60 a 
                        credit for this school.

                                 SUSAN
                        Do you ever shut up?

                                 MIKE
                        No.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           The class is excused, and students FILE OUT. As Mike and 
           Susan are about to leave--

                                 PROFESSOR
                        Michael? A word?

           Susan shoots Mike a look -- uh-oh -- and leaves.

                                 PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Nichols, you’re very bright.

                                 MIKE
                        What, but I’m a smug asshole?

                                 PROFESSOR
                             (laughs)
                        Well, if the shoe fits... No, 
                        listen, you’re a smart kid. But you 
                        come to one out of every three 
                        lectures, and every time you try to 
                        start a fight with me. If you want 
                        to be taken seriously, do the 
                        assignments, challenge your 
                        classmates -- and me, for that 
                        matter -- respectfully, and stop 
                        assuming you’re the smartest person 
                        in the room. Until then, I won’t 
                        call on you. Got it?

           Chastened, maybe, Mike nods. Leaves.

           INT. ILLINOIS CENTRAL - RANDOLPH STREET STATION - NIGHT

           Mike’s steps echo as he hurries down the steps onto the 
           platform. He realizes there is no train coming, hardly anyone 
           around. Except...

           Elaine sits on a bench with a book. It is the first time 
           they’ve ever been alone. Their first opportunity for a 
           conversation. And for whatever reason, Mike goes with--
                                 MIKE
                             (thick Russian accent)
                        May I seet down?

                                 ELAINE
                             (without looking up)
                        Eef you veesh.

           He produces a cigarette.

                                 MIKE
                        Do you haff a light?

                                 ELAINE
                        Yes, zertainly.

           She produces one.

                                 MIKE
                             (under his breath)
                        I had a lighter but I lost eet on 
                        57th Street.

                                 ELAINE
                        Oh, of course. Zen you are ... 
                        Agent X-9?

           His eyes go wide. 

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        I’m Z-12.

                                 MIKE
                             (laughs a little)
                        I’m very glad we’ve finally made 
                        contact.

                                 ELAINE
                        Yes, you’re a little late.

                                 MIKE
                        Well, I lost the microfilm.

                                 ELAINE
                        Did you really?

                                 MIKE
                        I had sewn it in the lining of my 
                        trenchcoat, and I accidentally sent 
                        it to the cleaners.

                                 ELAINE
                        And you forgot?
                                 MIKE
                        Yes.

           He’s given her a dead-end here, but she pushes forward, 
           confident enough to carry this little scene on her shoulders.

                                 ELAINE
                        Oh, I lose money and keys and 
                        everything, but microfilm. They’re 
                        going to be furious.

                                 MIKE
                        I was so afraid the head would find 
                        out. But I went back to the 
                        cleaners and it was watertight, 
                        thank Lenin.

                                 ELAINE
                        I mean, the microfilm isn’t too 
                        important. They’re gonna publish 
                        that in Life Magazine next week. 
                        But the little prints, those are 
                        very secret. They’re just ... top 
                        bureau drawer.

           The train clatters in the distance, arriving. She gets up.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to get a cup of coffee?

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, I don’t like to discuss the 
                        plans in public.

                                 ELAINE
                        Of course. That’s why we should go 
                        to zee safehouse.

           Mike DROPS CHARACTER for a second, caught off guard--

                                 MIKE
                        Are you ... inviting me back...?

           He catches himself as she BOARDS the train, looking back at 
           him expectantly. He follows her into the car, PICKS BACK UP.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I mean, of course. If we are to 
                        blow up the big dam -- I won’t say 
                        which one, I think you can probably 
                        guess -- we should get to work. You 
                        should take me to the safehouse 
                        immediately, before any American 
                        spies catch wind of our operation.
           The train pulls away.

           EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT

           Looser now, Mike and Elaine approach her basement apartment.

                                 ELAINE
                        And how did you come to join the 
                        Soviet mission?

                                 MIKE
                        I volunteered. I just wanted to see 
                        America. The cars, Mount Rushmore, 
                        “I Love Lucy.” I feel you cannot 
                        truly hate America until you have 
                        seen its national treasures.

           She lets them inside--

           INT. ELAINE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           --her dingy apartment, and they drop the act. Suddenly things 
           are very real. They stand, looking at each other and at her 
           apartment, until she breaks it--

                                 ELAINE
                        Are you hungry?

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           Elaine cooks two hamburgers while Mike watches.

                                 MIKE
                        My mother was sick, so she put us 
                        on the boat by ourselves. I was 
                        seven. My brother was three. 

                                 ELAINE
                        That must have been terrifying.

                                 MIKE
                        She pinned two phrases to the back 
                        of my coat: “I don’t speak English” 
                        and “Please don’t kiss me.” 

                                 ELAINE
                        What happened to her?

                                 MIKE
                        It took her another year and a half 
                        to get out of Germany. But she made 
                        it to New York and fought with my 
                        father until he died of hating her.
           She slathers cream cheese and ketchup on the finished 
           burgers. He tries to hide his confusion as she hands him one.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t had a very happy life, 
                        Elaine.

                                 ELAINE
                        I’m not going to bed with you just 
                        because you’re a tortured refugee. 
                        The sandwich will have to do.

                                 MIKE
                        I gotta be honest. It’s pretty 
                        gross.

                                 ELAINE
                        Take it or leave it.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ll take it.

           She watches him for a beat.

                                 ELAINE
                             (nonchalant)
                        Do you go hungry a lot?

                                 MIKE
                             (too quick)
                        No. I can usually bum off Paul at 
                        the restaurant.

                                 ELAINE
                        You know, you are the worst kind of 
                        snob.

                                 MIKE
                        Thank you.

                                 ELAINE
                        Paul and David pay $28 a week at 
                        Compass. And they’re looking for 
                        fresh meat. I’m surprised Paul 
                        hasn’t asked you already. 

                                 MIKE
                        He did. I said no.

                                 ELAINE
                        Why?

                                 MIKE
                        Improvisations? No. I couldn’t.
                                 ELAINE
                        You just did twenty minutes on 
                        Agent X9 and Anastasia or whatever 
                        the fuck--

                                 MIKE
                        No, no. I need a script. I need the 
                        classics -- Strindberg, 
                        Shakespeare...

                                 ELAINE
                             (shrugs)
                        I think you just need practice. Or 
                        maybe you just need me.

           INT. COMPASS THEATER - NIGHT

           A Compass rehearsal period. Mike watches awkwardly. Elaine, 
           Paul, and other company members explain the “rules.”

                                 ELAINE
                        There are four rules for 
                        improvisational performance. Number 
                        one: You can’t deny reality. If 
                        another actor declares something to 
                        be real, it is.

           Here, a QUICK POP to this rule in action--

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

           Paul mimes DRIVING A CAR, taking a step in front of Barbara.

                                 PAUL
                        Where to, ma’am?

                                 BARBARA
                             (snooty)
                        54th and Park. And hurry.

           Paul looks over his shoulder at her.

                                 PAUL
                        Oh, my God, you’re that actress, 
                        aren’t you? Don’t tell me--

                                 BARBARA
                        Sylvia Hottentott, yes.

                                 PAUL
                        I’ll be damned!
                             (serious)
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Is it true you were born with three 
                        eyes?

                                                           AND BACK TO:

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

                                 DAVID
                        Number two: Always make the active 
                        choice when faced with a decision.

           Another QUICK POP--

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

           Shelley and Elaine stand on stage.

                                 ELAINE
                        Darling, I have to tell you 
                        something. Today, while you were at 
                        work, the kids found a stray in the 
                        yard. And I know we’ve agreed not 
                        to get a pet, on account of your 
                        asthma and everything, but the kids 
                        -- they just fell in love with the 
                        little guy, and I couldn’t say no.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Oh, Helen, you know how I feel 
                        about dogs.

                                 ELAINE
                        That’s the thing -- it’s not a dog. 
                        It’s an aardvark.

                                                           AND BACK TO:

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

                                 PAUL
                        Three: Your job as the actor is to 
                        justify whatever happens onstage. 
                        Anything is possible.

           Mike nods, overwhelmed.

           Another QUICK POP--

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

           David and Shelley on stage--
                                 DAVID
                        Hand to God, the ghost of Abraham 
                        Lincoln just performed the 
                        Gettysburg Address on that street 
                        corner and then jumped in a cab.

                                 SHELLEY
                        Well, don’t just stand there. Which 
                        way’d he go?

                                                           AND BACK TO:

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

                                 MIKE
                        I thought you said there were four 
                        rules?

           Elaine sidles up, whispers--

                                 ELAINE
                        When in doubt, seduce.

           And now Mike learns to improvise--

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

           Shelley, onstage, MIMES setting a table. He’s very detailed, 
           like a classic butler, straightening imaginary forks and 
           wiping imaginary spots off imaginary crystal.

           In the WINGS, Mike WATCHES Elaine buckle her shoes, paying no 
           attention to Shelley. She catches him.

                                 ELAINE
                        What?

           He tries to turn his attention anywhere else -- Shelley seems 
           quiet. Oblivious, Mike tries to “help” by entering the scene, 
           WALKING STRAIGHT THROUGH Shelley’s “table.”

           The audience GROANS. This fucking guy.

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Elaine drinks coffee and smokes a cigarette, Mike beats his 
           forehead against the table.

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

           Paul animatedly moves around the stage, playing a CORPORATE 
           BOSS commandingly.
                                 PAUL
                        Get me the head of Dow Chemical on 
                        the phone, a hot cup of black 
                        coffee, and tell my wife I won’t be 
                        home until late. Probably not until 
                        tomorrow. Maybe never.

           Mike can’t keep up, trailing him as Paul looks over his 
           shoulder, waiting for Mike to help him out. Mike TRIPS OVER 
           HIS OWN FEET. 

           This gets a laugh, but not for the right reason.

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Elaine’s still smoking, and Mike’s still despondent.

                                 ELAINE
                        It could have been worse.

                                 MIKE
                        How?

                                 ELAINE
                        You could have been naked.

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

           Elaine mimes getting into a car.

                                 ELAINE
                        Come on, Tommy, get in the car.

                                 MIKE
                             (looks at the empty stage)
                        What car?

           This is a huge jackass move. Elaine barrels forward.

                                 ELAINE
                        Thomas Jefferson Ogbert, get over 
                        here right now -- ooh, just you 
                        wait until your father gets home.

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Elaine’s still smoking. Mike looks up at her.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sorry.
                                 ELAINE
                             (shrugs)
                        You’re learning. You’re the slowest 
                        learner since Napoleon, but still.

                                 MIKE
                        Still.

           She goes back to her cigarette.

           INT. THEATER - WINGS - NIGHT

           Mike and Elaine wait backstage as a SMALL AUDIENCE laughs 
           gently at Shelley. Barbara sits nearby, doing a CROSSWORD.

                                 MIKE
                        This is the last time.

                                 ELAINE
                        Fine.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m serious. I’m done after 
                        tonight. I’ll go back to University 
                        plays. I’ll get my job at WFMT 
                        back. Or maybe I’ll become a 
                        doctor. I don’t know.

                                 ELAINE
                        You wouldn’t be a very good doctor.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s a rotten thing to say.

                                 ELAINE
                        I got a papercut the other day and 
                        you almost vomited.

           Shelley’s act ends, and he pushes back into the wings.

                                 MIKE
                        This is humiliating.

                                 ELAINE
                             (ignoring that)
                        Let’s be English. You be a riding 
                        instructor, I’ll be your student.

           There’s no time to consider it -- they’re already pushing...

           INT. THEATER - ONSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           ...onstage, the lights blinding. In English accents--
                                 MIKE
                        Lovely day for a ride, isn’t it?

                                 ELAINE
                        I’m quite nervous, actually. What 
                        if my horse just runs off into the 
                        woods without me?

                                 MIKE
                        First of all, horses don’t run -- 
                        they gallop. And second of all, we 
                        put all of our beginner students on 
                        this special horse. He hasn’t done 
                        more than a canter in five years. 
                        Not since his left two legs were 
                        injured in the war. If you stay 
                        calm, so will he.

                                 ELAINE
                        All right then. What’s his name?

                                 MIKE
                        Hell Bitch.

           This gets a laugh. MIKE’S FIRST. Sitting in the wings, 
           Barbara looks up from her puzzle, notices Mike.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s start with a basic walk.

           He DEMONSTRATES, gracefully, leaving Elaine to follow, while 
           MIMING THE HORSE’S LIMP. She is easily an expert at it.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Are you feeling confident?

                                 ELAINE
                        Oh, no, not in the least, sir--

                                 MIKE
                        Wonderful. Let’s move on to a trot. 
                        A trot is an elegant, efficient 
                        gait--

           Barbara sets down her crossword puzzle and gets up, scurrying 
           through the wings and hallways until she’s exiting into the--

           INT. LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

           --where the guys are throwing back drinks like fiends.

                                 BARBARA
                             (elated)
                        Come quick.
                                 PAUL
                        What’s wrong?

                                 BARBARA
                        Mike’s got a character.

           They set their drinks down, take off after her, back into--

           INT. THEATER - CONTINUOUS

           --where the audience is MID-LAUGH.

           Elaine is now TROTTING around Mike in a circle, with an 
           elaborate limp.

                                 DAVID
                             (whispers)
                        I don’t get it.

                                 MIKE
                        Very nice, very nice. Try to keep 
                        your back straight.

                                 ELAINE
                             (out of breath)
                        Are you kidding? I can’t keep 
                        anything straight.

                                 MIKE
                        Certainly not the instructions.
                             (a beat, more laughter)
                        Lightly tug on your reins to stop 
                        the horse from moving.

           She mimes her attempt to stop, ungracefully falls to the 
           ground. Mike watches her from above.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                             (dryly)
                        If I didn’t love watching them fall 
                        down so much, I’d close this farm.

           The audience claps, including the other Compass Players, the 
           lights go down, and Elaine gets up. He pulls her into the--

           INT. THEATER - WINGS - CONTINUOUS

           --backstage, elated.

                                 MIKE
                        There was this moment-- I just -- I 
                        looked at you --
                                 ELAINE
                        I know--

                                 MIKE
                        I realized that you would end up --

           He MIMICS her motion -- spinning his finger and CRACKING 
           HIMSELF UP.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        And I knew you realized it, too. I 
                        mean, you are a goddamn genius.

                                 ELAINE
                        Thank you.

                                 MIKE
                        I mean it. It was like I could read 
                        your mind.

           She’s smiling like crazy, and he can’t help it--

           He goes in for a kiss. It’s tentative at first, but it grows 
           quickly. They’re breaking a tension that’s been building 
           since that night on the train platform.

           She relaxes into it, stretching her fingers around his waist 
           and to his back, drawing him closer.

           He’s surprised by it -- enough so that he pulls away and 
           looks at her.

                                 ELAINE
                        Well, shit.

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

           A little more professional, a little bigger audience. Real 
           costumes. They sit side by side on a BENCH.

                                 ELAINE
                        But this is our first date, and I--

                                 MIKE
                        I know what you’re going to say. 
                        Can I tell you what you’re going to 
                        say? Because I’ve heard it before. 
                        You’re going to say that I wouldn’t 
                        respect you. Right?

                                 ELAINE
                        I--
                                 MIKE
                        Listen, Jenny. I wanna tell you, 
                        right here and now, that I would 
                        respect you like crazy.

           This gets a HUGE LAUGH. A real laugh.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        You can’t even imagine how I would 
                        respect you.

                                 ELAINE
                        Are you sure you wouldn’t just be 
                        grateful?

                                 MIKE
                        No! I’m talking about respect.

                                 ELAINE
                        Well, um, can I ask you something? 
                        OK. Um, this is a very hard 
                        question to ask, so I would 
                        appreciate it, really, if -- just 
                        tell me the truth. Um, do you like 
                        me?

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, yeah. Oh, I do. I do.

                                 ELAINE
                        Really? Because I just want you to 
                        know something. I really like you. 
                        I know you don’t believe this -- 
                        I’ve never done this before with a 
                        boy. I really like you. You really 
                        like me?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

                                 ELAINE
                        Um. OK. OK. Will you hold this for 
                        me?

           She hands him her cigarette and starts carefully, nervously, 
           removing her sweater, a cotton sleeveless blouse underneath. 
           She folds it awkwardly in her lap. 

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        You really like me?

           He just nods, transfixed.

           As she starts to unbutton the blouse--
                                 MIKE
                        Do you think you’re gonna go to 
                        college when you get out of high 
                        school?

           Another huge laugh. Elaine, steady, CLOCKS his eyes -- 
           darting around, nervous, but always coming back to hers.

           INT. ELAINE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Elaine opens the door, Mike at her heels. As soon as the door 
           closes, he presses her against it and kisses her. He reaches 
           for the hem of her sweater; she loosens his bowtie.

           She gestures to the bedroom, tugs him toward the door. He 
           doesn’t immediately follow.

                                 ELAINE
                        Mike?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, no -- I mean -- I want to, 
                        trust me, I do. I just -- I gotta 
                        tell you something first?

                                 ELAINE
                        OK. Do you want a glass of wine?

                                 MIKE
                        Do you have wine?

           She opens the fridge, produces ... one can of beer.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           INT. ELAINE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Mike and Elaine are sharing the beer, passing it back and 
           forth on her couch.

                                 ELAINE
                        So you wanna tell me what’s on your 
                        mind?

                                 MIKE
                        I just ... there’s something I 
                        haven’t told you. Something ... 
                        unpleasant.

                                 ELAINE
                        OK ... that’s OK.
                             (a beat)
                        Do you want me to guess?
                                 MIKE
                             (laughs awkwardly)
                        No. I, um, don’t laugh. But--
                             (a breath)
                        This is a wig. False eyebrows. I’m 
                        bald. Look at my arms. The thing is 
                        -- I had an allergic reaction to 
                        the whooping cough shot when I was 
                        four. The doctors called it a 
                        “permanent denuding,” which is 
                        about as mortifying a phrase as 
                        they could find for such a 
                        mortifying condition, and--

           She’s been holding it in, and she can’t anymore. She LAUGHS.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        You evil cow!

                                 ELAINE
                        No, no! I’m not laughing at you, I 
                        swear. I’m only laughing because 
                        everybody knows.

                                 MIKE
                        What?

                                 ELAINE
                        Everybody knows. I mean, I didn’t 
                        know the part about the whooping 
                        cough vaccine, but--

                                 MIKE
                        Who’s everybody?

                                 ELAINE
                        Everybody. The company. The 
                        university. The state of Illinois.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh my God.

           He moves to get up.

                                 ELAINE
                        No, stop. Come here.

           She pulls him back down and climbs into his lap.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Everybody knows. Nobody cares. I 
                        don’t care.
                                 MIKE
                        You don’t?

                                 ELAINE
                        Why would I? So you’re weird. Who 
                        isn’t?

           He considers this for a moment.

                                 MIKE
                        But being peculiar is how I’ve 
                        defined myself. My father died when 
                        I was eleven, and I spent the rest 
                        of my childhood reading Eugene 
                        O’Neill and hiding from my mother.

                                 ELAINE
                        Did she hurt you?

                                 MIKE
                        Not physically, no. But she can be 
                        mean as hell, and she’s a textbook 
                        narcissist. She had affairs with a 
                        bunch of my teachers, and she was 
                        always in and out of the hospital 
                        with diseases she invented.

                                 ELAINE
                        My father died when I was young, 
                        too. I was nine, and it was like he 
                        took all the happiness with him. 

                                 MIKE
                        Are you trying to one-up me on 
                        tragedy?

                                 ELAINE
                        You survived Nazi Germany. You win 
                        forever. But you don’t have a 
                        monopoly on terrible mothers.

                                 MIKE
                        I just -- I’ve always been the 
                        friendless little bald kid. This is 
                        the first time in my life I’ve had 
                        anything good.

                                 ELAINE
                        Am I a good thing?

                                 MIKE
                        Yes.
                                 ELAINE
                             (dry)
                        This is very exciting. I’ve never 
                        been a good thing before.

           He kisses her. 

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        You wanna know a real secret?

                                 MIKE
                        What?

                                 ELAINE
                        I have a kid.

                                 MIKE
                             (genuinely surprised)
                        You ... what?

                                 ELAINE
                        She’s six. She lives with my mother 
                        in Los Angeles. Her name is 
                        Jeannie. She hates me.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sure that’s not true--

                                 ELAINE
                        She doesn’t know me. I wanted out 
                        of my mother’s house so bad, and 
                        the only way I knew how was to get 
                        married. But I wasn’t very good at 
                        it, and Marv was worse. So I 
                        bolted. I moved here, started 
                        auditing classes, met Paul. I only 
                        wish I’d done it before -- you 
                        know.

                                 MIKE
                        I get it.

                                 ELAINE
                        See, I’m way weirder than you.

                                 MIKE
                        Maybe.

                                 ELAINE
                        Are you done being neurotic now?

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not sure I’ll ever be done 
                        being neurotic.
                                 ELAINE
                        Well, could you try to be done long 
                        enough to take me to bed?

           He considers her a moment, sets the beer can aside. But 
           instead of taking her to bed, he tackles her here, pressing 
           her into the couch while she laughs.

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

           Mike, with Barbara, watches Shelley and Elaine perform a 
           telephone routine, but he’s not really hearing it. The 
           audience, at least, is finding it very funny.

                                 BARBARA
                        You look upset.

                                 MIKE
                        I was just thinking -- she’s good 
                        with everyone, and I’m only good 
                        with her.

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           All the Compass Players are sitting around a table. Mike 
           keeps trying to keep Elaine’s focus.

                                 MIKE
                        I want to do like a bored Princess 
                        Margaret thing.

                                 ELAINE
                        What’s that?

                                 MIKE
                        You know, because her husband is 
                        such a loser. I’ll play the 
                        husband.

                                 ELAINE
                        I have no idea what you’re talking 
                        about.

                                 MIKE
                        The queen’s sister. And her 
                        husband, Tony Whatshisname.

                                 ELAINE
                        Elizabeth.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s the queen. The sister.
                                 ELAINE
                             (shrugs)
                        I only read plays.

           David stands, raises a glass.

                                 DAVID
                        To The Compass’s first profitable 
                        week.

           Everybody cheers.

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

           Mike and Elaine are back in their seats onstage, the 
           teenagers in the car.

                                 ELAINE
                        Have you noticed the lake at all? I 
                        mean, it’s just -- suicidally 
                        beautiful tonight.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. It’s OK. It’s really OK.

                                 ELAINE
                             (noticing)
                        Oh. There is a full moon.

           She takes a drag off her cigarette as he looks at the “moon.”

                                 MIKE
                        Son of a gun.

           He goes in for the kiss. She doesn’t respond. After a beat, 
           she EXHALES HER CIGARETTE SMOKE out of the side of her mouth, 
           toward the audience, who LAUGHS uproariously.

           He tries to suppress a COUGH, but ends up just laughing into 
           her mouth. This just makes the audience laugh more.

           Their hands get TANGLED between their bodies as they try to 
           keep their cigarettes lit while feeling each other up. It 
           ends with her left ARM pressed between them, passing her 
           cigarette off to her right hand, free.

           He NOTICES, breaks for just a second.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.

                                 ELAINE
                        My fault.
           They go BACK IN, hands righted, with enthusiasm, to much 
           laughter. Finally, Elaine pulls away.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Do you think you’re gonna go to 
                        college when you get out of high 
                        school?

           More laughter.

           INT. ELAINE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Middle of the night. Mike is asleep in Elaine’s bed. She is 
           awake, watching him, fretting.

           She taps him on the shoulder. Nothing. Shakes him gently. 
           Nothing. Finally, elbows him in the ribs -- he turns over 
           with a start.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah?

                                 ELAINE
                        I think I’m in love with you.

                                 MIKE
                        OK, honey. Let’s talk about it in 
                        the morning.
                             (a beat)
                        Wait, what?

                                 ELAINE
                        I know. It’s so stupid.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s not stupid. Nothing you say is 
                        stupid. You’re the smartest person 
                        I’ve ever seen in real life.

                                 ELAINE
                        What?

                                 MIKE
                        I mean, presumably Socrates was 
                        smarter than you are. Bach, 
                        probably. James Madison, maybe. But 
                        I’ve definitely never been to bed 
                        with any of them.

           He yawns.
                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        This is where you say I’m the 
                        smartest person you’ve ever seen in 
                        real life.

                                 ELAINE
                        You’re the smartest person I’ve 
                        ever seen in real life.

           For the first time he notices how tense she is--

                                 MIKE
                        What’s wrong? Why are you lying 
                        like that?

                                 ELAINE
                        Like what?

                                 MIKE
                        Like you’ve got rigor mortis.

                                 ELAINE
                        Because you’re the smartest person 
                        I’ve ever known, and I’m ... this 
                        is real.

                                 MIKE
                        What do you want? You wanna get 
                        married?

                                 ELAINE
                             (alarmed)
                        This is way too serious for 
                        marriage.

           He laughs--

                                 MIKE
                        OK.

                                 ELAINE
                        We have to stop sleeping together.

           --and stops laughing.

                                 MIKE
                        What?

                                 ELAINE
                        We have to stop sleeping together. 
                        We have to work, we have to--

                                 MIKE
                        Is this about my hair?
                                 ELAINE
                        God no.

                                 MIKE
                        Are you sure?

           She climbs over and onto him now, kissing his lips and face.

                                 ELAINE
                        Yes, oh my God, yes. We have no 
                        money. We have no jobs. We’re never 
                        going to be doctors. I have a kid 
                        who doesn’t know me. This is what I 
                        have. This is what I’m good at.

           She gets emotional.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        I cannot fuck this up.

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t plan on fucking this up.

                                 ELAINE
                        I will, though. I’ll be mean to 
                        you.

                                 MIKE
                        I haven’t minded that so far.

                                 ELAINE
                        I’ll be meaner to you.

           Mike rubs his eyes.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s too late for me to come up 
                        with convincing arguments for why 
                        you’re ten packs of crazy. I mean, 
                        this is good, right?

                                 ELAINE
                        So good.

                                 MIKE
                        And we’re in love?

                                 ELAINE
                        Well, I just said I’m in love with 
                        you. I don’t know where you’re at--

                                 MIKE
                        Yes, you psychopath. I’m in love 
                        with you.
                                 ELAINE
                        OK, so ... yes.

                                 MIKE
                        And you want to stop?

                                 ELAINE
                        Yes.

                                 MIKE
                        You’re fucking crazy.

                                 ELAINE
                        Still. You’re not gonna win this 
                        one.

           He thinks a beat.

                                 MIKE
                        I take back what I said about you 
                        being the smartest person I know.

                                 ELAINE
                        No, you don’t.

           She kisses him again. And falls asleep, leaving him awake.

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           A title card reads ONE YEAR LATER.

           Stoic, the backs of two heads -- a bride and groom -- as a 
           PASTOR performs a marriage. 

                                 PASTOR
                        ...do you come here freely and 
                        without reservation to give 
                        yourself to Michael in marriage? If 
                        so, say “I do.”

           And we realize the bride is a stranger -- PAT SCOT, 26. She 
           smiles, laughs briefly. 

                                 PAT
                        I do.

           In the CONGREGATION, Elaine and Paul sit politely.

                                 ELAINE
                        This is a beautiful first wedding.

                                 PASTOR
                        ...give yourself to Patricia in 
                        marriage? If so, say “I do.”
                                 MIKE
                        I do.

           And so Mike is married. Everyone claps.

           EXT. CHURCHYARD - MINUTES LATER

           Elaine and Paul wait in the receiving line. Elaine greets 
           Mike first -- friendly, a cheek kiss -- and then his bride.

                                 ELAINE
                        Best wishes.

                                 PAT
                        Thank you, Elaine. Your dress is 
                        beautiful.

                                 ELAINE
                        It was on sale.

           INT. DANCE HALL - LATER

           As dancing is underway at the Nichols-Scot wedding, Paul 
           slips into the seat beside Elaine.

                                 PAUL
                        So I need to ask you something 
                        serious. And this might be a bad 
                        time, and I’m not sure how you’ll 
                        react, so I’m just going to say it 
                        and then we can move on from there.

                                 ELAINE
                        OK...

                                 PAUL
                        We’re setting up a satellite 
                        company. Ted, Severn, and some 
                        other guys -- I want you to go, if 
                        you want to. 

                                 ELAINE
                        Where? Please say Paris.

                                 PAUL
                        St. Louis.

                                 ELAINE
                        Ah, the Paris of Missouri.
                                 PAUL
                        We have a ten-week deal at the 
                        Crystal Palace with the possibility 
                        for more in success. It’s a huge 
                        headlining opportunity for you.

                                 ELAINE
                        Mike’s never gonna go for it.

           They glance at Mike, dancing with his new bride.

                                 PAUL
                        You could go solo. They’ll give you 
                        top billing, even on your own.

                                 ELAINE
                        No, I couldn’t do that. I won’t.

                                 PAUL
                        You wanna at least talk to him 
                        about it?

                                 ELAINE
                        Sure, but look at him. He just 
                        bought a house in Hyde Park -- he’s 
                        never gonna go for it.

           EXT. ST. LOUIS - DAY

           Mike drives across the Mississippi River, as Elaine, riding 
           shotgun, looks out at the St. Louis skyline.

           INT. WESTMINSTER PLACE HOUSE - DAY

           Mike and Elaine carry their suitcases into the boarding house 
           where the company lives.

                                 MIKE
                        Hello?

           SEVERN DARDEN (28), gangly and goofy, is the first to greet 
           them.

                                 SEVERN
                        Hello! We’re so glad you’re here.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m Mike, and this is Elaine.

                                 SEVERN
                        Of course, of course. Come in. 

           He offers an awkward hand.
                                 SEVERN (CONT’D)
                        I’m Severn--

           They enter the cozy living room, mismatched furniture 
           arranged around a card table. DEL CLOSE (23), NANCY PONDER 
           (25), and TED FLICKER (28) are waiting.

                                 SEVERN (CONT’D)
                             (pointing)
                        And here’s Del, and Nancy, and Ted.

           All greet them with enthusiasm.

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry to interrupt your card game.

                                 TED
                        Not at all -- please join us. 

                                 NANCY
                        If you’re not too tired from the 
                        drive.

           Elaine takes off her coat, excited to see new faces.

                           MIKE
           Yeah, I’m afraid I’m beat.
                                                         ELAINE
                                              It wasn’t too bad, actually. 
                                              We stopped to eat in 
                                              Springfield.

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry--

                                 ELAINE
                        He did most of the driving. Go on 
                        up, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        No, no, I’m fine. What are we 
                        playing?

                                 NANCY
                        Canasta. Elaine, you can play with 
                        the boys, and Mike, you can play 
                        with me and Sev.

                                 SEVERN
                        I’m sorry, am I not a boy?

                                 NANCY
                        You’re all man, darling.

           Elaine jumps into the game. Mike, more reluctant, takes the 
           seat beside her. 
                                 ELAINE
                        I haven’t played this since I was a 
                        kid -- is this the one with melds?

                                 TED
                        Yeah, everything’s legal except 
                        threes.

                                 ELAINE
                        Right right right.

           Ted deals everyone in. Mike leans in and whispers--

                                 MIKE
                        What the fuck is happening?

                                 ELAINE
                        Everything is legal except threes.

                                 SEVERN
                        I’ve seen the Chicago Compass -- 
                        you guys are so funny.

                                 MIKE
                        Thank you.

                                 SEVERN
                        The teenagers in the car? 
                        Hilarious. “I would respect you 
                        like crazy.”

                                 ELAINE
                        Thank you.

                                 DEL
                        I think you’ll both fit in well 
                        here. We’re all kind of avant 
                        garde, we don’t like to do the same 
                        sketch more than once. 

                                 SEVERN
                        Don’t let that make you nervous -- 
                        I know Chicago relied on repeatable 
                        bits, and we get it.

                                 MIKE
                        I wouldn’t call it “repeatable 
                        bits” so much as polishing and--

                                 DEL
                        Improvisation is so much more than 
                        just a tool to create performance 
                        material. Improvisation can be a 
                        performance in itself.
                                 ELAINE
                        I completely agree.

                                 TED
                        We like to think of ourselves as a 
                        circus. We draw on everything from 
                        Dostoyevski to the Warren Court to 
                        Ed Sullivan censoring Elvis’s hips.

                                 NANCY
                        Selfishly, I’m just so relieved to 
                        have another girl in town. I’ve 
                        been alone with these doofuses for 
                        too long.

           Elaine is excited by this.

                                 ELAINE
                        Yes! I’m really interested in, 
                        like, a “women of Cosa Nostra” 
                        thing. Anastasia’s mother-in-law -- 
                        what is that like?

                                 NANCY
                        Totally, totally.

                                 MIKE
                        Elaine and I thought of a bit on 
                        the drive down we’d like to work 
                        up. A husband who’s annoyed with 
                        his wife’s snoring.

                                 ELAINE
                             (dismissive)
                        He thinks I snore.

                                 MIKE
                        You do snore.

                                 NANCY
                        That reminds me -- we only have one 
                        room left upstairs. Are you all 
                        right with sharing?

           Elaine waves off Nancy’s concern.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, we’re fine.

                        Last night, we did “My Fair Lady” 
                        in the style of T.S. Eliot. It was 
                        hilarious.
           Mike rolls his eyes -- ugh, the pretention of this douche -- 
           as Severn deals another hand.

           INT. CRYSTAL PALACE - NIGHT

           The St. Louis company is doing a bit in formalwear that’s 
           getting moderate laughs.

                                 ELAINE
                        Oh, Fernando, I’m so worried we’ll 
                        run into Henrietta and Albert at 
                        this party.

                                 ELAINE
                        Fernando, my ex-husband and your ex-
                        wife have taken up with each other. 
                        It will always be uncomfortable.

                                 DEL
                        Please try to be nice.

                        I’m always nice. I can’t believe 
                        you’d suggest I have to try to be 
                        nice.

           Nancy enters. A hush falls.

                                 NANCY
                        Hello, Cecelia. You look lovely.

                                 ELAINE
                        Hello, Henrietta. You look like a 
                        raisin.

           Mike is backstage, the last to go on. He tugs on his white 
           gloves, watching Elaine do her rich lady act in a fur stole, 
           hating everything.

           INT. WESTMINSTER PLACE BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mike and Elaine sit cross-legged in pajamas, facing each 
           other on the bed. They are flicking a paper ball back and 
           forth, keeping score in a way only they understand.

                                 ELAINE
                        It’s 20-18 in the Paper Ball 
                        Flicking World Championship.

                        Mike Nichols of East Germany has 
                        made it all the way to the finals, 
                        and this could be match point.

                                 MIKE
                        Stop distracting me.

                        His opponent, the reigning world 
                        champion, Iva Greengrass of New 
                        Zealand, refuses to quit.

           He shoots, he scores, he celebrates, mildly.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        And East Germany takes home its 
                        first gold medal in paper ball 
                        flicking!

           She takes off her necklace and puts it on Mike.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Does the victor have a comment for 
                        the people back home?

                                 MIKE
                        Rematch?

           She drops the act but picks up the paper ball. They continue 
           playing over--

                                 ELAINE
                        What’s gotten into you lately?

                                 MIKE
                        Nothing, I just -- what if this 
                        doesn’t work out?

                                 ELAINE
                        Don’t be stupid. Of course it’s 
                        going to work out.

                                 MIKE
                        But if it doesn’t? We can barely 
                        afford one room in St. Louis.

                                 ELAINE
                        We’ll go back to Chicago, or try 
                        New York. Or maybe it’ll be time to 
                        get real jobs.

           She fakes a gasp.

                        I’ll write greeting cards and you 
                        can teach worrying at Northwestern.

           There’s a knock at the door. Elaine gets up to answer it.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        The Slovenian judge has requested a 
                        timeout.

           It’s Pat at the door -- both women are SURPRISED.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Pat.

           Mike JUMPS UP to greet her. Kisses his wife. 

                                 MIKE
                        Hi, honey.

           He watches Pat’s eyes drift to ELAINE’S NECKLACE, his 
           makeshift gold medal.

           Mike takes off the necklace, hands it back to Elaine. But the 
           damage is done. And now it’s awkward as hell.

                                 PAT

                        Elaine. You’ve been here a month, I 
                        think he’s said about fifteen words 
                        to me. And twelve of ‘em have been 
                        variations on “fuck you.”

                        When Mike first got to New York, 
                        his father had no idea what to do 
                        with two little kids. So he found 
                        another refugee family to take the 
                        boys while he set up his medical 
                        practice. These fuckers would kiss 
                        their own children good night, then 
                        shake Mike’s hand. He was seven. 
                        So, yeah, the first English words 
                        he learned were harsh ones. His 
                        instinct is cruelty. But he’s not a 
                        cruel person.

                        Don’t mind Del. He’s a terrible 
                        prick.

                        Gloucester was hilarious. James

                        Care to elaborate on that eyeroll?

                        Anyone who thinks Shakespeare is 
                        hilarious, or romantic, or terribly 
                        moving is a liar. “What man art 
                        thou that thus bescreen'd in night 
                        so stumblest on my counsel?” I

                        bushes?”

                        I know what it means. But I’m 
                        interested in how human beings talk

                        But we only talk to each other the 
                        way we talk to each other because 
                        Shakespeare invented something like 
                        2,000 of our words.

                                 MIKE
                        I paid a fortune to see Olivier do 
                        Macbeth. Couldn’t get them at the 
                        box office, so I found a guy who 
                        could get them through some other 
                        guy. I showed up and --

                        It was the understudy. It was 
                        Olivier’s night off. 
                             (to Elaine)
                        Seriously, you’re going right to 
                        hell.

           frankly.

                                 MIKE

                        it, it’s insane here. We may be

                        It might be nice, you know. Maybe 
                        we could open our own little club -- 
                        you could do scenes, I could sing. 
                        We could have a baby... We could be

                        down, and we can talk later.

           This only infuriates her more, and she CHUCKS THE SCISSORS AT 
           THE WALL, STABBING THEM INTO THE PLASTER. He regards them for 
           a second, doesn’t look at her, and LEAVES.

                        Well, this is a law firm. Most 
                        everyone here is an attorney. I’m 
                        an attorney -- I work upstairs in 
                        mergers and acquisitions. I’m new.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, no. I got invited by a girl who 
                        works in the copy room.

                                 DEL
                        Linda?

                                 MIKE
                        No.

           The scene is so boring, the audience is confused and yawning. 
           Del is furious with Mike, trying to get anything out of him.

                        Veronica. The tall lady.

           Del nods thoughtfully.

                                 DEL
                        I don’t know her.

           INT. WESTMINSTER PLACE BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

           The St. Louis cast enters together, after a rough night.

                                 DEL
                        Well, that was fun.

           Everybody groans.

                                 ELAINE
                        Can it, Del.

                                 DEL
                        No. Tonight was awful. What are we 
                        going to do tomorrow?

                                 TED
                        We’re going to shake tonight off 
                        and start again tomorrow. We’ve had 
                        off nights before.
                                 DEL
                        Come on, Ted. We’ve been “off” for 
                        weeks. This isn’t working. I can’t 
                        be in scenes with him anymore. I 
                        won’t.

                        Let’s do something different 
                        tomorrow night. Like one of the old 
                        Compass improvised plays. What’s 
                        that one...?

           No.
                                              No.

                        Sorry.

                        The wife cheats on her husband with 
                        his best friend. We’ve done it a 
                        hundred times, and it never 
                        resolved any fights, if you know 
                        what I mean.

                                 MIKE
                        Who said there were any fights to 
                        resolve?

                                 ELAINE

                                 MIKE
                        What?

                                 DEL
                        Oh my God, you are such a petulant 
                        little baby.

                                 MIKE
                        Me?!

                                 DEL
                        Yes, you. I don’t know what your 
                        problem is -- are you jealous that 
                        I’m more talented than you are, or 
                        that I’m sleeping with Elaine?
                                 MIKE
                        Please. You are an afterthought. 
                        You are a footnote. You are like a 
                        flea, and I’m sure everything about 
                        you is proportional.

                                 ELAINE
                        OK, that’s enough--

                        That’s fine. “You are not worth 
                        another word, else I’d call you

                        suck his dick?

           Mike uses this as his exit, storming upstairs.

                        You gotta do something about that 
                        guy, Sev.

           Severn isn’t sure.

                                 SEVERN
                        Yeah...

           He starts to follow Mike, but Elaine stops him.

                                 ELAINE
                        I got it.

           Del seethes as he watches her go.

           INT. WESTMINSTER PLACE HOUSE - MIKE AND ELAINE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Elaine knocks on the door, doesn’t wait for an answer before 
           entering. Mike’s sitting on the floor against the bed.
                                 ELAINE
                        Technically this is still my room 
                        too.

                                 MIKE
                        What do you want?

                                 ELAINE
                        I want you to knock it off. You’ve 
                        been sullen and mean for weeks.

                                 MIKE
                        If you came in here to try to make 
                        me feel better, you’re doing a 
                        pretty bad job of it.

                                 ELAINE
                        I don’t care how you feel.

           But she sits down beside him on the floor.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s not true.

                                 ELAINE
                             (relenting)
                        No, it’s not true. What’s going on 
                        with you?

                                 MIKE
                        Your boyfriend is a prick.

                                 ELAINE
                             (not buying it)
                        I know that. Try again.

                                 MIKE
                        I miss Chicago. I miss David and 
                        Paul and the rules.

                                 ELAINE
                        I know, you need structure.

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t say it like that -- like I’m 
                        being unreasonable. I didn’t move 
                        to St. Louis to do commedia with 
                        Del Close and get divorced. I came 
                        for you.

                                 ELAINE
                        Well, I came for something new. I 
                        came to be challenged. And you are 
                        not challenging me.
                                 MIKE
                        I can’t be who you want me to be. 
                        This is the same problem we had in 
                        Chicago when you said you were in 
                        [love with me]--

                                 ELAINE
                        It’s not the same. 

                                 MIKE
                        Fine, whatever. The bottom line is 
                        you can’t commit to an act.

                                 ELAINE
                        We’re part of a company, Michael!

                                 MIKE
                        We don’t have to be. They need us a 
                        hell of a lot more than we need 
                        them.

                                 ELAINE
                        No one needs you.

           She takes a beat, realizes how harsh that was.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry--

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t be. It’s true. You’ve always 
                        been the brilliant one, and I’ve 
                        always been the puppy, nipping at 
                        your heels. 

                                 ELAINE
                        Oh, brother. Enough with the pity 
                        party. You’re getting divorced. So 
                        what? You hold onto tragedy like 
                        it’s the throughline of your life. 

                                 MIKE
                        It might be.

                                 ELAINE
                        It doesn’t have to be. You have to 
                        get it together, or--

                                 MIKE
                        Or what? You’ll leave? You’ll kick 
                        me out of Compass? What?
                                 ELAINE
                        I don’t know, but something’s got 
                        to change.

           The uncertainty hangs for a second, and Elaine changes the 
           subject.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to see something cute?

           She pulls an envelope out of her pocket -- inside is a WALLET-
           SIZED PHOTOGRAPH of a nine-year-old girl. On the photograph 
           is printed: “JEANNIE BERLIN, GRADE 4.” It is very cute.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Her fourth-grade picture.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, that’s undeniably cute.

                                 ELAINE
                        She has my eyes, don’t you think?

                                 MIKE
                        Why does it say “Berlin”?

                                 ELAINE
                        I think, you know, because she’s 
                        with my mother. Easier.

                                 MIKE
                             (unconvinced)
                        Sure.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - ST. LOUIS - DAY

           Elaine considers the rotary phone. Dials. Each number is a 
           decision. Finally, it rings.

                                 ELAINE
                        Hi, David, it’s Elaine.
                             (beat)
                        I’m all right. Listen --

           She gathers her thoughts carefully.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got to fire Mike.

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

           Severn and Mike sit in the empty theater. Mike is happy to 
           see David is down from Chicago.
                                 MIKE
                        David Shepherd! Nobody told me you 
                        were coming down! What a nice 
                        surprise!

                                 DAVID
                        Hello, Mike. Have a seat.

                                 MIKE
                        What’s happening? How are the New 
                        York plans coming along?

                                 DAVID
                        Fine, fine.

           And now Mike senses what’s about to happen--

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Listen.

                                 MIKE
                        Fuck.

                                 DAVID
                        You know how much I respect you, 
                        but we just can’t keep you. Morale 
                        is low, Del doesn’t even want to be 
                        in the same room as you. I know 
                        Elaine’s not happy. I’m sorry, 
                        Mike. This is your last night.

           Off Mike, surprised and hurt--

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

           Mike and Elaine are still the fucking best, performing a 
           sketch where he, a doctor, and she, a nurse, are OPERATING on 
           an invisible patient.

                                 MIKE
                        Scalpel.

                                 ELAINE
                        Scalpel.

                                 MIKE
                        Gauze.

                                 ELAINE
                        Gauze.

                                 MIKE
                        More gauze.
                                 ELAINE
                        More gauze.

                                 MIKE
                        More gauze.

                                 ELAINE
                        More gauze.

                                 MIKE
                        Little more gauze.

                                 ELAINE
                        We don’t have any more gauze.

                                 MIKE
                        That’s all the gauze?

                                 ELAINE
                        Yeah. I don’t know what happened -- 
                        we had a small roll of gauze.

                                 MIKE
                        Give me a sponge.

                                 ELAINE
                        Sponge.

                                 MIKE
                        Clamp.

                                 ELAINE
                        You have the clamp.

                                 MIKE
                        Suture.

                                 ELAINE
                        You have the suture.

                                 MIKE
                        Edith?

                                 ELAINE
                        Yes?

                                 MIKE
                        I love you.

                                 ELAINE
                        Please -- please.

                                 MIKE
                        Sponge.
                                 ELAINE
                        You have the sponge.

                                 MIKE
                        Give me another sponge -- I want 
                        two sponges.

           INT. THEATER - BACKSTAGE - LATER

           Still in their masks--

                                 MIKE
                        They fired me.

                                 ELAINE
                        What?

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t act surprised. I know you had 
                        something to do with it. And the 
                        thing of it is, I can’t even blame 
                        you. I just can’t believe you went 
                        through with it.

                                 ELAINE
                        I hope our paths cross again...

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t. Don’t act like we’re 
                        colleagues. Jesus, Elaine, we sleep 
                        in the same bed.

                                 ELAINE
                        I don’t know what to say. I really 
                        do wish you all the best.

                                 MIKE
                        Fuck you.

           He storms off. She pulls her mask off, and cries.

           Mike and Elaine live separately, for a grand total of about 
           two weeks: 

           --Elaine moves half-heartedly through a dance sequence with 
           Del and Severn.

           --Mike walks down Fifth Avenue, the Empire State Building in 
           the distance, pulls his coat tighter around him.

           --Elaine slips out of Del’s bed while he sleeps, goes back to 
           her own room. Pat’s scissor wound is still in the wall.

           --Mike enters a building -- the STRASBERG INSTITUTE.
           INT. MIKE’S NEW YORK APARTMENT - DAY

           Mike has a small, bare apartment on the Upper East Side. One 
           of the few things he has is a phone. And he’s dialing it 
           while pacing.

           It’s Severn, in St. Louis, who answers.

                                 SEVERN
                        Hello?

                                 MIKE
                        Hello, Sev? Is Elaine there?

                                 SEVERN
                             (surprised)
                        Mike?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. Can you get Elaine, please?

                                 SEVERN
                        Sure.

           Mike paces while he waits. Is this a stupid idea?

           Elaine is maybe still pissed, but she answers anyway, curious 
           if nothing else.

                                 ELAINE
                        Hello?

                                 MIKE
                        How much money do you have?

                                 ELAINE
                        Umm, hi.

                                 MIKE
                        How much money do you have? The 
                        thing is, I got this audition for a 
                        talent agent, a real one. I’ve been 
                        going over it in my head all day, 
                        and if I go in alone, I won’t get 
                        it. I’m useless without you. You 
                        said you wanted a challenge. Well, 
                        here it is, Elaine.

                                 ELAINE
                        Who is this?

           He knows she’s joking, considers it a win.
                                 MIKE
                        Get on a plane. 

           He’s laid down all his cards. Elaine looks around, surveys 
           what she has. Like Del, popping his head in, clueless--

                                 DEL
                        Hey -- I’m trying to convince Ted 
                        to go down to the Cathedral and 
                        perform Hamlet from memory, as much 
                        as we can. You in?

                                 ELAINE
                        One second.
                             (to Mike)
                        I’m in.

           And off Mike’s surprise and relief--

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

           Mike and Elaine walk through midtown Manhattan, fighting the 
           wind.

                                 ELAINE
                        Who are we meeting again?

                                 MIKE
                        My friend Julie -- her husband, 
                        Charlie has this old friend who’s a 
                        talent agent. He’s got ins with all 
                        the big nightclubs.

           INT. RUSSIAN TEA ROOM - DAY

           Mike holds the door for Elaine, then reaches for her coat.

                                 MIKE
                        Let me help you with that.

           She does, but--

                                 ELAINE
                        You don’t have to be nice to me. 
                        You have every right to be mad.

                                 MIKE
                        Can we just add the last month to 
                        the list of things we pretend never 
                        happened?

           Elaine is slightly taken aback, but nods.

           Mike approaches the hostess.
                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        We’re meeting Mr. Jack Rollins?

                                 HOSTESS
                        Right this way.

                                 ELAINE
                             (under her breath)
                        I only have like nine dollars in my 
                        pocketbook.

           They push into the DINING ROOM and are greeted at their table 
           by JACK ROLLINS (43), the kind of guy who smoked cigars like 
           a chimney and still lived to 100.

                                 JACK
                        Hello, you must be Michael.

                                 MIKE
                        Yes, hello -- this is my partner, 
                        Elaine.

                                 JACK
                        Hiya, sweetheart. Have a seat, show 
                        me what you got.

           They sit, too stupid to be nervous.

                                 ELAINE
                        Give us an opening line and a 
                        closing line, and we’ll improvise 
                        to it.

                                 JACK
                        An opening line? Like what?

                                 MIKE
                        Anything you can think of -- as 
                        outlandish or banal as you like. 
                        We’ll build a scene, on the spot, 
                        around those lines.

                                 JACK
                        All right.

           He considers, then throws out--

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        “Merry Christmas.” And, uh, “Don’t 
                        be a stranger.”

                                 MIKE
                        Very well.
           Mike takes a beat, a last look at Elaine, then starts, 
           picking up an imaginary phone. She follows suit--

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Merry Christmas, Sally.

                                 ELAINE
                        Well, hello, Merry Christmas to you 
                        too, George. 

                                 MIKE
                        I meant to call you last week, but 
                        I was out of town. The whole 
                        holiday thing was so crazy.

                                 ELAINE
                        Oh, I imagine.

                                 MIKE
                        Have you had your baby yet?

                                 ELAINE
                        Mm-hmm, last Tuesday.

                                 MIKE
                        What was it -- a boy or a girl?

                                 ELAINE
                        Oh, well, gee, I’m really not sure. 
                        There’ve been so many calls, 
                        correspondence and everything, that 
                        I really haven’t had much of a 
                        chance to check.

                                 MIKE
                        But that’s wonderful. You must be 
                        very excited.

                                 ELAINE
                        Oh, yes I am. I really am. Oh, was 
                        I a mess -- my hair! I haven’t 
                        gotten to the beauty parlor or 
                        anything. How was your trip?

                                 MIKE
                        Fine. I wanted to write you, but 
                        there’s no mail from Cuba right 
                        now.

                                 ELAINE
                        Oh, I know, and you’ve been running 
                        around so much. Before Cuba, where 
                        was it?
                                 MIKE
                        Tanganyika.

           Jack chortles.

                                 ELAINE
                        Well, I would love to have you come 
                        by next time you’re in town. Your 
                        room is just the way it always was. 
                        Your mother comes over all the time 
                        and asks for you.

                                 MIKE
                        Has she been a pain?

                                 ELAINE
                        Well, you know mother-in-laws, 
                        they’re always a little bit of a 
                        pain, but she’s a sweet lady, and I 
                        imagine she’ll be a big help now.

                                 MIKE
                        Well, I have a couple days in town. 
                        I’ll come by.

                                 ELAINE
                        Please do, George. Don’t be a 
                        stranger.

           Jack laughs heartily, as Mike and Elaine drop the act.

                                 JACK
                        You practiced that. 

                                 MIKE
                        We really didn’t. We use 
                        improvisation to build our 
                        material. We have a repertoire of 
                        scenes and characters honed through 
                        improvisational work.

                                 ELAINE
                        We’re constantly creating new 
                        scenes, new ideas. We don’t write 
                        anything down, because nothing is 
                        ever quite the same twice in a row.

                                 JACK
                        I gotta go call my wife. 

           He moves to get up, leaving Mike and Elaine confused.
                                 MIKE
                        Well, thank you for your time, 
                        sir...

                                 JACK
                        The girl’s gonna need a new dress. 
                        Jane’ll take you to Macy’s. You, 
                        sonny, I’ll buy you a new shirt.

           He calls across the room--

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Marty -- can you get me a 
                        phone over here?

           --then turns back to Mike and Elaine.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        I gotta be honest -- I’ve never 
                        seen anything like that before. I’m 
                        not entirely sure what to do with 
                        you. Nightclubs, to start. I think 
                        I can get you in at the Blue Angel.

                                 ELAINE
                        Seriously?

                                 JACK
                        Well, I can get you an audition 
                        with Max Gordon -- he’ll love ya.

           Mike and Elaine are a little bit dumbfounded.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Smile, kids. We’re all going to be 
                        rich. And eat a blinchik -- aren’t 
                        you hungry?

           INT. BLUE ANGEL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Backstage, a full house out front. Mike is in a shirt and 
           bowtie (and a new wig), and Elaine is in a dress she didn’t 
           buy herself. They sit on a BENCH behind a red curtain.

                                 ELAINE
                        Are you nervous?

                                 MIKE
                             (lying)
                        No, strangely. You?

                                 ELAINE
                             (dry)
                        Terrified.
           He gives her a cigarette and lights it. The EMCEE gives them 
           a thumbs-up, then pushes through the CURTAIN. Mike and Elaine 
           can hear him announce--

                                 EMCEE
                        And now, making their New York 
                        debut, right here at the Blue 
                        Angel, the comedy team of Nichols 
                        and May.

           The curtains open, and Mike and Elaine start doing 
           “Teenagers.” He yawns and reaches an arm around her.

                                 ELAINE
                        Do you think you’re gonna go to 
                        college when you get out of high 
                        school?

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           As the scene progresses, we PIVOT to a table in the back, 
           where Jack is smoking and drinking with MAX GORDON (40s), the 
           owner of the club, and his wife, LORRAINE (40s). 

                                 MIKE
                        See, uh, this is the thing -- I 
                        only get the car once a week.

                                 ELAINE
                        Oh, well, that’s all right! I think 
                        if a girl likes a boy, she’ll ride 
                        on the bus!

           The audience laughs. Max is stoic, but Lorraine is EATING IT 
           UP.

                                 MAX
                        Quiet, Lorraine -- if you keep that 
                        up, Jack’s gonna charge me a 
                        fortune.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT

           Mike and Elaine head toward the Blue Angel for a performance. 
           They pass the WILL CALL LINE, a few people waiting patiently 
           for the show to start. They push into--

           INT. BLUE ANGEL NIGHTCLUB - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           --where a glamorous young singer is fixing her hair.

                                 MIKE
                        This is not Compass.
                                 ELAINE
                        No, it’s not...

           Jack is waiting for them in their dressing room.

                                 JACK
                        Good, you’re here.

                                 ELAINE
                        Hi, Jack.

                                 JACK
                        I got news. Omnibus is doing a 
                        revue next Sunday -- they were 
                        looking around for highbrow comedy. 
                        I told ‘em I got just what they 
                        need.

                                 MIKE
                             (instantly overwhelmed)
                        Television? 

                                 ELAINE
                        We can’t condense our act into a 
                        three-minute segment -- it’s not 
                        enough time to get anything going.

                                 JACK
                        That’s the thing -- I got you two 
                        eight-minute blocks, unedited. Look 
                        happy, kiddos. Omnibus isn’t 
                        exactly slaughtering the ratings, 
                        but they’re getting a 21 share. 
                        It’s a start.

                                 MIKE
                        No, it’s just -- we don’t usually 
                        rehearse. Television seems like 
                        something you should rehearse for.

                                 JACK
                        I’m telling you -- just do your 
                        thing, and you’ll be fine.

           INT. RCA BUILDING - 30 ROCKEFELLER CENTER - NIGHT

           LIGHTS and CAMERAS, and a STUDIO AUDIENCE, face Mike and 
           Elaine on a soundstage at Omnibus. They’re in places -- her 
           behind a desk, him ENTERING.

                                 ELAINE
                        Welcome to Longdust. Can I help 
                        you?
                                 MIKE
                        I read your ad. I’m interested in 
                        your $65 funeral.

                                 ELAINE
                        I’m terribly sorry. Can you tell 
                        me, what was the loved one’s name?

                                 MIKE
                        Seymour Maslow-Freen.

                                 ELAINE
                        Is that hyphenated?

                                 MIKE
                        It was.

           Chuckles from the STUDIO AUDIENCE.

                                 ELAINE
                        And may I ask what your name is?

                                 MIKE
                        Charlie.

                                 ELAINE
                        Charlie, I’m Miss Loomis, your 
                        grief lady.

                                 MIKE
                        Hi.

                                 ELAINE
                        Well, that will be $65.

                                 MIKE
                        I have the check all made out.

                                 ELAINE
                        Wonderful. Before you go, Mr. 
                        Maslow-Freen, I was just wondering -
                        - would you be interested in some 
                        extras for the loved one?

                                 MIKE
                        What kind of extras?

                                 ELAINE
                        Well ... how about a casket?

           More laughter -- enough that they have to pause.

                                 MIKE
                        Isn’t that included?
                                 ELAINE
                        No.

                                 MIKE
                        We have to have a casket.

                                 ELAINE
                        Yes. It looks better. We have three 
                        prices: $1,243, $768, and $14.98. 

                                 MIKE
                        May I ask, what do those prices 
                        represent?

                                 ELAINE
                        That’s mahogany, oak, and nubby 
                        plywood.

           Mike has to hide his laughter in his handkerchief.

                                 MIKE
                        Nubby plywood. Tell me, what kind 
                        of appearance does that make?

                                 ELAINE
                        Cheap.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ll take the oak.

                                 ELAINE
                        I am so sorry to intrude this way 
                        on your grief, I just wondered, can 
                        you tell me -- how did you plan on 
                        getting Mr. Maslow-Freen down here?

                                 MIKE
                        Cab?

                                 ELAINE
                        You’ll have to leave the driver an 
                        enormous tip.

                                 MIKE
                        You don’t happen to have a hearse?

                                 ELAINE
                        Yes, we do. For $35, I can give you 
                        an exquisite Cadillac Slumberwagon.

                                 MIKE
                        All right, all right. $35.
                                 ELAINE
                        This is the last -- and I am once 
                        again truly sorry -- it is my job. 
                        Had you planned at all on burying 
                        Mr. Maslow-Freen?

                                 MIKE
                        Madam, that was foremost in my 
                        mind!

                                 ELAINE
                        Do you happen to have a plot?

                                 MIKE
                        No, but I’m sure you do.

                                 ELAINE
                        Yes, we do. We have three prices: 
                        $824.46, $493.58, and $10.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m just curious -- what happens 
                        for $10?

                                 ELAINE
                        For $10, we have two men who come 
                        and take Mr. Maslow-Freen away and 
                        do God knows what.

           The laughter is uproarious, and from there we go to--

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT

           The line outside the Blue Angel WRAPS AROUND THE BLOCK as 
           Mike and Elaine try to sneak into the theater. People point 
           and cheer. Someone holds out a NEWSPAPER and a pen--

                                 ONLOOKER
                        Can you sign this, please?

           Mike takes the paper from her, notices the headline: “ELAINE 
           MAY, MIKE NICHOLS ARE TEAM WITH A FUTURE.” He scribbles his 
           signature, overwhelmed, and hands the pen off to Elaine.

                                 MIKE
                        Thank you.

           They push into the theater, breath heavy. They take a beat.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        What do we do now?
           INT. ELAINE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Elaine has a new apartment in a doorman building, barely 
           furnished. She’s nervous, anticipating the DOORBELL RINGING. 
           She answers it.

                                 ELAINE
                        Hello!

           And we pivot to see at the door -- Elaine’s mother, IDA 
           BERLIN (50s), and her daughter, JEANNIE BERLIN (9), with 
           SUITCASES. Jeannie looks down at the floor.

                                 MRS. BERLIN
                        Hello, Elaine.

                                 ELAINE
                        Hello, Mother.

                                 MRS. BERLIN
                        I saw your skit about nagging 
                        mothers on Jack Paar, and I did not 
                        like it.

                                 ELAINE
                        That was based on Michael’s mother, 
                        of course. 

                                 MRS. BERLIN
                        Oh. All right, then.

           Elaine bends down to assess Jeannie, a virtual stranger.

                                 ELAINE
                        Hi, darling. Gosh, you’re so tall! 
                        When’d you get so tall?

           Jeannie is too shy to answer, but Elaine knows -- in the 
           years it’s been since they’ve spent meaningful time together.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Come on in! I haven’t done much 
                        decorating. I thought we could do 
                        that together. Here’s the living 
                        room--

           It’s sparsely decorated, one couch facing a TV set.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        I did get one thing, just for you -- 
                        come here.

           She leads them into the dining room, where she has set up a 
           lone PING-PONG TABLE.
                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        This is technically the dining 
                        room, but I thought this would be 
                        more fun. Your grandmother told me 
                        you like table tennis.

                                 MRS. BERLIN
                             (faking enthusiasm)
                        Wow, Jeannie! Look at that! What do 
                        you say?

                                 JEANNIE
                        Thank you.

                                 ELAINE
                        Do you want to play? Look, I got a 
                        purple paddle just for you. Is 
                        purple still your favorite color?

           Jeannie shakes her head, but timidly takes the paddle anyway.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        You serve.

           Jeannie SERVES, and after a brief volley, Elaine lets it go 
           by. Jeannie is the only person Elaine would let win.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        1-0! Jeannie Brette Berlin.

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

           Mike and Elaine sit across from each other in a recording 
           booth, smoking and drinking coffee. A PRODUCER is in the next 
           room. They’re giggly.

                                 PRODUCER
                        Ready whenever you are.

                                 ELAINE
                             (to Mike, through 
                              laughter)
                        Stop laughing. This is serious.

                                 MIKE
                        Go on without me.

           This just makes her laugh harder.

                                 PRODUCER
                        Don’t worry -- if you crack up, we 
                        can splice the tape.
                                 ELAINE
                        How much tape do you have?

                                 PRODUCER
                        This is Mercury Records, kids -- 
                        we’ve got plenty.

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t freak out. It’s just a 
                        professionally recorded comedy 
                        album. They’re only going to sell 
                        it in every Woolworth’s from here 
                        to Seattle. It’s only costing the 
                        label $30 a minute to tape us 
                        giggling at each other.

                                 ELAINE
                             (still laughing)
                        Before I forget -- did your mother 
                        give you a hard time about the 
                        “Mother and Son” piece?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, but I just told her we based 
                        it on your mother.

                                 ELAINE
                        I told mine the same thing.

           Mike sobers now.

                                 MIKE
                        It really is kind of the best 
                        revenge, isn’t it?

           She nods. They can go on now.

                                 ELAINE
                        You know what I was thinking?

                                 MIKE
                        Hardly ever.

                                 ELAINE
                        And, I’m sorry, Al -- this isn’t 
                        remotely going to work for the 
                        album because I think it would have 
                        be visual --

                                 MIKE
                        What?
                                 ELAINE
                        Pirandello, “Six Characters in 
                        Search of an Author.” The 
                        deconstruction of human 
                        relationships. Where we’re playing 
                        ourselves playing other people 
                        pretending to be what they’re not.

                                 MIKE
                             (contemplative)
                        Yeah...

                                 ELAINE
                        You hear what I’m saying?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. You could do something like -- 
                        children trying to mimic their 
                        parents having a romantic 
                        conversation.

                                 ELAINE
                        Yes--

                                 MIKE
                        Which becomes the parents having 
                        the romantic conversation.

                                 ELAINE
                        Which becomes us, breaking the 
                        fourth wall, discussing the scene. 
                        It could work.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.
                             (a beat)
                        It shouldn’t be a romance. It 
                        should be a fight.

                                 PRODUCER
                        You guys want to try it?

                                 MIKE
                        Actually, I got something else. Do 
                        you mind?

                                 ELAINE
                        Not at all.

                                 PRODUCER
                        OK, rolling.

                                 MIKE
                        May I seet down?
           She smiles, recognizes what he’s going for, and follows...

                                 ELAINE
                        If you veesh.

           INT. ELAINE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           “Improvisations to Music” is a physical album. Mike holds it 
           in his hands, lowering it to the RECORD PLAYER. It CRACKLES 
           briefly, then their voices can be heard over classical piano.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Oh my God, Mommy, you’re famous.

                                 ELAINE
                        Turn it off, turn it off.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Why? This is so cool. Now, whenever 
                        I miss you, I can play this record 
                        and hear your voice.

           Elaine looks to Mike -- what a gut punch.

                                 MIKE
                        Your mom’s not going anywhere, 
                        sweetheart.

                                 JEANNIE
                        It’s OK. I know you have a big 
                        important job now. 

           INT. BLUE ANGEL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Mike and Elaine are on their knees, Elaine with a comically 
           big BOW in her hair. They pretend to be children, pretending 
           to be adults.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m going to work now at my big 
                        important job in New York City.

                                 ELAINE
                        Don’t forget to take your lunch.

                                 MIKE
                        I always remember my lunch.

                                 ELAINE
                        Well, honey, that’s just not true. 
                        I had to bring it to you at the 
                        office last week.
                                 MIKE
                        When?

                                 ELAINE
                        Thursday. It was the same day you 
                        missed Sally’s piano recital.

                                 MIKE
                        Honey, I had an important meeting 
                        with my boss, and I told you--

                                 ELAINE
                        Fine, fine. 

           We’ll cut away from this and go briefly to--

           INT. ELAINE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Jeannie hits a ping-pong ball against the wall with a paddle, 
           like mini-racquetball.

                                 ELAINE
                        It’s getting late. You have to do 
                        your homework.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Why?

                                 ELAINE
                        Because I want you to get good 
                        grades so you can go to college.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Why?

                                 ELAINE
                        Because I love you.

           Jeannie rolls her eyes.

                                 JEANNIE
                        You’re not in charge of me.

                                 ELAINE
                        I absolutely am. 

                                 JEANNIE
                        No. Grandma’s in charge of me. And 
                        Grandma doesn’t make me do my 
                        homework before dinner.

           Elaine, frustrated but powerless, leaves the room. Mrs. 
           Berlin is waiting, unintentionally surprising Elaine.
                                 ELAINE
                        Fuck, I hate it when you lurk 
                        around like that.

                                 MRS. BERLIN
                        Your language--

                                 ELAINE
                        I own this apartment, Mother.

           Then she relents, sinking down.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        I feel like I’m screwing everything 
                        up with Jeannie. She has no respect 
                        for me whatsoever.

                                 MRS. BERLIN
                        Hmm, I wonder what that feels like.

                                 ELAINE
                        That’s what scares me. I don’t want 
                        to be like you. And I don’t want 
                        her to drop out of school at 14 and 
                        get pregnant before she can drive a 
                        car. 

                                 MRS. BERLIN
                        If there’s one thing I learned, 
                        it’s that you can’t always control 
                        your children.

           But Elaine just sees this as a challenge.

           INT. BLUE ANGEL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Still pretending to be the children--

                                 MIKE
                        What is this really about? You are 
                        always yelling at me after the 
                        children go to bed--

           Elaine stands, takes the bow out of her hair.

                                 ELAINE
                        Harry. You know I know you’re 
                        having an affair with Margie.

           He stands now, too, taking on a more adult persona.

                                 MIKE
                        I most certainly am not!
                                 ELAINE
                        Oh, please. The florist called -- 
                        you accidentally charged a $40 
                        arrangement to my account. “Happy 
                        birthday to my favorite little 
                        secret.” 

                                 MIKE
                        It said, “To my favorite little 
                        secretary,” but they couldn’t fit 
                        it on the card. Because Margie is 
                        my favorite secretary. And you know 
                        Margie, she’s also, you know, not 
                        little -- it was a joke!

                                 ELAINE
                        If that’s true, that’s a very mean-
                        spirited joke.

           And we’ll leave for a minute to show--

           INT. ELAINE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           It’s Jeannie’s birthday. She blows out TEN CANDLES on a cake. 
           Elaine, Mrs. Berlin, and Mike, in party hats, clap and cheer.

                                 ELAINE
                        Here, darling, open this one.

           She hands Jeannie a carefully wrapped present, and Jeannie 
           opens it. It’s a small pink HANDBAG, embroidered with her 
           initials: JBB.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        I thought now that you’re ten, you 
                        should have a real pocketbook. And, 
                        look, it has your monogram on it.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Thank you!

           But the smile doesn’t quite reach her eyes. Mike hands 
           Jeannie a box.

                                 MIKE
                        Here’s mine.

           She rips the paper off -- it’s a BROWNIE CAMERA.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Oh my God!

                                 MIKE
                        Do you like it?
                                 JEANNIE
                        I love it! I’ve been wanting one of 
                        these for forever and ever and 
                        ever! Thank you thank you thank 
                        you!

                                 MIKE
                        There’s a few rolls of film in the 
                        bottom of the box.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Will you show me how to load it?

           As Mike helps Jeannie, Elaine can’t help but feel a little 
           dejected, a little regretful...

           INT. BLUE ANGEL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           --back to “Pirandello.”

                                 ELAINE
                        I just wish you would admit that 
                        you and Margie have had a thing 
                        going for years.

                                 MIKE
                        We haven’t --

           He throws up his hands in frustration.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Elaine, this scene is going 
                        nowhere. You’ve completely backed 
                        me into a corner.

           The audience perks up -- are they having a fight ... now?

                                 ELAINE
                        Me?! You want to blame this on me? 
                        If you would just admit to the 
                        husband’s affair, we could move on 
                        to a more interesting part of the 
                        story, but you’re intractable.

                                 MIKE
                        See, and your problem is you use 
                        words like intractable -- nobody 
                        out there knows what that means.

           He gestures to the audience.

                                 ELAINE
                        Oh, so now you’re insulting them, 
                        too? Nice, Michael.

                        People are a lot smarter than you 
                        give them credit for -- you think 
                        you’re so brilliant.

                                 MIKE
                        Well, at least I went to college.

           He turns to the audience.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Please forgive us. My partner and I 
                        have been having this minor 
                        squabble, and she--

                                 ELAINE
                        Screw this.

           She starts to walk offstage, but he stops her, grabbing her 
           arm roughly.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Michael, what do you think you’re 
                        doing?

                                 MIKE
                        I’m doing “Pirandello.”

           They take hands and bow, as the audience nervously laughs. 
           The curtain closes in front of them.

                                 ELAINE
                        We can do better.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, it’s not mean enough yet. You 
                        can really let me have it.

           He says it off-handedly, because he doesn’t realize -- this 
           will turn out to be a tremendously stupid idea.

           INT. ELAINE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Elaine answers the door to find Jack and Mike both on the 
           other side.

                                 ELAINE
                        Uh-oh. This can’t be good.

                                 JACK
                        It’s good.

                                 ELAINE
                        Did you come together, or is this a 
                        coincidence?
                                 MIKE
                        We came together, but he wouldn’t 
                        tell me what’s going on. He’s been 
                        buzzing around like a firefly since 
                        59th Street.

                                 ELAINE
                        What is it?

                                 JACK
                        I got a call late last night from 
                        Alexander Cohen, the producer. He’s 
                        got space at the Golden in the 
                        fall, and he wants to put you guys 
                        in it.

                                 MIKE
                        The Golden?

                                 JACK
                        45th and 8th. Broadway.

                                 MIKE
                        Seriously?

                                 JACK
                        Seriously.

                                 ELAINE
                        Seriously?

                                 JACK
                        Yep. Do you want me to get into the 
                        deal?

                                 ELAINE
                        Wait wait wait. Alex Cohen wants to 
                        put us on Broadway?

                                 JACK
                        It’s a smaller theater, only about 
                        800 seats. He wants to start the 
                        show late -- at 9:00.

                                 MIKE
                             (musing)
                        “An Evening With Nichols and May.”

           There’s silence for a beat. This is huge.

                                 ELAINE
                        Hey, who decided on “Nichols and 
                        May”? Why not “May and Nichols”? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELAINE (CONT'D)
                        Doesn’t it seem like it should be 
                        alphabetical?

                                 MIKE
                        Is this really what you want to 
                        [talk about right now]?

                                 ELAINE
                        No.

                                 MIKE
                        OK.

           They look at each other, considering, trying to read each 
           other’s faces. Finally, they smile.

                                 ELAINE
                        Let’s do it.

                                 JACK
                        Wonderful. I’m going to book you in 
                        some bigger theaters, maybe in 
                        Bridgeport, so you can try out 
                        material out of town, build a 
                        setlist. Get ready, kids -- you’re 
                        in the big leagues now.

           INT. AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - DAY

           Elaine walks through the prehistory exhibit with Jeannie.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Do they have penguins here?

                                 ELAINE
                        Maybe in the birds exhibit. Not 
                        live ones, though. 

                                 JEANNIE
                        Oh. Grandma took me to see the 
                        penguins once in San Diego. Have 
                        you ever seen a penguin?

                                 ELAINE
                        I can’t say that I have. Look at 
                        that woolly mammoth -- it’s huge!

           Jeannie looks -- isn’t impressed.

                                 JEANNIE
                        Yeah.
                                 ELAINE
                        Hey, uh, Jeannie? Listen. You know 
                        I love you, right?

                                 JEANNIE
                        Uh ... I guess.

                                 ELAINE
                        I’ve never, uh, I’ve never been 
                        very good at saying it. I’ve never 
                        been very good at hanging on to the 
                        things I should hang on to. And I 
                        know that’s made me a pretty crap 
                        mother so far. We’re both lucky 
                        that your grandmother has been 
                        there for you. But, if you’re all 
                        right with this, I’d like to step 
                        in. 

           Jeannie seems a little confused, but she’s listening.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        I know that it’s outrageously 
                        unfair of me to ask. But I would 
                        really appreciate another chance to 
                        be your mother. What do you think?

           Jeannie shrugs.

                                 JEANNIE
                        You won’t leave again?

                                 ELAINE
                        Never.

                                 JEANNIE
                        OK.

           Elaine exhales a heavy breath. She’s not sure what to say or 
           do next. So she goes for--

                                 ELAINE
                        What’s a woolly mammoth’s favorite 
                        sport?

                                 JEANNIE
                        What?

                                 ELAINE
                        Squash.

           Jeannie laughs.
                                 JEANNIE
                        You’re funny, Mom.

           INT. CONNECTICUT THEATER - NIGHT

           As they get ready to go on, Mike and Elaine start plotting 
           the move to Broadway.

                                 ELAINE
                        First act: “Teenagers,” one of the 
                        doctor ones -- rotating, “$65 
                        Funeral,” “Mother and Son.” Second 
                        act: improvisation. We’ll take 
                        suggestions for style and subject 
                        from the audience. Finish with 
                        “Pirandello.”

                                 MIKE
                        It’s too loose, Elaine. I’m 
                        proposing -- first act: 
                        “Teenagers,” “The Lost Dime,” 
                        “Mother and Son,” “Funeral,” 
                        “Adultery.” You love “Adultery.”

           She waggles her eyebrows, always going for the joke.

                                 ELAINE
                        I love all kinds of adultery.

                                 MIKE
                        Second act: “Disc Jockey,” “Little 
                        More Gauze,” “Snoring.” 
                        “Pirandello” isn’t nearly ready, 
                        and I doubt we can get it there 
                        before we open.

           A STAGE MANAGER sticks his head in.

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        You guys are up.

           They nod and dismiss him, but move faster now.

                                 ELAINE
                        I don’t understand why the concept 
                        of Broadway is scaring you so much. 
                        We have to do it the way we’ve 
                        always done it -- second by second, 
                        and when in doubt, seduce.

                                 MIKE
                        Do you know how much the producers 
                        are going to charge for a seat?
                                 ELAINE
                        Yes, Michael. But they’re paying to 
                        see us. Why would we change what us 
                        is?

           As he struggles to tie his bowtie, she helps him.

                                 MIKE
                        We’ve been working together for 
                        four years. This is the time to 
                        showcase the best of what we’ve 
                        got. That’s “Teenagers.” That’s 
                        “$65 Funeral” -- 

                                 ELAINE
                        No! The best of what we’ve got is 
                        us. When you look at me and we 
                        connect. It’s never better, it’s 
                        never more fun than when I don’t 
                        know what’s coming next. If you 
                        take that part out, we’re just 
                        jackasses doing little skits. 

           They head to the stage--

                                 MIKE
                        Well then compromise. Make me an 
                        offer.

                                 ELAINE
                        Make you an offer? Since when are 
                        you the arbiter of the act?

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        And now, tonight’s headliners, Mike 
                        Nichols and Elaine May.

                                 ELAINE
                        This isn’t over.

           The audience CLAPS and WHISTLES as Mike and Elaine step out.

           There’s something just a little off -- a little reluctant, a 
           little irritated, a little infuriated -- when she sits and 
           says...

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Have you noticed the lake at all? 
                        It’s just ... suicidally beautiful 
                        tonight.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:
           INT. CONNECTICUT THEATER - NIGHT

           Mid-”Pirandello.”

                                 ELAINE
                        I just wish you would admit that 
                        you and Margie have had a thing 
                        going for years.

                                 MIKE
                        We haven’t --

           He throws his hands up in frustration.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Elaine, this scene is going 
                        nowhere. You’ve completely backed 
                        me into a corner.

                                 ELAINE
                        No, Michael, you’ve completely 
                        backed me into a corner.

           He’s taken aback. This isn’t how the scene usually goes.

                                 MIKE
                        I -- I --

                                 ELAINE
                        We’re finally being recognized for 
                        our work, and all you want is to 
                        stop working.

                                 MIKE
                        I never said that. When did I say 
                        that?

                                 ELAINE
                        You want to immortalize every 
                        scene. You want every night to be 
                        the same as the last, when the 
                        truth is, the unpredictability of 
                        this stupid act is why it got 
                        noticed in the first place.

                                 MIKE
                        Do we have to do this now?

                                 ELAINE
                        You’re the one who thought 
                        “Pirandello” should be a fight -- 
                        well, here it is.
           He looks at the audience briefly (they’re AGHAST), then back 
           at her. And damn if he just lets her have it.

                                 MIKE
                        Forgive me if I want this to be 
                        commercially successful, too. I’m 
                        the only one who looks at the 
                        books. I’m the only one keeping our 
                        finances in order. Did you know I 
                        started a college fund for Jeannie? 
                        Because I did, and you’re welcome.

                                 ELAINE
                        Do not bring her up--

                                 MIKE
                        Right. Yeah, I saw that interview 
                        you did in Newsweek. It wasn’t a 
                        direct quote, but the magazine said 
                        you’d never been married, no 
                        children. I wonder how they got 
                        that idea...

                                 ELAINE
                        It’s nobody’s business...

                                 MIKE
                             (to the crowd)
                        Elaine’s 27. Her daughter’s 10. Do 
                        the math.

                                 ELAINE
                        Am I supposed to be ashamed of 
                        that? Because I’m not. And, by the 
                        way, that’s really rich coming from 
                        you, when you’re the one who just 
                        spent $300 on a wig.

           It’s the cruelest thing she’s ever said to him. And he 
           ADVANCES ON HER, holding his hands just inches from her 
           throat, wanting to throttle her but not quite touching her.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

           It’s the out. It’s the opportunity for him to call it a night 
           and say “I’m doing Pirandello.” But he doesn’t.

           The STAGE MANAGER holds the curtain rope in his hands, ready 
           to close them.
                                 MIKE
                        You are the craziest fucking person 
                        I know. And you’re a terrible 
                        mother.

           She pushes him away from her, but he doesn’t get far -- and 
           he pushes back. There’s a moment -- Are they doing this? Is 
           this theatre? Is this real? Is this the whole terrifying 
           point of “Pirandello”?

           He slaps her. She lunges, using her nails to dig into his 
           chest. 

                                 ELAINE
                        Thank God I didn’t marry you when I 
                        had the chance.

           He’s holding her forcefully at arm’s length while she 
           scratches at him, reaching for his neck.

                                 MIKE
                        Yes, thank God for that.

                                 ELAINE
                        Have you ever noticed that all the 
                        women in your life want to kill 
                        you? Why do you think that is?

                                 MIKE
                        Have you ever noticed that all the 
                        men in your life want to kill 
                        themselves?

           She screams.

           The stage manager pulls the curtain closed, as the audience 
           watches in sheer shock and confusion. They clap nervously, 
           unsure if they’re even supposed to.

           In the darkness backstage, they relent and stare at each 
           other. He cries first, and she follows, fiercely hugging him.

           They whisper apologies into each other’s skin.

           EXT. GOLDEN THEATER - NIGHT

           There’s a FERRIS WHEEL set up outside the Golden Theater on 
           the night of the Broadway opening. Mike and Elaine are in 
           formalwear, doing the red carpet. Jack is thrilled as hell, 
           charming photographers. 

           Mike talks to a REPORTER, while Elaine stands by -- she HATES 
           this kind of thing and is more than happy to let him do the 
           talking.
                                 REPORTER
                        So what can we expect tonight?

                                 MIKE
                        The show’s really unpredictable -- 
                        we don’t have a script, we don’t 
                        have a schedule. In the second act, 
                        we’ll take audience suggestions for 
                        scenes, and we’ll also visit some 
                        favorites of ours.

                                 REPORTER
                        Like the teenagers in the car?

                                 MIKE
                        Of course.

                                 REPORTER
                        Well, really looking forward to it.

           They nod in thanks and move down the rope line toward the 
           next reporter, until--

                                 ELAINE
                        Come on.

           She grabs his hand and leads him away, toward the ferris 
           wheel.

                                 MIKE
                        Elaine, we have to--

                                 ELAINE
                        No, we don’t. Come on.

           She skips to the front of the line -- no one complains -- and 
           boards a car.

                                 MIKE
                        We have a responsibility to promote 
                        the show.

                                 ELAINE
                        The show will promote the show. I 
                        don’t want to deal with all those 
                        people.

           They sit down, and he closes his eyes.

                                 MIKE
                        Also, I hate heights.

                                 ELAINE
                        It’s not that high. 
                                 MIKE
                        It’s high enough. And who do you 
                        think installed this thing? Was it 
                        a person with an advanced degree in 
                        structural engineering?

                                 ELAINE
                        I think his name was Jethro. Could 
                        you just try to have fun for two 
                        minutes?

           He takes a breath, tries to relax.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Did you bring a date tonight?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah -- her name’s Katie. She’s 
                        pretty, but she’s not -- you know --

                                 ELAINE
                        What?

                                 MIKE
                        We were watching the debate last 
                        night, and she thought Kinmen and 
                        Matsu were the Kennedys’ dogs.

                                 ELAINE
                        No, she didn’t.

                                 MIKE
                        She does not support using military 
                        force against them.

           Elaine laughs. Then--

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I wish my father were here.

                                 ELAINE
                             (surprised)
                        I’ve never heard you say that 
                        before.

                                 MIKE
                        He only knew me as the peculiar 
                        little bald kid. Look at me now. 
                        About to open on Broadway. Pretty 
                        girl by my side. These are things 
                        he could’ve understood ... maybe 
                        been proud of. Maybe I was closer 
                        to what he wanted than he thought.
                                 ELAINE
                        Thank you for compromising.

                                 MIKE
                        No, you’re right. This is nice -- 
                        look at all the people who came. 
                        Sidney Lumet and my mother -- I 
                        wonder who hates me more.

                                 ELAINE
                             (serious)
                        I don’t mean on the ferris wheel, 
                        dummy. I mean on the show. Fifteen 
                        minutes of improvisation in the 
                        second act -- I know you didn’t 
                        want that. 

           He shrugs.

                                 MIKE
                        I want the same thing I’ve always 
                        wanted.

                                 ELAINE
                        What’s that?

                                 MIKE
                        Whatever keeps you around.

           She takes his hand.

           INT. GOLDEN THEATER - NIGHT

           Mike and Elaine TAKE THEIR BOWS to thunderous applause.

           INT. RCA BUILDING - 30 ROCKEFELLER CENTER - NIGHT

           Mike and Elaine “sign in” on a chalkboard as mystery guests 
           on “What’s My Line?”, the panel blindfolded in the distance.

           INT. GOLDEN THEATER - NIGHT

           Mike and Elaine take another bow -- Elaine’s, to the trained 
           eye, might look perfunctory.

           INT. CARNEGIE HALL - NIGHT

           Mike and Elaine sit in the AUDIENCE, together.

                                 PRESENTER
                        And the Grammy Award for Best 
                        Comedy Performance goes to...

           She opens an envelope...
                                 PRESENTER (CONT’D)
                        Mike Nichols and Elaine May, for 
                        their recording of “An Evening With 
                        Nichols and May”!

           Mike and Elaine get up, smiling, to accept their awards.

           INT. GOLDEN THEATER - DAY

           Mike and Elaine take another bow after a matinee. She hurries 
           off and starts changing immediately. He follows.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, can I talk to you for a 
                        minute?

                                 ELAINE
                        Sure, but really fast -- I got a 
                        message from the school at 
                        intermission. Jeannie got in 
                        trouble. I have to go down there 
                        between shows and sort it out.

                                 MIKE
                        Look at you, Miss PTA.

                                 ELAINE
                        I’m trying. So what do you want to 
                        talk about?

                                 MIKE
                        It can wait.

                                 ELAINE
                        No, come on. I have six minutes--

                                 MIKE
                        “Pirandello” is going on for about 
                        two minutes longer than it needs 
                        to.

                                 ELAINE
                        During which part?

                                 MIKE
                        During the fight. We have to get 
                        them to gasp faster. We’re not 
                        gaining anything from the section 
                        about our divorces, and half the 
                        people -- thank God -- don’t know 
                        enough about us to make it funny 
                        anyway...
                                 ELAINE
                        I totally disagree.

                                 MIKE
                        Why?

                                 ELAINE
                        Because it’s uncomfortable. You 
                        have to let them marinate in the 
                        stew of awkward for a solid four or 
                        five minutes in order for it to 
                        really pay off.

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t think so, Elaine. 
                        Dramaturgically, it’s getting away 
                        from us in the third part. It’s 
                        losing the thread of the narrative. 

           She rolls her eyes.

                                 ELAINE
                        Fine.

                                 MIKE
                        Fine?

                                 ELAINE
                        I’m done fighting with you about 
                        “Pirandello.” Congratulations, 
                        you’ve won.

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t want to win. I want it to 
                        be a strong--

                                 ELAINE
                             (condescending)
                        Mike? Stop now.

           She grabs her purse.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        I have to go deal with my other 
                        kid.

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           Elaine walks into an after-hours elementary school classroom. 
           Jeannie has been kept late and is scribbling at her desk; the 
           TEACHER, MISS WILLIAMS, is at her own desk.

           Elaine approaches Jeannie first.
                                 ELAINE
                        Hello, sweetheart.

                                 JEANNIE
                             (chastened)
                        Hi, Mom. I’m sorry.

                                 ELAINE
                        What happened?

                                 MISS WILLIAMS
                        Jeannie, why don’t you wait outside 
                        while I talk to your mother?

           Jeannie steps outside. Elaine waits expectantly.

                                 MISS WILLIAMS (CONT’D)
                        Jeannie got in a fight with another 
                        student at recess today.

                                 ELAINE
                             (surprised)
                        A physical fight?

                                 MISS WILLIAMS
                        A boy was following her around, 
                        tugging her pigtails -- you know, 
                        the usual -- and Jeannie pushed 
                        him. Hard.

           Elaine ... doesn’t understand the problem.

                                 ELAINE
                        And?

                                 MISS WILLIAMS
                        Jeannie has been given detention, 
                        and we expect you to discipline her 
                        at home, as well.

                                 ELAINE
                        For shoving a kid who was 
                        antagonizing her? What kind of 
                        punishment did he get?

                                 MISS WILLIAMS
                        He’s not the one who pushed her.

                                 ELAINE
                        For pulling her hair. What 
                        punishment did he get for pulling 
                        her hair?
                                 MISS WILLIAMS
                        Oh, well, that’s--

                                 ELAINE
                        Assault? Should I involve the 
                        police?

                                 MISS WILLIAMS
                        I think this matter can be resolved 
                        without--

                                 ELAINE
                        Unless the boy who pulled her hair 
                        gets a stricter punishment, we have 
                        nothing more to discuss.

           Elaine stares the teacher down. Getting no response, she 
           decides this conversation is over and heads outside.

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Elaine kneels down beside Jeannie, who’s sitting on the floor 
           against the wall.

                                 ELAINE
                        Hey, look at me.

           Jeannie does, sadly.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        I’m proud of you. Don’t take shit 
                        from anybody, you hear me?

           Jeannie smiles. Throws her arms around Elaine. Elaine, caught 
           off guard, tries not to cry.

           A quick sequence of events over the next eight months -- 

           --Mike and Elaine run offstage at the Golden. Backstage, 
           Elaine introduces Mike to SHELDON HARNICK (35), a nerdy 
           lyricist in a too-big suit.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Mike, I’d like you to meet Sheldon 
                        Harnick. He’s the lyricist who 
                        wrote--

                                 MIKE
                        Fiorello. Congratulations on your, 
                        um, Pulitzer.

                                 ELAINE
                        And Tony. 
                                 SHELDON
                        Nice to meet you. Great show 
                        tonight.

                                 MIKE
                        Thanks. I heard you two are going 
                        skiing this weekend.

                                 SHELDON
                        That’s the plan.

                                 MIKE
                        Be careful with her. She’s clumsy 
                        and I need her back on Tuesday.

           Elaine side-eyes him.

                                 ELAINE
                        I haven’t fallen down in weeks. 

                                 MIKE
                        Maybe on regular shoes.

                                 ELAINE
                        I think I’m up for the challenge of 
                        skis.

           Mike watches them walk off. He won’t be good at this part 
           until 1988.

           --Mike holds another album -- “Mike Nichols and Elaine May 
           Examine Doctors” -- in his hands. 

           --Mike and Elaine take a FINAL BOW at the Golden. 

           --Mike watches a WORKER pick the letters of their names off 
           the marquee, then walks off.

           INT. JACK’S OFFICE - DAY - EIGHT MONTHS LATER

           Jack has stacks and stacks of paper on his desk; Mike and 
           Elaine help sift through it.

                                 JACK

                        whatever you want.

                                 ELAINE
                        No.

                        They’re offering this guy Carl 
                        Reiner to produce.

                                 ELAINE
                        No.

                                 MIKE
                        Wait -- don’t just say no. We 
                        should talk about this.

                                 ELAINE
                        Is it a western? I’ll totally do it 
                        if I can play a cowgirl.

                                 JACK
                        No.

                                 MIKE
                        Do you have anything in that stack 
                        you think we’d both go for?

           Jack looks through the papers and comes up with the only 
           answer that would work--

                                 JACK
                        Do you want to take a meeting with 
                        Lucy and Desi? They’re offering a 
                        blind deal.

                           MIKE
                                                         ELAINE
                 (intrigued)
                                              No.
           Yes!

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Honey, if you don’t want that deal, 
                        there’s nothing that’s gonna 
                        satisfy you.

                                 ELAINE
                        I don’t. Mike, if you want to take 
                        the meeting, you should take the 
                        meeting. And if you can really 
                        convince me that you want to do 
                        this, I am all ears.

           He thinks for a beat and then--

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t.

           She laughs.

                                 ELAINE
                        There you are.
                                 MIKE
                        I hate when you’re right.

           He leaves. 

                                 ELAINE
                        I’m sorry, Jack.

                                 JACK
                        Don’t be sorry. I’m proud of you, 
                        sweetheart.

           She follows Mike out.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

           Mike is feeling lost when she catches up with him outside.

                                 ELAINE
                        Do you want to talk about it?

                                 MIKE
                        You know, sometimes I feel like I’m 
                        the only person in the world who 
                        understands you. And sometimes 
                        you’re a complete stranger.

                                 ELAINE
                        OK...

                                 MIKE
                        We have the best fucking job in the 
                        world. We work two hours a night, 
                        cute people want you, our names on 
                        a marquee -- we just got offered 
                        carte blanche by the goddamn 
                        Ricardos! What more could you 
                        possibly want?

                                 ELAINE
                        Creativity! Invention! You think 
                        Desilu-CBS-Coca-Cola is going to 
                        let us do improvisation? Fuck no. 
                        We wouldn’t even get to write our 
                        own material! They’ll make us be 
                        Presbyterians.

                                 MIKE
                        You don’t know that--
                                 ELAINE
                        I miss showing up at Compass in 
                        that dingy theater, not knowing 
                        what the fuck we were going to do 
                        until the words came out of our 
                        mouths. When it was bad, it was 
                        bad. But when it was good, it was 
                        wonderful. You’d look at me, and I 
                        was so fucking in love with your 
                        brain I didn’t know what to do with 
                        myself. I haven’t felt that in a 
                        long time.

                                 MIKE
                        Me either.

                                 ELAINE
                        You care more about the “business” 
                        than I ever imagined you would.

                                 MIKE
                        Somebody has to!

                                 ELAINE
                        No! This was just supposed to be a 
                        diversion. This was supposed to be 
                        what we did until we figured out 
                        what our real jobs were.

                                 MIKE
                        What’s your “real job” then?

                                 ELAINE
                        I’m a writer. I’m not cut out for 
                        interviews and sponsors and network 
                        executives and night after night of 
                        the same thing. I’m too mean. I 
                        want to go home and sit in my 
                        office with my typewriter and have 
                        dinner with my kid after school.

                                 MIKE
                        You’ve been thinking about this.

                                 ELAINE
                        Yeah.

                                 MIKE
                        How long?

                                 ELAINE
                        Long enough that I wrote you a 
                        play.
           He’s surprised.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        You’ve always been a better actor 
                        than me, and I think you’d be 
                        really great at this part. It’s 
                        about a shut-in who... You know, 
                        I’ll just send you the pages. I’d 
                        like you to consider it.

                                 MIKE
                        OK...

                                 ELAINE
                        You’ll consider it?

                                 MIKE
                        Of course.

           She wants to hug him, but doesn’t.

                                 ELAINE
                        Also, um -- I gotta tell you 
                        something. And when I tell you, 
                        just know that it only happened 
                        this morning, and I just didn’t 
                        want to tell Jack before I told 
                        you.

                                 MIKE
                        What?

                                 ELAINE
                        Shel asked me to marry him, and I 
                        said yes.

                                 MIKE
                        Elaine...

                                 ELAINE
                        I know you don’t like him--

                                 MIKE
                        I -- I’m just looking out for you. 
                        You know you’re probably never 
                        going to have sex again.

                                 ELAINE
                        That’s not fair.

                                 MIKE
                        Does he even try to be good at it? 
                        I can’t imagine he has any skills--
                                 ELAINE
                             (amused)
                        Stop.

                                 MIKE
                        I mean, you’re a pretty lazy 
                        person, and I imagine you’re doing 
                        an awful lot of the work. Are you 
                        sure that’s how you want to spend 
                        your life?

                                 ELAINE
                        How exactly is that different from 
                        the last five years with you?

                                 MIKE
                        It’s your funeral. Your very long, 
                        really desert-like life, and then 
                        your funeral.

           They’re OK for now.

           INT. THEATER - DAY

           A rehearsal for Elaine’s play, “A Matter of Position.” 
           Everyone holds scripts -- Mike, Elaine, ROSE ARRICK (30) as 
           his wife, and the director, FRED COE (40s).

                                 MIKE
                        You really don’t care about me at 
                        all, do you? Just get a salary and 
                        keep the health insurance. Never 
                        mind that I’m up on 33, and I’m ... 
                        who am I? God, this is so painful 
                        ... to be such a fucking failure.

           He stops, thinks for a second.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I feel like I want to be more 
                        active in this scene. It’s the end 
                        of Act Two, I want to get out of 
                        bed and yell at her.

                                 FRED
                        OK, let’s try it.

                                 ELAINE
                        Well -- no.

           They look over to her, waiting for justification.
                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        It’s scripted he gets up four pages 
                        later. You’re going to completely 
                        dilute that moment if he’s already 
                        made the choice to fight her.

                                 FRED
                        Let’s try it. I agree with Mike 
                        that it’s a long scene, and it’s 
                        getting a little flat. I’m sure 
                        there’s a way to restructure the 
                        climax so we get the right dynamic 
                        between Howard and Sally.

                                 ELAINE
                        Selma.

                                 FRED
                        I’m sorry?

                                 ELAINE
                        The female character in the play 
                        you’re being paid to direct is 
                        named Selma.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        We’re not restructuring the climax, 
                        Fred. It’s plotted this way for a 
                        reason.

                                 FRED
                        And it’s about 20 pages too long. 
                        So let’s try it this way, and see 
                        if we can’t tighten it up.

                                 ELAINE
                        But--

                                 MIKE
                        Elaine...

           She shoots him the meanest fucking look of her life. But he 
           keeps standing to deliver the last--

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        How did this happen? I did 
                        everything right. I was born white. 
                        I got good grades. And my life just 
                        feels ... made-up, just 
                        meaningless, like something I’ll do 
                        to pass the time until I die. I 
                        mean, don’t you ever feel like 
                        that?
           Rose is searching around the room, looking through the fake 
           apartment.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Please don’t walk away from me 
                        while I’m talking. I was almost 
                        crying there.

                                 ROSE
                        I can’t find it.

                                 MIKE
                        What?

                                 ROSE
                        The forty dollars. I had two 20 
                        dollar bills put away for 
                        miscellaneous and now I can’t find 
                        them--

           Now Mike notices that Elaine is distracted. He follows her 
           eyeline to see that Sheldon has entered. She kisses him 
           hello, but tries to hurry him back out the door.

                                 MIKE
                        Well, you shouldn’t let money lay 
                        around loose. That’s the quickest 
                        way to lose money -- just to let it 
                        lay around loose.

                                 ELAINE
                             (whispers)
                        I know, I’ll see you at home.

           He whispers something into her ear that makes her laugh. 

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Bye. Later. Bye.

           He leaves, grabbing her ass as he goes.

           And as she turns back, she can see that Mike was watching. 
           And has stopped rehearsal.

                                 MIKE
                        Elaine, should I take it back for 
                        you? Somewhere around--
                             (he looks down at the 
                              pages)
                        “Please don’t walk away from me 
                        while I’m talking?”

                                 ELAINE
                        Sorry.
                                 FRED
                        I think it’s much better if he gets 
                        up here. It’s a good suggestion, 
                        Mike. We can bring up the climax to 
                        this point in the script -- it’d 
                        save about eight pages...

                                 ELAINE
                        Fred? Please direct the script as 
                        written.

           Off Mike, caught in the middle...

           INT. ELAINE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Elaine sits up in bed, in the middle of the night, Sheldon 
           sleeping beside her. She dials her phone, carries it into the 
           hallway, long cord dragging behind her. It picks up.

                                 MIKE
                        What?

                                 ELAINE
                        You have to be on my side.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m on your side.

                                 ELAINE
                        Fred Coe is an idiot. He’s phoning 
                        it in. He’s trying to tell the 
                        story like it’s math -- like it’s a 
                        formula of jokes and words that’s 
                        going to end up equaling something. 
                        And it’s just not. It has to be 
                        about something. It has to be true 
                        to human behavior.

                                 MIKE
                        I know, but--

                                 ELAINE
                        No. Mike. I need you on my side on 
                        this one. Tomorrow. You have to 
                        start fighting -- you know I’m 
                        right.

                                 MIKE
                        OK.

           But Mike doesn’t know how many more of Elaine’s battles he 
           can fight.
           INT. THEATER - DAY

           Elaine arrives to rehearsal to find Fred showing Mike through 
           the pages.

                                 FRED
                        Hey, Elaine. I was just showing 
                        Mike through the new pages.

                                 ELAINE
                        New pages?

                                 FRED
                        I talked things over with the 
                        producer and the financier, and 
                        we’ve agreed that cuts have to be 
                        made. The play is just too long.

                                 ELAINE
                        No. No no no no no. Mike?

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sorry, Elaine, but I agree. 

                                 ELAINE
                        No. I’ll -- I’ll get an injunction. 
                        I hold the copyright on the play. 
                        You can’t -- you can’t do this.

                                 FRED
                        The financier has the rights to 
                        present the material--

                                 ELAINE
                        What the fuck? How is this 
                        happening?

                                 FRED
                        You wrote a painfully long play, 
                        Miss May. We have to sell tickets. 
                        Did you see what the Sunday 
                        Bulletin said about previews?

                                 ELAINE
                        “Those members of the audience who 
                        had not already beat a hasty 
                        retreat before the final curtain, 
                        as many did, were left with a 
                        sensation of numbness that was too 
                        far down to be attributed to 
                        heartburn.”

                                 FRED
                        You memorized it.
                                 ELAINE
                        I read it a lot of times. I’m only 
                        surprised you’re so desperate to 
                        blame the script. Neither of you 
                        wants to take any credit for that?

           No, they do not.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you both.

           She turns to leave. Mike doesn’t stop her.

           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

           Lights now, with an audience, show has begun. Mike is acting 
           opposite Rose, but he’s barely trying. The play is bad.

                                 MIKE
                        Why don’t you just leave me?

                                 ROSE
                        I can’t. I’m nearly thirty-five. 
                        I’ve spent ten years of my life on 
                        you. And they were my pretty years, 
                        too.

           Mike dares a glance into the audience. And there’s Elaine, in 
           the second row. Practically the same seat she was in ten 
           years ago when he could feel her hatred during that 
           production of “Miss Julie.”

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to be nearly thirty-
                        five and live with my mother and 
                        type term papers and start waiting 
                        all over again. What if nobody 
                        wants me, and I just wait and wait 
                        and wait and nothing ever happens? 
                        Anything is better than that.

                                 MIKE
                        Leave me. Do it. End it. Make a 
                        move. Make some move that you can’t 
                        go back on. Put me in some position 
                        that I can’t change.

           And the same thing that happened then is happening now -- she 
           doesn’t like the play. She doesn’t like him. And he knows.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:
           INT. THEATER - NIGHT

           Mike takes his bow. He looks back into the audience, 
           expecting to at least share a smile with Elaine. All he sees 
           is her BACK, leaving the theater.

           INT. ELAINE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Elaine is already in pajamas when Mike arrives, straight from 
           the theater. She opens the door.

                                 ELAINE
                             (coolly)
                        What do you want?

                                 MIKE
                        The stunt you pulled tonight was 
                        awful.

                                 ELAINE
                        The stunt I pulled? You completely 
                        fucking betrayed me. I’m supposed 
                        to be your partner. I didn’t 
                        recognize anything about that play.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, cut the bullshit. We haven’t 
                        been partners in months.

                                 ELAINE
                        You let them fucking shred the play-
                        - 

                                 MIKE
                        It was a bad play, Elaine!

           She’s stunned.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        It was 40 minutes too long. Like 
                        most of your work. It’s visually 
                        boring. And, honestly, it’s not 
                        even very funny. 

                                 ELAINE
                        Then why the fuck did you agree to 
                        do it, if you hated it so much?

                                 MIKE
                        Because I love you! Because working 
                        with you is what I do. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        And because I’ve seen some of your 
                        most terrible, most shit-brained 
                        ideas turn into the funniest thing 
                        I’ve ever seen. I don’t know what 
                        it was about this one, but you just 
                        shut down. You shut me out, you 
                        never gave Fred a chance--

                                 ELAINE
                        Fred is an idiot.

                                 MIKE
                        No. He’s not. 

           Having heard the yelling, Sheldon comes out from the bedroom.

                                 SHELDON
                        Everything all right out here?

                          ELAINE
                                                          MIKE
           Yeah.
                                              Yes.

           Sheldon leaves.

                                 MIKE
                        Look -- I can’t do this anymore. I 
                        gotta figure out -- I don’t know -- 
                        I can’t be Nichols and May anymore. 
                        I can’t be your protector.

                                 ELAINE
                        My protector? What the fuck kind of 
                        -- you think you’ve been protecting 
                        me? You’ve been stifling me for 
                        years. “Elaine, make Pirandello 
                        shorter.” “Elaine, cut 40 pages 
                        from your play...”

                                 MIKE
                        I’ve been making you better.

           The last straw.

                                 ELAINE
                        Get out of my house.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sorry. That came out wrong.

                                 ELAINE
                        Get out of my house.

                                 MIKE
                        No, come on--
                                 ELAINE
                        Get out!

           She practically pushes him out the door and slams it on him.

           INT. MIKE’S APARTMENT - DAY - SIX MONTHS LATER

           Mike is in bed. There’s a loud knock at the door. Mike 
           doesn’t answer it.

           The knock gets louder.

                                 VOICE
                        Mike, are you in there? I’m not 
                        leaving until you answer...

           The knock gets louder, more annoying. Finally, Mike gets up 
           and opens the door. On the other side is Paul Sills, older 
           than when we last saw him.

                                 MIKE
                        Paul?

                                 PAUL
                        Good, you’re not dead.

                                 MIKE
                        What are you doing here?

                                 PAUL
                        Word on the street is nobody’s seen 
                        you since you busted up with 
                        Elaine.

                                 MIKE
                        I didn’t bust up with Elaine.

                                 PAUL
                             (shrugs)
                        OK.

                                 MIKE
                        Why, what’s she saying?

                                 PAUL
                        God, you’re pathetic. Get your 
                        coat.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

           Coffees in hand, Mike and Paul walk down a street.

                                 MIKE
                        How’s Compass 2.0 coming along?
                                 PAUL
                        Great, really great. Making money. 
                        We’re running it more like a comedy 
                        academy, gave it a new name: The 
                        Second City.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m really happy for you.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah, thanks. But I didn’t come 
                        here to gloat, or to ask you to 
                        come back to Chicago. So why don’t 
                        you tell me what’s going on?

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t know. I feel like I was 
                        just getting the hang of it. But 
                        Elaine -- Elaine thrives on 
                        struggle. If she felt like things 
                        were getting easy, she got nervous, 
                        and she created chaos for herself, 
                        and by extension, for me. So much 
                        fucking chaos. At least that’s what 
                        my analyst says. 

                        I’ve never been on my own before. 
                        I’m thirty, and I’ve always had 
                        her. I feel like ... I don’t know, 
                        like the leftover half of 
                        something.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah...

           He doesn’t know what to say.

                                 MIKE
                        Part of me feels so free without 
                        her, but most of me just feels 
                        despair. I got offered a play to 
                        direct, and I just can’t bring 
                        myself to make a decision.

                                 PAUL
                        Oh, Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        What?

                                 PAUL
                        You’re so good. I don’t know what 
                        at, but you’re so good.
           Mike lets that sink in for a minute.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        You should do the play. You need a 
                        reason to get up and put a shirt on 
                        every day.
                             (beat)
                        And by the way, Elaine is 
                        miserable, too.

           INT. ELAINE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Elaine and Jeannie sit across from each other at the ping-
           pong table. Jeannie scribbles homework, while Elaine types 
           script pages.

           Elaine reaches for a PENCIL to scribble on a page, and 
           Jeannie hands it to her, without thinking.

           Elaine looks up and smiles.

           Sheldon INTERRUPTS, SINGING as he crosses the room.

           As he walks off, Elaine ROLLS HER EYES for Jeannie’s benefit. 
           Jeannie giggles.

           INT. THEATER - DAY

           Mike walks in to the Biltmore Theatre. An empty room, except 
           for a few ACTORS holding SCRIPTS. We won’t linger on this 
           fact, but one of them is Robert Redford.

           As he approaches, they turn to him expectantly, waiting for 
           direction.

                                 ACTRESS
                        Good morning, Mr. Director!

                                 MIKE
                             (to himself)
                        Oh.

           He will later say that in this moment, he realized, “Here’s 
           my job. This is what I’ve been waiting for.”

           INT. MIKE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - TWO YEARS LATER - 1965

           Mike, looking much healthier, throws his keys down inside the 
           door to his apartment.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m home!
           Little feet run down the hallway toward him. It’s DAISY 
           NICHOLS (1), whom he sweeps up.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Daisy! Hello, sweet girl.

           Another lady, MARGOT CALLAS (33), Mike’s wife, enters.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Hello, sweet girl.

           He kisses her hello.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry I’m late. I stopped off for a 
                        bottle of Merlot. I thought we 
                        could put the baby to bed, and --

                                 MARGOT
                        Mike. We have company.

                                 MIKE
                        Oh. OK. Who?

                                 ELAINE
                        Hi, Mike.

           He spins around. She looks good.

                                 MIKE
                        Hi.

           He sets Daisy down on the floor; she toddles toward Margot.

                                 MARGOT
                        I’ll give you a minute.

                                 ELAINE
                        Thanks, Margot.

           She leaves.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean to surprise you. I 
                        tried to call, but I guess your 
                        number’s different.

                                 MIKE
                        What are you doing here?

                                 ELAINE
                        I got a phone call this morning. 
                        Organizers from Selma are asking us 
                        to do a thing after the march. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELAINE (CONT'D)
                        I’ve decided I’m going. Do you want 
                        to go?

                                 MIKE
                        Wow, well, you know, I’m in pre-
                        production on this movie. And 
                        Margot and the baby...

                                 ELAINE
                        Don’t let me pressure you.

                                 MIKE
                        The producer is never gonna let me 
                        go.

           Elaine shrugs.

                                 ELAINE
                        It’s up to you.

           He watches her for a second.

                                 MIKE
                        Shit, I have to go.

           He watches her for another second, maybe still waiting on her 
           approval.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Fine, yes! I’m going to go.

                                 ELAINE
                        Good.

                                 MIKE
                        What are we gonna do, “Teenagers”?

                                 ELAINE
                        You choose.

                                 MIKE
                        Might be getting a little old for 
                        “Teenagers.”

                                 ELAINE
                        That might make it funnier.

           She gets up to leave.

                                 MIKE
                        Stay. I have wine.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:
           INT. MIKE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mike pours the last of the bottle.

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry about the divorce.

                                 ELAINE
                        It’s OK. I got custody of the cake.

                                 MIKE
                        How’s Jeannie?

                                 ELAINE
                        Wonderful. Brilliant.
                             (rolls her eyes)
                        She wants to be an actress.

                                 MIKE
                        She’ll grow out of it. We did.

                                 ELAINE
                        We grew out of just about 
                        everything.

                                 MIKE
                        Not everything.

           She watches him with curiosity.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I still think you’re the smartest 
                        person I ever met.

                                 ELAINE
                        And I you.
                             (beat)
                        Look. I’m really sorry for how it 
                        ended. It deserved better.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sorry, too. You wanna add the 
                        last two years to the list of 
                        things we don’t talk about?

                                 ELAINE
                        I don’t want there to be a list 
                        anymore. I just want to be your 
                        friend.

                                 MIKE
                        Deal.
           He smiles at her, it’s a new equilibrium. She only lets it 
           linger for a second, before she’s off on--

                                 ELAINE
                        I can’t believe we never did the 
                        Burtons.

                                 MIKE
                        They’re not very funny, I can tell 
                        you that from experience.

                                 ELAINE
                        Well, of course they’re not -- 
                        what’s funny is that anybody cares 
                        about them at all. Funny is Dick 
                        and Lizzie arguing about how to 
                        squeeze a tube of toothpaste.

                                 MIKE
                             (in a British accent)
                        You see, darling, you have to 
                        squeeze from the bottom. 

                                 ELAINE
                             (impersonating Elizabeth 
                              Taylor)
                        Don’t tell me how to live my life!

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not trying to control you. I’m 
                        just trying to be economical.

                                 ELAINE
                        I’ll buy every toothpaste factory 
                        from here to Luxembourg before I 
                        let you--

           He breaks down into giggles.

                                 ELAINE (CONT’D)
                        What!?

                                 MIKE
                        Luxembourg?

           She laughs, too.

                                 ELAINE
                        I don’t know -- I bet they have 
                        fancy toothpaste in Luxembourg...

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

           Thirty years later.
           Mike is on the set of THE BIRDCAGE, script in hand. There are 
           EXTRAS and a slew of CREW MEMBERS around, but Mike is 
           concerned right now with ROBIN WILLIAMS, 44, at the top of 
           his game, with NATHAN LANE, 39.

                                 ROBIN
                             (to Nathan)
                        Stop whining, I’m teaching you to 
                        be a man. You’ve got to lower your 
                        voice and talk like you’ve got a 
                        chest cold, like you’re in the 
                        locker room at Yankee Stadium with 
                        Don Mattingly. You’ve just won the 
                        Pennant. They’ve poured Gatorade 
                        down your back and given you a hot 
                        dog. The meat of America. 

           He goes off on a tear, until--

                                 MIKE
                        Cut.

           We realize Mike is sitting beside Elaine, in a chair marked 
           WRITER. They pull their headphones off.

                                 ELAINE
                        You don’t have to.

                                 MIKE
                             (playing dumb)
                        What?

                                 ELAINE
                        He’s good. He’s perfect.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not doing anything.

           Mike gets out of his chair and walks over -- 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        OK. OK, that’s wonderful. You know 
                        you’re the most talented improviser 
                        alive, probably who ever lived--

                                 ROBIN
                        Thank you -- that’s not --

                                 MIKE
                        It is true.

           Elaine watches through the monitor, slips her headphones back 
           on. 
                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        But here’s the thing -- we’re going 
                        to do every take to the script 
                        until we’re all satisfied, and then 
                        you’ll get a take to improvise. OK?

                                 ROBIN
                        Yes, of course. You’re protecting--

                                 MIKE
                        I’m protecting the script. Elaine 
                        wrote a beautiful script.

           She’s watching him. There’s nothing more to say now between 
           them. All that’s left is respect.

           She looks back down at her pages as he pats Robin on the 
           shoulder.

           He turns around, looking back at Elaine, giving her the same 
           look of pure respect and affection she just gave him.

           But her attention is on her pages.

                                         THE END
