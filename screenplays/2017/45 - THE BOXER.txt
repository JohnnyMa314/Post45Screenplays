           EXT. CONEY ISLAND BOARDWALK - NIGHT

           A sweltering summer’s day is fading, casting shadows across 
           the orange glow of sunset. Neon lights flicker to life on the 
           boardwalk’s attractions. 

           SUPER: BROOKLYN, JUNE 1949

           Crowds surge towards the beach, the stalls, the amusements. A 
           giddy sense of post-war reconstruction and joy. 

           Except for one man, moving through the crowd, like swimming 
           upstream. HARRY HAFT. Brutishly handsome with intense, 
           haunted eyes. He’s lived a hundred lifetimes already.

           Sleeves rolled up on his heavily patched shirt, revealing 
           ropey forearms and a blue, scratchy tattooed number - 144738.

           EXT. BROOKLYN SYNAGOGUE - NIGHT

           Far from the sand, a SEAGULL cries overhead as Harry walks 
           down a quieter street.

           A RABBI is standing outside the synagogue, enjoying the night 
           air. Welcoming a group of MEN inside. 

           The Rabbi meets Harry’s gaze. Recognizing him with what might 
           be pity. He gestures Harry over to join them, welcoming.  

           Harry considers. Then walks away. 

           INT. BROOKLYN JEWISH CLUB - NIGHT

           A solitary fan blows hot air and cigarette smoke around, 
           ruffling faded flags of pre-war Eastern European countries. 

           The PATRONS are all men. Most are Holocaust survivors. 
           Drinking to forget. Tables crowd around a tiny space reserved 
           as a stage. 

           Harry takes a seat at the bar. Fishes in his pocket for a 
           quarter. Pushes the money across to the BARTENDER in exchange 
           for dark Polish beer. 

           Harry turns his head to a table of ROWDY MEN. One nods at 
           him. PERETZ HAFT, a sleeker version of his younger brother. 

           A female SINGER emerges from a back room. Taking command of 
           the stage space, she begins to sing. A Yiddish folk love 
           song, full of longing for home. 

           A HUSH falls. Even the drunkest of carousers falling silent.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Harry meets his brother’s eyes. A mutual connection. The 
           music stirring a memory...

           FLASHBACK: EXT. POLISH FIELD - NIGHT 1941

           The MOON illuminates two figures, moving quietly through a 
           field of grain.

           YOUNG HARRY follows YOUNG PERETZ. Both carry packs full of 
           smuggled goods. Dark caps pulled down low. 

           Peretz stops. Squats down. Pulls Harry with him. Listening. 
           But there’s nothing but the wind. 

           In SUBTITLED YIDDISH (until flashbacks end):

                                 PERETZ
                             (whispering)
                        The border’s close.

           Harry nods. They moving slowly through the RUSTLING BARLEY - 
           right into a GERMAN PATROL. 

                                 SOLDIER
                             (German)
                        Halt! Don’t move!

           The brothers SCATTER. The Germans OPEN FIRE. Peretz dumps his 
           pack. Harry bends to pick it up, hauling the two packs - 

           - as a BULLET catches his side. Harry stumbles. 

                                 PERETZ
                        Hertzko!

           Peretz catches Harry, hauling him up. 

           EXT. BELCHATOW JEWISH QUARTER - NIGHT 

           Peretz drags Harry through the dark, quiet streets. Passing 
           burned-out houses with smashed windows. NAZI FLAGS fly 
           overhead. 

           They duck down an alleyway. Peretz covers Harry’s mouth. 
           Hushing him as a GERMAN SOLDIER passes by. 

           INT. PABLANKSI HOUSE - NIGHT

           Peretz kicks open the door, hauling Harry inside - to the 
           surprise of MEIR PABLANSKI, 50’s, a once conservative man 
           embracing the new role of black marketeer.  

                                 MEIR
                        What happened?
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Harry FAINTS.

           INT. PABLANKSI HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           A Yiddish folk song plays. A scratchy, quiet recording. The 
           same song from 1949. 

           Harry’s eyelids flutter. Open. The pain floods back. He 
           grimaces. Grabbing at his side.

                                 LEAH
                        Don’t touch it. 

           LEAH PABLANSKI, gangly, a force of nature, pushes him back 
           down onto the thin bed. Stitching up his flesh wound under 
           smoky candlelight. 

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        If you’re going to vomit, tell me 
                        first. 

           Harry looks around, disoriented. A small bedroom. The windows 
           covered with blackout curtains. 

           A battered, precious RECORD PLAYER nearby. The source of the 
           haunting Yiddish tune. 

                                 HARRY
                        Who are you?

                                 LEAH
                        Leah Pablanksi. Your brother’s in 
                        business with my father. Or he was.

           She pulls the thread tight, closing the wound. Harry gasps. 

                                 HARRY
                             (defensive)
                        The Germans knew we were coming. 

                                 LEAH
                        Thirty six. That’s how many times 
                        I’ve made it across the border. 
                        I’ve never been caught.

                                 HARRY
                        I bet you’ve never been shot.

           She’s not the type to resist a challenge. Leah lifts up her 
           skirt, revealing a puckered SHRAPNEL SCAR on her shapely 
           calf. 

                                 MEIR (O.S.)
                        Leah.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Meir stands in the doorway, too weary of his daughter’s 
           antics to be surprised. 

                                 MEIR (CONT’D)
                        Tz’ni’ut gedolah. Tell me what this 
                        means. 

                                 LEAH
                        To behave with great modesty, 
                        father.

           She smooths her skirt down under his gaze.  

                                 MEIR
                        Finish with the boy, then hide the 
                        goods he didn’t lose. 

           Leah lowers her head. But when Meir withdraws to the main 
           room, she meets Harry’s gaze. They explode in a quiet, 
           hysterical giggle. 

           Bringing herself under control, Leah stands, picking up the 
           bowl of bloody water, to leave.

                                 HARRY
                        Leah. Wait. My name is Hertzko. 

                                 LEAH
                        I know. Not very smart, are you?

           Harry gestures to his gunshot wound, cocky. 

                                 HARRY
                        But maybe a little bit brave?

           It pays off. She’s unable to help a smile.  

           As the Yiddish song SWELLS from the record player...

           EXT. BELCHATOW ROAD - DAY 1941

           The shimmering, buttery light of an unforgettable summer. 
           Harry and Leah walk down a dirt road. Hands brushing. 

           Their BLUE STAR OF DAVID ARMBANDS the only clue to the dark 
           world willing to destroy them. 

           Side by side, Leah’s taller than him. But he likes it. 

                                 HARRY
                        You’re very tall for a girl.

                                 LEAH
                        Maybe you’re just short.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           He’s constantly off-balance around her. Her flirting game 
           miles above his own. 

                                 HARRY
                        You’re a bit mean, as well. 

                                 LEAH
                        I’m walking with you, aren’t I?

                                 HARRY
                             (astute)
                        Because your father didn’t want you 
                        to. 

           Dust billows in the distance. A NAZI CAR barreling down the 
           road. 

           Harry takes Leah’s hand, pulling her off the road. Hiding 
           from any potential trouble. Hearts pounding. 

           The car and its heavily armed SOLDIERS pass.

           Harry steps back to the road, picking up a rock. Throws it at 
           the disappearing car with youthful bravado. 

                                 LEAH
                        What would you do, if they came 
                        back?

                                 HARRY
                        Kill them. Take their car.  

                                 LEAH
                             (agreeing)
                        Drive to England. Or America. 

                                 HARRY
                        And never get caught. 

           Neither of them believe that for a second. 

                                 LEAH
                        Can you swim?

           With a grin, she reaches for his hand --

           EXT. BELCHATOW RIVER - DAY 1941

           -- dragging him into the river. Fully clothed, Harry opens 
           his eyes under water, bubbles spiralling up. 

           Surfacing, he’s hit with a face full of water. Leah laughs. 
           Harry attacks, grabbing her around the waist, dunking her. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           If it seems a little too perfect, maybe it is. But this is 
           Harry’s memory. 

           Leah kisses him. Surprised, Harry kisses her back. It quickly 
           turns into more, mad with lust and dizzying first love.

           INT. BROOKLYN JEWISH CLUB - NIGHT (BACK TO 1949)

           The SONG fades. 

           The crowd applauds. Some wiping away tears. Swaying with 
           liquor and grief. Harry’s expression is softer, the memory 
           relaxing his bones. 

           Until a man sits next to him. EMORY ANDERSON, American, 30’s. 
           An sharp mind wrapped in a body that’s seen its fair share of 
           abuse. 

                                 EMORY
                        When are you going to talk to me, 
                        Harry? Tell me your side of the 
                        story.

           Harry’s reverie is broken. Body tensing. In a thick Polish 
           accent:

                                 HARRY
                        You know my story. 

                                 EMORY
                        ‘Survivor of Auschwitz’? That’s 
                        just scratching the surface. 

           Harry drinks slowly. Fists clenching. 

                                 HARRY
                        You should leave, Mr Anderson. 

                                 EMORY
                        Call me Emory. I like it here. Lots 
                        of stories. Birkenau. Jaworzno.  

           Peretz clocks his brother’s body language. Emory’s 
           insistence. He stands. 

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        Some people call you a traitor. 

           Harry quietly drains his glass. 

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        Collaborator. Murderer. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Harry meets Emory’s eyes for the first time. A beast lurking, 
           itching to get out. An answering desperation in Emory. 

           Pushing through the crowd, Peretz reaches them. 

                                 PERETZ
                             (warning)
                        Hertzko...

           Harry SMASHES his fist into Emory’s face -

           EXT. CONEY ISLAND VELODROME - NIGHT

           - but now it’s Harry’s head SNAPPING BACK, to the ROAR of a 
           bloodthirsty crowd. 

           SUPER: HAFT VS LASTARZA. JUNE 27, 1949

           WIDER, REVEAL an open-air boxing ring. INSECTS dance around 
           the bright lights. 

           Steam rises from Harry’s bare, scarred torso - a bullet wound 
           here, a stab mark there. Sweat runs down his legs. A STAR OF 
           DAVID emblazoned on his shorts. 

           Harry shakes off the hit. Chasing his much larger opponent 
           ROLAND LASTARZA around the ring, swinging wildly.

           Small for a heavyweight, Harry fights without grace, all 
           balls and heart. 

           Taking in this display are two men who will shape Harry’s 
           future: ROCKY MARCIANO, 25, stocky, with a ready smile; and 
           his trainer CHARLEY GOLDMAN, 62, tiny, dapper. 

           Harry lands THREE VICIOUS BODY BLOWS. LaStarza COUNTERS with 
           a FLURRY of head shots. Harry’s HEAD SNAPS BACK. LaStarza 
           BELTS Harry’s RIBS. 

           In the expensive seats, TWO MEN in tailored suits are 
           watching too. FRANKIE CARBO, smooth, charming. BLINKY 
           PALERMO, squat, muscular. Boxing promoters and Mafia 
           soldiers. 

           The BELL sounds. His right eye swelling, Harry shakes his 
           head at LaStarza - no dice, asshole. 

           Harry bounces back to his corner. Utterly confident. 

           His trainer, Bill ‘POPS’ Miller, 50’s, West-Indian born, 
           never seen without a beret, holds an ice-cold SILVER DOLLAR 
           to Harry’s SWELLING EYE:
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 POPS
                        I told you, stop that friggin’ 
                        swinging bullshit. You want to win? 
                        Box. 

           A BOY climbs into the ring with the ‘4’ round card. 

           Peretz SHOUTS out from the cheap seats:

                                 PERETZ
                             (Yiddish)
                        Hit him in the balls!

           Harry grins. Pops pours water into Harry’s mouth. 

                                 POPS
                        Spit.    

           But Harry’s distracted by the SPORTS WRITERS surrounding the 
           ring, scribbling notes - except Emory. Face bruised. Meeting 
           Harry’s gaze, a challenge. 

                                 POPS (CONT’D)
                        Harry. Harry!

           POPS smacks Harry across the face.  

                                 POPS (CONT’D)
                        Keep your eyes on me. Spit. 

           Harry spits BLOODY FLUID into the bucket. 

                                 REFEREE
                        Seconds out! Round Four!

           Harry jumps to his feet. As Pops gets out of the ring:

                                 POPS
                        Stop chasing him. Don’t look for 
                        the knockout! 

           The bell RINGS. Harry launches himself at LaStarza. 

           Pops shakes his head. Harry never listens. 

           Harry and LaStarza CLINCH, Harry struggling to free his arms. 
           Forehead pushed awkwardly into LaStarza’s shoulder, Harry 
           catches a glimpse of -

           - a handsome SS OFFICER in the audience. Grey-green uniform, 
           DEATH’S HEAD collar and cap. SCHNEIDER. Staring right at 
           Harry.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Harry panics, pulling himself free of LaStarza’s grip, 
           stumbling backwards.

           LaStarza attacks with a STIFF FLURRY to the head and guts,  
           but Harry barely feels it. Eyes on the crowd -

           - but Schneider is gone. He was never there. 

           Harry snaps out of, swinging at LaStarza - who COUNTERS with 
           a HARD RIGHT to Harry’s JAW. 

           Harry’s feet slip. He hits the canvas. The Referee starts the 
           mandatory eight count.  

                                 REFEREE
                        One! Two! 

           Rattled, Harry grabs the ropes, hauling himself up. 

                                 REFEREE (CONT’D)
                        Three! Four!

                                 POPS
                        What are you doing? Stay down! 
                        Clear your head!

           Harry pulls himself to a wobbling stand. Hands at his sides.  

                                 REFEREE
                        Five! Six!

                                 POPS
                        Hands in the air! Look him in the 
                        eye!

                                 REFEREE
                        Seven! 

           But Harry’s too shaken by his vision, his eyes darting around 
           the crowd, wild. He looks concussed. 

                                 REFEREE (CONT’D)
                        Eight! You’ve had enough tonight. 

           The Referee waves his hands. It’s over. 

                                 REFEREE (CONT’D)
                        TKO! 

           As the crowd BOOS, throwing trash in the ring. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

           Harry PUNCHES the wall over and over again, bare knuckled. 
           Leaving bloody smears on the drywall. 

           Pops packs up his kit, unimpressed. Peretz sits, watching his 
           brother’s self flagellation without comment. 

                                 POPS
                        Smart, boy. Bust your damn hands 
                        up. 

           Muffled CHEERING and STAMPING FEET on the floor above, as the 
           crowd is entertained by another fight. PLASTER flakes down. 

           Pops tosses Harry a roll of money. Harry catches it. 

                                 HARRY
                        Thirty dollars? 

                                 POPS
                        You got licked. Again. Good luck 
                        getting your name in the papers 
                        now. 

                                 HARRY
                        Thirteen wins. Only six losses.  

                                 POPS
                        All in a row. Because now you’re 
                        fighting men who know how to fight. 
                        Whatever you did in Europe, maybe 
                        you don’t have what it takes here.  

           Pops heads out, disappearing into the dark hallway. 

           Harry throws his thin gloves across the room. Slumps on the 
           bench. Answer enough.

                                 PERETZ
                        Hertzko...

                                 HARRY
                        Don’t.

           Harry strips off his worn boxing boots, body aching. 

                                 PERETZ
                        The war’s over. 

           Harry shoots him a look. Not for him.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 PERETZ (CONT’D)
                        Eight years. If you haven’t found 
                        her by now... 

                                 HARRY
                        Leave. 

           Peretz goes. Leaving Harry alone with his loss. 

           EXT. CONEY ISLAND - FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

           Now soaring high above Coney Island in an otherwise empty 
           Ferris Wheel car, that’s how Harry remains. Alone. 

           Dressed in street clothes. Knuckles swollen. A black eye 
           spreading down to his cheek. 

           As the Wheel rotates, Harry watches the Velodrome lights go 
           dark. The boxing night over.

           LAUGHTER from below. Harry looks up. A group of YOUNG PEOPLE, 
           joking around. Making the passenger car swing. Enjoying their 
           perfect summer’s night. 

           They’re Harry’s age. But he feels a million years older. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (O.S.)
                        Hertzko. 

           Surprised, Harry turns. 

           A PISTOL is leveled at his forehead. Held there by Schneider. 
           The Nazi squeezes the trigger - 

           INT. HARRY’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           - Harry jerks awake. Heat and fear rising off his sweating 
           body. 

           Bright summer light streams through the threadbare curtains. 
           His shitty apartment is little more than a bed and a 
           kitchenette. A bronze statuette of APOLLO his most prized 
           possession. 

           He stands, clutching his bruised ribs. Pulls out a chamber 
           pot from under the bed. 

           BLOODY URINE splatters the enamel.  

           EXT. DISPLACED PERSONS SERVICE - BROOKLYN - DAY

           Bright and early, Harry waits outside an elegant Victorian 
           office building, impatient. Bruised face drawing stares.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           A CLERK unlocks the door from the inside. Kippah marking him 
           as Jewish, his accent pure New York.  

                                 CLERK
                        Mr Haft. I told you, come back in a 
                        month. 

           Harry pushes past him, heading inside. 

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           A tiny office, crammed with immigration records. 

           Harry stands, while the Clerk flicks through recent records. 
           Chewing on a CIGAR that makes Harry’s nose twitch. 

                                 HARRY
                        Leah Pablanski. Belchatow, Poland. 

                                 CLERK
                        I remember. Still nothing 
                        registered. Let’s go through the 
                        questions again. 

           The Clerk blows out smoke.

                                 CLERK (CONT’D)
                        Could she be under another name? 

                                 HARRY
                        No.

                                 CLERK
                        I’ll mark it as a possibility. 
                        Maybe she got married. Birth date? 

                                 HARRY
                        March 18.    

                                 CLERK
                        When was the last time you had 
                        contact?

                                 HARRY

           The Clerk exhales another puff of smoke in Harry’s face.   

                                 CLERK
                        Eight years ago. Mr Haft, are you 
                        sure she survived?

           Harry smacks the cigar out of the Clerk’s hand. Grabs him by 
           the jacket, SLAMMING his face down on the table. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 HARRY
                        Look again.

                                 CLERK
                        Get off me! Miriam! Call the cops!

           A young woman bursts through the side door of the office. 
           MIRIAM, early 20’s, a Brooklyn native, deeply empathetic. 

           She takes in the situation in a heartbeat. The camp tattoo. 
           Harry’s rage. Unafraid, she places her hand on his shoulder. 

                                 MIRIAM
                             (Yiddish)
                        I need you to let him go. Please.

           Something about Miriam calms Harry down. He lets the guy go.   

                                 CLERK
                        You fucking animal!

           Miriam steps between them. Placating. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        Let me show you out, Mr Haft.

                                 HARRY
                             (to Clerk, a threat)
                        Leah Pablanski. 

           EXT. DISPLACED PERSONS SERVICE - BROOKLYN - DAY

           Harry pushes out onto the busy street. Miriam follows.  

                                 MIRIAM
                        Mr Haft? I want to apologize for my 
                        boss. 

           Harry stops, forcing himself to calm down.  

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        You hear terrible stories all day, 
                        maybe you lose a little kindness...

           Post-war, Harry saves whatever gentleness he has left 
           exclusively for women.  

                                 HARRY
                        Not you. 

           Self-conscious under the charm of his rare smile: 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 MIRIAM
                        My problem’s the opposite. Too soft-
                        hearted.

                                 HARRY
                        What is your name?

                                 MIRIAM
                        Miriam. Miriam Wofsoniker. 

                                 HARRY
                        Can you help me, Miriam?

                                 MIRIAM
                        Me? I’m a volunteer, one day a 
                        week, to do the paperwork. 

                                 HARRY
                        Please.

                                 MIRIAM
                        This Leah... She’s a relative?

                                 HARRY
                        We were going to be married.

                                 MIRIAM
                        You must have been very young.

                                 HARRY
                        Nobody is young in a war. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        And she was taken to which camp? 
                        Ravensbrück? Auschwitz? Belsen?

           Harry doesn’t have a clue. It kills him.  

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        Mr Haft, forgive me, but...

                                 HARRY
                        My mother, three sisters and three 
                        brothers are dead. I feel them 
                        inside, gone. Not her. She’s alive. 

           Swayed by the fervor of his belief and despair, Miriam nods. 
           She’ll try. 

           EXT. BROOKLYN BOXING GYM - DAY

           Harry leans against a car, waiting impatiently. Examining his 
           bruises in the side mirror. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Pugilistic sounds - HEAVY BAGS, SPEED BAGS and SKIPPING ROPES 
           - emanate from the second floor window.

           Boxing manager, Herschel MANDELL, 40’s, emerges through the 
           doorway. A shark in a snappy suit. Occasionally with a heart.  

                                 HARRY
                        You were not at my fight, Mandell. 

                                 MANDELL
                        You mean your latest screw-up? I’m 
                        cut up about that inside, really. 
                        You’re not my only boxer, kid.

                                 HARRY
                        I need to fight again. 

                                 MANDELL
                        And I need to preserve my 
                        reputation - and your damn face. 
                        Look at that eye. Protect yourself, 
                        you’re a handsome man. Take a few 
                        months off. 

                                 HARRY
                        Get me a fight now. I won’t lose.

                                 MANDELL
                        How hard did LaStarza hit you? What 
                        do you want it for? Money? Titles? 
                        Broads? 

                                 HARRY
                        You can have half my purse.

           Now Mandell’s listening. 

                                 MANDELL
                        Ever heard of the Brockton 
                        Blockbuster? Dago kid. 

                                 HARRY
                        Rocky Marciano. 185 pounds. 17 
                        wins, 16 knockouts.  

                                 MANDELL
                        Of course you have. He saw you 
                        fight. He wants you, July 18. Ten 
                        rounds, Rhode Island.   

           If Harry still believed in God, this’d be the answer to his 
           prayers.

                                 MANDELL (CONT’D)
                        Don’t look so happy, kid. You’re a 
                        tomato can to Marciano. Understand? 
                        A bum. He’s gonna be the world 
                        champ one day, so they don’t want 
                        you, they want your story. The real 
                        one, to drum up extra cash at the 
                        gate. You wanna be famous? Then 
                        start telling the truth about what 
                        happened in the camps. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BROOKLYN DINER - DAY

           Emory. Even with a black eye courtesy of Harry’s fists, he 
           can’t disguise his triumph. He lights a cigarette.

                                 EMORY
                        Smoke?

           ON Harry, sitting opposite him. Hating this already. 

                                 HARRY
                        Never. 

                                 EMORY
                        Not even in the camps?

                                 HARRY
                        You could swap them for food. 

                                 EMORY
                        Then you understand deals. Here’s 
                        mine. I write your real story, no 
                        bullshit, and it hits the papers 
                        before the Marciano fight. 

                                 HARRY
                        What’s in this for you?

                                 EMORY
                        I’m a journalist. I seek the truth. 

           A WAITRESS puts a black coffee in front of Harry. Eyes 
           flickering between the men and their matching bruises. Harry 
           smiles his thanks at her. 

           As she walks away:

                                 HARRY
                        Nobody wants the truth about the 
                        camps.  
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 EMORY
                        Try me. 

           Emory takes out a notepad and pen. A beat, then Harry nods. 

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        You said you survived Auschwitz for 
                        six months.

                                 HARRY
                        Auschwitz-Birkenau. 

                                 EMORY
                        And then you were moved to another 
                        camp. Why? 

                                 HARRY
                        I got lucky. 

                                 EMORY
                        I heard you were protected by an SS 
                        Officer.

           Emory’s done his homework. 

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        What was his name? 

           Harry sips his coffee. The name leaving a bitter taste in his 
           mouth. 

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        You don’t give me honesty, I don’t 
                        make you famous. It’s that simple. 

                                 HARRY
                        Schneider. 

                                 EMORY
                        Why’d he pick you? 

           As Emory waits, pen poised:

           FLASHBACK: INT. AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU GAS CHAMBER - DAY 1943

           YOUNG HARRY waits outside a sealed door. His head shaved, 
           tattoo fresh. He’s gaunt, but wearing ‘normal’ clothes and a 
           metal SONDERKOMMANDO BADGE.

           WAILS and an arrhythmic THUMPING from behind the door grow 
           weaker. Harry closes his eyes. Blocking it out.

           A hand clasps his shoulder, tender, bracing. JEAN, French, a 
           father figure to Harry. Holding a long metal hook. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Silence. Jean nods. Harry ties a rag over his mouth and nose. 
           Unlocks the door.  

           A NAKED DEAD BODY hits the floor in front of them. Skin 
           stained black and blue from Zyklon B. 

           INT. CREMATORIUM - DAY

           Covered with sweat and ash, Harry and Jean push a METAL CART 
           of naked CORPSES along tracks towards a roaring OVEN. 

           Their crematorium is one of many. PAIRS of men, stripped to 
           the waist, robotically feed BODIES to the flames. 

           Harry and Jean tip the cart, spilling the corpses. 

           Pliers in hand, Harry opens a DEAD MAN’S MOUTH. Seeking gold. 
           Nothing. Behind him, Jean YANKS a GOLD TOOTH free. Drops it 
           into a bucket. 

           From outside, an off-key WHISTLING. A popular NAZI MARCH. 

           Fear ripples through the men. They work faster. 

           Harry and Jean pick up a BODY with metal hooks, hauling it 
           into the oven. 

           The WHISTLING GETS LOUDER as an SS Sturmmann (Stormtrooper) 
           KUTTNER enters the crematorium. Hand on his pistol. Watching 
           the Jewish prisoners work. 

           A long, tense beat. Satisfied, Kuttner moves on. 

           Harry pulls the next corpse out of the pile by the ankles - 
           the body of a YOUNG GIRL. She did not die a peaceful death.  

           Harry backs away. VOMITING up his meager breakfast. 

                                 JEAN
                             (Yiddish)
                        Close your eyes. Breathe. 

           Harry hates his weakness, but closes his eyes. 

           Jean gently picks up the girl’s body, cradling her in his 
           arms. Farewelling her in the only way he knows how. 

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                             (Hebrew)
                        Adonai dayan ha-emet. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           INT. SONDERKOMMANDO BARRACKS - NIGHT

           Harry’s eyes are open. Lying shoulder to shoulder with Jean 
           on a straw mattress covering a wooden platform. Sharing a 
           thin blanket. 

           Jean murmurs the MOURNER'S KADDISH to himself. A clear, calm 
           refrain amongst the SNORES, SOBS and GROANS of the men 
           crowded in misery among them.

           In SUBTITLED YIDDISH:

                                 HARRY
                        Stop. It won’t help. 

                                 JEAN
                        If we don’t mourn the dead, who 
                        will?

           Harry turns away, blocking his ears. 

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        This will pass, Hertzko. Have 
                        faith. 

           Jean resumes PRAYING, twisting a wedding band woven from 
           grass around his finger. A reminder of the life he used to 
           have. 

           Harry listens. Finding comfort in the sound of his friend’s 
           voice, if not his words. 

           Pulling up his thin shirt, Harry’s fingers gently brush the 
           knotted SCAR on his torso, left by Leah’s stitches. Proof 
           that she existed. 

           EXT. CREMATORIUM - DAY

           Marching two by two, Harry, Jean and THIRTY SONDERKOMMANDO 
           move towards the Crematorium, watched by SS GUARDS and 
           growling DOGS. 

           The group crosses with the exhausted MEN of the previous 
           shift. 

           SMOKE billows from the solitary chimney. ASH falls from the 
           sky. EMPTY WAGONS outside the crematorium door. 

           Harry notices Kuttner saluting an SS Scharführer (Squad 
           Leader) holding a clipboard. Handsome, elegant, with ideal 
           Aryan coloring. SCHNEIDER, 30.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           EXT. AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU FOREST - DAY

           Birch trees sway. A gentle breeze kicks up clouds of SMOKE 
           from a burning OPEN PIT.

           Covered with sweat and ash, Harry and Jean unload CORPSES 
           from a wagon, drag them to the pit, heave them in.

           Kuttner watches, exchanging jokes with another SS GUARD.  

           The FLAMES lick higher, fuelled by the bodies. The smoke 
           engulfing the Sonderkommando at the edge. 

           Harry splutters, spits. Choking on the human soot.

           Kuttner and the SS Guard back off with a grimace, sharing a 
           flask of alcohol. Leaving the prisoners to their work. 

           Harry grimly grabs a pair of ankles - 

           - but Jean is no longer beside him. He’s staring at the body 
           of a WOMAN in the wagon. Head shaved. Desperately thin. 

           Jean digs frantically to pull her out. Lays her down on the 
           ground. Touches her face. Begins to sob. Whispering to her in 
           FRENCH.  

                                 HARRY
                        Jean...

           Harry looks to Kuttner. The Guards have not noticed - yet. 

           In SUBTITLED YIDDISH:

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Jean. Get up. 

           Hidden from view by the wagon, Jean clutches his wife, 
           rocking her body, lost in a world of grief. 

           A SONDERKOMMANDO glances over, expression blank. He’s seen 
           this before. Returns to his work.  

           A distant WHISTLING. Kuttner is moving back towards them. The 
           other Guard heading back to the camp.  

           Harry takes Jean’s arm. Trying to pull him up.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        He’ll kill you. Jean. Please. 

           But Jean clings to the body of his wife. Harry sees no 
           choice. He hauls Jean to his feet. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           In full view of Kuttner, Harry HEADBUTTS Jean, knocking him 
           to the ground, unconscious. 

           In SUBTITLED GERMAN: (until end of Flashbacks)

                                 KUTTNER
                        Fucking animals. Halt! On your 
                        knees, Jew! 

           A SS VEHICLE pulls up in the background. Schneider gets out. 
           Watching Harry sink to his knees. 

                                 KUTTNER (CONT’D)
                        I let you live. I let you work. And 
                        you brawl like a rabid dog. You 
                        know the rules, Sonderkommando? 
                        “Yes, Sturmmann”.

                                 HARRY
                        Yes, Sturmmann. 

                                 KUTTNER
                        You know the punishment, 
                        Sonderkommando? “Yes, Sturmmann”.

                                 HARRY
                        Yes, Sturmmann. 

           Without warning, Kuttner PISTOL-WHIPS Harry, knocking him to 
           the dirt. KICKS him, once, twice, three times. Harry curls up 
           in a ball, trying to protect himself. 

                                 KUTTNER
                        Get up.

           Harry reluctantly gets back to his knees. Kuttner KNEES Harry 
           in the face, knocking him down. Harry spits out blood. 

           Schneider watches the punishment, curious. 

                                 KUTTNER (CONT’D)
                        Up! Up, or I’ll throw you in that 
                        fucking pit myself! 

           Harry tries to crawl away. Kuttner SMASHES the butt of his 
           rifle into Harry’s outstretched hand, SHATTERING BONE. 

           RAGE RISES. If Harry’s going to die, he’ll go out fighting. 
           He LAUNCHES himself at Kuttner, PUNCHING him with his 
           unbroken hand. Kuttner staggers back. NOSE BROKEN.

           Now Harry’s got Schneider’s attention. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Kuttner grabs his gun, aims it at Harry’s head. Harry 
           freezes. 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Halt! Enough! 

           Schneider approaches, calm.  

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        I’ll deal with this Jew. 

                                 KUTTNER
                        Scharführer, his death is mine.

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        That’s an order, Sturmmann.

           A born follower of the Reich, Kuttner salutes. 

                                 GUARD
                        Yes, Scharführer. 

           Harry drops to the ground, on trembling legs. Sneaks a look 
           at Jean, who is slowly regaining consciousness. 

           Schneider casually lights a cigar. Looking Harry over like a 
           man buying a horse. 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        I saved your life just now, Jew.
                        You owe me. Do you understand?

                                 HARRY
                        Yes, Scharführer. Whatever you 
                        want. 

           Schneider blows CIGAR SMOKE in Harry’s face, pleased. 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        You won’t regret that. 

           EXT. JAWORZNO LABOR CAMP - DAY

           Battered and bloody, Harry sways in the backseat of the open-
           top SS car. Holding his broken hand. 

           Driving, Schneider is completely at ease.

           The car passes a line of coal-covered, skeletal WORKERS on 
           the other side of a barbed wire fence. 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Welcome to Jaworzno. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           INT. JAWORZNO HOSPITAL - DAY

           A long row of hospital beds. Most unoccupied. At Jaworzno, 
           serious illness leads to one place - Birkenau’s gas chambers. 

           Harry sits on a bed. Broken hand on his lap. Touching the 
           bleached bedsheets with the other. Like a relic from another 
           world.  

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Patch him up. Feed him well. He’ll 
                        work here until he’s healed. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Scharführer, I will not waste 
                        valuable resources -

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        I’ll be sure to direct extra 
                        resources to you for your trouble. 

           The Doctor’s disgust with the Jew dirtying his clean sheets 
           is palpable. But he nods. 

           Schneider strides towards Harry. Takes his forearm, seeking 
           the tattooed number. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        You belong to me now, 144738.

                                 HARRY
                        Hertzko Haft. That’s my name.

           Amused by this spark of defiance, Schneider inclines his 
           head.

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Scharführer Dietrich Schneider. Do 
                        you speak English?

           Harry shakes his head.

           INT. BROOKLYN DINER - DAY (BACK TO 1949)

           The ashtray is filled with cigarette butts. Emory’s hands fly 
           over the notepad, filled with journalistic shorthand.

           There’s an elation to Emory’s movements. A lightness to him 
           that’s not yet explained. But for Harry, only darkness. 

           His scarred hands clench, in and out, like a beating heart. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 EMORY
                        Why English?

           Before Harry can answer, a whisper in his ear:

                                 SCHNEIDER (V.O.)
                        If you want to communicate with the 
                        wolves, learn to howl. 

           Harry shakes off the auditory hallucination. 

                                 HARRY
                        He knew Germany was losing. That 
                        the Nazis would be punished. 

                                 EMORY
                        He wanted you to speak for him, to 
                        the Allies. The good German. And 
                        you agreed?

           Harry doesn’t like his tone. Or this line of questioning. 

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        What happened when Schneider came 
                        to collect his debt?

           Harry drains his coffee cup. Bracing himself. 

           FLASHBACK: EXT. JAWORZNO LABOR CAMP - DAY - 1943

           Covered in black dust, Harry and JEWISH PRISONERS haul a cart 
           of coal towards the mine’s train tracks. 

           Harry’s hand is healed, his body strong from extra rations. 
           His head shaved, he wears prisoner’s clothing, but he stands 
           out - a Hercules amongst skeletons. 

           As he shovels the coal into a open CARRIAGE, he sees -

           - Schneider leaning against his car, parked outside the 
           barbed wire fence. Impressed by Harry’s recovery.

           EXT. JAWORZNO ROAD - DAY

           Harry RUNS beside Schneider’s car as it bumps across a dirt 
           road. 

           Schneider checks Harry’s pace in the side mirror. Speeds up. 

           Harry RUNS FASTER. Coal dust sweating off in rivulets. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           EXT. JAWORZNO FIELD - DAY

           The car pulls up to a stop in an open field. The BARBED WIRE 
           of the CAMP visible in the distance. 

           Harry catches his breath. Body alert. Unsure of Schneider’s 
           plan. But Schneider gets out. Speaking ENGLISH:

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Take off your shirt.

           Cautious, Harry follows orders. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        You’ve learnt English. Good. Now  
                        Make a fist. Both hands. I’ve seen 
                        you punch. Can you box? Don’t lie 
                        to me.

                                 HARRY
                        No, Scharführer. 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        When we’re alone, I’m just 
                        Schneider. 

           Schneider smacks Harry in the face with a STIFF JAB. 
           Surprised, Harry hits the dirt.

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        Lesson one. Defend yourself.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER:

           Both men are now shirtless. Sweating. Schneider dances around 
           Harry with grace and power, aiming blows at his face. 
           Awkward, Harry SLIPS his punches. 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Slip. Slip. Move your head! Now hit 
                        me.

           Harry lowers his hands. Is he fucking kidding?

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        That’s an order, Jew. Jab, with 
                        your left.

           Harry paws out a weak JAB. Missing by a mile.

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        Hard! Jab!
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Harry JABS HARD. Schneider absorbs the blow with his hands. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        Hit me again. 

           Harry fires a WILD SWINGING RIGHT. No beauty. No finesse. A 
           brawler’s punch. Snapping Schneider’s head around. 

           Harry freezes. Then Schneider laughs, surprised. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        The element of surprise. Very 
                        crafty. You’ve earned a break.

           Schneider walks towards his car. Leaving his shirt, SS cap 
           and gun behind. In Harry’s reach. But does Harry dare?

           Schneider pulls a bottle of WHISKY from the trunk. Leans 
           against the car. Taps the spot beside him. Wary, Harry joins 
           him. 

           Schneider takes a swig, hands the bottle to Harry, 
           companionable. As he takes it, Harry notes a small TATTOO 
           inked on Schneider’s inner arm. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        Blood type. All the SS have them. 
                        I’ll have to cut it out, before the 
                        war’s lost. 

           He’s cheerfully fatalistic. Harry doesn’t know how to take 
           it. But he drinks the man’s whisky. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        I want you to become an 
                        entertainer. Boxing matches, on 
                        Sundays, to help the officers pass 
                        the time and make me some 
                        Reichsmarks.

                                 HARRY
                        Against who? 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Volunteers.

                                 HARRY
                        Jews.

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Correct. Winner gets special 
                        rations. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 HARRY
                        Do I have a choice?

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        There’s always a choice. 

           Harry knows better than to ask what the alternative is. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        All you have to do is win. 

           Off Schneider’s friendly grin -

           EXT. JAWORZNO BOXING RING - DAY

           Harry follows Schneider towards a makeshift RING, four simple 
           posts and a rope strung around them. 

           Chairs and benches provide a comfortable seat for SS OFFICERS 
           and GUARDS, drinking in a festive, bloodthirsty atmosphere. 

           Harry steps into the ring, nervous. A sheep amongst wolves. 

                                 SS GUARD 1
                             (German)
                        One hundred Reichsmarks on the fat 
                        Jew! 

                                 SS GUARD 2
                             (German)
                        What a beast! You’ve fed him too 
                        well, Scharführer.

           Schneider hands Harry a pair of worn winter driving gloves. 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        To protect your bones. 

           A tiny SS DEATH HEAD patch is sewn into the leather. Harry 
           slips them on, sickened. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        Remember, you fight until one man 
                        can no longer get up.

           Harry nods. Schneider moves out of the ring. 

           Body tingling with adrenaline, Harry warms up his arms. Jumps 
           on the spot. Waiting. Feeling the hate-filled gaze of the SS - 
           until they start CHEERING. 

           Schneider ushers in Harry’s OPPONENT. The Jewish prisoner is 
           skin and bone. Open sores on his body. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           This is no fair fight. Harry looks to Schneider, horrified. 
           But Schneider just rings the makeshift BELL.

           Harry puts up his hands, awkward. His opponent advances, 
           desperate, swinging, missing by a mile. Harry steps back, 
           hitting him with a brutal FIVE PUNCH COMBINATION.

           The man hits the dirt. Pushes himself weakly up. Lip split. 

                                 HARRY
                             (Yiddish)
                        Stay down. 

           The watching SS HOLLER and SCREAM anti-Semitic curses. 
           Calling for blood. 

           Harry’s opponent lunges forward, punching Harry weakly in the 
           gut. In return, Harry SLAMS the man with BODY SHOTS, 
           finishing with a BRUTAL UPPERCUT.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                             (Yiddish)
                        I told you, stay down. 

           His opponent SLUMPS to the dirt, gasping for air. This isn’t 
           boxing. It’s a street fight. As Harry turns away, looking 
           into the hate-filled faces of the SS -

           BANG! 

           Harry turns back. His opponent is sprawled on the dirt, DEAD. 
           A bullet hole in his skull. 

           Schneider replaces his GUN in its holster, casual. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        You lied.

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        I said the last man standing wins. 

           Harry sways. Sinks to the dirt. Watching an SS GUARD drag the 
           dead body out. A bloody trail. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        It was a mercy. What would you 
                        prefer - a bullet or the gas?
                             (then)
                        Up you get, Jew. 

           But Harry shakes his head. No more. Schneider hauls him 
           roughly to his feet. Pinning Harry’s arms as he struggles. 
           Forcing him to look at the SS crowd, drunk and rowdy.   
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        These men want blood. Yours or his, 
                        it’s no matter. 

                                 HARRY
                        No. 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Tell me. Who do you love most in 
                        this world? Mother? Father? 
                        Brother? A woman? 

           Harry’s body language gives him away. Schneider’s got him.

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        Is she worth fighting for?

           Harry’s eyes fill with angry tears. 

           EXT. JAWORZNO - BARRACKS - DAY

           Hours later. Harry stumbles towards his wooden barracks. Gore 
           splattering his pants. His knuckles raw, bruised. 

           INT. BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

           Harry enters his barracks. PRISONERS stare at him, some 
           horrified or afraid, others looking on with empathy. He 
           shuffles through them towards his wooden bunk. 

           Harry pushes past them. Climbs onto his bunk. 

           A RABBI, his beard growing back after a violent shaving, 
           approaches cautiously. Offering sympathy, understanding, with 
           a simple touch. 

           But Harry doesn’t want it. He turns away, wrapping himself in 
           the flea-infested blanket. Bloodied, swollen fingers reaching 
           for Leah’s scar on his torso. Feeling every rough bump. 

           Hoping desperately she will forgive the monster that he has 
           agreed to become.

           INT. BROOKLYN DINER - DAY (BACK TO 1949)

           Harry’s energy is as worn down as the ink of Emory’s pen. 

                                 EMORY
                        You kept fighting?

                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 EMORY
                        How many men died?

                                 HARRY
                        Too many. 

                                 EMORY
                        Give me a number.

                                 HARRY
                        Seventy six. 

           Harry takes perverse satisfaction in Emory’s horror. 

                                 EMORY
                        Did you ever think it might be 
                        better just to die?

                        But here you are. 

                                 HARRY
                        Yes. 

                                 EMORY
                        Do you have nightmares? 

           Harry spills his coffee all over the booth, over his lap. He 
           stands up, blotting at it with a napkin.

                                 HARRY
                        No. 

                                 EMORY
                        Ever see things that aren’t there? 

                                 HARRY
                        Never. 

                                 EMORY
                        Hear sounds nobody’s making? Voices 
                        you remember?

           Harry’s itching to shove this asshole’s teeth down his 
           throat. 

                                 HARRY
                        No.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 EMORY
                        But I bet you can smell it still. 
                        The dead. The ash. 

           Unable to take the questions any more, Harry heads for the 
           diner door - 

           - he catches sight of his reflection in the mirror above the 
           counter. But it’s not him. Not the Harry of 1949. His head is 
           shaved. Skin grey. Dark circles under his eyes. Chest bare. 
           Haunted. The JEWISH ANIMAL of Jaworzno. 

           Harry rushes out the diner door - 

           EXT. BROOKLYN DINER - CONTINUOUS 

           - out into the bustling street. The welcome humidity and 
           sunlight. Harry sucks in air - until Emory follows him out. 

                                 HARRY
                        No more interviews. I’ve changed my 
                        mind.

                                 EMORY
                        I thought you wanted your name in 
                        lights. Play this right, you could 
                        even be on television.

           Harry pushes past him. But Emory’s not done. 

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        I heard you’re looking for someone. 
                        A girl from home. 

           Harry stops. Like Emory knew he would. 

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        Figured that’s why you want to be 
                        famous so badly. She sees your name 
                        in the papers, she knows where to 
                        find you, right? 

           Harry’s rattled by the depth of Emory’s understanding. 

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got connections all over the 
                        world. I can help you find her. 

           There’s a yearning in Emory’s voice that Harry doesn’t yet 
           understand. 

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        Your choice, Harry. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Off Harry, realizing he’s made a deal with Devil. Again. 

           INT. UPTOWN GYM - HARLEM - DAY

           Sunlight streams through dirty windows onto faded posters of 
           African-American boxers, Jack Johnson to Joe Louis. 

           BOYS and MEN of all skill levels skip, work heavy bags and 
           speed bags. 

           In the ring, Harry and COLEY WALLACE spar, sweating in worn 
           headgear. Coley’s 21, African-American, with an easy smile. 

           Mandell, Pop and Emory are watching. 

                                 POP
                        What are you swinging for, Haft? 
                        This ain’t no bar brawl. Box! 

           Harry grunts, absorbing punishing blows to the gut. He 
           clinches with the taller man.

                                 POP (CONT’D)
                        Coley, don’t let him tangle you up! 

           As Harry sends Coley reeling back with a flurry of blows:

                                 MANDELL
                        That’s right. You’re a fucking 
                        animal, Harry! You hear me?
                             (to Emory)
                        You write that down for Marciano. A 
                        fucking animal. 

           But Mandell’s words have the opposite effect on Harry. A 
           whisper on the edge of his hearing:

                                 VOICE
                             (German)
                        Animal. Jew Animal. 

           Harry tries to shake it off. PUMMELLING Coley. But more 
           VOICES join in. Taunting. Cheering. 

                                 VOICES
                             (German)
                        Jew Animal! Jew Animal!

           Harry steps back, dropping his hands -

           BAM! A snappy LEFT HOOK knocks Harry to the canvas. 

                                 POP
                        What the hell was that?
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Emory’s sharp eyes have missed nothing. 

           Harry spits out his mouthguard. Jumps to his feet, leaving 
           the ring. 

                                 POP (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going? 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Harry BURSTS into the tiny locker room, slamming the door 
           behind him. Pulls off his headgear. Sinks to the floor.  

                                 MANDELL (O.S.)
                        You sick or something? Harry?

           Harry braces his feet against the door. Looks up. 

           The walls are plastered with flaking fight posters. 

           ROCKY MARCIANO stares down at him. Fists up. Stocky, strong, 
           a future world champion. Taunting him. 

           Harry pushes himself to his feet. Squaring up against the 
           poster. Forcing himself to be stronger than this. 

           INT. PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO - DAY

           A FLASHBULB POPS, FREEZING an image of Harry. Boxing shorts, 
           embroidered with the Star of David. A fit, heavily muscled 
           body. Boxing gloves. Piercing eyes. This man is afraid of 
           nothing.  

           REVEAL Emory is the photographer. Peretz stands at the back, 
           his gaze flickering between his brother and Emory. He doesn’t 
           trust the reporter. 

           As Emory continues snapping away:

                                 EMORY
                        You’re small for a heavyweight. 
                        Ever consider dropping down a 
                        class? 

                                 HARRY
                        No.

                                 EMORY
                        Hasn’t been a Jewish heavyweight 
                        champ since -

                                 HARRY
                        Max Baer. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 EMORY
                        Madcap Maxie. I was there when he 
                        won the title against Primo 
                        Carnera. Madison Square Garden, 
                        June 14, 1934. 

           Harry lets his guard down a little. Looks to Peretz. A 
           pleasant childhood memory. There aren’t many. 

                                 HARRY
                        My brothers told me about that 
                        fight, when I was a boy. Baer 
                        knocked Carnera down eleven times. 

                                 EMORY
                        He killed two men in the ring, you 
                        know. Never forgave himself for it.

                                 HARRY
                        Because it was sport. Not war. 

                                 EMORY
                        Every prizefight is a war, right?  
                        You think Baer looks at himself in 
                        the mirror and hates what he sees?

                                 PERETZ
                        Why don’t you ask him?

           Emory switches focus. Knowing he has the attention of both 
           brothers now. 

                                 EMORY
                        I found your records too. Peretz 
                        Haft. Rounded up in Belchatow in 
                        1941. German labor camps until 
                        1943, when you were specifically 
                        moved to Jaworzno. 

                                 PERETZ
                        Do you have a point, Mr Anderson?

                                 EMORY
                             (to Harry)
                        Did Schneider find him for you? 
                        Some kind of reward?

           Harry meets Peretz’s gaze. 

           FLASHBACK. EXT. JAWORZNO LABOR CAMP - NIGHT 1944

           A new shipment of JEWS are shuffling through the gate. 
           Starved young men, flinching at the BRIGHT SPOTLIGHTS and 
           BARKING DOGS.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Harry rushes towards the prisoners. A GUARD raises his gun, 
           but Schneider, following, waves him away. 

           Harry searches their faces, going from man to man. A 
           painfully gaunt man turns, confused. PERETZ.

           Harry envelops his stunned brother in a hug. 

           INT. PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO - DAY (BACK TO 1949) 

           Harry gives a sharp nod. Terse. 

                                 HARRY
                        My thirtieth fight. 

                                 EMORY
                        Thirty men. Do you remember their 
                        faces?

           Harry doesn’t dignify that dickish question with a response. 

                                 PERETZ
                             (Yiddish)
                        Why are you letting this piece of 
                        shit talk to you like that?

                                 HARRY
                             (Yiddish)
                        If I break his teeth, he won’t 
                        write about me. 

                                 PERETZ
                             (Yiddish)
                        He has no respect. You don’t need 
                        him.

                                 HARRY
                             (Yiddish)
                        I’ll take whatever he dishes out, 
                        for Leah. 

           Emory can’t speak Yiddish, but he’s smart enough to figure 
           out the gist of their conversation - especially ‘Leah’. 

                                 EMORY
                        Did Schneider ever find your girl? 

                                 HARRY
                        Have you?

                                 EMORY
                        Not yet. I’m still looking. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 HARRY
                        That was Schneider’s excuse too.

                             (to Peretz)
                        What was your relationship with the 
                        Nazi?

                                 PERETZ
                        I don’t remember. Are we done?

                                 EMORY
                        If Harry doesn’t want training 
                        shots.

           INT. UPTOWN GYM - DAY

           Harry works the HEAVY BAG, slow, deliberate, for Emory’s 
           camera. Every muscle defined, glistening, for the lens. 

           In the ring, Pop trains Coley on the mitts, listening to 
           Emory probing Harry’s psyche.

                                 EMORY
                        Schneider was your coach. He fed 
                        you, kept you and your brother 
                        alive. Made you special.

                                 HARRY
                        If I had lost in the ring, he would 
                        have shot me. 

                                 EMORY
                        You were the most protected Jew in 
                        Poland. That was risky for him. 
                        Part of you must have been 
                        grateful. Even learned to like him.

           In response, Harry punishes the bag. Emory knows he’s gotten 
           under Harry’s skin.

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        Were you friends, Harry?

                                 HARRY
                        I was his pet. His trained dog. 
                        Nothing more. 

                                 EMORY
                        Even beaten dogs love their 
                        masters. 

           Enraged, Harry SHOVES Emory backwards. The camera nearly 
           tumbling from his hands. The BOXERS stop training, staring.

                        Too far. I apologize. I’m just 
                        saying, nothing’s black and white. 
                        Good people can do bad things. Bad

                        There was nothing good in what 
                        Schneider made us do.

                                 EMORY
                        Us? Did Schneider have other pets?

           Harry realizes he’s slipped up. But Emory’s interest is 
           piqued. 

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        Another fighter? Did Schneider have 
                        a whole stable of Jews?

           Harry says nothing. 

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        You want this article to go to 
                        press or not? 

           Harry can smell Emory’s need. Despite the threat, Harry 
           realizes he has leverage, power even. Just for a moment. 

                                 HARRY
                        Yes. By tomorrow. 

                                 EMORY
                        This is why I’m the journalist, not 
                        you. No way this story’s ready by 
                        tomorrow.  

                                 HARRY
                        Then I won’t tell you what you want 
                        to know.  

           Before Emory can respond, Pop calls out from the ring:

                                 POP
                        Enough glamor shots, Rita Hayworth. 
                        Get in here.  

           As Harry moves towards the ring, Emory’s hunger for the truth 
           wins. 

                                 EMORY
                        Two days. I’ll bust my tail, get it 
                        to the presses. Deal?
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Harry nods. 

           FLASHBACK. INT. AUSCHWITZ CAMP BROTHEL - DAY 1944

           Blood drips into warm water, steam rising. 

           Naked, Harry lies back in a bathtub. A reward, his first 
           proper wash in years. But he’s too nervous to enjoy it. 

           The room is simple but comfortable. A sturdy bed. A jug of 
           water. Bread and cheese. A Nazi flag hangs over the locked 
           window. 

           Schneider sits on the chair, counting his winnings from 
           Harry’s latest fight.

           Through the crack of the open door, Harry can see two CAMP 
           GUARDS filing excitedly past, led by POLISH FEMALE PRISONERS. 
           He looks away, to the NAZI FLAG hanging over the locked 
           window. A reminder that this interlude is a false freedom. 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        It was a symbol of peace and good 
                        luck, you know.

           Schneider indicates the Nazi flag.

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        The Ancient Greeks, the Hindus, 
                        Buddhists, all worshipped it. Until 
                        the Führer twisted the swastika 
                        just so, and gave us the 
                        Hakenkreuz. 

                                 HARRY
                        Good luck...

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Our world is full of irony.

           A knock at the door. A pretty, hollow-eyed woman of Aryan 
           appearance enters. ELSE, 30. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        This is Else. 

           He nods at Else, who obediently picks up the bath sponge. 
           Kneels to wash Harry’s shoulders. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        To the victor go the spoils. Nobody 
                        has had her but me, so she’s clean. 
                        Half an hour, no more.  
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Schneider winks, locks the door behind him. 

           Harry notices a SCAR on Else’s inner forearm. A deliberate 
           burn. Where a camp tattoo once existed. 

           In SUBTITLED YIDDISH: 

                                 HARRY
                        You’re Jewish?

           Else nods, but indicates a small PEEPHOLE cut into the locked 
           door. Hushed, urgent, she leans in. Continuing to wash 
           Harry’s body. 

                                 ELSE
                        Which camp are you from?

                        Jaworzno. The mines.

                                 ELSE

                        I don’t know him. I’ll ask. Leah 
                        Pablanksi, from Belchatow?

                        I’m not allowed to mix with the 
                        women’s camp. But I can get a 
                        message out. 

                                 HARRY
                        Tell her to survive. That I’ll find 
                        her. 

           Else nods. Struggling to maintain composure. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        How long have you been here?

                        But... you and Schneider, it’s 
                        against their laws.

                        have children anymore. He made sure 
                        of that.

           One more horror in a long list of horrors. Harry takes her 
           hand. Trying to be comforting. 

                                 ELSE (CONT’D)
                        How old are you?

                                 HARRY
                        Does it matter?

           Else takes this in. Steps away from the bath. Unbuttons her 
           dress, letting it fall to the floor. Standing naked before 
           him. Ashamed. A knotted SCAR across her lower abdomen. 

           Desire blooms, but Harry averts his eyes. Shaking his head. 

           She tilts her head towards the door. Harry realizes that 
           Schneider is planning to watch his pet Jews perform. 

           That neither of them have a real choice. 

           Harry looks to the door. To where Schneider waits. A silent 
           vow - one day, he is going to kill the German. 

           But not today. 

           Harry stands up. Wet, naked. Reaching for Else’s hand, he 
           draws her close. Two naked bodies, forced together. Else 
           closes her eyes. Harry strokes her hair, gentle. Determined 
           to find something good in this moment. 

           REVEAL Schneider’s blinking EYE at the peephole -

           INT. UPTOWN GYM - DAY (BACK TO 1949)

           - Emory, gazing through the camera lens. Too troubled by the 
           tale to snap a photo, he lowers the camera. 

                                 EMORY 
                        What happened to her?

                        When Schneider didn’t want her 
                        anymore, she died. In the gas. 

           For once, Emory doesn’t know what to say. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        No more questions. Print the story.

           Harry climbs through the ropes.

           EXT. CONEY ISLAND BEACH - MORNING 

           Early morning. The sun is rising. Harry runs, legs burning, 
           every step digging into the sand. 

           An abandoned kid’s sand bucket floats on the shoreline. He 
           picks it up, half-filling it with salt water.  

           INT. HARRY’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Harry puts the bucket on the floor, water sloshing. Pulls his 
           sweaty running shorts down and PISSES in it. 

           He sits down next to the bucket, soaking his bare hand in the 
           mixture to toughen it up. Leaning up against his sagging bed.

           A KNOCK at the door startles him. He tips the bucket, 
           spilling it on the floor.

                                 HARRY
                             (Yiddish)
                        Fuck!

                                 MIRIAM (O.S.)
                        Hello? Mr Haft? 

           Harry takes off his shirt, mopping up the offending liquid. 

                                 MIRIAM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s Miriam Wofsoniker. Hello?

           Harry pulls open the door, surprised. To her credit, Miriam’s 
           gaze only lingers on his muscled bare chest for a second. 

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        I have news about Leah. 

                                 HARRY
                        You found her?

                                 MIRIAM
                        Not quite. A survivor’s 
                        organization in Chicago found a 
                        woman who recognized Leah’s name. 
                        They made it through Ravensbrück 
                        together.  

                                 HARRY
                        She’s alive?

                                 MIRIAM
                        Until May 1945, at least.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Harry’s legs buckle. Miriam rushes inside, helping him to sit 
           on his bed.

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        Put your head between your knees. 

           Harry does as he’s told. Miriam grabs a chipped glass by the 
           sink. Lets the water run clear, fills it. 

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        Brooklyn’s best. Here.

           Harry gulps down the water. She pats his naked back like he’s 
           a child, before realizing the line she’s crossing. 

                                 HARRY
                        I looked for her, in Belchatow. She 
                        never went home. Where is she?

                                 MIRIAM
                        I don’t know yet. It’s like a 
                        puzzle, I have to find all the 
                        pieces. 

                                 HARRY
                        I can’t pay you, not until after my 
                        fight. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        I don’t want money, Harry. I can’t 
                        take away what you’ve suffered... 
                        but I can do this. 

                                 HARRY
                        Soft-hearted.  

           It’s a compliment and she takes it as such. 

           INT. BROOKLYN JEWISH CLUB - DAY

           Exhausted STEVEDORES mix with GARMENT WORKERS, all reading 
           Yiddish newspapers, filling their bellies with hearty food 
           from the old country. 

           Every plate is scraped clean, every mug drained. These men 
           have known hunger before. 

           Peretz is amongst them, dressed in a worn suit. Finishing his 
           breakfast, when Harry rushes in. 

           In SUBTITLED YIDDISH:

                                 BARMAN
                        I told you not to come back.

                                 BARMAN
                        Outside.  

           Peretz shovels the last of his meal down. 

           EXT. BROOKLYN JEWISH CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           Peretz follows Harry out into the busy street. 

                                 PERETZ
                        What’s so important I have to rush 
                        my breakfast?

                                 HARRY
                        Leah survived. She’s alive. 

                                 PERETZ
                        Someone saw her? Where is she? 

                                 HARRY
                        Not exactly. And I don’t know. Yet. 

                                 PERETZ
                        Hertzko, don’t do this to yourself. 

           Peretz’s reaction isn’t what Harry had hoped. He deflects. 

                                 HARRY
                        You should look for Sara. 

                                 PERETZ
                        Sara? She’s gone. Everyone we knew 
                        in Belchatow is gone. 

                                 HARRY
                        I can help you. This story about me 
                        for the fight, it’s also about you. 

                                 PERETZ
                        No. I have to make a life here, 
                        Hertzko. Tell that reporter to 
                        leave me out. 

           His vehemence catches Harry by surprise. 

                                 HARRY
                        Are you ashamed of me, big brother?

                        over. But am I proud of what we did 
                        in the camps? 

           Peretz’s own emotional scars, usually so well hidden, have 
           crept to the surface. 

                                 PERETZ (CONT’D)
                        If I could cut every memory from my 
                        head, I would. Schneider, Jaworzno,  
                        even Belchatow. 

                                 HARRY
                        You’re talking about forgetting our 
                        family.   

                                 PERETZ
                        Because I can’t think about what 
                        happened to them. To our mother. 
                        Our brothers and sisters...

           Peretz wrestles himself back under control. 

                                 PERETZ (CONT’D)
                        Enough of that. You should know 
                        I’ve decided to marry Rushka. I 
                        want you to be my shomer.

                                 HARRY
                        Rushka Rynski? From Temple? Why?

                                 PERETZ
                        She survived too. We understand 
                        each other. No questions. 

                                 HARRY
                        That’s not love. 

                                 PERETZ
                        You’re a man, start thinking like 
                        one. Leah was just some girl you 
                        screwed.

           Harry grabs Peretz by his shirt, enraged. 

                                 PERETZ (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you want to be more than what 
                        Schneider made you?

           Harry shoves his brother to the ground. As Peretz picks 
           himself up, Harry strides away. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           INT. UPTOWN GYM - NIGHT

           With ruthless rhythm, Harry punches the DOUBLE END bag, hands 
           wrapped. Taking out his rage over his brother’s betrayal.

           The gym is empty, clean. Pop switches off the dusty overhead 
           lights. Leaving Harry bathed in flickering neon light of the 
           Apollo Theatre next door. 

                                 POP
                        Enough. Go home. Rest. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’ll rest after I win. 

                                 POP
                        Stop. Listen to me for once. 

           Exhausted, Harry drops his hands. Waiting, impatient.  

                                 POP (CONT’D)
                        You got heart. You can take a 
                        punch. But Marciano, he’s the 
                        hardest hitter in the country. 
                        Maybe the world. And he has 
                        protection. Understand? Plenty of 
                        people want him to be the champion.  

           If there’s a warning here, Harry fails to pick up on it. 

                                 HARRY
                        Then they will be disappointed. 

                                 POP
                        Harry, after everything you’ve 
                        suffered -

                                 HARRY
                        - what harm can a man with gloves 
                        on his hands do to me?

                                 POP
                        Marciano could kill you in that 
                        ring. 

                                 HARRY
                        Do you know how many times I’ve 
                        nearly died?  

                                 POP
                        Stubborn kike. 

                                 HARRY
                        He’s just a man, Pop.  
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 POP
                        No. He’s a monster. You ain’t never 
                        fought someone like this. 

                                 HARRY
                        Yes, I have. 

           As he turns back to the bag, popping off a fierce series of 
           BLOWS -

           FLASHBACK: EXT. AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU FOREST - DAY 1944

           - his bare hands weakly land blow after blow into a muscled 
           midsection -

           - before he is caught by a MASSIVE bare fist to the jaw. 
           Harry REELS back against the ring ROPE. CUTS above both eyes. 
           BLEEDING from his nose and mouth.

           REVEAL Harry’s fighting, bare knuckled, in a RAISED BOXING 
           RING in the middle of a forest. 

           Beyond the ring, BARBED WIRE FENCING, CREMATORIUMS, never-
           ending BARRACKS and RAILROAD TRACKS. 

           Harry’s back at Birkenau. Losing to another prisoner, the 
           FRENCH HEAVYWEIGHT, 6 inches taller and 50 pounds heavier. 

           Neither of them are wearing driving gloves. Pure bare-knuckle 
           brawling. 

           An ORCHESTRA of JEWISH PRISONERS plays jaunty German folk 
           music for the hundred-strong crowd of NAZIS and their WOMEN, 
           including the Jaworzno Doctor and Harry’s nemesis Kuttner.

           The monsters of the camps are watching too - RUDOLF HOESS, 
           IRMA GRESE, ELISABETH VOLKENRATH and HEINRICH HIMMLER. 

           The BELL rings. The Heavyweight lumbers back to his corner. 
           Ribs bruised. A bloodied nose. Harry’s given a good fight. 

           Harry collapses back against the post, gasping. No stool to 
           sit down on. 

           Schneider splashes water in Harry’s face. Blood runs down. 
           Harry blinks, trying to clear his hazy vision. 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        You see that man with the glasses? 
                        Do you know who he is? Reichsführer 
                        Heinrich Himmler.

           A name to send chills down the spine of any Jew in Europe. 
           Harry snaps into focus. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        Yes. The head of the SS is here to 
                        watch you die. He knows your name. 

                                 HARRY
                        The ‘Jewish Animal of Jaworzno’. 
                        Not my name.

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Then show him who you are, Hertkzo.  

           It’s the first time Schneider has called Harry by his name. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        Show him you’re not afraid. 

           The canvas is THUMPED. Seconds out. The BELL RINGS. 

           Harry waits by the ropes. Gathering his strength. The French 
           Heavyweight approaches. A looming giant.

                                 HIMMLER
                             (German)
                        Finish the Jew!

           Himmler’s words open the floodgates. The Nazis SHOUT and 
           SCREAM.

           The French Heavyweight ATTACKS. Harry ducks and moves on 
           shaky legs, until -

           - the Heavyweight DROPS HIS GUARD. Harry ATTACKS. No finesse. 
           No technique. Hammering the man’s head, body, then back to 
           the head. 

           The Heavyweight staggers back, but Harry follows. Merciless. 
           Until the Heavyweight is beaten onto the canvas.

           The Frenchman tries to stand, but Harry BELTS him back down. 
           He goes still, unconscious. 

           Standing over the Heavyweight’s body, Harry meets Himmler’s 
           gaze. Spits out blood. A ‘fuck you’. 

           The tiniest of victories in an unequal world. 

           EXT. JAWORZNO FIELD - NIGHT

           Harry and Schneider sit on the hood of the German’s open-top 
           vehicle. Drunk, sharing expensive WHISKY from pre-war 
           bottles. 

           Harry is a mess. His face and body battered  from the French 
           Heavyweight’s blows. But he - and Schneider - are elated.  
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Himmler will never forget what you 
                        did today. None of them will. A 
                        strong Jew fighting back. They may 
                        hate you, Hertzko, but you have 
                        their respect.  

           Schneider slaps Harry on the back. Head swimming from whisky, 
           Harry can’t control his tongue. 

                                 HARRY  
                        Do I have yours? 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Of course. 

                                 HARRY
                        But you’re Schutzstaffel. Like 
                        them.

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        So?

                                 HARRY
                        So you hate what I am. 

           Schneider’s taken aback, even wounded by the suggestion. 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        I never hated Jews. That kind of 
                        passion is for simple minds. 

           He sweeps an arm behind them, where Jaworzno’s guard tower 
           SEARCHLIGHTS blink and flare in the distance. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        All this unpleasantness in the 
                        camps was just a means to an end.  
                        But I don’t blame you for not 
                        seeing that. 

           Harry doesn’t trust himself to speak. Schneider’s eager to 
           make himself understood. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        When I was a student of history and 
                        philosophy, one work spoke to me 
                        above all others. “You must either 
                        conquer and rule, or serve and 
                        lose, suffer or triumph, be the 
                        anvil or the hammer”. The SS was my 
                        chance to be part of rebuilding our 
                        nation.
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        But choosing to be the hammer 
                        doesn’t mean I enjoy striking the 
                        anvil.

                                 HARRY
                        Then why do it? 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        It was inevitable. All great 
                        empires are built off the 
                        destruction of other people. The 
                        Romans over the Gauls. Mongols, the 
                        Chinese. Normans, the Saxons. And 
                        now, Germans over the Jews. Hitler 
                        was not the first to try. Your race 
                        has been expelled from every 
                        Christian country over the past 
                        thousand years.

                                 HARRY
                        For doing nothing. For living.  

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        But they didn’t fight back, did 
                        they? Any logical person would see 
                        this coming, when Hitler rose to 
                        power. The stripping away of your 
                        rights. The beatings. The 
                        humiliations. But still your people 
                        refused to save themselves and 
                        leave.

           Harry says nothing. The rage burning inside him too dangerous 
           to see free. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        I need to piss.

           With fumbling hands, Schneider unbuttons his belt, dumping it 
           - with his PISTOL - in the seat of the car. He moves away, 
           his back to Harry. 

           Harry’s gaze falls on the gun. He could reach it. He could 
           shoot this man dead. 

           Pissing, Schneider looks up at the night sky. To the moon and 
           endless stars. Regretful.

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        I thought Germany could be made 
                        great in a civilized manner. 
                        Brutality, followed by peace.

           Harry believes him. But he still inches towards the gun. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        But the monsters of my race were 
                        given free reign. Cruel, stupid 
                        men. Germany will fall and I will 
                        testify to every horror. 

           Harry picks up the gun. Battered hands trembling. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        If you want to shoot me, you’ll 
                        have to take the safety off. 

           Schneider turns, buttoning his pants. Calm, even with a GUN 
           pointed directly at his chest. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        But tell me, my friend, where will 
                        you go? In a stolen SS car? Will 
                        you leave your brother behind, to 
                        die without my protection? How will 
                        you ever find Leah?

           Schneider approaches, predatory and paternal, all at once. 
           Leans against the car. Seemingly completely at ease. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        Ask yourself, is this truly a 
                        survivor’s move? To kill the one 
                        man standing between you and the 
                        gas?

           Hating himself, Harry allows Schneider to take the gun from 
           him. Schneider keeps it out of the holster, in his hand. 

                                 HARRY
                        If you’re going to shoot me...

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Why would I do that? 

           Schneider smiles. Picks up his whisky bottle, clinking it 
           against Harry’s.  

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        Prost. 

           Schneider drinks. Cautious, Harry drinks too.  

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        In English, it’s “cheers”. What do 
                        your people say? 

                                 HARRY
                        L’Chaim.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        L’Chaim. What does that mean?

                                 HARRY
                        To life.

           The irony is not lost on either of them. 

           Suddenly, Schneider PISTOL WHIPS Harry across the face. 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Don’t betray me again. 

           Harry spits out blood. Schneider helps him up, friendly.  

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        Come. Back to the barracks.

           EXT. BROOKLYN NEWS STAND - DAY (BACK TO 1949)

           As Brooklyn’s workers start their day, Harry pushes through 
           the crowd towards a stand selling colorful magazines, 
           cigarettes, sodas and newspapers. 

           The worker, an ITALIAN-AMERICAN BOY, stares at Harry as he 
           rifles through a New York paper. 

                                 BOY
                        You’re him, ain’t you? The Jewish 
                        Animal. 

           The boy takes the paper from Harry, flipping it open to the 
           right page. Emory’s article. 

                                 BOY (CONT’D)
                        Here. It is you.

           Harry can’t read the words, but there’s a lot of them - and a 
           PHOTO of himself. Boxing gloves. Bare chest. Piercing gaze. 

                                 BOY (CONT’D)
                        Can I see your tattoo?

           Harry ignores this. 

                                 HARRY
                        My story is in all these papers?

                                 BOY
                        The New York ones. 

                                 HARRY
                        Not Washington? Chicago? Los 
                        Angeles?
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 BOY
                        Why would it be?

           INT. NEWSPAPER BUILDING/BULLPEN - DAY

           Harry strides into a bustling office, full of REPORTERS. 
           Mostly men and a few tenacious women. Small offices ring the 
           bullpen. Cigarette smoke hangs thick in the air.

           A female STENOGRAPHER points Harry in the direction of an 
           office. The door closed. 

           INT. EMORY’S OFFICE - DAY

           The office is cramped. Awards on the walls, none later than 
           1946. A worn couch, with a pillow and blanket folded 
           precisely. On the bookshelf is a mug with a toothbrush and 
           razor. 

           Emory is at his desk, tapping intently on a typewriter. A 
           full ashtray beside him. A framed PHOTO too - Emory in 
           military fatigues, with soldiers. A camera hanging around his 
           neck. 

           Harry enters, slamming the newspaper down in front of Emory. 
           Looming over the smaller man.  

                                 EMORY
                        Is this your idea of a thank you?

                                 HARRY
                        You said you’d make me famous. 

                                 EMORY 
                        I did. Tri-state area. Rhode Island 
                        too. 

                                 HARRY
                        You lied to me. 

                                 EMORY
                        You fighting Marciano, it’s not 
                        enough. Your survival story, not 
                        enough. You need to beat Marciano 
                        to go nation-wide.

                                 HARRY
                        And how do I do that? 

                                 EMORY 
                        Isn’t that your department?
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 HARRY
                        I’ve asked about you, Mr Anderson. 
                        You don’t know boxing. You’re not 
                        even a sports writer. 

                                 EMORY
                        I never said I was.  

                                 HARRY
                        Then what the hell are you?

                                 EMORY
                        Technically, a war correspondent. 
                        Award winning. I travelled with the 
                        45th Infantry Division. 1945, we 
                        liberated Dachau. That mean 
                        anything to you?
                             (then)
                        You should be kissing my ass for 
                        telling your story, because I 
                        understand you, Harry. 

                                 HARRY
                        Understand? Because you saw a camp? 

                                 EMORY
                        Saw? No. I smelt it first. Two 
                        thousand bodies rotting in open 
                        trains. Jews, mostly. 

           Viscerally impacted, Harry backs away. The power has shifted, 
           as Emory knew it would. 

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        I admit, I spent the first hour 
                        yakking my guts up, but I stayed. 
                        To report the truth. Like two 
                        prisoners smashing a Nazi guard’s 
                        face in with a shovel. And the 
                        women’s barracks. That was really 
                        something. Lice. Blood. Shit. And 
                        this woman, dead in the dirt 
                        outside. Holding a little baby. 
                        Both of them shot in the head. But 
                        I stayed. Took the photos. So 
                        nobody could say it didn’t happen.  

           Realizing he’s unwittingly shown his own deep wounds, Emory 
           pulls himself together. 

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        How many sports hacks can say that? 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           But Harry’s seen it, Emory’s truth. So close to his own. And 
           Emory knows it. 

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        You want our deal to end, just say 
                        so. Good luck finding your girl. 

                                 HARRY
                        When I beat Marciano, that story 
                        goes to every newspaper. 

                                 EMORY
                        Then get the hell out of my office 
                        and focus on your job. 

           Harry heads out, leaving Emory regretting his outburst, the 
           self-revelation. With shaking hands, he grabs a cigarette. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - DAY

           The reservoir WATER shimmers in the heat. Young BOYS fish. 
           LOVERS row boats across the water, shaded by umbrellas and 
           hats. COUPLES neck on blankets on the grass.

           Harry RUNS PAST at a brisk pace, already sweating in the 
           heat. Looking around for something -

           - and there he is. Rocky Marciano, in the flesh. Running 
           stiffly, punching the air in combinations.

           As he passes, NEW YORKERS greet him, point, stare and wave. 
           It’s clear - this is his territory.   

           Harry increases his speed, following Marciano. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NORTH WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           Marciano runs slowly through the WOODLANDS, a stocky bull 
           with endless energy.

           Harry follows at a distance. Watching the way Marciano moves. 

           Marciano SPRINTS, then slows to a stop. Stretching his back. 
           Then turns to face him, affable with a hint of menace. 

                                 MARCIANO
                        You following me?

                                 HARRY
                        Yes.

           Marciano comes closer, trying to place him. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 MARCIANO
                        Seems like you’re a big fan. Ain’t 
                        you gonna introduce yourself?

                                 HARRY
                        Harry Haft. 

                                 MARCIANO
                        Haft. I recognize that mug now. 
                        You’re the Jew I’m fighting. 

           Marciano sticks out his hand. Harry refuses it.

                                 MARCIANO (CONT’D)
                        Come on, that ain’t friendly. 

                                 HARRY
                        You’re not my friend. 

           Rocky laughs, not fazed by Harry’s intensity. 

                                 MARCIANO
                        You know, I read about what you 
                        been through. This morning, in the 
                        paper. Sounds like you’ve taken a 
                        hell of a beating. I respect that. 

           Harry says nothing. Marciano’s affability slips. 

                                 MARCIANO (CONT’D)
                        Okay, tough guy. It’s been a real 
                        thrill, but don’t follow me no 
                        more.  

           Marciano jogs away. 

                                 MARCIANO (CONT’D)
                        See you in Rhode Island.  

           But Harry’s not done yet.

           INT. MARCIANO’S GYM - MANHATTAN - DAY 

           Harry slips through the back door of a Catholic Youth gym, 
           pulling his cap over his head. 

           A CROWD is gathered around the ring, watching Marciano SPAR. 
           Raw, explosive, fighting out of a low crouch. He’s not just 
           great, he’s extraordinary. Terrifying.

           Mobsters Blinky Palermo and Frankie Carbo discreetly watch 
           from a vantage point out of the crush as -
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           - Rocky WEAVES under his opponent’s HOOK. Grimaces as red-hot 
           pain shoots down his back. Covering quickly, he ATTACKS.

           CRACK! Marciano’s OPPONENT hits the canvas. He gets up, 
           shakily - and is KNOCKED straight back down again by a 
           vicious RIGHT. KO’d on the canvas.

                                 MARCIANO (CONT’D)
                             (cheerful)
                        You okay? Someone help him up. Come 
                        on. Get him out. Who’s next, boys? 

           Harry’s arm is grabbed by gnarled fingers. Charley Goldman, 
           hauling Harry away. 

                                 CHARLEY
                        Marciano sees you in here, he’ll 
                        rip your fucking head off. Move. 

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Charley pushes Harry out the back door. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’m just here to watch -

                                 CHARLEY
                        You think I don’t know who you are? 

           Charley pulls the day’s paper out of his back pocket. 

                                 CHARLEY (CONT’D)
                        Hell of a write-up. Poetic. 
                             (reading)
                        “How does a man survive a world 
                        bent on destroying him from the 
                        inside out? To sleep soundly and 
                        look only forward, never back?”

           Charley folds up the article. His gaze finds Harry’s tattoo. 

                                 CHARLEY (CONT’D)
                        144738. That a real number? All 
                        those people?

                                 HARRY
                        Yes. But most of them are dead. 

                                 CHARLEY
                        Including all my family from 
                        Warsaw. That’s the sad history of 
                        our people. We’re always the 
                        fucking punching bag. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 HARRY
                        You’re Polish? 

                                 CHARLEY
                        I was born in there, long time ago.  
                        Charley Goldman. 

           Harry shakes the offered hand, cautious. 

                                 HARRY
                        Hertzko Haft. Harry’s the name 
                        America gave me. 

                                 CHARLEY
                        My real name’s Israel. Don’t tell 
                        nobody. Let me give you some 
                        advice, Hertzko. Don’t come here 
                        again. 

           As Charley heads back into the gym:

                                 HARRY
                        Any advice for the fight?

                                 CHARLEY
                        Wise guy. 

                                 HARRY
                             (Yiddish)
                        Israel, help me. Please. You know 
                        why I need to win. 

           Charley considers, torn. Finally: 

                                 CHARLEY
                        Get out of the city. Escape the 
                        heat, train in the fresh air. Try 
                        Greenwood Lake.

                                 HARRY
                        Why? 

                                 CHARLEY
                        Stop asking questions. Go tomorrow.

           Harry considers - any advice is better than none. 

           EXT. GREENWOOD LAKE - DAY

           Harry stands on the edge of expansive lake, surrounded by 
           green, forested hills. A world away from the sweaty melting 
           pot of the city. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Sucking in the fresh air, he starts to RUN towards the 
           distant VILLAGE. 

           INT. GREENWOOD LAKE VILLAGE GYM - DAY

           Harry enters the tiny gym, panting, sweating - 

           - to see Charley waiting by the ring with Mandell and Pop. 
           Despite his diminutive size, he’s clearly holding court.

                                 CHARLEY
                        You’ve lost seven of your last nine 
                        fights. Marciano’s bigger, taller, 
                        hits harder, has more experience. 
                        Pugilistically speaking, you were 
                        taught wrong from the beginning.  

                                 POP
                        You think I haven’t tried?

                                 CHARLEY
                        I ain’t blaming you, I’m blaming 
                        the SS. 
                             (to Harry)
                        Here’s the big secret. Rocky’s got 
                        a slipped disc. He’s hurting and 
                        wants to end this fight quickly. 
                        What do you do, Hertzko?

                                 HARRY
                        Attack. Make him go backwards.

           Charley and Pop share a mutual moment of frustration. 

                                 POP
                        That’s exactly what he wants you to 
                        do. 

                                 CHARLEY
                        He’ll just plant himself and 
                        counter you. No, you make him come 
                        to you. Keep your distance, make 
                        him miss, then move, so he has to 
                        chase you. 

                                 MANDELL
                        Get to the good part, Charley. 

                                 CHARLEY
                        I’ll give you two days training. 
                        But you never tell nobody I was 
                        here. Nobody. Got it?
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 HARRY
                        Why would you help me win? 

                                 CHARLEY
                        Win? Boychik, all I’m giving you is 
                        the chance to lose with a little 
                        dignity. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’m not going to lose. 

                                 POP
                        Prove it. 

           Pop holds the ring ropes open. An invitation - and a 
           challenge. Harry climbs in.

           EXT. GREENWOOD LAKE ROAD - NIGHT

           Haloed in the headlights of Mandell’s car trailing him, Harry 
           runs along the shore road. Punching, slipping and bobbing as 
           he moves. 

           Mandell drives. Charley calls out from the car window:

                                 CHARLEY
                        Chin down. Tuck it into your 
                        shoulder when you throw that jab. 
                        Then move your head. Don’t give 
                        Rocky a target.  

           Harry listens. Learning. Doing as he’s told.  

                                 MANDELL
                             (impressed)
                        Sure we can’t convince you to 
                        switch teams?

                                 CHARLEY
                        Don’t push your luck.

           Harry picks up the pace. Supremely fit, supremely confident.

           FIREWORKS EXPLODE INTO THE SKY from a lakeside hotel. 

           Instinctively, Harry hits the ground, covering his head. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           FLASHBACK. EXT. JAWORZNO CAMP - NIGHT 1945

           Harry’s nightmarish memory. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           BOMBS light up the night sky on the outskirts of the camp. 
           Deafeningly loud. RUSSIAN WAR PLANES zoom overhead. 

           Flat on the ICY GROUND, covering his head, Harry hears 
           GERMANS SHOUTS, the RATTLE OF GUNFIRE, the BARKING of DOGS.

           When he dares to look up, the camp is pitch black, in chaos. 

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. GREENWOOD LAKE ROAD - NIGHT (BACK TO 1949)

           Mandell’s car SCREECHES TO A HALT. Missing Harry by inches. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           A tiny attic room, with little more than a twin bed, a bare 
           bulb, and Harry’s suitcase. A place to sleep, nothing more.

           Not that Harry’s doing any sleeping. He lies on the bed, eyes 
           wide open. Still shaken by the hallucination. 

           A KNOCK at the door. Harry jumps. Mandell enters, in pyjamas. 
           Tosses Harry a bottle of pills. 

                                 MANDELL
                        I saw the lights on. Here. To help 
                        you sleep. 

                                 HARRY
                        I don’t like pills. 

           Harry tosses them back. Mandell lingers. 

                                 MANDELL
                        My old man, he was in the Great 
                        War. Got pinned down in a shell 
                        hole at Argonne Forest. 
                             (then)
                        He’s no fan of fireworks either. 

           Harry says nothing. He doesn’t need to. 

                                 MANDELL (CONT’D)
                        Look, kid, if you don’t get your 
                        head on straight...

                                 HARRY
                        There’s nothing wrong with me.

                                 MANDELL
                        Of course not. But you gotta win, 
                        right? Beating Marciano’s your 
                        ticket to the big time. 
                                 (MORE)
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 MANDELL (CONT'D)
                        To finding your girl. And to win, 
                        you gotta sleep.

           A beat, then Harry holds out his hand. Mandell tosses the 
           pills back again. 

           Harry pops two. Turns over to sleep. Mandell switches off the 
           light. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           FLASHBACK: EXT. BELCHATOW RIVER - DAY 1941

           Naked, Leah lies in Harry’s arms on the riverbank. Basking in 
           sunlight and post-coital wonder. 

           As she runs her hands over his flat stomach, Leah’s fingers 
           reach down to his stitched wound, healing. She bends down to 
           kiss it. 

           Squinting at the bright sun, Harry takes a deep breath of the 
           lazy summer air. Hearing BIRD SONG mixed with the gentle thud 
           of Leah’s HEARTBEAT.

           A SPLASHING from the river gets Harry’s attention. Curious, 
           he sits up, looking to the source -

           - to see SCHNEIDER standing in the water. Watching them. Hand 
           on his pistol. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY (BACK TO 1949)

           Dawn light glows through the dirty window. 

           Harry’s eyes snap open. Breathing fast. Panicking. Flushed. 
           Even his memories aren’t safe anymore.

           EXT. GREENWOOD LAKE - DAY

           Harry pounds the pavement until his shaking legs force him to 
           stop. Soaked in sweat. Gasping for air. 

           Down the bank, the glimmering lake beckons. 

           Harry wades in, plunging into the cool water. Dragging 
           himself down to the muddy bottom. Trying to lose himself. To 
           block everything out. 

           Seconds tick by in the silent world. When Harry emerges, 
           taking a deep breath -
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           - a car is pulled off to the side of the road. Charley sits 
           on the hood. Waiting patiently. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER:

           WATER trickles down Harry’s legs, sending rivulets through 
           the dust of the bonnet.

           Soaked, he’s sitting quietly next to Charley, who puffs his 
           cigar, looking out over the lake.

                                 CHARLEY
                        You religious, Hertzko?

                                 HARRY
                        Not any more. 

                                 CHARLEY
                        Me neither. But life makes you 
                        wonder, sometimes. Like I didn’t 
                        choose boxing, it chose me. Pulled 
                        me out of nothing. Nine years old, 
                        my first fight. Love of my life. 

                                 HARRY
                             (wry)
                        Then you need a good woman. 

                                 CHARLEY
                        Both have a way of stripping you 
                        down to the spark of what you are. 

                                 HARRY
                        The Jewish Animal?

                                 CHARLEY
                        Brockton Blockbuster. Cinderella 
                        Man. Manassa Mauler. They’re just 
                        names. Nothing to do with the man 
                        who wears them.

           Harry takes this in. Quiet. 

                                 CHARLEY (CONT’D)
                        See, I believe boxing chose you 
                        too, in the camps. Saved your life. 
                        Brought you to America. Maybe it’ll 
                        even help find your girl. But one 
                        day, if you don’t love it, it’ll 
                        let you go. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Charley clips the embers off his cigar. Putting it back in 
           his pocket. 

                                 CHARLEY (CONT’D)
                        I gotta go back to Marciano.
                             (Yiddish)
                        I wish you blessing and success, 
                        Hertzko.

           Charley holds out his gnarled hand to shake. Harry clasps it.

           INT. RHODE ISLAND AUDITORIUM FOYER - DAY

           SUPER: HAFT VS MARCIANO. JULY 18, 1949

           Cigarette smoke hangs in the air. A crush of FIGHT FANS and 
           JOURNALISTS jostle for position. Emory pushes to the front, 
           watching as -

           - Harry and Marciano enter, wearing only boxing shorts. Rocky 
           is all stocky, powerful muscle. Harry is leaner, slightly 
           shorter. 

           Behind them are their teams - Pop, Mandell, Charley and 
           CUTMEN, wait for the results.

           The crowd’s attention is on Harry, openly gawking at the 
           ‘Survivor of Auschwitz’. But Harry ignores the whispers.

           Marciano steps up to a METAL SCALE on wheels. Waits as the 
           WEIGHMASTER adjusts the balance arm.

                                 WEIGHMASTER
                        Rocky Marciano weighs in at 184.5 
                        pounds. 

           Marciano shows off his biceps, grinning at the cheering 
           crowd. He steps off the scales, winking at Harry. 

           Harry stares straight ahead. Steps onto the scales. 

                                 WEIGHMASTER (CONT’D)
                        Harry Haft weighs in at 174 pounds.

           Emory notes this down. Beside him, a LOCAL MAN scoffs. 

                                 LOCAL MAN
                        What the hell is this kid doing, 
                        fighting at heavyweight?

           Harry hears him. Ignores it.  

           Harry and Marciano switch to fighting stance for an official 
           photo. Staring each other down, fierce. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           The BULB FLASHES. 

           As Harry blinks away the afterglow, he sees a familiar face 
           at the back of the crowd. 

           Peretz. 

           EXT. RHODE ISLAND AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Peretz leans against the red brick wall of the arena. Smoking 
           a cigarette. Waiting. 

           He squints up at the banner hung high above the main 
           entrance: ‘TONITE: ROCKY MARCIANO VS HARRY HAFT’.

           Now dressed, Harry comes outside. Lingers by the wall, unsure 
           how to breech the gap between them. 

                                 PERETZ
                        I said I’d never miss a fight.  

           Aware of his brother’s sensitivity, Peretz drops the 
           cigarette, grinding it into the concrete.

           Harry catches sight of Emory, leaning against a car in the 
           parking lot, watching them. Peretz follows his eyeline. 

                                 PERETZ (CONT’D)
                        Remember what we used to say, in 
                        Jawornzo? If we survived -

                                 HARRY
                        - no man would ever own us again. 

           Harry knows it’s a warning about Emory. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        After I win, I won’t need him 
                        anymore. But he needs me. 

                                 PERETZ
                        Why?

           Harry shrugs. After a moment, Peretz reaches into his pocket. 

                                 PERETZ (CONT’D)
                        Telegram came for you. 

           Peretz reads the TELEGRAM aloud. 

                                 PERETZ (CONT’D)
                        “Dear Harry. Good luck with your 
                        fight tonight. Your friend, Miriam”
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Harry’s surprised. He takes the telegram when it’s offered. 
           Looking over the unfamiliar English letters. 

                                 PERETZ (CONT’D)
                        Friend?

                                 HARRY
                        She’s helping me find Leah.

                                 PERETZ
                        She spent good money sending this 
                        to you. Is she pretty?

                                 HARRY
                        Why do you care? You’re marrying 
                        Rushka. 

                                 PERETZ
                        And you’ll be there. 

           Harry nods. They’ve been through too much to hold grudges. 
           Relieved, Peretz extends an olive branch. 

                                 PERETZ (CONT’D)
                        Have you eaten? Come. You’re giving 
                        up too much weight to Marciano 
                        already. 

           Harry’s all bravado. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’d fight him as a lightweight. 
                        Easy work tonight, brother.  

           Peretz wishes he could believe that. 

           INT. RHODE ISLAND AUDITORIUM - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

           Harry sits backwards on a chair. Strong legs in purple boxing 
           shorts shaking from adrenaline - and nerves. 

           The room is vast. Rows of lockers stretch the length of a 
           room intended for hockey and basketball teams.

           Muffled CHEERING and STAMPING FEET from the ceiling, from the 
           tiered seat above. PLASTER flakes down.

           Mandell lays out Harry’s worn boxing boots. His cheap flannel 
           robe, with the name ‘HARRY HAFT’ painted on. 

           Pop finishes taping Harry’s knuckles. His fingers spread, 
           then clench. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 POP
                        You know the plan?

                                 HARRY
                        Win.  

                                 POP
                        That’s goddamn right. 

           Harry stands, cracks his neck. Shrugs his shoulders. Opens 
           his mouth wide, stretching his jaw. Trying to focus. 

                                 POP (CONT’D)
                        Put your gloves on. Let’s get them 
                        shoulders warmed up.

           Mandell heads over with the gloves, helping Harry pull them 
           on. Loosely tying the laces. 

                                 MANDELL
                        Charley Goldman sends his regards. 
                             (then)
                        I got a good feeling about tonight, 
                        Harry. You look sharp.  

           The DOOR opens. Curious, Harry looks over to see THREE MEN. 
           Frankie Palermo, Blinky Carbo and a man mountain, clearly the 
           MUSCLE. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Sorry for the intrusion. 

           Pop puts the mitts down. Nervous. 

                                 POP
                        What are you doing, Frankie? 

           He moves towards Harry, putting out his hand to shake. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Harry, it’s a pleasure. I read your 
                        story. You’re a tough sonofabitch. 

                                 HARRY
                        Who are you?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Frankie Carbo. That’s Blinky 
                        Palermo. You might have heard of 
                        us.

                                 POP
                        I told you, not him.  
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 FRANKIE
                        I took it under advisement. 

                                 MANDELL
                        What the hell is this, Pop?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Herschel Mandell, right? Take a 
                        walk. I’m here to talk to your 
                        fighter. 

           He nods. The Muscle takes Mandell’s arm, to hustle him out. 

                                 MANDELL
                        No fucking way. Whatever you got to 
                        say to him, you can say to me. 

                                 POP
                        Mandell...

                                 FRANKIE
                        No, that was rude of me. You’re his 
                        manager, you got his best interests 
                        at heart. Stay. 

           The Muscle pulls a chair out for Frankie to sit down.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Here’s the problem. We represent 
                        the interests of Rocky Marciano. 

                                 HARRY
                        So?

                                 BLINKY
                        So you gotta go down in the first 
                        round.

                                 FRANKIE
                        We thought you were just a tomato 
                        can. Take it as a compliment, kid. 

                                 HARRY
                        Fuck you. 

           This is not the response they were expecting. The temperature 
           drops. Pop hastens to protect his fighter. 

                                 POP
                        The boy doesn’t know who you are. 

                                 HARRY
                        Yes, I do. There’s nothing you can 
                        pay me to throw this fight. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 FRANKIE
                        Because you want to find your girl? 
                        I read that, too. Very touching. 

                                 BLINKY
                        Enough bullshit. No money. You take 
                        a dive, or we’ll kill you. 

           He’s deadly serious. Mandell’s afraid now. Pop’s ashamed. 
           Harry hides how shaken he is. 

                                 HARRY
                        You think you scare me? The Nazis 
                        tried that. I’m still here. 

           Blinky pulls out a gun. It’s not a flashy gesture. It’s a 
           well-used tool. 

                                 BLINKY
                        You think we’re fucking with you, 
                        you stupid kike?

           Frankie eases his associate down. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I can see why Pop likes you, Harry. 
                        You got balls. But use your head. 
                        You survived the camps by being 
                        smart. Is a prizefight worth dying 
                        for?

           Frankie stands. No more needs to be said. 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        See you out there, kid.

           Frankie walks out, followed by Blinky and the Muscle. 
           Shutting the door behind them.

           Mandell turns on Pop, enraged. 

                                 MANDELL
                        They own you. You asshole. 

                                 POP
                        They own everybody. You know that. 

                                 MANDELL
                        And how much do they pay you to 
                        steer your fighters in their 
                        direction?

                                 HARRY
                        What do I do?
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 POP
                        Take the dive. You don’t have a 
                        choice.

                                 HARRY
                        No. Marciano thinks I can beat him. 
                        Otherwise they wouldn’t have come.

                                 POP
                        Marciano has no idea he’s 
                        ‘protected’. 

                                 HARRY
                        But Charley does.

           If true, it’s a heartbreaking betrayal. 

                                 MANDELL
                        Goldman didn’t set you up. He hates 
                        that side of the game. But you’re 
                        right, kid. The mob’s worried. 

                                 HARRY
                        What happens if I win?

                                 POP
                        They might decide you’re worth more 
                        to them alive. But they’d own you, 
                        Harry, for the rest of your career. 

           It’s an impossible choice. Harry POUNDS his fists into the 
           metal lockers. Slumps. 

                                 HARRY
                        If I don’t fight, if I don’t win, 
                        Leah will never find me. 

                                 POP
                        Can she find you if you’re dead?

           Harry processes, for a long beat. 

                                 HARRY
                        Schneider owned me. He kept me 
                        afraid. Every day. 

                                 POP
                        And you lived. This is the 
                        survivor’s move.  

                                 HARRY
                        I’m tired of just surviving. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 POP
                        You don’t have a choice.   

                                 HARRY
                        There’s always a choice. 

           Harry holds out his gloves to Pop. Laces dangling. 

                                 RING ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        ... fighting out of Harlem...

           EXT. RHODE ISLAND AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           Harry stands at the entrance to the auditorium. Robed, hood 
           up. Pop and Mandell behind him. 

           The ring’s only fifty away. Hot lights blindingly bright. 

                                 RING ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        ... with thirteen wins, eight by 
                        knockout, and seven defeats...

           The CROWD is thousands deep in tiered seating, but he has 
           never felt so alone. Pulsing with energy. Eyes wide. Nervous 
           sweat trickling down his face. Terrified.  

                                 POP
                        Don’t do this, Harry. Please.

           But Harry’s no coward. Never has been. 

                                 RING ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        ... the Survivor of Auschwitz...

           His gloved hands reach for the scar at his side. Closing his 
           eyes. Desperately trying to summon the memory of the 
           riverbank, with Leah. 

                                 RING ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        ... Harry Haft! 

           He’s terrified. But he’s going out fighting.

           INT. RHODE ISLAND RING - NIGHT

           The ring canvas is speckled with blood and sweat of the 
           undercard bouts.  

           Harry slides through the ropes. Trembling. Scanning the 
           crowd. But there’s no sign of Palermo or Carbo.

           Ringside is full of sports REPORTERS. Front and centre is 
           Emory. Peretz is further back, in the cheap seats. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           A ROAR from the crowd. Harry refocuses. Sees Marciano in his 
           corner, raising a fist to the crowd. Charley beside him. 

           But Harry can’t keep his eyes off the crowd. Desperately 
           seeking the mobsters. 

           Pop pushes Harry forward, to the centre of the ring. The 
           REFEREE and Marciano waiting.

           Marciano’s not friendly now. Utterly focused. He wants this 
           fight over, quickly. 

           Pop massages the back of Harry’s neck as the Referee 
           instructs them. 

                                 REFEREE
                        You both know the rules of the

                        Commission. Protect yourself at all 
                        times. Keep your punches high and 
                        clean... 

           Harry stops listening. Closes his eyes. Trying to summon up 
           his happy memory of Leah. Anything to calm him. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BELCHATOW RIVER - DAY 1941

           The riverbank is empty. There’s no sign of Leah.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           RING:

           Harry jerks, opening his eyes, as his gloves are SLAPPED DOWN 
           by Marciano. 

           Harry shakes himself. Stripping off his robe. Baring his 
           teeth for the mouthguard. Determined. 

           SUPER: ROUND ONE. 

           The BELL RINGS.

           Harry charges like a bull, landing a HARD RIGHT to Marciano’s 
           gut. Marciano absorbs the blow. Surprised. Then loads up, 
           fires back with a LONG RIGHT.

           Harry has never been hit so hard. 

           He recovers, steadying his legs. Hands up. Chin down. Just in 
           time. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Marciano UNLOADS on Harry, battering him around the ring. 
           Harry covers up, taking the blows on his gloves, until -

           - Harry ATTACKS, explosive. Pushing Marciano back. Pounding 
           his ribs, his kidneys, his back.  

           Harry’s not hearing the screams of the crowd. Not Peretz. Not 
           Pop. Just GRUNTS. The SMACK of thin leather on flesh. The 
           WHISTLE of air pushed out of lungs.

           Marciano ties Harry up, forcing him to the ropes. Walking him 
           back like a battering ram. Harry tries to fight his way out, 
           but Marciano’s impossibly strong. 

           SCHNEIDER appears in Harry’s peripheral vision. Standing on 
           the step to the ring. Hands on the rope. Judging. 

           Harry was half-expecting him to turn up.

           Against the ropes, Harry trades blows with Marciano, 
           brawling, slugging. No fancy footwork. It’s rough, even a 
           little dirty. Harry lands a PERFECT RIGHT to the body - and 
           the BELL RINGS. 

           It’s Harry’s round. Marciano wanted a bum. A tomato can. He 
           got a fighter. 

           Harry stumbles back to his corner. Knowing he’s just signed 
           his death warrant. 

           Pop rubs a towel over Harry’s sweating shoulders and face. 

                                 POP
                        You’re a goddamn fool, but you make 
                        me proud. 

           From his corner, Marciano stares at Harry. Cold. Business-
           like. But it’s what’s behind Marciano that frightens Harry.

           HIMMLER and his SS OFFICERS, sprinkled amongst the crowd. 
           Silently watching. As though Harry’s fear has conjured them 
           into being. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           SUPER: ROUND TWO. 

           Harry and Marciano trade PUNCH for PUNCH. Sweat and spit 
           flying. Fierce. Furious. Evenly matched, until -

           - it’s not Marciano anymore. It’s a JEWISH PRISONER. 
           Skeletal. Striped pants. Body crawling with lice and filth.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Shocked, Harry drops his guard. Marciano launches his 
           trademark ‘phantom’ OVERHAND RIGHT. 

           BAM! Harry reels back against the ropes. A nasty CUT above 
           his left eye pumping out BLOOD. 

           Harry covers up. Cheekbone swelling. Desperately wiping his 
           bloody eye with his gloves. He can’t see. So he HITS BACK, 
           wildly. 

           A lucky shot CRUNCHES into Marciano’s iron jaw. Marciano 
           twists to avoid the full blow. A tiny grimace of pain. 
           Slipped disk making its presence known. 

           It’s enough to let Harry off the ropes. But now Marciano’s 
           pissed. 

           Marciano BATTERS Harry around the ring. Groggy, Harry slips, 
           ducks, weaves - but it’s not enough. Rocky’s just getting 
           better. 

           This is Marciano’s round. They both know it. 

           The BELL RINGS. Groggy, Harry catches himself on the ropes. 
           Staggering. But he does not fall.

           In his corner, Pop has to lower Harry to the stool. The 
           CUTMAN packs a thick salve into Harry’s open cut, trying to 
           stop the bleeding.

           Blood splatters the canvas like rain. 

           Pop shouts instructions at Harry, but Harry’s not listening. 
           He’s staring into the crowd.

           The stadium is full of Harry’s ‘ghosts’. Seventy-five DEAD 
           PRISONERS, wearing the clothes they died in. 

           Harry VOMITS into the spit bucket, terrified.  

           Emory sees it, and instinctively understands. Harry’s having 
           a very public breakdown. 

           Peretz pushes towards the crowd to the ring. Helpless to do 
           anything but watch. 

                                 REFEREE
                        Seconds out! Round Three!

           Pop hauls Harry to his feet. Slaps his face. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 POP
                        Don’t you give up now, Haft. You 
                        hear me? 

                                                                CUT TO:

           SUPER: ROUND THREE

           The BELL RINGS. Marciano approaches. A beast. A demon. 
           Unstoppable. Harry steps forward, bunching his fists -

           - but his boxing gloves are gone. Replaced with Schneider’s 
           worn winter gloves. SS skull embroidered.

           Stunned, Harry looks down. The canvas beneath his feet is 
           covered with Jaworzno dirt. A bloody drag mark trailing up to 
           Marciano -

           - who lands a killer LEFT RIGHT COMBINATION.

           Harry’s head snaps around. Blood gushing from his cut eye. 
           Skin splitting. He clutches the ropes, right in front of 
           Emory.

           But it’s not Emory anymore. It’s Schneider. Gun in hand. 
           Ready for Harry’s failure. 

           Harry turns around, DUCKING a wild LEFT HOOK from Marciano. 
           Tangles Rocky’s arms up, shoving his forehead into Rocky’s 
           shoulder. Walking him backwards. Working Marciano’s gut, his 
           ribs. 

           The crowd is on their feet. Screaming. 

           Harry’s dominating. All speed, all strength, until - 

           - his feet slip on a patch of blood and sweat. He hits the 
           canvas. The REFEREE starts the eight count:

                                 REFEREE
                             (counting him out)
                        One! Two! Three...

           Harry’s learnt. He takes a knee. Waiting. Catching his ragged 
           breath. He risks a glimpse at the crowd -

           - and the hallucinations are gone. No Schneider, no SS 
           officers, no dead prisoners. 

                                 REFEREE (CONT’D)
                             (counting him out)
                        ...Seven! Eight!

           Harry jumps to his feet, ready to rumble - 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           - but it’s not Marciano waiting for him now. It’s the Jewish 
           Animal of Jaworzno. Harry himself, circa 1945. Head shaved. 
           Bloodied. Dirty. Dead-eyed and murderous.

           Harry’s nerves fail him. Panicking, he backs away, flat-
           footed - but his dark self ATTACKS. A LEFT BODY SHOT to the 
           gut makes Harry double over. A SHORT RIGHT drops Harry to the 
           canvas. Drooling spit and blood. 

           The ‘Jewish Animal’ looms over him. 

                                 JEWISH ANIMAL
                             (Yiddish)
                        Stay down. 

           Now it’s Marciano above him. Fist clenched, ready to hit 
           again.

           Harry blinks. Blood in his eyes. Trying to push himself up. 
           Then he collapses. His eyes rolling back. 

           It’s over.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 

           Alone, Harry sits on the floor. Leaning against the wall. 

           Bare chest splattered with gore. Hands still taped. Holding a 
           bloody towel to the cut above his eye. 

           A man whose entire future has been shattered. 

           He barely looks up as someone POUNDS on the door. 

                                 MANDELL (O.S.)
                        Harry. Come on, kid. Open the 
                        fucking door.

           The POUNDING grows louder -

           FLASHBACK. EXT. JAWORZNO BARRACKS - NIGHT 1945

           - as GLOVED FISTS on the flimsy wooden barracks. CAMP GUARDS 
           banging on the outside, waking the prisoners up.

                                 GUARD
                             (German)
                        Get the fuck up!

           INT. JAWORZNO BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

           Sharing a wooden platform bunk, Harry shakes Peretz awake. 
           Both men are thin now. Rations are tight. But they’re still 
           stronger than the half-dead PRISONERS around them. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           SUPER: JANUARY 1945

           EXT. JAWORZNO CAMP/TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT

           SNOW litters the ground. WIND moans around the barbed wire 
           fencing. 

           Half-asleep, freezing cold, the PRISONERS are being herded 
           towards CATTLE TRAINS by the Guards. Some are bare foot,  
           dressed in rags. 

           Breath frosting in the cold air, Harry and Peretz stick 
           together, jostled along by the crowd. Wearing long, striped 
           coats. 

           Harry spots SCHNEIDER, unusually dishevelled, by the gate. 

                                 HARRY
                        Schneider!

           Harry pushes through the crowd, pulling Peretz with him. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Is it the Americans?

           Schneider’s tone is clipped. No longer friendly. 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Russians. 

           The train doors slide open. The guards start pushing the 
           prisoners inside. 

                                 PERETZ
                             (Yiddish)
                        They’re going to kill us.

                                 HARRY
                        Where are they taking us?

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Germany. 

           He slips Harry a FLASK and a knot of hard BREAD. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        I can’t protect you anymore. 

                                 HARRY
                        What do you mean?

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Your word won’t save me now. Not 
                        with the Communists. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 HARRY
                        Schneider... 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Get in the train. 

                                 HARRY
                        We had a deal. I’ll keep my word. 

           Schneider pulls out his PISTOL.

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        I won’t tell you again, Jew. 

           Harry’s survival instinct kicks in. He pushes through the 
           crowd, hauling Peretz behind him. 

           Climbing up into a carriage, Harry watches Schneider 
           disappear into the darkness of the evacuating camp. 

           A HIGH PITCHED WHINE assaults his ears. The RUSSIAN SQUADRON 
           is returning. 

           As Harry watches the Allied planes fly overhead -

           - a panicking GUARD slides the METAL DOORS SHUT, plunging the 
           frightened men in darkness.  

           His protector gone, Harry’s suddenly not special anymore.

           INT. UPTOWN GYM - DAY (BACK TO 1949)

           A few days after the Marciano fight. 

           Dressed in street clothes, Harry stands at the entrance of 
           the gym. His bruises vibrant, his face and hands still 
           swollen.

           He watches the BOXERS train. A world in which he no longer 
           belongs.

           Working with Coley in the ring, Pop notices Harry. 

           INT. UPTOWN GYM - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Harry opens his locker. A sad pile of belongings. Headgear. 
           Training gloves. Spare socks. Faded wraps.   

           Pops stands at the door. 

                                 POP
                        Frankie won’t come for you, if you 
                        quit fighting. That was the only 
                        deal he’d take. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Harry already figured as much. 

                                 HARRY
                        You want me to thank you?

           Harry packs his boxing gear into his sports bag.

                                 POP
                        I want you to find a sweeter life. 

           Pop tosses him a roll of money. Harry catches it. Flicks 
           through. Two hundred dollars. 

                                 POP (CONT’D)
                        From Mandell. He don’t want his 
                        cut. 

           Harry puts the cash in his pocket. Closes his locker. A sense 
           of strange, unimaginable finality.  

                                 HARRY
                        What happens when you stop?

                                 POP
                        Depends if you ever loved fighting 
                        at all. 

           Harry looks down at his scarred knuckles. Either way, the 
           proof will be with him for the rest of his life. 

                                 POP (CONT’D)
                        You got out before you got hurt. 
                        Some mornings, my hands don’t stop 
                        shaking. This leg don’t work at 
                        all.

           Harry picks up his bag. Looks at the faded posters on the 
           wall. At the image of Marciano, staring down at him. 

                                 HARRY
                        I could have lived with that. 

                                 POP
                        At least this way, you’ll live. 
                        Good luck to you, Harry. 

           Harry hands Pop the bag of boxing gear. He has no use for it 
           anymore. 

           EXT. UPTOWN GYM/APOLLO THEATRE - DAY

           As Harry emerges from the gym into the sunshine, he sees 
           Emory, waiting under the Apollo Theatre sign. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Before Harry can say anything, Emory pulls out a stack of 
           papers from his pocket. 

                                 EMORY
                        Telegrams to and from my contacts, 
                        looking for Leah. 

           This stops Harry in his tracks, as Emory knew it would. 

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sticking to my promise. 

                                 HARRY
                        Have you found her?

                                 EMORY
                        Survivors, they didn’t just come to 
                        America. I’ll keep looking, for a 
                        price. 

                                 HARRY
                        Another deal?

                                 EMORY
                        You owe me the end of your story. 

                                 HARRY
                        Owe you? No win, no story, 
                        remember? Your rules. 

                                 EMORY
                        Maybe those rules have changed. 
                        People need to know the truth. 

           But Harry sees through it, to Emory’s need. 

                                 HARRY
                        You need to know. 

           Harry pushes past Emory, walking down the busy street. 

                                 EMORY
                        Wait. What do you want, money?

           Emory digs in his pockets, pulling out cash. 

                                 HARRY
                        I want Leah back. You can’t give me 
                        that. 

           Harry keeps walking. Desperate, Emory chases after him.  
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 EMORY
                        Harry. Come on. Wait! You want me 
                        to beg, you son of a bitch?

           Emory hauls Harry by the shoulder, turning him around. 
           Instinctively, Harry DROPS HIM with a hard GUT PUNCH.  

                                 HARRY
                        Stay down.

           But Emory pushes himself up, gasping. Defiant.

                                 EMORY
                        What do you want to hear, Harry? 
                        I’m weak? You win. Call me whatever 
                        you want. Hit me until I’m out 
                        cold. But I haven’t slept sober in 
                        years, until I started writing your 
                        story. Living it, in my head. 
                        Letting it out on the page. And 
                        when I told you about Dachau... it 
                        was like dropping a stone I’d be 
                        carrying around for years.

           As Harry considers:  

                                 EMORY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe it’ll help you too. What have 
                        you got to lose?

           FLASHBACK. EXT. GERMAN FARMLAND - DAY 1945

           The METAL DOOR of the train slides open. Four miserable days 
           after it was closed. 

           Harry and Peretz emerge first from the darkness, squinting at 
           the sudden sunlight. Hungry, thirsty but alive. 

           Others were not so lucky. DEAD BODIES litter the carriage. 

           A German GUARD pounds the side of the train. 

                                 GUARD
                             (German)
                        Out! Move!

           Harry and Peretz join the pitiful lineup of survivors in a 
           FROST-COVERED GERMAN FIELD. The Guard FIRES his GUN in the 
           air. 

                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                             (German)
                        March! Any prisoner who falls 
                        behind will be executed. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Harry takes his brother’s hand, pulling them to the front of 
           the line. Determined to survive, the Haft brothers trudge 
           forward, under the watchful eye of nervous SS GUARDS. 

           A long line of exhausted, shivering Jews following. 

           Staccato GUNSHOTS ring out. The execution of the weak. 

           EXT. FLOSSENBÜRG CAMP - NIGHT

           WINTER RAIN lashes down on the surviving Jaworzno PRISONERS. 
           A third less than when they left their camp. 

           Stumbling down a path between BARBED WIRE FENCING, the 
           brothers huddle together. Filthy coats wrapped around them. 
           Peretz has developed a HACKING COUGH.

           LONG WOODEN BARRACKS appear through the mist.  

           SKELETAL FIGURES stand out in the rain, watching their 
           approach. DEAD BODIES on the ground. 

           Another camp. Another hell on earth. 

           Harry spots Schneider in the distance. Rain-soaked, 
           unsettled. Talking animatedly to Flossenburg GUARDS. 

           Suddenly, Harry is slammed in the back by a RIFLE. He hits 
           the muddy ground. 

                                 GUARD
                             (German)
                        Keep moving, Animal. 

           INT. FLOSSENBÜRG BARRACKS - NIGHT

           Dripping wet, Harry and Peretz enter the dark barrack. RAIN 
           drums through holes in the roof. Wind whistles through holes 
           in the wooden walls. 

           MEN stare back. Stacked three or four to a bunk. Vermin-
           infested and dying of starvation. 

           Harry and Peretz’s relative good health stands out like a 
           beacon. Drawing hostile stares - and worse, aggression. 

           In SUBTITLED YIDDISH: (until end of FLASHBACKS)

                                 PERETZ
                        Why are they looking at us like 
                        that?

                                 HARRY
                        Now they have even less to eat. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Harry spots a free space on the highest platform. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        There. 

           Harry uses the last of his strength, pushing Peretz up onto 
           the platform, then climbs up after him. 

           Peretz checks for watching eyes, then pulls a tiny lump of 
           STALE BREAD from his pocket. 

                                 PERETZ
                        Last piece. 

                                 HARRY
                        We don’t know when we’ll have food 
                        again. 

           Seeing the wisdom, Peretz puts the bread back in his pocket. 
           His whole body shakes as he COUGHS. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Try to sleep.

           Peretz closes his eyes, exhausted. 

           Harry feels the prickle of someone’s gaze. Looks down to see 
           a RUSSIAN JEW staring at them from another bunk. Calculating. 
           Harry meets his gaze. Unwavering. Alpha male. Until the 
           Russian looks away. 

           Harry curls around his brother for warmth. 

           INT. FLOSSENBÜRG BARRACKS - NIGHT

           The RAINSTORM is fierce, battering the wooden structure. 

           Peretz shakes Harry awake. Before Harry can speak, Peretz 
           covers his brother’s mouth with his hand. Inches to the edge 
           of the bunk, pointing. Harry glances down -

           - to see the Russian Jew and TWO COMPANIONS are SMOTHERING 
           another MAN. Weakly, their VICTIM kicks and struggles with a 
           MUFFLED SCREAM. 

           Watched in silence by a hundred dying men of the barracks. 

           Horrified, Harry and Peretz pull back, out of view. They wait 
           until the THUMPS and WEAK GASPS fade away. Harry dares to 
           look back over the edge -

           - as the Russian Jew uses a stolen knife to cut a long strip 
           of FLESH from the dead man’s arm. Shovelling it into his 
           mouth. His companions HACK into the man’s thin legs.  
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Harry gags, turning away from the horrors in front of him. 
           Touching the scar at his side, seeking comfort. 

           Certain now that he has to do something drastic to survive 
           this hell. 

           EXT. GERMAN FARMLAND/FOREST - DAY

           Weeks later. Freezing rain soaks the German countryside. Like 
           the end of the war, spring is slow to come. 

           Harry, now desperately thin, walks through prickling, knee-
           high GRASS. His shoes ripped and worn. His striped pants 
           hanging off him.

           But he keeps going, at the front of the line, following the 
           LEAD GUARD. Hauling Peretz, who’s LIMPING badly. His foot 
           swollen, infected. 

           Behind the brothers, the line of Jewish PRISONERS stretches 
           on. Walking corpses. The Russian cannibals amongst them.

           HOOVES thunder towards them. Schneider, on HORSEBACK. Hand on 
           his pistol. His usually crisp uniform is soaked, his long 
           coat muddy. His STALLION is foaming at the flanks. The Nazis 
           are on the run.

           Schneider rides past to scout ahead, without a glance back to 
           the Hafts. Betrayed, even now, Harry watches him go. 

           GUNSHOTS ring out from behind them. The execution of the 
           slowest and sickest. Harry and Peretz know better than to 
           look back. 

                                 LEAD GUARD
                             (German)
                        Keep moving!

           Sliding the bayonet onto his rifle, the Lead Guard moves to 
           the back of the line to join the executions. 

           Even half-dead, Harry recognizes an opportunity. He looks 
           around. The field stretches on over the horizon, but to the 
           side, up the CREST of a HILL, is THICK FOREST. 

                                 HARRY
                        Peretz.

           Harry nods at the forest. Peretz understands immediately. But 
           he’s too tired. Too sick. Too frightened. 

                                 PERETZ 
                        If we try, they’ll shoot us.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           More GUNSHOTS from behind. SCREAMING too, as BAYONETS are 
           used in place of bullets. 

                                 HARRY
                        If we don’t try, we’ll die on this 
                        march. 

                                 PERETZ 
                        I can’t run, Hertzko.

                                 HARRY
                        You can. 

           A DUTCH JEW behind them speaks up. Hope burning like the 
           fever wracking his body. 

                                 DUTCH JEW
                        I’ll run with you. 

                                 HARRY
                        If you slow us down...

                                 DUTCH JEW
                        I won’t.

                                 HARRY
                             (to Peretz)
                        Schneider said the Allies are 
                        close. We just have to find them. 
                        I’ll protect you.  

                                 PERETZ
                        That’s what I promised our father, 
                        when he was dying. I’d protect you.

           Peretz’s sense of failure is palpable. Knowing he’s a burden. 

                                 HARRY
                        When all this is over, you will. 

           A beat. Then Peretz nods. He’s in. 

           Harry looks to Schneider’s horse, in the distance. Behind 
           them, to the murderous, distracted Guards. It’s now or never. 

           Harry takes a deep breath, filling his tired lungs -

           - and takes off RUNNING. Adrenaline surging, urging his 
           wasted legs forward. Sprinting up the crest of the hill. The 
           Dutch Jew at his heels.

           SHOUTS ring out behind them. The Nazis are in pursuit.

           At the top of the rise, Harry risks a glance back -
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           - but Peretz isn’t with him. He’s still in line. Watching his 
           brother leave. A sacrifice. An act of love.

           BULLETS zip through the air, kicking up puffs of grass and 
           dirt. Harry DUCKS -

           - but the Dutch Jew is HIT. Dead, he tumbles into Harry. 
           Falling together down the other side of the hill. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (O.S.)
                             (German)
                        Bring the Animal to me!

           Harry pushes the dead man off him, scrambling to his feet, 
           running towards the forest -

           - just as Schneider crests the rise on his snorting horse. 
           Watching Harry disappear into the trees.  

           Behind the German, the death march moves on. Taking Peretz 
           with it. 

           EXT. GERMAN FOREST/RIVER - DAY 1945

           Soaked by the rain, Harry stumbles through the trees, 
           following the sound of RUNNING WATER. His boots sink into MUD 
           and DEAD LEAVES, leaving clear tracks. 

           A RIVER emerges through the mist. Harry stops to drink, 
           gulping down the water - and freezes like prey at the sound 
           of an approaching HORSE. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (O.S.)
                        What does one do with a rabid 
                        animal? 

           REVEAL Schneider approaching behind him, high in the saddle. 

           Terrified, Harry’s eyes dart to the rocks under the river’s 
           surface. Seeking a weapon. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        On your feet, Jew. 

           Harry stands. Turns to face Schneider, defenseless. Frail. 
           Hands behind his back. But he will not be cowed. Schneider 
           sees it.

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        A fighter to the end.  

                                 HARRY
                        The war is almost over. You can let 
                        me go.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Go where? Back to Poland? You 
                        murdered your own people. You 
                        collaborated with the enemy. 
                        When Europe drags itself out of 
                        this bloody nightmare, there will 
                        be no place for men like us. 

           Schneider aims his pistol at Harry’s forehead -

           - and Harry HURLS a river rock at the HORSE’s muzzle. 
           Startled, it REARS. Schneider topples to the ground, dropping 
           the pistol -

           - and Harry CHARGES at him. SLAMMING Schneider into the mud, 
           BEATING him, all rage and revenge. But the German is 
           stronger. Kicking Harry off, Schneider crawls for the PISTOL -    

           - until he’s HAULED BACKWARDS, choking, Harry’s arm around 
           his neck. Schneider HEADBUTTS Harry. A CUT opens above 
           Harry’s eye, spraying crimson. 

           Schneider grabs the gun, FIRES at Harry looming above him -
           but Harry DIVES ASIDE. The bullet WHIZZES past his head, 
           BURSTING his eardrum. 

           The horse SHIES, galloping away.

           BLEEDING from the ear, Harry desperately GRABS a ROTTING LOG 
           from the forest floor, BATTING the gun from Schneider’s hand, 
           then SMASHING the wood into Schneider’s face. 

           Face bloody, nose broken, Schneider stares up at Harry. 
           Utterly at his mercy. 

                                 SCHNEIDER (CONT’D)
                        Hertzko... 

           Harry hesitates. Relief flashes in Schneider’s eyes - until 
           Harry CLUBS the wood into Schneider’s skull until it CRACKS. 

           But Harry doesn’t stop. He keeps smashing the German’s broken 
           face and skull until it is obliterated beyond recognition.

           Harry falls back. Staring at Schneider’s lifeless body. It’s 
           over. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER:

           Harry, now washed clean, is burying his striped, lice-ridden 
           prisoner’s clothing under a pile of leaves.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           He’s dressed in Schneider’s bloodstained SS uniform. It’s too 
           big on Harry’s starved frame - but the perfect disguise. 

           Tucking Schneider’s gun away in its holster, Harry picks up 
           Schneider’s cap out of the mud. The final piece of the 
           transformation. The perfect Nazi. 

           Harry staggers away, leaving Schneider’s naked body to rot.

           EXT. APOLLO THEATRE - DAY (BACK TO 1949)

           Harry leans against the wall, face turned up to the sun, 
           letting the warmth draw him back from the cold, terrifying 
           memory.

           Emory’s hands shake as he lights a cigarette. Listening. 

                                 HARRY
                        I walked for weeks. Slept in barns. 
                        Stole food. Followed the roads 
                        until I found American soldiers. 

                                 EMORY
                        How the hell did you not get caught 
                        by the Germans?

                                 HARRY
                        I did. Twice. An old man and his 
                        wife. A mother and her son.
                             (then)
                        I left the boy alive. 

           His eyes tell the full story. The horrors of what he did to 
           escape. The guilt he still feels. 

                                 EMORY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 HARRY
                        For me? Or for them?  

                                 EMORY
                        For the whole damn mess.
                             (then)
                        Your brother survived that death 
                        march. How?

                                 HARRY
                        I don’t know. I found Peretz in 
                        Berlin, three months after the war, 
                        working the black market. He said 
                        he decided not to remember. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 EMORY
                        “I like the dreams of the future 
                        better than the history of the 
                        past.” 
                             (then)
                        My wife, courtesy of Thomas 
                        Jefferson.

                                 HARRY
                        Smart woman. 

                                 EMORY
                        Smart enough to divorce me. 
                             (then)
                        One more question, Harry. Seventy 
                        six men. Ever fight anyone you 
                        knew?

                                 HARRY
                        No.

           He’s lying. They both know it. But Emory lets it go.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t come looking for me again.

           Emory holds out his hand. 

                                 EMORY
                        To dreams of the future. 

           Harry grasps Emory’s hand. Shakes. 

           INT. HARRY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Sunlight streams through the open window onto Harry’s bed, 
           stripped of its threadbare sheets. The apartment is empty. 

           Peretz watches from the doorway as Harry wraps the Apollo 
           bronze in a jacket, packing it into his suitcase.

                                 PERETZ
                        Brownsville’s run by criminals. 

                                 HARRY
                        Jewish criminals.  

                                 PERETZ
                        Don’t get involved. 

                                 HARRY
                        I can’t afford to live anywhere 
                        else. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 PERETZ
                        Maybe. I have a job for you. A 
                        factory in Manhattan. 

                                 HARRY
                        A factory.  

                                 PERETZ
                        They need a hat blocker. You’ll 
                        learn. 

           Definitely not a future Harry ever imagined for himself. But 
           he tries to be grateful.

                                 PERETZ (CONT’D)
                        How did you find this Brownsville 
                        apartment?

                                 HARRY
                        Miriam lives in the building with 
                        her parents. 

                                 PERETZ
                        You should ask her to walk with you 
                        one night.  

                                 HARRY
                        She’s not that kind of woman.

                                 PERETZ
                        A date, then. No man should be 
                        alone.  

                                 HARRY
                        Now you sound like our mother.  

                                 PERETZ
                        Because she’s not here to tell you 
                        this. But you know what she would 
                        say? Why did you survive, Hertzko, 
                        if not to live?

           Harry’s worn down. By grief. By his failures. By his 
           confessions to Emory. His brother’s words make sense - if 
           he’ll listen. 

                                 PERETZ (CONT’D)
                        Leah’s not real. Not anymore. She’s 
                        just a memory. A dream. Time to 
                        wake up. 

                                 HARRY
                        I can’t. I never said goodbye.

           FLASHBACK: EXT. BELCHATOW JEWISH GHETTO - DAY 1941

           Harry and Leah sneak down a ghetto street, flushed with 
           excitement. 

           In SUBTITLED YIDDISH:

                                 HARRY
                        What do I say to your father?

                                 LEAH
                        That it’s too late to stop us. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’m serious, Leah. He has to say 
                        yes. I have to marry you. 

                                 LEAH
                        Do you have a coin? 

           Strange request, but Harry pats his pockets. Comes up with a 
           small groszy coin.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        Give it to me.

                                 HARRY
                        Don’t we need witnesses?

                                 LEAH
                        Just say it. 
                             (Hebrew)
                        "You are hereby betrothed unto me 
                        with this ring in accordance with 
                        the laws of Moses and Israel."

                                 HARRY
                             (stumbling Hebrew)
                        "You are hereby betrothed unto me 
                        with this ring in accordance with 
                        the laws of Moses and Israel."

           Leah kisses him. 

                                 LEAH
                        Now my father can’t say no. 

           With a grin, she pulls Harry along the street -

           EXT. GHETTO SQUARE - DAY 

           - out into the central square. Once a bustling marketplace, 
           framed by houses. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Leah stops. Staring at large POSTERS, pasted on every 
           available surface. Written in German.

                                 HARRY
                        What does it say?

                                 LEAH
                             (reading)
                        “All Jewish men aged sixteen to 
                        fifty, must register today.” 
                        Register for what?

           A OLD JEWISH WOMAN hisses at them from a window above.

                                 WOMAN
                        Boy! Get home before the Germans 
                        see you.  

                                 HARRY
                        Why? 

                                 WOMAN
                        Not one man has come back. The 
                        Nazis are taking them away. 

           She SLAMS the window shut. 

           EXT. FIRE BRIGADE BUILDING - DAY

           German SOLDIERS preside over a long line of JEWISH MEN 
           patiently waiting in line. Peretz among them.  

           REVEAL Harry and Leah approaching, hiding in the shadows of 
           the broken-down buildings, as - 

           Peretz disappears inside the building. 

                                 HARRY
                        I have to warn my brother. 

           Leah pulls him back down. 

                                 LEAH
                        Don’t be stupid. They’ll take you 
                        too. 

                                 HARRY
                        I won’t let them. And if Peretz 
                        doesn’t register, they can’t take 
                        him either. 

                                 LEAH
                        Haven’t you noticed they do 
                        whatever they want to us?
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 HARRY
                        Go home, Leah. Please. Tell your 
                        father I have something to ask him.  
                        I’ll meet you there. 

                                 LEAH
                             (relenting)
                        Don’t be late.

           Harry kisses her, gets to his feet. 

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        Wait!

           She hands him the COIN. 

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        Take this. Then you have to come 
                        back to me.  

           Harry takes the coin. Kisses her again. Then moves out of the 
           shadows, fearless. But before he reaches the German soldiers, 
           he turns back, to meeting Leah’s gaze. 

           She’s afraid. Seeing it, he tries to make her laugh. Flicking 
           the coin up, pretending to fumble the catch. 

           It works. Leah grins. Harry watches it. Memorizing every 
           beautiful feature.

           Turning, he flicks the coin up in the air, reaching out to 
           catch it -

           INT. HARRY’S BROWNSVILLE APARTMENT - DAY (BACK TO 1949)

           - and opens his hand to reveal a DIME. 

           Harry’s standing at an open window, looking over the crowded 
           tenement he now calls home.  

           Lines of fresh washing hang between buildings. Kids play in 
           the street below. A NEIGHBOR practices a mournful klezmer 
           tune on a FIDDLE. 

           His new place is a shoebox. Barely room for the Apollo 
           statue. PENNIES and DIMES are spread out on his sagging bed. 
           All the money he has in the world. 

           A KNOCK at the door. Harry tugs the bedsheet over the coins. 
           Opens the door to see -

           - Miriam, holding a basket. A big, warm smile.  
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 MIRIAM
                        Welcome to the neighborhood. 

           Harry pulls the cloth across to reveal her traditional gift: 
           BREAD, a bag of SALT and a jar of HONEY. 

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        Bread, so that you shall never know 
                        hunger. Salt, so your life shall 
                        always have flavor. Sugar, so your 
                        life shall always have sweetness. 
                             (self-conscious)
                        My mother is very traditional when 
                        it comes to gifts. 

                                 HARRY
                        Thank you. 

           Miriam notices the bronze statue.

                                 MIRIAM
                        That’s Apollo, isn’t it? 

           Harry nods. She picks it up, admiring. 

                                 HARRY
                        I won the Jewish Boxing 
                        Championship, in Munich after the 
                        war. General Clay gave it to me. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        Is it real bronze? Be careful. Some 
                        people around here, they have 
                        nothing. Not even morals.

                                 HARRY
                        You have enough for all of us. 

           She places Apollo back down, carefully. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        I’ll leave you to get settled in. 

                                 HARRY
                        Miriam. Wait. It’s a beautiful day. 
                        Will you walk with me? 

           His heart’s not exactly in it, but he’s trying. 

           EXT. CONEY ISLAND BOARDWALK - DAY

           Harry and Miriam walk down the crowded boardwalk. A cacophony 
           of amusement games, food stalls, running CHILDREN, TEENAGE 
           COUPLES and FAMILIES enjoying the sun. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Miriam finishes an icecream with every ounce of enjoyment.  

                                 MIRIAM
                        Do you like it here?

                                 HARRY
                        New York? Or America? 

                                 MIRIAM
                        Both. Either. Does it feel like 
                        home? Not just where you live?

                                 HARRY
                        I don’t know. I haven’t thought 
                        about it. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        I’ve never gone anywhere. That’s 
                        why I love this city so much. 

           She indicates the packed beach below, reflecting the city’s 
           melting pot of ethnicity. 

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        People from every country are here. 
                        The whole world in one place. 

           Harry’s trying to listen, but the competing SCREAMS of 
           delight from the Thunderbolt and Cyclone roller coasters are 
           making him jumpy. 

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        A lot of girls at my work speak 
                        Italian. I told my parents I wanted 
                        to learn, but I guess it is a waste 
                        of money.

           A SOLDIER, hand in hand with his GIRLFRIEND, accidentally 
           bumps into Harry. Harry tenses. 

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        Are you feeling alright? 

                                 HARRY
                        Of course. 

           He stops, clutching the railing. Pretending to look at the 
           beach. Trying to gain control of his creeping sense of panic. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        It’s such a beautiful beach.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Can you swim?
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 HARRY
                        What did you say?

           Suddenly, Miriam’s been replaced by YOUNG LEAH. Asking him 
           the very same question in 1941. 

                                 LEAH
                        Can you swim?

           Harry closes his eyes. Shaking the hallucination. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        Harry?

           There are suddenly too many people. Too much noise. Harry 
           pushes through the crowd, away from her. 

           EXT. BEACH/UNDER BOARDWALK - DAY

           Miriam finds Harry sitting under the boardwalk, head in his 
           hands. Crippled by panic and self-loathing. 

           She sits beside him. Quiet. Looking out at SUNBATHERS on the 
           beach. KIDS playing in the gentle waves. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        A woman at my Temple survived 
                        Belsen. She sleeps with an axe 
                        under her pillow. One night, she 
                        wakes up and sees Nazis at the 
                        door. She chopped that door to 
                        pieces before she realized they 
                        weren’t real.

           Miriam touches Harry’s back, lightly. Unobtrusively soothing. 
           Just like the first time they met, it calms him. 

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        I read your story. What happened to 
                        you in the camps...

                                 HARRY
                        Was my choice. Every fight, I could 
                        have refused. 

                                 MIRIAM 
                        Choosing between living in hell and 
                        dying is not a real choice.
                             (then)
                        Harry... I know you’re not 
                        religious, and I’m no expert. But 
                        what if telling your story to that 
                        reporter was your T’shuvah? 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Miriam takes his hand. 

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        T’Shuva’s about finding closure, 
                        right? Speaking out loud about your 
                        mistakes. Saying, this is what I 
                        did, this is who I was. You take 
                        possession of your wrongs, so you 
                        can start again. 

                                 HARRY
                        That won’t change what I’ve done. 
                        Or bring back the dead. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        You didn’t murder those men in the 
                        ring. The Nazi’s did. 

                                 HARRY
                        Not all. One was mine. 
                             (then)
                        Still want to hold my hand?

                                 MIRIAM
                        I’m not going anywhere. No matter 
                        what you did.

           As Miriam waits, patient...

           FLASHBACK: INT. JAWORZNO BOXING RING - DAY 1944

           SMACK! A PRISONER flies out of frame, blood spurting from his 
           mouth. 

           The crowd of SS OFFICERS has grown. Now they’ve brought WIVES 
           and GIRLFRIENDS. Rowdy with drink.

                                 CROWD
                             (German)
                        Jewish Animal! Jewish Animal!

           Harry dances around as the prisoner struggles to get up. 
           Toying with him. He’s learnt to entertain. 

           A JEWISH ORCHESTRA plays a jaunty tune, dead behind the eyes. 

           Harry beats his opponent to the ground with a LOOPING RIGHT 
           HAND. The crowd CHEERS. The man doesn’t get up. 

           Harry watches, emotionless, as the unconscious man is dragged 
           out of the ring. 

           Pleased, Schneider pours whisky from a flask into Harry’s 
           mouth.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Four down. One to go.  

           Harry just nods. Flexing his sore hands in their thin gloves. 
           Blood stains the leather.

           The final opponent enters the ring. Striped, ill-fitting 
           pants. Head shaved. Sonderkommando badge. Just another lamb 
           to the slaughter.

           Until Harry looks at his face. 

                                 HARRY
                        Jean?

           Jean meets Harry’s gaze. A nod of recognition, even pleasure 
           to see an old friend. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Schneider. I know him. From 
                        Birkenau.

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        The man you protected? 

           Jean removes his shirt to reveal his sunken chest. Every rib.  
           Folding the shirt carefully, he places it down in the dirt 
           with dignity. 

                                 HARRY
                        He’s my friend. 

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        I told you, don’t think of them as 
                        human. 

           An SS OFFICER rings a bell. The CROWD starts to SHOUT in 
           anticipation.

                                 HARRY
                        Not him. I won’t do it.  

                                 SCHNEIDER
                        Hammer or anvil, Hertzko. Your 
                        choice. 

           Schneider pushes Harry towards Jean, who smiles at him 
           through broken teeth.   

           In SUBTITLED YIDDISH:

                                 JEAN
                        I hoped it would be you.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Jean ATTACKS. Harry DUCKS and SLIPS every wild punch. 
           Refusing to punch back. 

           The SS laugh, entertained. Schneider is less amused. 

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        Hit me, Hertzko.

                                 HARRY
                        No. 

           Harry TANGLES Jean into a CLINCH. Mind racing. Trying to find 
           a solution to this nightmare. 

                                 JEAN
                        The ring, or the gas. My choice. 

           Jean KNEES Harry in the balls, freeing himself. Laying into 
           Harry with PUNCHES, a man with nothing to lose. 

           As the SS BOO and SHOUT, Harry lets Jean hit him. Absorbing 
           the weak blows, then CLINCHING again. 

           Already breathless, Jean whispers to Harry, desperate. 

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        Let me die a man, Hertzko. Please. 
                        I want it to be you. 

           Heart breaking, Harry makes his choice. 

                                 HARRY
                        Close your eyes. 

           Harry UNLEASHES a vicious HOOK and RIGHT, sending the older 
           man flying back. Hitting his head on the hard earth with a 
           CRACK. Unconscious. 

           The SS cheer. Schneider reaches for his gun -

           - but Harry kneels. Fighting back furious tears, he puts his 
           hands around Jean’s thin neck. CHOKING him. Twitching, Jean 
           GASPS and SPLUTTERS, but Harry’s grip doesn’t loosen.

           EXT. BEACH/UNDER BOARDWALK - DAY (BACK TO 1949)

           Harry shakes, engulfed by grief. Unable to cry. But he 
           doesn’t have to. Tears slip down Miriam’s face on his behalf. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        You gave your friend a gift.

                                 HARRY
                        Death?
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 MIRIAM
                        Respect. Dignity. A choice in how 
                        he died. 

           They sit in silence, looking out over the ocean. 

           EXT. BROWNSVILLE TENEMENT - DAY

           Harry and Miriam approach the tenement in silence. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        Thank you for the walk, Harry.

           She kisses him on the cheek. Something crackles between them. 

                                 HARRY
                        Miriam... 

                                 MIRIAM
                        You don’t have to explain. 

           And that’s why he wants to. 

                                 HARRY
                        Even if Leah’s gone, she’s not gone 
                        for me. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        That’s why I haven’t stopped 
                        looking for her. 

           She can see Harry doesn’t understand. 

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        When I was bat mitzvahed, I 
                        discovered that Hebrew has so many 
                        different words for love. Because 
                        there are so many kinds of love. 
                        That’s the nice thing about a heart 
                        - it can’t get filled up by just 
                        one person.

           Harry can feel the weight of his future pressing down. Miriam 
           unlocks the front door, willing to leave it at that.  

                                 HARRY
                        I have no money. I can’t read. I 
                        don’t know how to be a husband, or 
                        a father. I will try to change 
                        these things. To leave my past 
                        behind. For you. If you believe you 
                        can... share me with her. 

           As proposals go, it’s unorthodox and painfully honest. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 MIRIAM
                        I can do that. 

           Harry kisses her, sweetly. It’s not perfect. She’s not Leah. 
           But maybe, just maybe, he can be happy. 

           EXT. FRUIT & VEGETABLE SHOP - BROOKLYN - DAY 1963

           SUPER: SEPTEMBER, 1963

           A broad shouldered, powerful man is hauling an empty CART 
           towards a small store, in the heart of bustling 1960’s 
           Brooklyn.

           OLDER HARRY. Hair a little thinner. Broader. Still handsome. 
           But his demons have taken their toll.

           Leaving the cart, Harry moves inside, passing a Mezuzah 
           hanging on the door frame. 

           INT. FRUIT & VEGETABLE SHOP - DAY

           A small, well-kept shop bursting with fruit and vegetables. 

           Miriam is finishing serving a MALE CUSTOMER, wrapping his 
           purchases in newspaper.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Two dollars, eighty nine cents.  

           As the customer hands over the cash:

                                 CUSTOMER
                        There he is. Harry the fighter!

           The customer fakes punching Harry in the guts. Miriam covers 
           a smile at Harry’s expression. As the customer heads out:

                                 MIRIAM
                        Did everything sell?

           Harry nods, crossing to her. His eye caught by the open 
           newspaper on the counter. 

           A print ad for a shaving cream, with a celebrity endorsement. 
           ROCKY MARCIANO. Only 40, the ‘Brockton Blockbuster’ has aged 
           badly. Chunky, balding - but wealthy, a superstar. 

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        At least you’ve kept your good 
                        looks. 

           Harry smiles. Picks a bunch of grapes, wrapping them in 
           Marciano’s face. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 HARRY
                        Alan! Get out here!

                                 MIRIAM
                        You’re yelling at him again.

                                 HARRY
                        He’s lazy.  

                                 MIRIAM
                        He’s just a child.

                                 HARRY
                        Then why the hell did we spend so 
                        much money on his bar mitzvah? 
                        Alan!

           ALAN HAFT rushes out from the back room. 13, sensitive, the 
           polar opposite of his father. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Take this to your Uncle Peretz.   

                                 ALAN
                        I’m doing my homework. 

           He shrinks from Harry’s glare. Looks to his mother. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        Go on. 

           Alan grabs the package, heading out the front door. Miriam 
           meets Harry’s eyes, disappointed. 

                                 HARRY
                        What?

                                 MIRIAM
                        You know what. 

           She busies herself with a box of apples. Frustrated, Harry 
           considers getting into the argument - but the telephone 
           RINGS, interrupting.

           Harry grabs it, irritable.  

                                 HARRY
                        Hello? Yes, I’m Harry Haft. Who’s 
                        asking? 

           He listens. And keeps listening. 

           Miriam looks over, curious. Whatever Harry’s hearing, it’s 
           shocked him to the core.

           EXT. MIAMI HOTEL - DAY

           Palm trees sway in the tropical breeze. A taxi pulls up 
           outside a rundown HOTEL on the beach. A sign out the front, 
           in bright 1960’s colors: ‘WELCOME TO MIAMI BEACH!’

           In suitable vacation wear, Harry, Miriam and their three 
           children - Alan, HELENE (9 years old) and MARTY (5 years 
           old), get out of the taxi. 

           INT. MIAMI HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           A room crowded with two double beds and a pull-out bed. A 
           glimpse of an ocean view out the window.

           Miriam fusses with Helene and Marty, all in their bathing 
           suits. Rubbing suntan lotion on their exposed skin. 

           Excited, Alan stands at the window, straining to get a 
           glimpse of the ocean. 

           INT. MIAMI HOTEL - BATHROOM - DAY

           Harry, shirtless, stands in front of the mirror. Shaving with 
           precision. Hands shaking. Adrenaline coursing through his 
           veins.

           Putting the razor down, he looks at himself with a critical 
           eye. His hairline. His belly. The passage of time undeniable.

           A KNOCK at the door startles him.

                                 MIRIAM (O.S.)
                        Harry? The kids want to go to the 
                        beach.  

           INT. MIAMI HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Harry comes out of the bathroom. Helene grabs his hand, 
           pulling him towards the door. 

                                 HELENE
                        Popsie, let’s go!

                                 HARRY
                        Your mother will take you. 
                             (to Miriam)
                        I’m going for a drive. Alan, you’re 
                        coming with me.

                                 ALAN
                        But we just got here. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 HARRY
                        Don’t talk back. Get dressed. 

           Alan grabs his clothes, pissed off but not daring to risk his 
           father’s wrath. As he goes into the bathroom to change:

                                 MIRIAM
                             (to Helene and Marty)
                        Head down to the beach. No swimming 
                        until I get there. Understand? 
                        Helene, hold Marty’s hand.

           Helene takes her brother’s hand, pulling him out the door. 

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        A drive?

                                 HARRY
                        I’ll be back soon.

           Miriam reaches out. Feeling his nervous energy.

                                 MIRIAM
                        Don’t lie to me, Harry. Please. 

           But Harry moves away. Uncomfortable. A horrible suspicion 
           crosses Miriam’s mind. A silent awareness. 

           Alan leaves the bathroom, stepping into the tension. Miriam 
           picks up her beach towel. 

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        We’ll be at the beach. Come back 
                        when you want to. 

           She walks out, hiding her distress for the sake of her son. 

           INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

           Growing more nervous with every second, Harry’s hands grip 
           the steering wheel. Driving past rows of HOUSES in the Miami 
           suburbs, an urban sprawl built on swampland. 

           Alan navigates with a map from the passenger seat. Checking 
           the house numbers against a scrawled address. 

                                 ALAN
                        There.

           He points to a colorful home surrounded by fruit trees. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           EXT. MIAMI HOUSE - DAY

           Harry knocks at the door. Adjusts his shirt. Smooths his 
           hair. Alan watches his father, no idea what’s happening. 

           It’s opened by MICHAEL LIEBERMAN, 40’s, American, a kind man 
           worn down by a terrible tragedy. 

                                 HARRY
                        Mr. Lieberman? I’m Harry Haft.

           Michael takes his measure for a long moment. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Call me Michael. I’m glad you came. 

           Michael lets them inside. 

           INT. MIAMI HOUSE - DAY

           Michael leads them into a comfortable family home. A teenage 
           girl of Alan’s age, SARAH, sits on the couch. A plate of 
           homemade cookies in front of her. A pitcher of lemonade. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        This is Sarah. Our son Ben is at a 
                        friend’s house. 

           Sarah stands, to greet them. Her eyes meet Alan’s for a 
           moment, in shared confusion. 

                                 HARRY
                        How did you find me, Michael?

                                 MICHAEL
                        A journalist tracked us down. Mr 
                        Anderson? Said he knew you. 
                             (then)
                        There’s something you should know  
                        before you see her -

                                 LEAH (O.S.)
                             (Yiddish)
                        You got old, Hertzko.

           Harry looks up to the staircase. And there she is. LEAH. 
           Gaunt, pale, clearly sick. 

           But all Harry sees is YOUNG LEAH, grinning at him. Teasing. 

                                 HARRY
                        Leah.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Tears well in Harry’s eyes. She’s real. Alive. Just as 
           overwhelmed to see him. 

           Leah moves slowly down the stairs. Michael helping her the 
           last few steps. His love and devastation clear. 

                                 LEAH
                        Walk with me?

           Weakly, she takes Harry’s arm. Fingers grazing the Auschwitz 
           TATTOO. 

           EXT. LEAH’S GARDEN - DAY

           Harry and Leah sit side by side on a bench, perfectly 
           positioned to catch the sun. Fruit trees line the yard. A 
           cosy fish pond. A place of utter tranquility. 

           There’s so much ground to cover, so much pain to acknowledge, 
           neither of them can say it. 

                                 HARRY
                        I looked for you. 

           She takes his hand. Touching his scarred knuckles. 

                                 LEAH
                        I saw your name once. In the 
                        newspaper. 

           She draws a New York newspaper clipping from her pocket. 
           Carefully folded around the PHOTO of Harry, in 1949. Chest 
           bare. Boxing gloves. 

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        I was already married.

           As Harry absorbs this blow, her fingers trace his wedding 
           ring. 

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        Your wife. She’s kind to you?

                                 HARRY
                        Always. Too much.

                                 LEAH
                        Good. 

           Leah looks through the window into the house. Inside, Alan 
           and Sarah talk with teenage awkwardness. The generation that 
           the Nazis tried to ensure would never exist.  
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        There’s nothing the doctors can do 
                        for me. 

           Harry suspected as much. But it hits him, worse than any 
           blow. 

                                 HARRY
                        You’re still beautiful.

                                 LEAH
                        Liar. 

           Leah leans into him, head on his chest. He puts his arm 
           around her.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        Do you remember the river, in 
                        Belchatow? In the camps, when I 
                        wanted to give up, I thought about 
                        that day. 

           Harry fights against the urge to sob.

                                 HARRY
                        Run away with me?

           He’s only half-joking. And she loves him still. 

                                 LEAH
                        Not very smart, are you?

           Harry kisses her forehead.  

           INT. MIAMI HOUSE - DAY

           Alan stares out the window, watching his father and Leah 
           holding each other, silent. The complex, adult emotions too 
           difficult for a boy to comprehend. 

           INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

           Alan’s eyes flicker between the freeway ahead, and his 
           father, driving in excruciating silence. Body trembling. 

           Alan reaches for the radio, but Harry roughly turns it off. 
           Tires SCREECHING, he HAULS the car across three lanes. 
           Driving onto a knoll overlooking the freeway.

           Harry stops the car with a jolt. Breathing hard. A beat, then  
           - he PUNCHES the WINDOW, shattering it. 

           Alan jumps, frightened. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           BLOOD running down his arm, Harry gets out of the car.

           Harry walks a few steps. Collapses down, sitting in the 
           grass. Starts to SOB.

           Through the smashed window, Alan stares, wide-eyed. He’s 
           never seen his father cry. 

           After some time, Harry’s sobs subside. He pulls a 
           handkerchief from his pocket, wipes his face. 

           Alan gets out of the car, cautiously approaching, as Harry 
           wraps the handkerchief around his BLEEDING hand.  

                                 ALAN
                        Mr. Lieberman told me to give this 
                        to you. 

           He awkwardly thrusts a small PHOTO at Harry. A black and 
           white shot of healthy Leah. A beaming smile. Bursting with 
           spark and personality.

           Harry snatches it from him. Drinking in the image. 

           Alan’s eyes are on the blood, running down Harry’s TATTOO. 

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        Was she in Auschwitz too?

                                 HARRY
                        Who told you I was in Auschwitz?

           Alan shrinks from Harry’s sudden rage. 

                                 ALAN
                        Nobody. Just kids at school.
                             (bolder)
                        You never tell me anything about 
                        you. 

                                 HARRY
                        Because you’re like your mother. 
                        You feel too much. 

           Harry sees Alan flinch, absorbing the emotional blow. He 
           forces himself to soften, for his son’s sake.  

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        One day, I’ll tell you everything, 
                        Alan. Then you’ll understand me.
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           The Hafts sit in silence. The traffic rushing past. Palm 
           trees dancing in the tropical breeze. 

           Harry gets to his feet. Extends a hand to his son. Forcing 
           himself to return to his real life.  

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go for a swim.

           Alan’s face lights up. 

           EXT. MIAMI BEACH - DAY

           In colorful bathing trunks, Alan RUNS into the WAVES, 
           splashing his siblings. Washing away the trauma like only a 
           kid can.

           Harry sits quietly beside Miriam, who’s sunning herself on a 
           deck chair. His hand now bandaged. His eyes red from crying. 
           Her empathetic, fearful gaze misses none of it. 

           A long beat. Then Harry hands over the photo of Leah. Miriam 
           takes in the image of her greatest rival. 

                                 MIRIAM
                        I think I’d like her. 

           She hands the photo back. Harry is awed by his wife’s 
           generous spirit.

           SCREAMS of joy draw his attention to the ocean, where his 
           children laugh and play. Harry freezes. Overcome by a 
           familiar flush of terror. 

           SCHNEIDER stands at the edge of the water, watching him. The 
           lapping tide washing over his polished boots.

           Miriam reaches out, tentative. Calming him with her touch. 

                                 MIRIAM (CONT’D)
                        Harry, whatever you’re seeing can’t 
                        hurt you. You’re here, with us. 

           Emboldened by her words, Harry stares back at Schneider. His 
           ‘black dog’. His constant companion. Refusing to be scared. 

           Schneider fades away. Maybe not forever. But for this day.

           INT. OCEAN - DAY

           Harry dives into the waves. His tattoo shimmers in the warm 
           water, changing shape. He floats peacefully in the underwater 
           world. 
                         'HARRY HAFT' - CLEAN DRAFT - 2/17/17     

           Surfacing, Harry looks to his wife and children, playing in 
           the ocean. His gift of survival. 

           With a smile, he swims over to join them. 

           SUPER: 

           Harry ‘Hertzko’ Haft was inducted into the National Jewish 
           Sports Hall of Fame in 2007. 

           He was their first Holocaust survivor. 

           He died nine months later.
