         May 26, 2017
           CLOSE ON

           A PREGNANT BELLY.

           Just visible beneath a yellow dress.

           Lowered into frame -- a white-gloved hand holding a MARTINI. 
           It rests slightly on the belly.

           Then the other hand -- holding a CIGARETTE, red-hot at the 
           tip.

           We hang on the belly in the center, like a sun.

           EXT. HOTEL BAR - 15TH FLOOR BALCONY - EVENING - 1968

           JOY GRIFFIN (30s), the owner of the belly, cigarette and 
           drink, stands with a crowd gathered on the balcony of a hotel  *
           bar.

           It’s a law firm office cocktail party. Everyone is rich, 
           white and drunk. Including Joy’s husband WILL GRIFFIN (30s), 
           who talks shop with a COLLEAGUE and his WIFE. 

           The wife, studying Joy, reaches out and places her hand on 
           Joy’s belly.

                                 WIFE
                        How far along are you?

                                 JOY
                        Just three months. And a few days.

           The wife keeps her hand on Joy’s belly.

                                 WIFE
                        I can feel him kicking. 

                                 JOY
                        I think it’s too soon for that. 

           The wife is clearly a little drunk. She finally withdraws her  *
           hand, examines Joy with glazed eyes. 

                                 WIFE
                        Well, you look beautiful. 

           Joy doesn’t know what to say.

                                 WIFE (CONT’D)
                          (whispering)
                        We’ve been trying for over a year. 
                        He wants me to get checked out. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 WIFE (CONT’D)
                        You know, to make sure I’m not one 
                        of those women. 

                                 JOY
                        I’m sure you’re not. 

           INT. HOTEL BAR - POWDER ROOM - EVENING

           Joy powders her nose next to a long row of WOMEN examining 
           themselves in the mirror. 

           The woman next to her -- in a red dress that barely covers 
           her generous breasts -- opens her clutch. Joy catches sight 
           of a CONDOM. The clutch closes. 

           EXT. HOTEL BAR - BALCONY - EVENING

           Joy wanders among the other couples. Finds Will, standing 
           with his boss, WARREN HALSEY... and the WOMAN IN RED. 

                                 WILL
                        Joy, you remember my boss, Warren 
                        Halsey.

                                 JOY
                        Of course. 

           They fake kiss. Joy looks at the woman in red.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t catch your 
                        name?

           The woman smiles, extends her hand. 

                                 WOMAN IN RED
                        Bethany.

           Joy briefly shakes it. 

                                 WARREN
                        Julia’s in Vancouver this weekend. 
                        This is our personal assistant.

           Joy and Will smile tightly, catching the implication. 

           A LOW RUMBLE from the street below. Joy turns to look, the 
           others don’t bother. Bethany downs another glass of 
           champagne, lights a cigarette. 

                                 BETHANY
                        I like the party lights. 
                                 Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

           She gestures vaguely to the twinkling lights hanging over the  *
           balcony. 

                                 BETHANY (CONT’D)
                        It’s like we’re in Italy. 

           The RUMBLE grows louder. 

                                 JOY
                        What is that?

           She moves toward the balcony’s edge - but Will grabs her 
           wrist, keeping her by his side.

                                 WILL
                          (to Warren)
                        What’s happening with the class 
                        action suit? I heard the judge is 
                        leaning our way?

           Joy pulls free of Will, their voices drifting into the 
           background, and walks to the edge of the balcony. Looks OVER 
           at--

           A PARADE OF ANTI-WAR PROTESTORS, charging down the street, 
           which is four or five stories below them. Holding signs, 
           chanting.  

           FACING THEM IS-- 

           A barrier of police officers in riot gear wielding night 
           sticks and guns. White-and-blue box-like police cars weave in  *
           and out between them. 

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Joy? You have to hear Warren’s 
                        story--

           A GUNSHOT.

           Joy flinches. Below, a tiny female figure in hippie clothes 
           collapses. 

           Will, hearing the gunshot, comes over. 

                                 JOY
                        What’s happening?

           Will looks back -- Warren and Bethany have disappeared. He 
           sighs, annoyed. 

                                 WILL
                        I don’t know. Vietnam. Black power. 
                        Angry people.  
                                 Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Below, a policeman shoots TEAR GAS at the crowd. Protestors 
           choke and cough. 

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        I had planned on asking Warren 
                        about my promotion tonight. That 
                        was my chance.

           A policeman beats another protestor with a nightstick. Joy 
           watches. Horrified and transfixed. 

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        He’s got his eye on Baxter. 

           A man in a white shirt streaked with blood is DRAGGED down 
           the street by two policemen. 

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        This is fucking annoying, isn’t it?   
                        It’s been like this every night 
                        this week. Stopping traffic. 
                        Wreaking havoc. Hoodlums.

           Joy doesn’t know what to say. 

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to tell them to get the 
                        car. Let’s get out of here. 

           As the chaos escalates below... 

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Joy.

           She’s watching a woman carrying a sign that reads “FUCK THE 
           PIGS.” The woman is dancing, high, enjoying the world turning  *
           upside down. 

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Joy. We have to go. Now. 

           She leans over the balcony. The woman is shouting something 
           in unison with the rest of the crowd. 

                                 JOY
                        I just want to know what they’re 
                        saying. 

                                 WILL
                        It doesn’t matter. 

           Joy doesn’t move. 
                                 Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 JOY
                        The whole world is watching. That’s 
                        what they’re saying. 

           INT. CAR - MOVING

           Joy and Will drive through the melee. She’s glued to the 
           window. 

                                 WILL
                        Every street is blocked off, I 
                        don’t know how we’re going to--

           Someone BANGS on the window. It’s a YOUNG PROTESTOR with 
           crazed eyes. 

                                 YOUNG PROTESTOR 
                          (muffled)
                        Open the door!!

           He tries the handle. Joy watches the door RATTLE in sheer 
           terror. 

                                 JOY
                        Should we--

           BANG. The young protestor is brained from behind by a 
           policeman. 

           He slumps against the window. His body is pulled away. The 
           policeman brutally steps on his face. 

                                 WILL
                        Close your eyes, Joy. You don’t 
                        need to see this.

           She ignores him, looks at the angry sea of protestors and 
           police, clashing. The intensity of the noise rises, then 
           sudden...

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           SILENCE. Joy sits on the edge of her couch in her perfect 60s  *
           suburban home. 

           She’s watching... A TV SCREEN with the SOUND OFF. 

           The protests continue raging. Miles away from her. 

           A reporter stands on the steps of the International 
           Amphitheater in Chicago, yelling.
                                 Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

           The TV turns off. Will stands by the console.

                                 WILL
                        Jesus, Joy, haven’t you seen enough 
                        for one night? 

           Joy looks up at him, wipes her brow. She’s sweating for some 
           reason. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Will and Joy’s daughter, CHARLOTTE GRIFFIN (14), housewife-in- *
           training, sets the table with precision. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Little forks on the outside or 
                        inside?

                                 JOY
                        It doesn’t matter, Charlotte. It’s 
                        just us. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        It always matters.

           LATER

           The family of three eats dinner in silence. Charlotte looks 
           between her parents, eyeing them quietly, sensing the 
           tension.

           Joy looks past her family at the television set. 

           The black, blank screen. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Will undresses out in the open, while Joy, alone in the 
           bathroom, separated by a wall (but still visible to us), does  *
           the same. 

                                 WILL
                        God, it feels good to get back to 
                        civilization.

           She doesn’t reply, continues to undress in silence.  

           LATER

           Will and Joy make love. His breaths grow ragged. He’s louder 
           than she is. 
                                 Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

           He stops, looks at her. She’s clearly distracted. 

                                 WILL
                        What are you thinking about?

                                 JOY
                        Nothing. You.

           He kisses her, deeply.

                                 WILL
                          (whispering in her ear)
                        Come on. You’re allowed to enjoy 
                        yourself a little. Don’t be such a 
                        prude.

           She blushes. 

                                 JOY
                        Charlotte will hear. 

                                 WILL
                        She won’t. 

           Joy pulls him into the nape of her neck. 

           He finishes, shuddering, as she stares blankly at the 
           ceiling. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Dark. Joy, wearing her nightdress, doesn’t turn on the 
           lights. 

           She hears the sound of the clothes dryer -- walks past the 
           fridge, opening the door to...

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

           The washer and dryer are side by side. 

           She opens the door to the dryer, checks the clothes. Still 
           damp. Closes the door and presses the start button. It begins  *
           to shake softly. She looks at it for a beat. Then spreads her  *
           hands across the surface, feeling the warmth.

           She presses herself into the front of the machine, feels it 
           vibrate against her. Her head falls back. She moans, 
           uninhibited, alone. It’s so much easier. 
                                 Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - CHARLOTTE’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Charlotte sits in front of a mirror, running her fingers 
           through her long, brown hair. 

           Posted on the mirror are ads clipped from magazines. She 
           tapes up a new one - a full-page advertisement of a 
           voluptuous blonde. The caption reads: “IF I HAVE ONLY ONE 
           LIFE, LET ME LIVE IT AS A BLONDE.” 

           All the ads are of blondes. Others are of Norman Rockwell-
           type families, gathered around the dinner table. She stands. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Charlotte tiptoes past her parents’ bedroom. The door is 
           cracked open. She pushes it further.

           Her father is sprawled on his back, looking completely 
           satisfied. There’s no one next to him. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Charlotte walks through the dark kitchen. Notices a light 
           coming from beneath the laundry room. She opens the door, 
           sees--

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

           Joy folding laundry. She looks up at Charlotte, surprised.

                                 JOY
                        You’re up late. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        So are you. 

                                 JOY
                        I don’t have school tomorrow. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Joy and Charlotte share a piece of pie. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        How come you and Dad waited so long 
                        to have another baby?
                                 Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 JOY
                        That’s a strange question, 
                        Charlotte.

           Charlotte takes a sip of milk. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Fourteen years is a really long 
                        time.

                                 JOY
                        It only seems long to you -- 
                        because it’s your whole life.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        My friend Samantha has a little 
                        brother who’s a lot younger than 
                        her. She says he was an STM baby.

                                 JOY
                        A what?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        A ‘Save The Marriage’ baby. It was 
                        that or a divorce. 

                                 JOY
                        Charlotte, go to sleep. 

           Charlotte takes her milk and disappears. Joy watches her go. 
           Then looks at her neatly folded stack of laundry, visible 
           through the cracked open door.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           BUZZ. Morning. Joy, alone and businesslike, guides an 
           electric waxer across the kitchen floor. A discarded 
           newspaper on the counter -- the headline screaming PROTESTS 
           OVERRUN CHICAGO AT DNC. Her gaze lingers on it for a beat, 
           then she throws it in the trash.

           In quick cuts, we watch Joy bake bread, hem a pair of pants, 
           tend to her garden. Iron. Transfer clothes from the washer to  *
           the dryer, over and over again, an endless cycle. Fix the 
           lawnmower. Usher out a praying mantis trapped inside the 
           kitchen screen door. It rears up on its hind legs, looks at 
           her. She stares deep into its bulging green eyes, transfixed.  *

           EXT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LANA’S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY

           Joy sits on a lawn chair balancing a cigarette and a 
           cocktail. 
                                 Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Next to her, LANA COOK (26), aggressively accessorized, 
           slightly intoxicated. 

                                 JOY
                        How’s Erin?

                                 LANA
                        I should’ve had a son. 
                        Daughters are stressful. There’s so 
                        many ways to go wrong. Sons are 
                        easy.

           Joy says nothing. They smoke and drink in silence. 

           A WOMAN passes by the sidewalk in front of them - MELANIE 
           WOODS (30s).

                                 LANA (CONT’D)
                          (whispers, ironic)
                        The divorcee. 

           She says this while smiling and waving cheerfully. Melanie 
           waves back. They watch her walk down the street.

                                 JOY
                        I would’ve left her too. What is 
                        she wearing?

           They both laugh. Lana takes a BOTTLE OF RED PILLS from her 
           purse, unscrews the cap.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

                                 LANA
                        Who knows. My doctor prescribed 
                        them.

           She pops the pill with her gin & tonic. Offers one to Joy.

                                 JOY
                        No, thank you.

                                 LANA
                        They’re not for depression, if 
                        that’s what you’re thinking. 

                                 JOY
                        I wasn’t--
                                 Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 LANA
                        Ever since Roy died, everyone 
                        thinks I’m just going to wake up 
                        one morning, drive onto the Wabash 
                        Avenue Bridge and swan dive off. 

           Lana drops the pill back into the bottle, leans back, woozy.

                                 JOY
                        What are they for then?

                                 LANA
                        You know, when you’re feeling... 
                        nothing.

           Joy is quiet, thinking. Downs the rest of her drink. Pours 
           another. She’s tipsy. 

                                 JOY
                        This morning I was in the living 
                        room-- just me, and the only sound 
                        of life was the dishwasher. BEEP - 
                        BEEP - BEEP, like a mechanical 
                        heartbeat. And I just sat there. 
                        Thinking about nothing. 

           She looks over, Lana is asleep. 

           Joy picks up the pill bottle, reads the label: “LANA ELROY. 
           DX: HOUSEWIFE SYNDROME.”

           She opens the bottle, takes out a pill. Downs it with her 
           drink. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - BATHROOM - EVENING 

           Joy works blonde dye into her daughter’s hair. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        When did you start dyeing yours?

                                 JOY
                        When I met your father. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You became a blonde for him?

                                 JOY
                        No, not exactly. But it didn’t 
                        hurt.

           A beat, while Charlotte considers that.
                                 Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Am I pretty, Mom? You can be 
                        honest.

                                 JOY
                        You’re beautiful, Sweetheart. In an 
                        unassuming way. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What does that mean?

                                 JOY
                        It means you don’t have to try too 
                        hard. 

           She leans over kisses her on the forehead. Charlotte is still  *
           confused.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           The next morning. Joy, now alone, irons clothes while 
           watching TV. 

           ONSCREEN: More footage of the streets of Chicago exploding. A  *
           particularly brutal beating. The volume at full blast, a 
           little louder than necessary.

           She holds onto the iron. It’s steaming. She starts sweating 
           again. 

           The clashing onscreen grows in intensity. She puts down the 
           hot iron, grips the board to steady herself. The iron 
           wobbles. And she collapses, pulling the board and iron down 
           with her.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - FOYER - EARLY EVENING

           Hours later. Will, whistling, opens the door, briefcase in 
           hand. 

                                 WILL
                        I’m home.  

           She doesn’t answer. He puts down the briefcase, walks into...

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Joy?
                                 Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

            -- and finds JOY’S BODY sprawled on the floor. Beside her, 
           the iron, now facedown, has BURNED through a square of 
           linoleum. The ironing board is tangled with her body.

                                 WILL
                        Oh my god.

           He rushes to her side. 

                                                     CUT TO BLACK:

           INT. HOSPITAL - WARD - LATER

           Joy’s eyes open. She’s in a large hospital ward, her bed 
           surrounded by a circle of WHITE-COATED MEN, murmuring. The 
           bell of a COLD STETHOSCOPE on her chest. 

           Her hands go instinctively to her belly. The oldest, BENSON, 
           wearing a bow-tie, barely looks at her.

                                 JOY
                        What’s happening?

                                 BENSON
                        Relax, Mrs. Griffin. 

                                 JOY
                        Is the baby okay?

           They don’t reply, glancing at each other.

           Will appears at the far corner of the ward. Without a word, 
           the doctors cross to intercept him. 

           Joy watches as Benson talks. She can’t hear what he’s saying, 
           but sees Will react. It’s clearly bad news. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - BENSON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Close on a MASSIVE HEART on an X-RAY.

           Will studies it. He and Benson confer as if Joy -- sitting on 
           an examining table in the background -- is not there. 

                                 BENSON
                        The heart failure is, without 
                        question, due to the pregnancy.

                                 WILL
                        Is there a treatment?
                                 BENSON
                        To not be pregnant. If she weren’t, 
                        the condition would reverse.

           Joy makes a sound, as if all the air just got sucked out of 
           her. They turn to look at her. 

                                 WILL
                        There’s nothing else we can do?

                                 BENSON
                        We could ask the board for 
                        permission to perform...

           He trails off. She touches her belly. 

                                 JOY
                        That’s it? That’s the only cure?

                                 BENSON
                        I’m afraid so. It’s not a 
                        recommendation, mind you. 

                                 WILL
                        Honey, why don’t you step out a 
                        moment? 

           She pauses, too stunned to argue. Walks out.

           INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY

           Joy stands quietly looking at the closed door to the room 
           where her husband and Dr. Benson confer. Her hands clenched 
           tightly around her purse. 

           A woman pushes a BABY in a stroller past her. The baby looks 
           up at Joy, eyes wide. Joy smiles tearfully, struggling to 
           control her emotions. 

           INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Will drives, one hand resting on Joy’s belly.  

                                 WILL
                          (broken)
                        I don’t know what to do. 

           Joy looks at him, then back at the road. They continue 
           driving in silence, tortured. 
           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Joy makes dinner, quietly and efficiently. She carries a 
           roast to the table where Will and Charlotte are seated. She’s 
           cheerful, bright, hiding her pain. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Didn’t we have roast the day before 
                        yesterday?

                                 JOY
                        I like roast. It’s comforting.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Good Housekeeping says you should 
                        vary dishes as much as possible. Or 
                        your husband and children will get 
                        bored. 

                                 JOY
                        What does Good Housekeeping say 
                        about picky daughters?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Oh my God, Mom...

           Will ignores the banter. He’s looking at Joy’s belly, 
           stricken.

           INT. BEDROOM - EVENING

           Will watches as Joy sits in front of her vanity, applying 
           face cream. He’s nursing a tall glass of whiskey.

                                 WILL
                        How can you do that?

                                 JOY
                        I always put on cream before--

                                 WILL
                        No, how can you do it now? During 
                        this crisis.

           She sees him looking at her in the mirror. 

                                 JOY
                        I’ll do whatever you want to do. 

                                 WILL
                          (his voice breaking)
                        I told you - I don’t know what to 
                        do. 
           She turns to look at him, composed. 

                                 JOY
                        I do. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY

           Joy walks determinedly down the crowded corridor. Will trails 
           behind, more reluctant and conflicted. 

           She passes a sign that reads “SEPTIC PATIENTS WARD” -- looks 
           at it curiously, but moves past. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Joy slides a plate of cookies towards the center of the 
           table.

                                 JOY
                        Me and my daughter made 
                        Snickerdoodles. Please, help 
                        yourself.

           Seven men - including Benson - look down at the cookies, then 
           at her. Then begin discussing the case as if she’s not there. 
           This is the hospital Board of Directors.

                                 BENSON 
                        As you know, the patient -- Mrs. 
                        Griffin -- is petitioning the board 
                        to make a special exception in this 
                        case.

                                 DIRECTOR #1
                        You understand this request is 
                        extraordinary.

                                 BENSON 
                        We do.

                                 DIRECTOR #1
                        Is there a chance she can survive 
                        the pregnancy?

           A pause, then--

                                 BENSON (O.S.)
                        Yes.

                                 DIRECTOR #2 
                        How much of a chance?
           Joy looks back and forth between the men deciding her fate, 
           waiting for an opening.

                                 BENSON (O.S.)
                        It’s difficult to say, Sir. 

           No longer able to contain herself--

                                 JOY
                        What percentage would sway you? I’m 
                        just curious.

                                 DIRECTOR #1 
                        This hospital has approved a 
                        termination of pregnancy once in 
                        the last ten years, Mrs. Griffin. 
                        Are you aware of that?

           Joy is clearly stunned. 

                                 BENSON 
                        We are, Sir.

           SILENCE. Then...

                                 DIRECTOR #1
                        I’m afraid my vote is no. Shall we 
                        go around the table?

           One by one, SEVEN MORE MALE VOICES vote “No.”

           INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - LATER

           Benson stands ill at ease as Will comforts Joy. Then speaks 
           in a low voice--

                                 BENSON
                        There is always Insanity.

                                 JOY
                        What?

                                 BENSON
                        If you can convince two 
                        psychiatrists you’re suicidal, the 
                        hospital will have no choice but to 
                        grant you an abortion.

                          JOY
                                                      WILL
           I can do that.
                                          She can’t do that.

                                 BENSON
                        Are you suicidal, Joy?
                                 JOY
                          (beat)
                        I believe I am, yes.

                                 WILL
                        Honey, we need to talk about 
                        this...

                                 BENSON
                        You know, a lot of women would say, 
                        Save the baby, not me. Most women, 
                        perhaps.

                                 JOY
                        I have a 14-year-old daughter at 
                        home who needs me. I’m just asking 
                        for the choice.

           INT. PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           A somber, bearded psychiatrist, DOCTOR AARONSON (60s), faces 
           Joy, lying stiffly on a leather couch.

                                 JOY
                        I think I’ve settled on a shotgun 
                        to the head. My husband has one, so 
                        it would honestly be the most 
                        convenient.

                                 AARONSON
                        Shotguns are very long. You’d have 
                        to place the barrel under your jaw 
                        and pull the trigger with your toe. 
                        Like Hemingway did.

                                 JOY
                        Yes, that’s my plan.

                                 AARONSON
                        Women don’t typically commit 
                        suicide with guns.

                                 JOY
                        Why is that?

                                 AARONSON
                        Too violent.

                                 JOY
                        I-- am feeling violent.
                                 AARONSON
                        You have a life inside you, Mrs. 
                        Griffin. A beautiful, unspoiled 
                        potential life. It could be 
                        Beethoven or Einstein--

                                 JOY
                        Or Stalin. 

           She attempts a smile. Aaronson doesn’t return it. 

           INT. SECOND PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           Joy sits in an oversized armchair, facing a younger, kinder-
           looking psychiatrist, DOCTOR CAMPBELL.

                                 JOY
                        I’m plunging downward... like a 
                        waterfall. Then I realize I’m in my 
                        shower, hanging from a noose--

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Mrs. Griffin, are you under the 
                        impression that I’m going to 
                        believe everything you say?

           Joy looks up. Realizes he’s not buying it.

                                 JOY
                        I really did have a dream.

                                 CAMPBELL
                        But not that one.

                                 JOY
                        No. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        Why don’t you describe the one you 
                        really had?

                                 JOY
                          (hesitates, then--)
                        I was lying in a poppy field. I 
                        don’t know where. But it was so 
                        peaceful. Then suddenly the poppies 
                        started moving... marching, 
                        carrying me. And I realized they 
                        weren’t poppies at all -- they were 
                        protestors. Chanting, singing, 
                        beating drums... 
                          (beat)
                        That’s the truth.
                                 CAMPBELL
                        And how did that make you feel?

                                 JOY
                        Scared at first. Then... alive.

           Campbell studies her, then--

                                 IVES
                        I don’t think you’re suicidal, Joy. 

           Her face falls.

           INT. FIRST PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           Aaronson stares at Joy. She’s uncomfortable with his gaze.

                                 AARONSON
                        It’s obvious you want to live.

           She bursts into tears. He watches dispassionately.

           INT. SECOND PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - EARLIER

           Campbell is scribbling something on a pad of paper. He looks 
           up at Joy. 

                                 CAMPBELL
                        But I’m going to say you are. If 
                        the other psychiatrist doesn’t 
                        agree--

           He folds the PIECE of PAPER, hands it to her.

                                 CAMPBELL (CONT’D)
                        -- this is your plan B. 

           Joy takes the paper, grateful.

           INT. PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE - RECEPTION - CONTINUOUS

           Joy walks out of the nice psychiatrist’s office, past a 
           RECEPTIONIST, who beckons her closer, lowers her voice. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Just fall down a staircase. It 
                        worked for me.

           Joy reacts.
           INT. GRIFFIN HOME - STAIRCASE - LATER

           Joy walks slowly up the steps, Will assisting. She’s short of 
           breath, stops to touch her chest. 

           Charlotte appears at the top of the stairs, looks down at her 
           mom.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What’s wrong, Mom?

                                 JOY
                        Nothing, Honey.

                                 WILL
                        Your mom’s just a little tired... 
                        because of the baby. She’ll be 
                        better soon.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOME - BEDROOM - LATER

           Will lies in bed next to Joy. 

                                 WILL
                        He said there was a chance. That’s 
                        what we have to hold onto. 

           A beat. 

                                 JOY
                        There’s so much I still want to do. 

           He looks at her, genuinely curious.

                                 WILL
                        Like what?

           She’s at a loss, then--

                                 JOY
                        Ride in a convertible. Go on 
                        safari. Smoke weed.

           He smiles, but it’s a heartbroken smile. 

                                 WILL
                        I wish there was another option. 

           He starts to cry. She looks at the folded piece of paper on 
           her night-stand, but says nothing. 
           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

           Midnight. Joy lies awake. Looks at Will, sleeping. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER 

           She stands perfectly still at the top of the staircase, eyes 
           closed as she mentally prepares for the fall -- her 
           concentration suddenly interrupted by-- 

                                 CHARLOTTE (O.S.)
                        Mom?

           Staring up at her mother from the bottom of the stairs, a 
           text book and peanut-butter sandwich in her hand.

           EXT. SOUTH SIDE - STREET - DAY

           Joy walks quickly down a sketchy street in a bad 
           neighborhood. Gripping the PIECE of PAPER in her hand. 

           She reaches her destination, a grungy apartment building. 

           INT. SOUTH SIDE - APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Joy steps out of an elevator, knocks on an unmarked door. No 
           answer. Knocks again. Waits.

           Suddenly the door opens. A small BEARDED MAN looks at her, 
           says nothing. Behind him, a STOUT WOMAN fusses with a pot of 
           water. 

                                 JOY 
                        Hello? Am I in the right place?

           The man silently ushers her into a decrepit apartment. The 
           woman says nothing, holds out her hand, palm up.

           Joy, understanding, hands over a BUNDLE of CASH. The woman 
           counts it out, twice. Slips it into her apron pocket. 

           Then helps Joy remove her coat and purse, placing them on a 
           chair at the back of the room.

           INT. SOUTH SIDE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The man ushers Joy into the bedroom, speaks with a thick 
           German accent--
                                 MAN
                        Remove please your undergarments. 
                        Call when ready.

           He exits, closing the door. 

           She looks around the small room. Gingerly lies down on the  
           rickety bed. Maneuvers off her underwear, leaving her dress 
           on.

                                 JOY
                        I’m ready. 

           She waits. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Hello? 

           Something feels off. She gets up, opens the door.

           INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She enters, looks around. The man and woman are GONE. So is 
           her coat. Her purse lies on the floor. She picks it up, looks 
           inside. EMPTY.

           EXT. SOUTH SIDE - STREET - LATER

           Joy exits the building without a coat -- it’s RAINING. She 
           holds the empty purse above her head, walks down the street, 
           disappearing into the darkness. 

           INT. LANA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Joy plays bridge with a group of other women. She’s haggard, 
           can’t focus. She’s smoking compulsively. She coughs, 
           struggling to catch her breath. 

                                 JOY
                        Excuse me. I’ll be right back. 

           Melanie, the divorcee, watches her go. 

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Joy throws up into the toilet. She leans back, her face 
           streaked with tears. 
           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Joy exits the bathroom, closing the door quietly. Melanie is 
           waiting, studying her coolly. 

                                 JOY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 MELANIE
                        Don’t be. 

           A beat. 

                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                        643-4434. Will you remember that?

                                 JOY
                        What?

                                 MELANIE
                        Just call them. 

           She passes into the bathroom, leaving Joy alone in the 
           hallway. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Joy stares at the phone. After a long beat, she picks it up. 
           Dials the number. 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hello, this is Jane.

                                 JOY
                        Jane who?

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        You called us. 

                                 JOY
                        I was given this number. 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                          (hesitating, careful)
                        We’re a service for women who are 
                        expecting.

           Silence. Joy hangs up. 

           A beat. She picks up the phone, calls back. 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hello?
                                 JOY
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Don’t be. Everyone hangs up the 
                        first time.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Joy waits nervously at the corner of a street a few blocks 
           from her house. 

           An old VW Bug pulls up to the curb. 

           INT. CAR - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER

           GWEN COOPER (20), dark-haired, unkempt, sits in the driver’s 
           seat, smoking. Joy sits next to her, trembling. 

                                 GWEN
                        I’m Gwen. You’re in good hands.

                                 JOY
                        I thought your name was Jane?

                                 GWEN
                        Jane’s an all-women abortion 
                        referral network. You call Jane, we 
                        deliver you to someone who can 
                        help. Dig it?

                                 JOY
                        Yes. 

                                 GWEN
                        We help women seize the means of 
                        reproduction. Anatomy is destiny. 
                        Freud said that, you know? 

           They drive in silence. Gwen senses Joy’s growing anxiety.

                                 GWEN (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to be okay, Joy.

                                 JOY
                        How do you know? 

                                 GWEN
                        Freshman year. That was my first.

           Joy recoils a bit, Gwen’s tone is uncomfortably cavalier.
                                 GWEN (CONT’D)
                        Got laid at the wrong time of the 
                        month. You know how that goes. 

           She looks at her, smiling. Joy doesn’t smile back. 

           As they roll to a halt-- 

                                 GWEN (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to get into another 
                        car, okay? With a fancy capitalist 
                        pig doctor. He has one condition--

                                 JOY
                        What?

           Gwen takes out a blindfold. Joy looks at it, alarmed. 

                                 GWEN
                        I’m sorry. 

           She ties it tightly around Joy’s eyes.

           The screen turns BLACK. 

           Silence. Then a parade of sounds. A DOOR OPENING. POUNDING 
           RAIN. DISTANT STEPS. MUFFLED VOICES. A DOOR SLAMMING SHUT. 

           INT. CAR - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER

           STILL BLACK. Joy’s heart is pounding. 

                                 JOY (O.S.)
                        Hello?

           Nothing. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Can you just tell me where we’re 
                        going-- at least what part of town? 

           Nope.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        You’ve done this before though, 
                        right?

           Again no answer. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Please talk to me--

           She’s beginning to break down. But still no reply. 
           The blackness shifts. She’s fiddling with her blindfold. 
           Through a tiny aperture, we see a disarmingly HANDSOME MAN 
           (34) in the driver’s seat. He looks over at Joy.

                                 HANDSOME MAN (O.S.)
                        Pull yourself together, Sweetheart.

           She immediately covers her eyes. 

                                                     CUT TO BLACK.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Much later. The procedure over. Joy is back home, in bed. 

           Will, still in work clothes, sits beside her.

                                 WILL
                        A miscarriage?

           Joy nods, unable to look him in the eye. 

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                          (bewildered)
                        I don’t even know what to feel. 

                                 JOY
                        Me either.

           She leans into him, and he kisses her forehead. Then he puts 
           his head on her belly, like a child. She runs her hands 
           through his hair. He cries quietly. She tries to comfort him.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Joy finds Charlotte on the couch knitting. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Look Mom, I added a pom-pom.

           She holds up the baby hat. Nearly done. Joy looks at it, 
           stricken, sinks into the couch next to her daughter.  

                                 JOY
                        Charlotte, I have to tell you 
                        something.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - CHARLOTTE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Charlotte, shaken, slowly places the hat on a baby doll. She 
           looks at its beady blue eyes. Cradles it like a real baby.
           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Alone, Joy stands in front of the mirror, presses a warm 
           washcloth against her face. She feels something... looks down 
           and sees a drop of blood on her leg. 

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        Joy? Are you okay in there?

           A beat, as she tries to hold it together.

                                 JOY
                        Yes, fine. I’ll be out in a minute. 

           She takes a tissue and gently wipes off the blood... suddenly 
           overcome with grief and shame. She cries and cries.

           EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - LAWN - DAY

           Joy and the rest of the PTA moms, including Melanie, sit 
           under umbrellas. 

           Lana’s wearing dark sunglasses, we sense she’s drinking 
           something stronger than tea.

                                 LANA
                        We live next door to each other and 
                        I have to come to this ridiculous 
                        PTA event just to see you.

                                 JOY
                        Sorry. We’ve been busy.

                                 LANA
                        Really? Because your car never left 
                        the driveway all weekend.

           Joy crosses her legs, forcing a smile. Lana studies her, 
           notices the saucer shaking slightly in her hand. Melanie 
           watches.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Will reads the newspaper as Joy prepares breakfast. The phone 
           rings. He picks up.

                                 WILL
                        Hello?

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                          (after a pause)
                        Hello.
                                 WILL
                        Who is this?

           A pause...

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        A friend of Joy’s. From work.

                                 WILL
                        She doesn’t work. 

           Another pause. 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        From the PTA, that’s what I meant. 
                        We call that work. 

           He passes the phone to Joy.

                                 WILL
                        PTA. 

           She takes it, cradles it in her neck, while frying sausages. 

                                 JOY
                        Hello? This is Joy.

                                 GWEN (O.S.)
                        Hi Joy, it’s Gwen. From... Jane. 
                        I’m just following up to see how 
                        you’re doing after--

           Joy lowers her voice, looks at Will, who doesn’t seem to 
           notice anything.

                                 JOY
                        I’m fine, thanks.

                                 GWEN (O.S.)
                        Cool. Jane’s having a thing 
                        tomorrow night. 7pm at 1257 
                        Lakeshore Drive. We’d love for you 
                        to come. 

                                 JOY
                        Oh, I couldn’t possibly. But thanks 
                        so much for calling.

           She’s about to hang up when...

                                 GWEN (O.S.)
                        Joy, there are a lot of scared 
                        women out there, just like you were-
                        - 
                                 JOY
                        I know.

                                 GWEN
                        They need our help.

           Will is now looking at her.

                                 JOY
                        I really have to go--

           Joy hangs up, a bit shaken. Quickly recovers. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Avon lady. They’re getting more 
                        aggressive.

                                 WILL
                        She said she was a friend. From the 
                        PTA.

                                 JOY
                          (a beat)
                        She is. I mean, she’s both.

           INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY 

           Dr. Benson stands outside the door to a consultation room, 
           reads silently from a chart as his resident updates him.

                                 RESIDENT
                        Mrs. Griffin is here for follow-up. 
                        She’s no longer pregnant. Almost 
                        all her symptoms have improved. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - CONSULTATION ROOM - SAME TIME

           Joy sits, listening to the doctors discuss her case. 

                                 BENSON (O.S.)
                        She lost the baby?

                                 RESIDENT (O.S.)
                        She did, Sir. 

                                 BENSON (O.S.)
                        How convenient for her.

           The resident chuckles. Benson opens the door.

           Joy smiles gamely, pretends she hasn’t heard anything. 
                                 JOY
                        Hello, Dr. Benson. Thanks for 
                        seeing me so soon. 

           And then, unable to help herself. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        I hope the timing wasn’t too 
                        inconvenient for you.

           Benson reacts. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           On her way out, Joy passes a team of doctors and nurses 
           pushing a YOUNG WOMAN (16), Charlotte’s age, down the hall. 
           The gurney is maneuvered into a LARGE ANNEX with a sign she 
           recognizes: “SEPTIC PATIENT WARD.” 

           Joy slows, watches the woman transferred to a bed in a row of 
           nearly forty. All occupied by young women.

           A NURSE stops to add a NAME to a list on a large blackboard. 
           Joy approaches, gestures to the young woman.

                                 JOY
                        Excuse me, what’s wrong with her?

           The nurse shrugs.

                                 NURSE
                        Same thing that’s wrong with all of 
                        them. Either she did it to herself 
                        or someone did it to her.

           Joy looks at the faces of all the women -- the desperation, 
           shame, guilt, pain. It’s overwhelming. 

           The nurse enters and the double doors close in Joy’s face.

           EXT. HYDE PARK - STREET - DAY

           Joy walks through her neighborhood alone, returning from her 
           appointment. 

           Through passing windows, she sees HOUSEWIFE after HOUSEWIFE 
           engaged in the same activities -- cooking, cleaning, watching 
           soap operas. One woman stands at the window, looking out, 
           smoking. 
                                 JOY (PRE-LAP)
                        When we first got married, Will was 
                        worried I was too malleable -- 
                        always shifting and bending to 
                        everyone else’s needs. He wanted me 
                        to take more initiative. Find 
                        hobbies. Figure out what made me 
                        happy. 

           EXT. LANA’S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

           Joy and Lana recline in familiar poses, smoking and drinking. 
           She continues. 

                                 JOY 
                        But then he changed. And he got 
                        used to having me around all the 
                        time. 

                                 LANA
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about, Joy. Seems to me you’re 
                        always in motion.

                                 JOY
                        But I never get anywhere. 

           Lana looks at her, confused. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes I think I’m more than 
                        Will. Do you know what I mean?

                                 LANA
                          (cautiously)
                        No. 

                                 JOY
                        He’s indecisive. I mean he’s 
                        loving, so good with Charlotte, 
                        kind and dependable. But he’s... 
                        weak. That’s what I mean. Is that 
                        awful to say?

                                 LANA
                          (frank)
                        Yes. 

           A beat.

                                 LANA (CONT’D)
                        You’re acting strange, Joy. Is it 
                        the baby?
           She hesitates. Can’t bear to tell Lana the truth. 

                                 JOY
                        No. Just the wine. 

           Lana takes a long swig of hers.

                                 LANA
                        Well, whatever it is, it’s not 
                        Will’s fault.

           INT. JOY’S CAR - DRIVING - DAY

           Joy winds through an expensive section of Hyde Park. She 
           consults the address -- the one Gwen gave her over the phone. 
           Pulls up to a MASSIVE MANSION.

           She looks out the window for a moment, surprised. 

           EXT. MANSION - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Joy waits at the top of the steps. An elegant woman with 
           intelligent eyes, JULIA KNOWLES (73), opens the door, 
           confidently reaches out her hand.  

                                 JULIA
                        Hello, I’m Julia. 

           They shake. 

                                 JOY
                        Joy.

                                 JULIA
                        Yes, of course. Welcome. 

           She turns, motioning for Joy to follow her. 

           INT. JULIA’S MANSION - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The room is crowded with women. Most in their late 20s and 
           early 30s. Housewives, moms.  Also a small cabal of beatnik 
           students, including Gwen, who reads off an index card at the 
           top of a stack.

                                 GWEN
                        Darlene. 22 years old. Eleven 
                        weeks. Lost her job at the bank 
                        when they found out. Husband 
                        doesn’t know.
           She places the card in her lap. Passes the stack to the woman 
           sitting next to her... MELANIE. 

                                 MELANIE
                        Connie. 17 years old. Coming in on 
                        the train from Peoria. Thinks she 
                        may be 20 weeks. Syphilis. Has 54 
                        dollars.

           Passes it.

           Joy takes a seat outside the circle, watching as the card 
           moves from one woman to the next. 

           Melanie looks up, sees Joy, smiles. Then takes a breath, 
           picks up the next card.

           INT. JULIA’S MANSION - KITCHEN - LATER 

           The women mill around a center island where a housekeeper 
           refills refreshments. Joy hangs back. 

           Julia hands her a glass of iced tea.

                                 JULIA
                        Thanks for coming. We were hoping 
                        you would.

           Joy hands back the glass.

                                 JOY
                        I can’t stay.

                                 JULIA
                        What a shame. 

                                 JOY
                        I’m not like the women on those 
                        cards. 

                                 JULIA
                        Aren’t you?

                                 JOY
                        I wanted that baby. I had no 
                        choice.

           Julia studies her. 

                                 JULIA
                        Coat hangers. Knitting needles. Gin 
                        and ginger. Sloes. Turpentine. 
                                 JOY
                        What?

                                 JULIA
                        Or mafia docs. Who like to rape 
                        women before butchering them. 
                          (beat)
                        Those were your other choices. 

           Joy just stares at Julia, clearly thrown.

                                 JOY
                        Even if I wanted to-- 

                                 JULIA
                        Your husband never has to know. 
                        None of ours do. We know each other 
                        from the knitting circle, the book 
                        club, golf, the PTA--

                                 JOY
                        I’m not sure what you’re doing is 
                        right.

                                 JULIA
                        Me neither. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Will looks up from the paper as Joy enters.

                                 WILL
                        Your Avon party went late. 

           Raises his martini glass, proud.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        I made my own drink.

                                 JOY
                        Congratulations.

           She heads for the stairs, then regrets her sharpness. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        I just need to lie down for a 
                        minute. I’ll be down soon to make 
                        dinner. 

           Will watches her slowly climb the stairs, a little miffed.

                                 WILL
                        Who knew Avon could be so taxing.
                                 JOY
                        What?

                                 WILL
                        Nothing.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           A cookbook is propped open, ingredients and utensils 
           everywhere. Joy is peeling apples when the PHONE RINGS. 

                                 JOY
                        Hello?

                                 JULIA (O.S.)
                        Joy. It’s Julia. 

                                 JOY
                        Julia?

                                 JULIA
                        From Jane. We need you for a 3pm 
                        pick up at Washington Park. Her 
                        name’s Sandra. She’ll be waiting 
                        for you at the pay-phone near the 
                        South entrance. You’ll be dropping 
                        her at the Drake Hotel. Room 316. 
                        The doctor will meet her there. 
                        Okay? 

           Joy looks around, even though nobody’s home. 

                                 JOY
                        I have guests coming for dinner 
                        tonight. 

           A long silence, then--

                                 JULIA
                        What are you making?

                                 JOY
                        Uh... pork roast. Scalloped 
                        potatoes, pineapple upside-down 
                        cake--

                                 JULIA
                        Change of menu. Tuna casserole, 
                        creamed spinach and Jello. 

                                 JOY
                        But--
                                 JULIA
                        I know it’s inconvenient, Joy. Do 
                        you want to tell this poor girl she 
                        can’t get an abortion because you 
                        have to make a cake? 

           INT. CAR - PARKED - DAY

           Joy sits in the front seat of a car parked at the curb near 
           the Drake Hotel. She checks her watch incessantly. Relaxing 
           in the back, SANDRA (18), powders her nose.

                                 SANDRA
                        I hope he’s handsome.

                                 JOY
                        Who?

                                 SANDRA
                        The abortion doctor.

                                 JOY
                        Does it matter?

                                 SANDRA
                        Wouldn’t it be funny if I fell in 
                        love with my abortion doctor?

                                 JOY
                        Great story for the kids.

           Joy checks the time. It’s 3:05PM. He’s late.

                                 SANDRA
                        The lady on the phone said most 
                        Janes have had one.

           She’s clearly hoping for some reassurance.

                                 JOY
                        Not me. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I don’t believe you. 

                                 JOY
                        Not like this.

                                 SANDRA
                        What does that mean?

                                 JOY
                        Nothing. Never mind. 
           Sandra has no idea what she’s talking about.

                                 SANDRA
                        This is such a bore. Is he always 
                        so late?

                                 JOY
                        I really don’t know. 

           Sandra pulls out a wad of cash.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Where did you get all that?

                                 SANDRA
                        My boss. At the bank. It’s no big 
                        deal for him. He’s rich. When we 
                        were doing it, I asked him to pull 
                        out. But he didn’t want to. He 
                        whispered, I’ll take care of it. 

           She holds out the cash, cheerful.

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        And he did. 

           Joy takes it, clearly uncomfortable with Sandra’s cavalier 
           attitude. 

           LATER:

           Close on the FACE OF A WATCH. It’s now 5PM. The two are still 
           waiting in the car, now filled with smoke. Joy is choking on 
           it, her anxiety growing. 

           She glances back at Sandra, sprawled across the seat, smoking 
           a joint.

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        Want to play Truth or Dare?

                                 JOY
                        I actually need to go. My husband--

           Sandra sits up, anxious.

                                 SANDRA
                        You can’t leave me here alone. 

           She leans over the front-seat, holds out the joint. 

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        It’ll make the time go faster. 
                        While slowing everything else down.
           Joy looks at her, confused.

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        It’s hard to explain. But it’ll 
                        help. I promise. 

                                 JOY
                        No, thank you.

                                 SANDRA
                        You’re very tightly wound, Joy. I 
                        bet you’re the kind of lady who’s 
                        always smiling, then one day a 
                        fisherman finds you at the bottom 
                        of Lake Michigan.

                                 JOY
                        That’s ridiculous.

           Sandra sinks into the backseat, starts singing to herself 
           from “Mother’s Little Helper” by The Rolling Stones.

                                 SANDRA
                        Things are different today
                        I hear ev'ry mother say
                        Cooking fresh food for a husband's 
                        just a drag
                        So she buys an instant cake and she 
                        burns her frozen steak
                        And goes running for the shelter of 
                        a mother's little helper
                        And two help her on her way, get 
                        her through her busy day
                        Doctor please, some more of 
                        these...

           A CAR pulls up in front of them, flashes its lights. They 
           don’t notice. 

           The HANDSOME MAN from earlier, wearing dark sunglasses and a 
           ball cap, gets out of his car, irritated. Taps on the glass. 
           Joy screams.  

           MOMENTS LATER:

           Joy stands outside the car, counting out the wad of cash. 

                                 JOY
                        1200 dollars. 

           The Handsome Man takes the money out of her hand.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        It’s a lot of money.
                                 HANDSOME MAN
                        Not as much as having a baby.

                                 JOY
                        You’re late. That’s really 
                        inconsiderate. There are people at 
                        my house right now waiting for me 
                        to serve them dinner. 

                                 HANDSOME MAN
                        What’s your name?

                                 JOY
                          (after a beat)
                        Joy. What’s yours?

           Ignoring her question.

                                 HANDSOME MAN
                        Okay Joy, listen up. I went to a 
                        big fancy medical school that was 
                        really fucking expensive-- but this 
                        is what I choose to do with my 
                        time. I’m late because I’ve got a 
                        lot of women to help, okay? Now 
                        please put that blindfold on her so 
                        I’m not late for the next one. 

           He starts to walk off, turns back. 

                                 HANDSOME MAN (CONT’D)
                        By the way, I remember you. You had 
                        a whole lot to say that time too.

           He heads to his car. Joy opens the back door to his -- and 
           finds Sandra, her confidence suddenly gone. She’s trying not 
           to cry. Joy squeezes in next to her, holds her close. 

           EXT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Joy screeches up, late. She hurries out of the car, carrying 
           cartons of Chinese food.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Joy rushes in, drops a carton of rice, keeps going.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She enters, stops cold when she sees...
           Will, seated at the head of a beautifully set table, staring 
           back, angry. Around the table are two other couples, as well 
           as Charlotte, Lana, and her daughter, ERIN (15). 

                                 JOY
                        I’m so sorry. My...
                          (knowing it sounds 
                           ridiculous)
                        Avon party. I meant to call-- 

           She surveys the impressive meal.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Wow.

                                 LANA
                        It’s nothing. Just threw it 
                        together. I saw you had a roast in 
                        the fridge, so...

           Joy looks around the table. There’s nowhere for her to sit. 
           Will stands.

                                 WILL
                        I’ll bring in another chair. 

           He heads for the kitchen. She follows.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Will takes a chair from the kitchen table and starts to head 
           back towards the dining room-- 

                                 JOY
                        I’m sorry. I thought I’d be home--

           He doesn’t wait for her to finish. She watches him go, then 
           collapses onto a chair. Lana enters, turns on the oven.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 LANA
                        Sorry, I just need to take the pies 
                        out of the oven.

                                 JOY
                        That’s not what I mean.

                                 LANA
                        You weren’t here, Joy.
                                 JOY
                        I’m here now.

           Lana removes the pies, looks up.

                                 LANA
                        Are you?

           Joy follows her out into...

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Lana places the pies on the table. Will looks up at her, 
           grateful.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           Joy carefully folds laundry. The phone rings. She looks at 
           it, hesitates.

                                 CHARLOTTE (O.S.)
                        I’ll get it--

                                 JOY
                        No, honey, it’s okay.  

           She picks up. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           INT. JULIA’S MANSION - SITTING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Julia, in painter’s smock, stands in front of an easel -- a 
           paintbrush in one hand and phone receiver in the other. On 
           the table in front of her, a sleeping cat poses. 

                                 JULIA
                        Hi Joy, it’s Julia. I was calling 
                        because--

           INTERCUT AS NEEDED:

                                 JOY
                        I’m sorry, Julia, I don’t think I 
                        can help out anymore. 

                                 JULIA
                        Your husband?
                                 JOY
                          (beat)
                        Yes. 

           The cat stretches.

                                 JULIA
                        Not now, Eleanor.

                                 JOY
                        Excuse me?

           Eleanor circles the cushion, resumes her pose. Julia 
           continues painting.

                                 JULIA
                        I thought I saw something in you, 
                        Joy. Maybe I was wrong.

                                 JOY
                        Maybe you were.

                                 JULIA
                        I’m not suggesting you become a 
                        different person. I’m suggesting 
                        you become more you. 

           A beat. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        There’s a young girl waiting for 
                        you. She’s scared-- 

                                 JOY
                        I really can’t.

                                 JULIA
                          (a beat)
                        Okay. 

           Julia’s doorbell RINGS. She puts down her brush.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Goodbye, Joy. 

           She’s about to hang up--

                                 JOY
                        How old is she?

           Julia smiles.

                                 JULIA
                        Seventeen. 
           Joy’s silent. 

           The doorbell RINGS again. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Two o’clock. Same place. 

           She looks out the window, sees...

           A frazzled pregnant woman, a toddler in her arms.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Share your own abortion story, Joy. 
                        It’ll help. 

           Julia hangs up. Then Joy hears the sound of another phone 
           CLICKING off. She hangs up, walks into...

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - CHARLOTTE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlotte is sitting by the phone, looking shocked. 

                                 JOY
                        Charlotte...

           Charlotte looks up at her mom. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                          (“normal”)
                        May I use your sewing machine? I 
                        have to finish my project for home 
                        ec.

                                 JOY
                        Did you hear anything?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                          (clearly lying)
                        No. 

           Joy looks into Charlotte’s eyes, searching.

                                 JOY
                        Please don’t say anything to your 
                        father.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You want me to lie to him?

                                 JOY
                        You just lied to me.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Did you have a miscarriage?

           Joy falters...

                                 JOY
                        I think you’ll understand if you 
                        just let me--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I don’t want to understand. 

           Charlotte gets up and walks out of her room. Joy looks over 
           at the doll, still wearing the handmade hat. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Later. Joy and Charlotte sit, silently knitting. Joy watches 
           as Charlotte puts hers aside, picks up an issue of Good 
           Housekeeping. She’s pointedly ignoring her mother’s gaze. 

           She flips through the magazine, finally looks up.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Just promise you’ll stop.

                                 JOY
                          (hesitating)
                        I will.

           She looks like a child again, plaintive and scared.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        It could be someone else’s brother 
                        or sister. 

                                 JOY
                        I know.

           Charlotte goes back to her magazine, doesn’t look up.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        And it’s disgusting. 

           Off Joy, conflicted.

                                 JOY
                        You’re right. It is.
           INT. HELEN’S APARTMENT BUILDING - CORRIDOR - DAY

           Joy and Melanie walk through a dingy hallway facing a closed 
           door. Joy looks guilty, but determined. 

                                 MELANIE
                        You do the talking this time. At 
                        some point, you’ll be running these 
                        sessions on your own. 

           They knock on a door. It opens. A timid bedraggled woman, 
           HELEN (32), answers. A crying baby in her arms. 

                                 JOY
                        Good morning. We’re Jane.

           INT. DINGY APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Helen sits across from Joy and Melanie. She’s nursing a baby.

                                 JOY
                        Any questions for us?

           Helen looks up, nervous.

                                 HELEN
                        Is there any... flexibility on the 
                        price?

           Joy pauses, uncertain.

                                 MELANIE
                        I’m sorry. That’s out of our 
                        control. 

                                 JOY
                        Is there anything you could sell? 

           Joy looks around the apartment at the broken toys, worn out 
           furniture.

                                 HELEN
                        Twelve hundred is a lot.

           Melanie reaches out, gently exposes a bruise on Helen’s 
           forearm. Their eyes meet.

                                 MELANIE
                        Do what you can. And if you 
                        can’t... we’ll pray for you.

           Melanie stands, heads for the door. Joy, reluctant, follows.  
           INT. HELEN’S APARTMENT BUILDING - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           Joy looks at Melanie, incredulous.

                                 JOY
                        We’ll pray for you? Really? 

                                 MELANIE
                        You’ll get used to it. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Will and Charlotte sit beside each other, watching TV. Will 
           passes Charlotte a large bowl of popcorn. She passes it back. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You made too much.

                                 WILL
                        Well, your mom usually eats most of 
                        it.

           Will glances out the window at the empty driveway.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        It must be a very intense Avon 
                        meeting.

           Charlotte turns away, unable to hide her sense of betrayal. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I guess so. 

           INT. MELANIE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Joy looks around Melanie’s small apartment, bare except for 
           photographs of her son. 

           Melanie pours a tall glass of wine, holds it out to Joy. 

                                 JOY
                        No, thank you.

           Melanie downs half the glass. She can tell Joy is still 
           thinking about Helen. 

                                 MELANIE
                        You can pay the 1200 dollars for 
                        her if you like. But there are 
                        hundreds more just like her. Are 
                        you going to pay for all of them?
           Joy contemplates this.

                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                        The world is full of sadness, Joy. 

                                 JOY
                        Maybe I’ll just have half a glass. 

           Melanie pours a full glass, hands it to her. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know what I’m doing, I 
                        don’t know what I want--

                                 MELANIE
                        I find we spend a lot of time 
                        trying to figure out what we want. 
                        When we show ourselves what we want 
                        by what we do. 

           A beat. 

                                 JOY
                        Do you miss him?

                                 MELANIE
                        My son or my husband?

                                 JOY
                        Both.

                                 MELANIE
                        Of course. But I like being alone. 
                        I always have.

           Joy looks at the unpacked boxes.

                                 JOY
                        Then why haven’t you unpacked?

           Melanie smiles at her.

                                 MELANIE
                        Because I don’t have to.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - WILL’S STUDY - NIGHT

           Joy enters Will’s study, closes the door behind her. 

           Heads to a safe in the bookshelf. Opens it. There are stacks 
           of CASH. She stares at them. Thinking. Doesn’t take anything. 
           Closes the safe and walks out...
           Nearly SLAMMING into Will as he heads in, carrying a drink. 

                                 WILL
                        Looking for me? 

           Joy startles, but quickly recovers. 

                                 JOY
                        I was just coming to say it’s late.

           He smiles, turns off his desk lamp. 

                                 WILL
                        Let’s go to bed.

           Kisses her as he heads out. She lingers, eyeing the safe. 

                                 JOY
                        I’ll be right up.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

           Joy slides in next to Will. He turns towards her, kisses her. 
           His hands move beneath the sheets--

                                 JOY
                        I can’t. 

           He looks at her, confused.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 WILL
                          (gently)
                        This didn’t just happen to you, 
                        Joy.

                                 JOY
                        I know. But to be fair, it did 
                        happen more to me than to you.

           He turns away. 

           INT. HELEN’S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

           Joy knocks on Helen’s door. It’s been raining, her hair is 
           damp. She quickly glances inside her purse. 

           It’s stuffed with CASH from the safe. She snaps it shut as 
           the door opens.
           A BURLY MAN (35) looks at her suspiciously. 

                                 BURLY MAN
                        What do you want?

                                 JOY
                        I was looking for Helen. I’m a 
                        friend. I think she’s expecting me--

                                 BURLY MAN
                        Are you one of them? Those ladies 
                        she called? 

           He starts to shake with anger. 

           Joy backs up a little. 

                                 BURLY MAN (CONT’D)
                        You nosy bitches. 
                          (breaking down)
                        She almost killed herself. She’s in 
                        the hospital. I hope you’re proud 
                        of yourselves. 

                                 JOY
                        I think there’s been some kind of 
                        mistake.

                                 BURLY MAN
                        You’re fucking right there’s been 
                        some kind of mistake.

           She turns and leaves, walking faster and faster, forcing 
           herself not to look back. 

                                 BURLY MAN (CONT’D)
                          (shouting after her)
                        I’m going to make sure they find 
                        you bitches and put you all in 
                        jail!

           INT. HOSPITAL - SEPSIS WARD - SAME TIME

           NURSE LYDIA (32), kind face, wheels Helen into the SEPSIS 
           WARD seen earlier. Her patient gown is covered in blood.

           MARVIN FALK (36), a bearded, dispassionate doctor, quickly   
           assesses the situation.

                                 FALK
                        Another one?

           Nurse Lydia nods. He grimaces, approaches Helen. 
                                 FALK (CONT’D)
                        Who did this to you?

           Helen says nothing. Looks at him with dead eyes. 

                                 FALK (CONT’D)
                        Until you tell me who did this, I’m 
                        afraid I can’t treat you. 

                                 HELEN
                        Just let me die.

                                 FALK
                        Syndicate doctor? Midwife. Husband. 
                        Sister. Boyfriend-- 

                                 HELEN
                        I did it to myself. 

                                 FALK
                        I don’t believe you. If you don’t 
                        tell me, whoever did this to you 
                        will do it to someone else.

           He stares intently. She closes her eyes, surrendering to the 
           pain.

           INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - LATER

           Falk gestures to the nurse. 

                                 FALK
                        Let her stew for awhile. Until 
                        she’s ready to talk.

                                 NURSE LYDIA
                        She’s bleeding.

           He walks away. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - LATER

           Falk is in the middle of abdominal surgery, assisted by a 
           YOUNG RESIDENT and Nurse Lydia. 

           We see the patient’s face - it’s Helen.

                                 YOUNG RESIDENT
                        Fibrotic. 

                                 FALK
                        This wasn’t her first abortion.
                                 YOUNG RESIDENT
                        I can close up. 

                                 FALK
                        We’re not done. I’m going to remove 
                        her uterus.

                                 YOUNG RESIDENT
                        Is that medically necessary?

                                 FALK
                        It’s a preventive measure.  

           There’s a fraught silence. The resident looks to the nurse, 
           biting her tongue. He pulls out Helen’s uterus, drops it into 
           a pan.

           INT. SEPTIC WARD - NIGHT

           It’s quiet. Most of the young women are sleeping. Falk, with 
           the resident by his side, walks between beds, rounding. 

                                 FALK
                        I declare a young woman dead twice 
                        a week. I tell the police, they do 
                        nothing. I tell the patients, they 
                        condemn me for judging. Everyone 
                        tells me, ‘It’s not your job to 
                        save them all. Just save the ones 
                        you can, let the rest die.’ People 
                        know they can exploit these women 
                        and they do. They take their money, 
                        then mutilate them and nobody 
                        cares. We’re just supposed to stand 
                        by and bear witness.

           He looks at the resident.

                                 FALK (CONT’D)
                        I perform a hysterectomy whenever 
                        possible. I consider it a 
                        charitable act. At least I’m doing 
                        something. 

           The resident says nothing. Falk pulls the sheet up on a 15- 
           year-old girl, sleeping with her teddy bear. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Joy’s on the phone, shaken, tearful, having just heard the 
           news about Helen. 
                                 MELANIE (O.S.)
                        They claimed it was an emergency 
                        operation--

                                 JOY
                        Jesus--

           The door opens. Joy panics, hangs up just in time. 

           Will and Lana enter, laughing. Stop short when they see Joy, 
           quickly wiping the tears from her eyes. 

                                 WILL
                        I thought you had your Avon thing 
                        today?

                                 JOY
                        It was cancelled. 

           Will looks awkwardly between her and Lana. 

                                 WILL
                        I ran into Lana at the dry cleaner--

                                 JOY
                        I’m sorry, Will, I meant to--

                                 WILL
                        It’s okay. I figured you wouldn’t 
                        have time. 

           Joy looks at Lana, who shows no sign of leaving.

                                 JOY
                        I’ll put on the kettle.  

           She smooths her dress, wipes her mascara-- 

                                 WILL
                        Everything okay, honey?

           She gestures to the TV--

                                 JOY
                        It’s the soap. Poor Nurse 
                        Caldecott. Her own step-daughter 
                        ran off with her fiancé. I got 
                        caught up in it. 

           Will snorts.

                                 WILL
                        Women and their soaps. 
                                 LANA
                        I’m the same way. Sometimes it 
                        feels more real than real life.

                                 JOY
                        It really does.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Through the open door, Joy watches Will and Lana, laughing 
           easily. 

           She sees Charlotte leap down the staircase, greet Lana 
           enthusiastically, then flop down on the couch beside her. The 
           three of them look like the picture perfect family. 

           Will looks up, catches her eye. He looks guilty and 
           uncertain. She smiles at him. Then picks up a knife and 
           aggressively slices a pound cake -- her motions rapid and 
           effective.

           The women of Jane sit in a circle, brooding. Joy looks 
           fierce, determined.  

                                 JOY
                        That can never happen again. 

                                 JULIA
                        It will.

           Joy looks at them sharply.

                                 JOY
                        Helen hurt herself because the 
                        doctor we hired charges too much. 
                        This is our fault. 

           Julia raises an eyebrow.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        We’re supposed to be 
                        revolutionaries, but we’re not. 
                        We’re just secretaries and 
                        chauffeurs. And we take orders from 
                        a man. 

           There’s murmurs in the room. 

                                 MELANIE
                        What do you suggest, Joy? 
           She bites her lip. 

                                 JOY
                        Cut out the middle man. Do the 
                        abortions ourselves. 

           Julia and the others stare at her, dumbfounded.

                                 GWEN
                          (high as usual)
                        We are the middle man.

                                 JOY
                        You know what I mean.

                                 JULIA
                        It’s out of the question, Joy. It’s 
                        not a risk Jane is prepared to 
                        take.

                                 JOY
                        It’s a risk I’m prepared to take.

                                 JULIA
                        You don’t know the first thing 
                        about--

                                 JOY
                        I could learn. Dean could teach me. 

                                 JULIA
                        Why would he do that?

                                 JOY
                        I don’t know. Because women are 
                        dying?

                                 JULIA
                        He’s a doctor, Joy. He spent four 
                        years in medical school. He can’t 
                        teach you everything he knows in a 
                        week.

                                 JOY
                        I don’t need to know everything. 
                        And I learn fast. I mastered the 
                        soufflé in one day when everyone 
                        said-- 

                                 JULIA
                        This isn’t a soufflé--
                                 JOY
                        Okay. Let’s sit here and do 
                        nothing. That’s a better plan. 

           A long silence as Joy looks from one woman to the next. 
           Melanie meets her gaze, smiles sympathetically, but can’t do 
           more.

                                 JULIA
                        Moving on. Jane has received 
                        several complaints about unanswered 
                        phone calls. We need to honor our 
                        commitment to be near the phones 
                        during designated hours. 

           Gwen raises her hand.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Yes, Gwen?

                                 GWEN
                        My phone got turned off by the 
                        fascists.

                                 JULIA
                        Did you forget to pay your bill 
                        again?

                                 GWEN
                        Communication should be free. Free 
                        speech is not a commodity.

                                 JULIA
                        Okay, anyone else?

           INT. JOY’S CAR - PARKED - NIGHT

           Slouched low in her seat, Joy watches as Dean’s car pulls up 
           to the curb. He guides the blind-folded girl, post-abortion, 
           onto the sidewalk. She removes her blindfold, a little dazed. 

           Joy starts up her car. Chases after Dean’s.

           INT. JOY’S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT

           Joy follows Dean’s car down some sketchy streets... then into 
           Hyde Park, her own neighborhood of expensive homes and 
           manicured lawns. 

           He pulls into the driveway of a large brownstone, emerges 
           from his car, whistling, jogs up the front steps and enters. 
           She jump out of her car, follows. Knocks on the door.

           INT. HYDE PARK HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           Dean opens the door. Joy peers in at the impressive entryway 
           behind him. 

                                 DEAN
                        You again.

                                 JOY
                        Me again. 

                                 DEAN
                        How can I help you this time?

                                 JOY
                        Is this your house?

           Suddenly uncomfortable, he doesn’t respond. She maneuvers 
           past him. 

           INT. DEAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The living room is filled with expensive furniture and a 
           state of the art (circa 1967) sound system. Joy takes in the 
           original paintings on the walls. 

                                 JOY
                        1200 per procedure. Five or more 
                        procedures per week... 

                                 DEAN
                        Do you need help with the math?

                                 JOY
                        We thought your fee was so high 
                        because of overhead, instruments, 
                        staff...

           He shrugs. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        My patient nearly died because she 
                        couldn’t afford you. And this is 
                        how you live.

                                 DEAN
                        Coincidentally, that’s not my 
                        fucking problem. I provide a 
                        dangerous, illegal service -- I 
                        deserve my fee. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DEAN (CONT'D)
                        And I happen to be damn good at 
                        what I do. God knows no one else is 
                        jumping at the chance to risk their 
                        license for women who can’t keep 
                        their legs shut. 

           Dean looks up, sees Joy’s jaw clench. 

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean it like that.

           The sound of LOPSIDED FOOTSTEPS.

           Gwen, half-asleep, walks in wearing one of Dean’s tee shirts.

                                 GWEN
                        You home, baby?

           She notices Joy, smiles. 

                                 GWEN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Joy. 

           Joy stares, speechless.

           INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Joy, white knuckling the steering wheel, stares straight 
           ahead. 

           She turns on the radio. Cranks the volume as high as she can. 
           A man in a sports car cuts her off and she SCREAMS over the 
           music. 

                                 JOY
                        ASSHOLE!

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

           Joy walks in with wild hair and a slightly deranged look in 
           her eyes, practically crashes into Charlotte coming down the 
           stairs.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What happened to you?

                                 JOY
                        Nothing, honey. Just one of those 
                        days.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No, I mean your hair. Your roots 
                        are so dark. 
                          (beat)
                        Aren’t you embarrassed?

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Joy sits at the vanity, while Charlotte applies blonde dye to 
           her roots.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        How often do we have to do this?

                                 JOY
                        About once a month.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Isn’t there a way to stop the roots 
                        from growing?

                                 JOY 
                        Death.

           Charlotte looks at her. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I have a lot on my mind.

           A beat. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You’re not going to stop are you?

           Joy doesn’t answer.

                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
                        I know what you did.

                                 JOY
                        I had no choice, Charlotte. You 
                        have to believe me. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        But you lie all the time.

                                 JOY
                        It’s not lying. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Well, it’s not the truth.

           Joy has no response. 
                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
                        Lana’s helping me with my home ec 
                        project, by the way -- since you’ve  
                        had a lot on your mind a lot.  

           Charlotte glances at her mother in the mirror. It’s clear her 
           words stung.

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

           The entire PTA, including Lana, is assembled. Except for Joy. 
           Lana checks her watch. 

                                 LANA
                        I think we should get started. 

                                 HOUSEWIFE #2
                          (nervously)
                        But she’s the president--

                                 JOY
                        Not anymore. I’m resigning. 

           Joy’s standing in the doorway, a little out of breath. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Due to other commitments. Can I 
                        speak to you for a moment, Lana?

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

           Joy looks at a bemused Lana. 

                                 LANA
                        Joy, you don’t seem yourself--

                                 JOY
                        And in exchange for my stepping 
                        down... I would like you to stay 
                        the hell away from my family. 

           Lana just smiles, shakes her head ruefully.

                                 LANA
                        You have no time for you family, 
                        now you have no time for the PTA. 
                        What do you have time for, Joy? 

           Lana walks back into the PTA meeting, closing the door in her 
           face.
           EXT. MEDICAL SCHOOL - DAY

           Joy walks through heavy wooden doors under an imposing sign 
           that reads: “UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO MEDICAL SCHOOL.” 

           INT. MEDICAL SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           The halls are filled with men carrying heavy books and white 
           coats. 

           INT. MEDICAL SCHOOL - LIBRARY - LATER

           Joy walks through the impressive aisles of the library. On 
           the walls, she passes portrait after portrait of IMPORTANT 
           WHITE MEN wearing bow-ties and stethoscopes. 

           She starts looking through titles. Trying to find something. 

           A young, confident MEDICAL STUDENT sidles up to her.

                                 MEDICAL STUDENT
                        Hi, I’m Ben. 

           Joy considers him, then shakes his hand.

                                 JOY
                        Joy.

                                 MEDICAL STUDENT
                        Nursing?

           She hesitates, then nods. 

                                 MEDICAL STUDENT (CONT’D)
                        Can I help you find something?

                                 JOY
                        I’m looking for a book on the 
                        female anatomy. The pelvic floor 
                        specifically. It’s just... 
                        confusing to me. 

           She smiles, winningly. He grins, starts looking for a book. 
           Finds one, opens it up.

                                 MEDICAL STUDENT
                        Let me give you a quick recap.

                                 JOY
                        And abortion. 
                                 MEDICAL STUDENT
                          (caught off guard)
                        What?

                                 JOY
                          (redirecting)
                        Just the pelvic floor is fine.

           The medical student looks at her. 

           INT. MEDICAL SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - LATER

           Joy walks out carrying the textbook. 

           The walls are lined with face-sheets of previous medical 
           school classes. She begins to study them. Class of 1968, 
           1967, 1966...

           INT. DEAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Dean lies on the couch, a white cat on his chest. The 
           doorbell RINGS. He jumps up, looks through the peephole, then 
           sighs. Opens the door.

           Joy stands there, a probing look on her face.

                                 DEAN
                        I thought we had an understanding--

                                 JOY
                        You’re not a doctor.

           INT. DEAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           They sit across from each other. 

                                 JOY
                        You said you went to the University 
                        of Chicago. I went through every 
                        face-sheet. You’re not on any of 
                        them. 

                                 DEAN
                        I was sick that day--

                                 JOY
                        Bullshit. 

           A beat.
                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        You taught yourself this procedure. 
                        Or someone taught you. But either 
                        way, you didn’t learn it in medical 
                        school.

                                 DEAN
                        What does it matter where I learned 
                        it? The point is I did.

                                 JOY
                        You’re a fraud.

                                 DEAN
                        You have no idea how tough it is 
                        for a guy like me who grew up poor 
                        and went to a shitty college to get 
                        into medical school. It doesn’t 
                        matter how bad you want it. You 
                        gotta be set up in life from the 
                        beginning to get anywhere--

                                 JOY
                        Are you seriously looking for 
                        sympathy from me?

                                 DEAN
                        What are you going to do? Tell 
                        Jane? 

                                 JOY
                        All this time we’ve been telling 
                        women they’re getting a doctor 
                        when, in reality, they’re just 
                        getting a guy named Dean. So, yeah, 
                        I’m going to tell Jane.

                                 DEAN
                        How much do you want?

                                 JOY
                        I don’t want money.

                                 DEAN
                        What the hell do you want, Joy?

           INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY

           Joy walks through the same corridors of the floor where she 
           was a patient. 

           She passes the Septic Ward, looks in at the women. Wants to 
           linger but knows she can’t. 
           She slips into a supply closet.

           INT. HOSPITAL - SUPPLY CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER

           Joy is filling her purse with INSTRUMENTS, selected at random 
           from the shelves. 

           As she moves to leave, she spots a WHITE COAT hanging off a 
           hook on the door. Grabs it, stuffing it into her purse. Slips 
           out...

           INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Into the corridor, where she nearly runs into Dr. Benson.

                                 BENSON
                        Mrs. Griffin. 

           He looks at the supply room from which she emerged.

                                 JOY
                        I took a wrong turn. Looking for 
                        the bathroom.

                                 BENSON
                        I see. And what brings you here 
                        today?

           A beat...

                                 JOY
                        I’m here to... volunteer. I feel I 
                        should give back, after all you did 
                        for me, Doctor Benson.

                                 BENSON
                        Well, that’s gratifying. Thank you. 

           He continues on his way.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Joy transfers the instruments to a drawer in her bathroom.

           She pauses a moment, lifts an instrument that looks like a 
           metal WAND. Holds it up to the light. Her face shines. A 
           feeling of power courses through her. 

           Suddenly, she pulls out the white coat. Puts it on. Holds up 
           the instrument. Studies her reflection. 
           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Joy sits down in front of Will and Charlotte, surreptitiously 
           reading GOOD HOUSEKEEPING under the table.

                                 JOY
                        Put the magazine away, Charlotte.

           Charlotte looks up at her, then back down, continues reading.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                          (to Will)
                        How was your day, Honey?

                                 WILL
                        Uneventful. Yours?

                                 JOY
                        Same.

           A beat.  

                                 WILL
                        Joy?

                                 JOY
                        Yes?

                                 WILL
                        We don’t have any food.

           Joy blinks, looks at the empty table. Right. 

           Will leans back, deeply concerned. 

           INT. DINGY MOTEL - GUEST ROOM - DAY 

           Joy guides an anxious blindfolded woman through the door. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Are you going to do it?

                                 JOY
                        I’m going to help. 

           Joy squeezes the woman’s hand, guides her into the bathroom, 
           passing Dean, who’s covering the bed with a plastic sheet. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Honey, you can remove the 
                        blindfold while you’re in here. 
                        Just knock when you’re ready. 
           The woman nods, nervous.

           Joy steps out, closes the door. Turns to Dean, now arranging 
           his instrument tray. 

           She pulls a white coat out of her purse, puts it on. Then 
           takes out her own tray of carefully labelled instruments. 

                                 DEAN
                        What’s all that?

                                 JOY
                        I brought my own set. Curettes and 
                        dilators. I’m ready.

           Dean stares at her, dumbfounded.

                                 DEAN
                          (loud whisper)
                        Let’s be clear. I agreed to let you 
                        watch. No way in hell are you 
                        touching any of these women. Ever.

           A tap on the bathroom door. Dejected, Joy moves to open it. 
           Leads the blindfolded woman to the bed.

                                 JOY
                        That’s it, you’re doing great. 

           She settles the patient on the bed, as Dean steps forward.

                                 DEAN
                          (rough)
                        I’m Doctor Brooks. I need you to 
                        lie very still. If you move, it’s 
                        going to hurt. 

           The woman turns towards Joy’s voice, grips her hand tightly.

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                        Scooch down to the edge of the bed. 

           The woman does.

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s not the edge.

           Joy soothes her, as she helps her into position.

                                 JOY
                        There you go, perfect.

           LATER
           Dean cleans up. The woman is gone. 

                                 DEAN
                        Show’s over, you can go now. 

           Joy doesn’t move.

                                 JOY
                        You like it. 

                                 DEAN
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JOY
                        The work. I can see it in your 
                        eyes. People always like what 
                        they’re good at. Or they wouldn’t 
                        be good at it.

                                 DEAN
                        It’s just a job. 

                                 JOY
                        You help women. Keep them from 
                        hurting themselves. You understand 
                        the human body. 

                                 DEAN
                        If there was any other way to make 
                        this much money, this fast, I’d do 
                        it. 

           He slams his case shut, and leaves. Joy looks at the now 
           empty bed. Sits on it. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Charlotte and Erin (Lana’s daughter) drink lemonade from 
           martini glasses. Trying their best to act like grownups. 

           Will walks down the staircase, bemused. 

                                 WILL
                        How’s the play date going?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Dad, we’re not five-year-olds. 

           He puts his hands up, walks into the kitchen. 

                                 ERIN
                        Where’s your mom?
           Charlotte shrugs.

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        My mom says she’s gone a lot.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        That’s not true. 

                                 ERIN
                        When my dad was alive, my mom never 
                        left unless he wasn’t home. That’s 
                        how her mom was too. And that’s how 
                        I’m going to be.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Me too.

                                 ERIN
                        Did you hear Alison is getting 
                        married?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No.

                                 ERIN
                        She’s only three years older than 
                        us. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Pretty soon we’re going to have 
                        husbands too. And we’ll have to 
                        take care of them and the house and 
                        the kids.

                                 ERIN
                        And the shopping and cooking and 
                        cleaning.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        We’re going to be really busy.

                                 ERIN
                        And really happy.

           The door opens and Joy enters, her cheeks glowing from the 
           cold. Erin jumps up.

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Griffin, so nice to see you. 
                        May I take your coat?

           Joy looks at Charlotte.
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        She’s practicing--

                                 JOY
                        Being a butler?

                                 ERIN
                        A wife.

           Joy takes off her own coat, tosses it over the couch. Then 
           looks at the two girls with their mock martinis, perfectly    
           hair.

           She sits down next to them, eyes blazing. Takes Charlotte’s 
           “martini” and downs it.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Mom, it’s lemonade--

                                 JOY
                        What do you girls know about the 
                        female anatomy?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Erin, let’s go to your house--

           Joy rips a page out of Good Housekeeping. Takes a pen and 
           begins drawing on it.

                                 JOY
                        It’s unacceptable that we don’t 
                        know how we work. 

           She sketches lines.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        This -- this long canal -- is the 
                        vagina. 

           The girls look at each other, embarrassed.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        And right at the top, like a closed 
                        fist, is the cervix. It’s sort of 
                        the stopper to the uterus--

                                 ERIN
                        I should probably go help my mom 
                        with dinner.

                                 JOY
                        I haven’t even gotten to the 
                        urethra.
                                 ERIN
                        It’s late--

           Joy firmly grips her arm. 

                                 JOY
                        Did you know that our bodies don’t 
                        matter? Inside you and me and every 
                        man in the world is the same thing -
                        - a brain and a spinal cord, like a 
                        giant squishy noodle. That’s us, 
                        that’s the entirety of us. 
                        Everything around it -- the bones, 
                        muscle, uterus, penis, it’s all 
                        armor, accessories. We are all our 
                        brains. And we are all the same.  

           Erin looks at her astonished. 

           She holds out the diagram to Erin.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to take this with you? 
                        I’m sure your mother could benefit 
                        from it as well.

                                 ERIN
                        Oh, I don’t think so. But thank you 
                        so much anyway. 

           Erin heads quickly for the door. Charlotte stares at Joy, 
           angry. 

                                 JOY
                        Don’t look at me like that, 
                        Charlotte. You are going to be so 
                        much happier when you stop caring 
                        what other people think. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Are you happy?

           Joy just looks at her, then walks out. 

           A SERIES OF SHOTS:

           - Joy sits at a Jane meeting, dispirited and silent as she 
           listens to the other women talk. 

           - Joy watches Dean intensely as he performs abortions, her 
           eyes recording every movement. 
           - Joy and Charlotte cook at home. Charlotte watches Joy slice 
           steak tomatoes with precision and ease.

           - Dean watches Joy practicing intently with the curette, 
           impressed with her technique.

           - Joy, alone in her bathroom, slowly and deliberately squirts 
           the contents of her hair dye into the toilet.

           - Joy walks through a high school HOME EC fair. Girls exhibit 
           their handiwork. She watches as Lana stands proudly next to 
           Charlotte and Erin, displaying their homemade tablecloth.

           - Dean finally gives in, guides Joy’s hand through an actual 
           procedure. There is something intensely intimate about it. A 
           connection between two people doing something important and 
           delicate and dangerous.

           INT. JULIA’S HOUSE - GRAND FOYER - EVENING

           Wealthy couples in elegant attire mill about this black tie 
           charity event.

           Julia, in a classic gown and pearls, holds a cigarette in the 
           air as she listens to her HUSBAND entertain a group of 
           important-looking business men. 

           We recognize her husband as WARREN, the PARTNER from the 
           beginning of the movie. The one with the woman in the red 
           dress. Who is conspicuously absent now.

           She whispers in her husband’s ear, then turns to head for the 
           bar and practically collides with Will and Joy, also in an 
           evening gown. Her brown roots now strikingly obvious. 

                                 WILL
                        Mrs. Knowles. I’ve heard so much 
                        about you. I’m Will Griffin. An 
                        attorney at your husband’s firm.

                                 JULIA
                        I’m sorry, I should probably know 
                        all the names--

                                 WILL
                        I don’t even know all the names.

                                 JULIA
                        I trust he’s treating you well?

                                 WILL
                        No complaints. May I introduce you 
                        to my wife, Joy? 
           The two women smile guardedly at each other, shake hands. 

                                 JULIA
                        Pleasure to meet you. What a lovely 
                        dress.

                                 JOY
                        Thank you. Your home is exquisite.

           Julia smiles, intensely uncomfortable. An awkward pause.

                                 JULIA
                        I should check on the hors 
                        d’oeuvres. 

           She starts towards the kitchen, turns back.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        If you see the crab cakes floating 
                        by, grab one. They’re to die for.

           She walks off. 

           LATER

           Julia winds her way back with a cigarette and drink in hand, 
           passing Will, who’s in conversation with her husband.

           Julia suddenly bumps into Joy, smiles politely, but keeps 
           moving.

                                 JOY
                          (loud whisper)
                        Julia.

           Julia pauses, nervous, whispers back.

                                 JULIA
                        You know the rule, Joy. We don’t 
                        associate outside meetings.

                                 JOY
                        I have to tell you something. 

           Julia takes a puff from her elegant cigarette holder.

                                 JULIA
                        Later--

                                 JOY
                          (not quiet)
                        I helped perform an abortion.

           Julia winces at the word. 
           INT. JULIA’S MANSION - LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

           Julia pretends to be showing off her art collection. She and  
           Joy stare at an original Caravaggio.

                                 JULIA
                        Why would he let you do that? He’s 
                        the most private doctor I’ve ever--

                                 JOY
                        Because he’s not a doctor. And he’s 
                        afraid I’ll tell you. 

           Julia reacts. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        He wants us to think it’s rocket 
                        science. It’s not. It’s a fifteen 
                        minute procedure. Safer than a 
                        tonsillectomy when done correctly 
                        with clean instruments. I can do it 
                        now. Any of us could-- 

                                 JULIA
                        Joy, we could lose everything. Jane 
                        could... the police. Our husbands, 
                        their jobs--

           Joy looks out at all the well-adorned guests. Picks up a 
           crystal ashtray. 

                                 JOY
                        I can’t stand these people. 

                                 JULIA
                        You are these people. Just because 
                        you stopped dyeing your hair 
                        doesn’t make you Betty fucking 
                        Friedan. 

           She starts to walk away--

                                 JOY
                        What if I told your husband?

                                 JULIA
                        Why would you do that?

                                 JOY
                        Because I’m desperate. 

                                 JULIA
                        You would destroy my marriage?
                                 JOY
                        Your marriage is a lie, Julia. 

                                 JULIA
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JOY
                        The personal assistant.

           She flinches, but doesn’t look surprised. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        You know about her, don’t you?

                                 JULIA
                        I know about all of them. 

                                 JOY
                        So he gets to parade his other life 
                        in front of everyone you know. And 
                        you hide. Because you’re afraid 
                        he’ll lose his job. 

           A long beat. 

                                 JULIA
                        I’ll give you one chance. 

           Joy nods, grateful. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        He’s really not a doctor?

           She shakes her head. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        That’s very disturbing.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           A little drunk, Joy pushes Will onto the bed. They kiss 
           intensely. She begins undressing him. He pushes her dress up. 

                                 WILL
                        What’s gotten into you?

           She doesn’t answer, but it’s clear something has. Her face is 
           glowing. She begins to ride him, their clothes still mostly 
           on. And she starts to moan. Growing LOUDER and LOUDER. Until--

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Joy. Shhhh. 
           He pulls her close, presses her face into his chest. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Will whistles as he flips pancakes. Charlotte enters in her 
           ballet clothes, hair pulled into a tight bun.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Why are you making breakfast? 
                        Where’s Mom?

                                 WILL
                        She’ll be down soon. Want to set 
                        the table?

           Charlotte jumps into the task as Joy enters, still in her 
           robe. 

                                 JOY
                        Thanks for letting me sleep in.

           Will hands her a cup of coffee.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Is it my birthday?

                                 WILL
                        Let’s pretend it is.

           Will flips the pancakes onto a plate, proudly sets it on the 
           table. They all sit down. Charlotte looks back and forth 
           between her mom and dad, smiling at each other.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Why is everybody so happy?

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Joy, Will and Charlotte sit in the living room. Joy reads 
           Women’s Day, Will reads the Sunday sports section and 
           Charlotte knits. A record plays softly in the background. The 
           picture of domestic bliss. 

           It’s like a Rockefeller painting. But secreted between the 
           wide, colorful pages of Joy’s magazine, we see ripped-out 
           pages from a medical textbook guide to dilation and 
           curettage.

           Will snuggles up to Joy. She shuts the magazine just in time. 

                                 WILL
                        Dance with me?
           Charlotte watches as Joy stands and they begin slow-dancing  
           to the music. She’s stilted at first, but then settles in. 
           They dance well together. She leans her head against his 
           chest. Charlotte smiles, starting to believe it’s real.  

           Suddenly they all look up at the sound of LOUD RAPPING at the 
           door. 

           Will moves to answer it. Standing on the front porch is 
           DETECTIVE CHILMARK (40s). 

                                 CHILMARK
                        Good evening, Sir.

                                 WILL
                        Can I help you?

           Chilmark flashes his badge.

                                 CHILMARK
                        Detective Chilmark. Chicago P.D. 
                        May I come in?

           Will looks at Joy, who is frozen. He opens the door wider to 
           allow Chilmark to enter. 

           Chilmark looks over at Joy.

                                 CHILMARK (CONT’D)
                        Hello, Jane.

           Then he WINKS. Will, confused, looks between them. 

                                 WILL
                        What is this about?

                                 CHILMARK
                        Ask your wife.

           Will looks at Joy, leaning against the couch for support. 

                                 CHILMARK (CONT’D)
                        Think I can get a cup of coffee?

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Joy sits opposite Chilmark at the kitchen table. He’s 
           drinking the coffee slowly, taking his time. Will’s too upset 
           to sit. 

                                 CHILMARK
                        I don’t know how you ladies came to 
                        be. Fascinating as hell.

                        I’m sitting at my desk taking 
                        barking dog complaints when I get a 
                        call from an old buddy of mine, 
                        says his wife Helen called you 
                        girls for a you-know-what. I went 
                        to see Helen but she won’t give up 
                        any names, won’t say nothing except 
                        that it wasn’t your fault. I guess 
                        she put something up her hoochie 
                        that didn’t belong there because 
                        she ended up in the E.R. Almost 
                        died. 

           Chilmark puts down his coffee cup.

                                 CHILMARK (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, my buddy says a lady came 
                        to their apartment to check on 
                        Helen, and he got a good look at 
                        her plates before she left. 

           Joy shifts position, clearly uncomfortable.

                                 CHILMARK (CONT’D)
                        I’ll give you one guess whose car 
                        they match?

                                 WILL
                        Joy, what’s going on?

           But she doesn’t look up.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Charlotte stands on the other side of the closed door, 
           strains to listen in on their conversation.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

                                 CHILMARK
                        Life is funny. You really couldn’t 
                        make this stuff up. Anyway, I could 
                        get a warrant, force you to name 
                        names, and throw the lot of you in 
                        the slammer. It’d get me a crap 
                        load of attention. Press. Probably 
                        a promotion. I’d be a local hero. 

           Will pulls out his wallet, slides over several HUNDRED DOLLAR 
           BILLS. The policeman looks at the cash, eyebrow raised.
                                 CHILMARK (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t come here looking for 
                        cash.

           He pockets it anyway. 

                                 CHILMARK (CONT’D)
                        The reason I’m here is, a lady 
                        friend of mine is in need of your 
                        services. And you’re going to treat 
                        her real special. She’s my girl. 
                        Not my wife. Got it?

           He slides a piece of paper with a name and number across the 
           table to Joy. She doesn’t touch it. 

                                 CHILMARK (CONT’D)
                          (smiling)
                        Do we have an understanding? 
                        Because if we do, my boys at the 
                        station got a couple of other girls 
                        who could use your help. 

           Joy stares at him, incredulous. Chilmark spoons more sugar 
           into his coffee, takes another sip. 

                                 CHILMARK (CONT’D)
                        One thing I’ve learned as a cop, 
                        you can’t stop women. They’ve been 
                        getting abortions since the 
                        beginning of time.  And they’ll 
                        keep getting them until the end-- 

                                 JOY
                        As long as there’s sex, there’s 
                        abortion. 

           Chilmark shrugs. Will stares at Joy, astounded. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Joy vomits into the toilet. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Will and Joy sit on opposite ends of the couch. 

           He looks down at her magazine on the coffee table, notices 
           the edge of a sheet of paper peeking out. He reaches over, 
           pulls it out. Looks at the medical treatise. Crumples it into 
           a ball. 
                                 JOY
                        Will--

                                 WILL
                        I have no idea who you are.

           He gets up, grabs a bottle of Brandy from the bar, heads 
           upstairs. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Joy wakes up on the couch when she hears Will coming down the 
           stairs. He’s dressed for work. Walks past her, opens the 
           door. 

                                 JOY
                        Will--

                                 WILL
                        There’s no point talking. I’m not 
                        going to believe you anyway. 

           He slams the door behind him. Joy watches his car pull out of 
           the driveway. 

           INT. JULIA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Joy sits in front of the other women, including Julia and 
           Melanie. They look scared. 

                                 JULIA
                        Did you give the cop our names?

                                 JOY
                        Of course not. 

                                 JULIA
                        If we’re really going to do this, 
                        now’s the time. While we have his 
                        protection. 

                                 GWEN
                        Do what?

                                 JULIA
                        Tell them, Joy.

           Joy is suddenly too conflicted to say anything. 
                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Joy is about to become the first 
                        female abortionist in the history 
                        of Jane.  

           The other women react with surprise and admiration. Joy looks 
           at their faces, discomfited. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        She’s been training with Dean. She 
                        knows how.

           INT. MELANIE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Melanie, already tipsy, pours Joy a glass of wine. 

                                 JOY
                        I should really be home making 
                        dinner, in case Will--

           Melanie snorts.

                                 MELANIE
                        He’s not coming home.

                                 JOY
                        You think he’s going to leave me?

                                 MELANIE
                        For your sake, I hope so. 

           Joy contemplates this, uneasy. Takes a long sip of wine. 

                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                        This is Hyde Park, Joy. Nobody 
                        wants an abortionist wife.

                                 JOY
                        Is that why your husband left you?

           Melanie just gives her a look that says, What do you think?

                                 MELANIE
                        You can move into this building. 
                        There’s a vacancy on the floor 
                        below. File for divorce. You’ll 
                        still be able to see Charlotte, 
                        every now and then. 
                          (beat)
                        Start your life, Joy. Nobody’s 
                        going to do it for you.

           Off Joy, terrified. 
           INT. LANA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Lana carries a strong drink into the living room, hands it to 
           Will, sitting on the couch. He takes a sip.  

                                 WILL
                        Thank you, Lana. You’re a good 
                        listener. 

                                 LANA
                        I hope you know I would never tell 
                        any of the ladies what you’ve told 
                        me. It’s a private matter. 

                                 WILL
                        I trust you.

           She notices a button hanging from his shirt. Reaches out and 
           touches it. 

                                 LANA
                        Let me fix this.

           She gets up, opens a drawer and takes out a needle and 
           thread. 

                                 WILL
                          (uneasy)
                        That’s really not necessary. 

                                 LANA
                        It’s no trouble, Will.

           She sits close to him, begins to sew the button back on. 
           Their knees touch and they look up at each other at the same 
           moment. She slowly puts a hand on his chest, lets it linger. 

           He suddenly pulls away. 

                                 WILL
                        Where’s Erin?

                                 LANA
                        Cheerleading practice. It’s just 
                        us. 

                                 WILL
                        You probably have to make dinner 
                        for her. I don’t want to get in 
                        your way. 

           He starts to get up, but she reaches out to him.
                                 LANA
                        Stay--

           He picks up his drink, downs it.

                                 WILL
                        I should go. Thanks, Lana.

           He stands, unsteady, heads for the door.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Joy sits on the couch trying to read a magazine. She checks 
           her watch, restless. Looks out the window at Will’s car, 
           parked in the driveway.  

           After a moment she sees Will stumbling across the path from 
           Lana’s house. A little tipsy. 

           He enters, sees Joy. 

                                 WILL
                        I was at Lana’s.

                                 JOY
                        I know.

           He collapses in a chair. Stares at her. 

                                 WILL
                        I know you’ve been bored. I have 
                        too. At times. The house, the job, 
                        the friends -- they all start to 
                        blend together into some kind of  
                        comforting domestic stew-- but then 
                        one day you wake up and you’re just 
                        not in the mood for stew.

                                 JOY
                        Are you having an affair with Lana?

                                 WILL
                        No, what I’m saying is-- I still 
                        want the stew. I just want to know 
                        what’s in it. 

           Joy doesn’t know what to say. 

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        I’m not judging you for what you 
                        did. Or what you’re doing. But you 
                        have to stop now, okay?

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Please stop, Joy. Before it 
                        destroys everything.

           She looks at him, genuinely wishing she could lessen his 
           pain, but--

                                 JOY
                        Women are dying, Will. Someone has 
                        to not stop.

                                 WILL
                        Just not you. 

           Joy shakes her head.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        It’s either Jane or me. 

           He’s not ready to hear her answer.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to bed. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Will lies awake, waiting. 

           He hears FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. Then they stop. Retreat. 
           Becoming fainter and fainter... until they’re gone. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 

           Joy wakes up on the couch, looks around, disoriented. Then 
           remembers... 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Joy’s making breakfast when Will enters, still in his 
           pajamas. She looks at him, confused.

                                 JOY
                        Why aren’t you dressed for work? 

           He pours himself a cup of coffee.

                                 WILL
                        I’m taking the morning off. We need 
                        to figure this out.

                        I can’t. I have a full day.
                                 WILL
                        Full of what?

           She turns to look at him, directly. 

                                 JOY
                        Jane. We’re doing our first 
                        abortion today. 

           He reacts.

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        You can leave if that’s what you 
                        need to do. Or I can. I don’t care 
                        about the house or the car or--

                                 WILL
                        Us.

                                 JOY
                        I didn’t say that. 

           Charlotte enters, stops when she sees their expressions.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What’s going on?

                                 JOY
                        Nothing, Honey.

                                 WILL
                        If you really cared about 
                        Charlotte, you wouldn’t do this. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Do what?

                                 JOY
                        That’s what you don’t understand. 
                        I’m doing this for her. 

           In a sudden, impulsive gesture, he THROWS his coffee mug 
           against a wall. It shatters into pieces, spraying coffee. 

           Joy looks at it a moment. Then calmly reaches into the closet 
           for a broom and dustpan, sweep it up and dumps the pieces 
           into the trash. Then she grabs a dishrag and mops up the 
           coffee. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be back by four to make 
                        dinner. 

           Will watches her pick up her purse and head for the door. 
                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I choose Dad. 

           Joy stops, stung.

                                 JOY
                        Charlotte, please--

           Charlotte runs out. Joy starts to go after her, looks at her 
           watch. Torn, heads for the door instead. 

           INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Joy at the wheel of the car, her instruments and white coat 
           on the seat next to her. 

           INT. JULIA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME TIME

           Julia leads a group of women around as they prepare for Joy’s 
           first procedure. She’s holding a clipboard, checking off 
           items as they go. 

                                 JULIA
                        Next, we prepare a hot bath in a 
                        shallow pan -- the kind you’d use 
                        for baking brownies -- to sterilize 
                        the instruments. We need to cover 
                        the bed with plastic sheets. If we 
                        don’t have plastic, she says we can 
                        use garbage bags cut up and taped 
                        together. 

           The women follow her instructions as she checks items off the 
           list.

           INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Joy suddenly stops the car. 

           EXT. CAR - STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           She leans into a nearby ditch, VOMITS. Then catches her 
           breath. Starts to head back to the car. Then FAINTS.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           She sits opposite Dr. Benson in an exam room. He’s looking at 
           her chart, frowning. 
                                 JOY
                        I don’t mean to rush you, Dr. 
                        Benson, but I really have to be 
                        somewhere. 

           He isn’t listening. Still examining her chart, he opens the 
           door. 

                                 BENSON
                        I’ll be right back. 

                                 JOY
                        Wait, where are you going?

                                 BENSON
                        I need to call your husband.

                                 JOY
                        But I’m right here. You can tell 
                        me.

                                 BENSON
                        I’m sorry, Mrs. Griffin. But I 
                        really can’t discuss your case 
                        without your husband present. 

           She nods, forcing a smile. He turns to go and she finally 
           breaks. 

                                 JOY
                        On second thought... that’s utterly 
                        FUCKING ridiculous. Because it is 
                        my FUCKING body.

           He turns back, astonished.

           INT. JULIA’S HOUSE - GUEST BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           In front of a GIGANTIC PORTRAIT of Julia’s husband, the women 
           cover the bed with taped-together garbage bags. 

           Julia guides in a BLINDFOLDED WOMAN (24) and lays her gently 
           on the bed. She’s shaking. 

                                 JULIA
                          (re blindfold)
                        Take it off.

           Gwen looks at her, confused. Julia nods, and Gwen removes it. 
           The woman blinks. Looks up at them. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        You’re in good hands, Honey.
           The woman slowly nods. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        The doctor’s on her way. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - LATER 

           Will and Dr. Benson examine an x-ray, while Joy strains to 
           see over their shoulders. 

                                 BENSON
                        At least eight weeks. And no sign 
                        of heart failure. I think she’ll be 
                        able to carry this one to term with 
                        no danger to her health.  

           Will turns slowly to look at Joy. Benson watches, curious. 

           Will walks over, slowly enfolds her in a hug. There are tears 
           in his eyes. Joy looks past him, frozen. 

           INT. JULIA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The women watch as Julia paces. Melanie checks her watch, 
           worried.

           Gwen and another Jane enter from the bedroom.

                                 GWEN
                        The patient wants to leave. 

           All eyes turn to Julia. 

                                 MELANIE
                        She’s four hours late. 

                                 JULIA
                        Call her house.

                                 JANE #1
                        We already did. No answer. 

                                 JULIA
                        Then call Dean.  

           They look at each other.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        I’m not sending that poor girl home 
                        in the same condition she arrived. 
                                 GWEN
                        She doesn’t have the money.

                                 JULIA
                        I’ll pay.

           Gwen heads for the phone. 

           LATER

           Julia counts out 1500 dollars, hands it to Dean, who is 
           packing up post procedure. 

                                 DEAN
                        I still can’t believe she thought 
                        she could do this on her own. She 
                        could’ve hurt someone. Or worse. 

           Dean looks at all their strained faces.

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                        Relax, girls. It all worked out. 
                        Everyone’s fine. 

           He turns to leave. 

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                        By the way, I don’t like being 
                        played. So there’s going to be a 
                        price hike coming. Fair warning.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Joy, shell-shocked, sits on the couch next to Will and 
           Charlotte. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What are we going to name her?

                                 WILL
                        You pick. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        How about Beatrice? Or maybe April?

           Will smiles. 

                                 WILL
                        April is nice. What do you think, 
                        Joy?

           Joy forces a smile. They’re all pretending the earlier 
           conversation never happened.
           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

           Joy lies next to Will. They’re both awake. 

                                 WILL
                        Maybe this is God giving us a 
                        second chance? 

           No response.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        You’re not still thinking about 
                        Jane, are you? 

           Still nothing.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        I mean, you can’t possibly perform 
                        abortions while our baby is growing 
                        inside you.

           Joy closes her eyes. Will softens. 

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        People always said, You’re such a 
                        perfect family. Now we’re even more 
                        perfect. 

           He rolls over to look at her. Gradually, she rolls over to 
           look at him too. He gently places his hand on her belly, like 
           before.

                                 JOY
                        I think it’s a girl.

           He smiles. 

           INT. MELANIE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Melanie looks at Joy, sitting across from her. She’s angry.

                                 MELANIE
                        You could have called. 

                                 JOY
                        You’re right. I’m sorry.

                                 MELANIE
                        Tell that to the poor girl who 
                        waited four hours for you.

           Joy’s on the verge of tears.
                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                        We believed in you.

                                 JOY
                        Maybe you shouldn’t have.

                                 MELANIE
                        Oh no, you don’t get to play the 
                        victim. This was your idea.

           Melanie backs down a little.

                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                        You should’ve seen Dean’s smug 
                        face.

                                 JOY
                        I don’t want to picture that.

           A beat, then-- 

                                 MELANIE
                        You know you don’t have to go 
                        through with it. 

           Joy’s caught off guard.

                                 JOY
                        I always wanted a second child. 

                                 MELANIE
                        I thought you wanted more than 
                        that?

                                 JOY
                        I don’t want to be all alone. 

                                 MELANIE
                        Like me. 

           Joy looks around the bare apartment, taking it all in.

                                 MELANIE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t feel sorry for me, Joy. At 
                        least I made a choice.

           Joy nods, stands, picks up her purse.

                                 JOY
                        I guess I’m making one too. 
           She looks at Melanie, some regret in her eyes. Then walks 
           out.

                                                     CUT TO BLACK:

           EXT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY

           Joy, Will and Charlotte sit stilted, smiling. We realize 
           they’re posing for a photograph. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        One... two... three... Say Cheese!

           Will and Charlotte do. Joy remains frozen as the camera 
           flashes. She now has an impressive baby bump.

           SUPER: “THREE MONTHS LATER.”

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 

           Joy examines a postcard. A picture of the Griffin family. 
           Below, in big bouncy letters: “We’re expecting!” 

           She licks a stamp, places it on the card. Picks up the next 
           one. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Joy vacuums, carefully and methodically. She suddenly notices 
           a violent antiwar rally on TV. Young protestors carrying 
           banners with the words, “DAYS OF RAGE.” She moves closer to 
           the screen... then turns it off. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Drying off after a shower, Joy reaches for the drawer where 
           she keeps her instruments, pauses, her hand lingering. After 
           a beat, she opens it. It’s filled with prenatal vitamins now. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Joy vigorously polishes the floor. 

           She stops to pour herself a generous glass of wine. Takes a 
           long sip. 
           EXT. THE LOOP - DAY

           Joy waddles, weighed down by several shopping bags.

           Across the street, she spots Melanie, now wearing loose-
           fitting clothes, a wreath in her hair, talking animatedly to 
           a young man in torn jeans. She looks like a hippie. 

           Joy ducks into a nearby dress shop, watches undetected 
           through the window. Melanie is laughing, happy. 

           INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - DAY

           Joy sits alone at a table. On the chair next to her, a pile 
           of SHOPPING BAGS. She sips a cocktail as she looks out the 
           window at...

           EXT. THE LOOP - SAME TIME

           An ANTI-VIETNAM WAR PROTEST led by a young Black MAN. He 
           yells into a MEGAPHONE at passersby--

                                 YOUNG BLACK MAN
                        WHITE AMERICA IS SHOPPING WHILE 
                        BLACK AMERICA IS DYING! 

           The young man with the megaphone catches Joy’s eye, yells 
           through the glass-- 

                                 YOUNG BLACK MAN (CONT’D)
                        PUT DOWN YOUR MARTINI AND PICK UP A 
                        SIGN!

           Joy smiles awkwardly, continues drinking.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Charlotte pulls a horribly misshapen cake out of the oven. 
           Sighs. 

           The doorbell rings. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           Charlotte opens the door. Julia stands there, alone. 
           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Charlotte sits opposite Julia. They’re sipping tea and eating 
           misshapen cake. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I know it looks awful.

                                 JULIA
                        It’s delicious.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You don’t have to say that.

                                 JULIA
                        I know.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        You’re one of them, aren’t you? A 
                        Jane.

                                 JULIA
                        Yes. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        My father might come home before 
                        she does. 

                                 JULIA
                          (smiling)
                        I’ll take my chances.  

           She takes another sip of tea. 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        I hope you know your mother is a 
                        remarkable woman. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Are you trying to get her in 
                        trouble again?

           Julia laughs.

                                 JULIA
                        I like you. You speak your mind. 
                        Just like her.

                                 CHARLOTTE 
                        You don’t seem like the Jane type 
                        to me.
                                 JULIA
                        I probably wouldn’t be. Except I 
                        was young once. And needed an 
                        abortion.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Why couldn’t you just have the 
                        baby?

                                 JULIA
                        I did. Because I had no choice.
                          (beat)
                        I love my son. But I wanted to be 
                        an anthropologist. I wanted to 
                        travel to faraway places and 
                        discover things nobody else had 
                        seen. 
                          (beat)
                        What do you want to be? 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        A mom.

                                 JULIA
                        Good for you, Charlotte. It’s a 
                        wonderful thing to be. 

           Julia looks at her expensive watch, stands-- 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Tell your mother I was here, okay?

           Charlotte nods.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        And tell her... we forgive her. And 
                        that we need her back. Desperately. 
                        It’s important she knows.

           Charlotte nods again, reluctantly.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - CHARLOTTE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Charlotte sits at her vanity as Joy does her hair. 

                                 JOY
                        Any calls while I was away?

           Charlotte thinks for a moment, makes a decision. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        No.
                                 JOY
                        Are you nervous about tonight?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        A little.

                                 JOY
                        You look beautiful. He’s going to 
                        fall head over heels. Then you’ll 
                        get married and buy a house and 
                        have babies and live happily... 

           Joy trails off, can’t do it. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Ever after?

           Joy nods, uneasy.

           INT. CAR - PARKED - NIGHT

           Charlotte sits next to a handsome YOUNG MAN. They’re parked 
           at a drive-in movie theater. 

           He stretches his arm around her as he rambles. Looks like 
           he’s been talking for hours.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        ... and then, after Yale, I can 
                        obviously go anywhere. Maybe I’ll 
                        get my MBA. Go into banking, like 
                        my uncle. He has a huge apartment 
                        on the Upper East Side, and a 
                        staff. Or maybe I’ll be a best-
                        selling author. Mrs. Harrison liked 
                        the essay I wrote about Apollo 8. 
                        Did you know it set a new rocket 
                        speed of 24,200 miles per hour? 

           Charlotte pretends she didn’t. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Wow, that’s really fast.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Or I could be a dentist like my 
                        dad.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I could see that.

           She looks out the window. In the next car, Lana’s daughter 
           Erin is making out with her date. 
           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Joy and Charlotte finish frosting their perfectly shaped 
           cake.

                                 JOY
                        Baking isn’t intuitive like 
                        cooking. It’s science. It takes 
                        precision.  

           Charlotte takes the icing cone, squeezes out a blob. Joy 
           places her hands over her daughter’s, guides the icing into 
           an elaborate rose. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        You can’t let your hands get in the 
                        way of your mind. That’s the 
                        secret. 

           Charlotte looks up at her mother, admiring. 

           EXT. LANA’S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

           Joy knocks on the door. Lana answers. They exchange chilly 
           smiles. 

                                 JOY
                        I’m looking for Charlotte. We were 
                        going to make a quilt together. 

                                 LANA
                        They’ve been holed up in Erin’s 
                        room for hours. God only knows what 
                        they have to talk about. 

                                 JOY
                        God only knows what we used to talk 
                        about.

           An uncomfortable silence, then--

                                 LANA
                        How’s Will?

                                 JOY
                        He’s fine. 

                                 LANA
                        Good. He seemed a little... lost 
                        the last time we spoke. 

                                 JOY
                        Well, he’s been found. 
           She heads for the hallway.

           INT. LANA’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Joy knocks softly on the door. No answer. Frowning, she 
           pushes it open. 

           INT. LANA’S HOUSE - ERIN’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Charlotte sits on the edge of the bed, comforting Erin. 

           As Joy enters, they whip around. Erin hurriedly wipes tears 
           from her face. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Mom!

                                 JOY
                        I’m sorry. I knocked. Is everything 
                        okay?

           The girls look at her.

                                 ERIN
                        Everything’s fine, Mrs. Griffin. 

                                 JOY
                        Are you ready to go, Charlotte?

           Charlotte hesitates, looks back at Erin.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Tell her. You can trust her. 

           Erin shakes her head, begins to cry again. 

           Joy slowly closes the door behind her. Sits down next to 
           Erin. Her panicked face, streaked with tears, is one Joy 
           knows well.

           A beat.

                                 JOY
                        How far along?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        How did you know?

           Joy takes Erin’s hand.

                                 JOY
                        When was your last period?
                                 ERIN
                        A month ago. Maybe a little more. I 
                        only just started getting them. I 
                        thought it was normal. 

                                 JOY
                        The father?

           Erin starts crying again. She looks so young and vulnerable. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        He...

           She trails off. Joy looks at their pained faces. 

                                 CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
                        She didn’t want to, but he forced 
                        himself on her--

           Before Joy can react, the door OPENS behind them. Lana takes 
           in the scene.

                                 LANA
                        What’s going on in here?

           Joy dissembles quickly, smiles cheerfully. 

                                 JOY
                        Oh, you know, typical high-school 
                        girl drama. Boy A pretends to like 
                        Girl A but secretly likes Girl B, 
                        who happens to be Girl A’s best 
                        friend. 

                                 LANA
                        What?

           Erin looks at Joy, grateful. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Joy, Charlotte and Will sit in their familiar evening repose. 
           Will reading the paper, Joy reading a magazine and Charlotte 
           knitting.

           Joy and Charlotte keep glancing at each other, waiting for 
           Will to leave. 

                                 JOY
                        Honey, did you check on your 
                        accounts?

           Without looking up-- 
                                 WILL
                        Yes, Dear.

           Joy looks at Charlotte, apologetic. 

                                 JOY
                        Hey, who wants hot chocolate?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I do.

                                 WILL
                        None for me, thanks.

           Joy stands, heads for the kitchen. Charlotte leaps up after 
           her.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’ll help.

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Joy holds the phone to her ear, dials a number. Frowns.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What’s wrong?

                                 JOY
                        The line is dead. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What do we do now?

           Joy shakes her head, confused. 

                                 JOY
                        I don’t understand--

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Mom. There’s something I didn’t 
                        tell you. 

           EXT. JULIA’S HOUSE - DAY 

           Joy pulls up, jumps out of the car.

           INT. JULIA’S HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           Julia opens the door, sees a very pregnant Joy. The two women 
           stare at each other in silence. Finally... 
                                 JULIA
                        Took you long enough.

           Then Julia smiles, and the two embrace. Julia places a hand 
           on Joy’s belly, reacts.

                                 JOY
                        Sorry, it’s been kicking a lot.

                                 JULIA
                        It’s a girl.

                                 JOY
                        How can you tell?

                                 JULIA
                        She wants to get out and do 
                        something.

           Joy laughs.

           INT. JULIA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           They’re sipping tea. 

                                 JULIA
                        It’s all over. Dean hiked his 
                        prices up to $2000. Almost nobody 
                        could afford him. Then one day he 
                        just disappeared. Turned out he was 
                        under the thumb of the Mafia. When 
                        he stopped giving them a cut, they 
                        drove him out of town.  

           Joy puts down her teacup, about to speak-- 

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        Before you say anything... my 
                        husband is running for congress. My 
                        hands are tied.   

           Joy sits back, quiet.

                                 JULIA (CONT’D)
                        You and Dean are more alike than 
                        you think. You both disappeared. 

                                 JOY
                        I know. I’m sorry. 

                                 JULIA
                        It’s probably for the best. We’re 
                        not doctors. 
                                 JOY
                        Neither was he.

           Julia shrugs. 

           INT. LANA’S HOUSE - ERIN’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Erin and Charlotte huddle in her bedroom. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        There’s no doctor. She tried.  

           Erin takes this stoically. 

                                 ERIN
                        I have a plan. 

           From under the bed, she pulls out a CAN of TURPENTINE.

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        I found it in the garage. Will you 
                        help me?

           Charlotte shakes her head, horrified. Grabs the can out of 
           Erin’s hands. 

                                 ERIN (CONT’D) (CONT’D)
                        There’s plenty more out there. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’ll tell your mother. 

           Erin shrugs. 

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t care anymore. 

           INT. GRIFFIN HOUSE - JOY’S BATHROOM - DAY

           Charlotte watches as Joy puts on makeup. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I made her promise. You don’t think 
                        she’ll do anything, do you?

           Joy doesn’t answer. She opens the bottom drawer. Lifts out 
           her vitamins and beneath them we see... the INSTRUMENTS, 
           glistening in the light. She looks at Charlotte, waits for 
           her to react. She doesn’t.
           INT. CAR - PARKED - DAY

           Charlotte and Joy sit in the car in their driveway. They look 
           anxiously at Lana’s front door.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        She said she’d be out at three 
                        sharp. When her mom turns on her 
                        soaps.

           They look at the dashboard clock. It’s a few minutes past. 

                                 JOY
                        I think it would be better if you 
                        stayed home, Charlotte. 

           Charlotte shakes her head.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I don’t want her doing this alone.

           The DOOR suddenly flies open. It’s Lana. And she’s furious. 

                                 LANA
                          (shouting)
                        SHE’S NOT COMING.

           Then slams the door shut.

           EXT. LANA’S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Joy bangs on the front door, Charlotte beside her. No answer. 
           She bangs harder. 

           The door opens. Lana stands there. Behind her, huddled on the 
           couch, is Erin. She doesn’t make eye contact. 

                                 LANA
                        I called Will. Told him what you’re 
                        doing. He’s on his way. And he’s 
                        not happy. 

           She starts to shut the door again, but Joy wedges her foot 
           in. 

                                 LANA (CONT’D)
                        Erin doesn’t want any part of your 
                        disgraceful plan. That’s why she 
                        told me everything.

           Joy peers around Lana--
                                 JOY
                        Erin? Is that true?

           Erin looks up, she’s clearly been crying for hours. 

                                 LANA
                        She’s going away for a little 
                        while. To a nice country retreat. 
                        The girls have daily bible study. 
                        She’ll probably have the time of 
                        her life. Then she’ll come back, 
                        and everything will be just as it 
                        was. Except she’ll obviously never 
                        associate with you or your daughter 
                        again.  

           Erin is shaking. 

                                 JOY
                        She’s going to hurt herself, Lana. 
                        I’ve seen it before.

           Joy pushes past, takes Erin’s hand. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to be okay, Honey. But 
                        we need to go now. 

           Erin looks up at her mom, cautiously stands. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                          (to Lana)
                        I know you want this for her. You 
                        don’t have to help. Just don’t get 
                        in the way.

           Lana’s bluster has faded. She stands frozen, says nothing as 
           Joy leads Erin out the door, to Charlotte, who gently guides 
           her down the steps. 

           Joy looks back, sees Lana collapse on the couch. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Come with us. 

           Lana shakes her head. 

                                 LANA
                        I can’t. 
           INT. JULIA’S MANSION - FOYER - EVENING

           The doorbell rings. Julia walks unhurriedly in her painter’s 
           smock, brush still in hand. Opens it. 

           Joy, Charlotte and Erin are perfectly framed in the doorway. 

           INT. JULIA’S MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Julia paces back and forth as Joy and Charlotte busy 
           themselves with preparations. 

                                 JULIA
                        This is insane. You haven’t picked 
                        up an instrument in months.

                                 JOY
                        I remember everything.

           Julia looks at Erin, shivering on the bed, staring at the 
           GIGANTIC PORTRAIT of her husband. She shuts the window, grabs 
           a blanket and covers her. 

                                 JULIA
                          (under her breath)
                        What if something goes really 
                        wrong?

                                 JOY
                        It won’t.

                                 JULIA
                        You actually can’t know that.

                                 JOY
                        Your doubt is actually not helpful. 

           She pulls on a white coat. 

                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Charlotte. Go boil the instruments. 
                        The way I told you.

           Charlotte hurries out with a pan. Joy suddenly winces, grabs 
           hold of her belly.

                                 JULIA
                        What?

                                 JOY
                        Nothing. She’s kicking.
                                 JULIA
                        For God’s sake, Joy. 

           INT. JULIA’S MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Classical music plays in the background as Julia and 
           Charlotte boil water, sterilize instruments, warm towels.

           INT. JULIA’S MANSION - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Joy, in a white coat, stares at herself in the mirror. Trying 
           to believe. 

           She suddenly rips off the white coat, bunches it into a ball, 
           throws it on the floor. 

           INT. JULIA’S MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Joy sits beside Erin, applying cool compresses.

                                 JOY
                        I’ve never done this by myself 
                        before. You understand that, right? 

           Erin nods, a little drowsy from the sedative.

           Joy starts to get up, but Erin reaches for her hand, holds 
           on. 

                                 ERIN
                        I lied before. I wasn’t raped. 

           She’s crying softly.

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        I thought I had to say that. But I 
                        let him do it. I wanted him to. And 
                        I liked it. 

                                 JOY
                        Everyone wants you to believe you 
                        deserve this. You opened your legs 
                        and brought this on yourself. When 
                        the truth is, you’re just a girl. 
                        And he’s just a boy. And that’s 
                        what girls and boys do. 

           Erin looks at Joy’s belly, touches it.
                                 ERIN
                        I really do want to be a mom 
                        someday. I always have.

                                 JOY
                        I know. Just not today. 

           Joy has tears in her eyes too.

           INT. JULIA’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Julia and Charlotte walk carefully towards the staircase, 
           balancing pans of sterile instruments. 

           Suddenly, they hear a key turning in a lock. Charlotte 
           freezes. Julia shoves her pan under an antique console. 

           INT. JULIA’S HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           Julia races to the entrance. Opens the door just as her 
           husband, WARREN, steps in. 

                                 JULIA
                        Honey. What a surprise. I thought 
                        you weren’t supposed to get in 
                        until tomorrow? 

           He waves off his driver. 

                                 WARREN
                        The senator took an early flight 
                        out. Cancelled our meeting. My 
                        lucky day. 

                                 JULIA
                        That’s wonderful.

           She gives him a big hug, holds tight as she waves Charlotte  
           to GO ON behind his back. 

                                 WARREN
                        I wasn’t gone that long.

           INT. JULIA’S MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Charlotte rushes in with the heavy pan, locks the door behind 
           her, breathing hard. 

           Joy looks up.  
                                 JOY
                        Where’s the other pan? With the 
                        curette I need. 

           Charlotte tries to catch her breath. 

           INT. JULIA’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Julia sets a plate out for Warren. Watches him eat. 

                                 WARREN
                          (mouthful of food)
                        How’s the new portrait coming? Did 
                        you make much progress while I was 
                        away?

                                 JULIA
                        Uh, not really, no. I’ve just been 
                        so busy-- 

                                 WARREN
                        With what?

                                 JULIA
                        You know -- a little of this, 
                        little of that. 

           Behind him, she sees Charlotte TIP-TOE towards the console. 
           Julia holds her breath. Warren looks at her curiously. 

                                 WARREN
                        Is everything okay? You seem -- you 
                        didn’t crash the Lincoln again, did 
                        you?

           She shakes her head. Charlotte quickly pulls out the stashed 
           pan, tip-toes back up the stairs, trying not to breath. 
           Warren follows her gaze, turns around. Nothing. 

           INT. JULIA’S MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Charlotte enters with the second tray, places it beside Joy.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        Maybe we should get out of here?

                                 JOY
                        It’s too late. I just gave her 
                        another sedative.

           Erin is nearly out. 
                                 JOY (CONT’D)
                        Charlotte, I need you to go into 
                        the bathroom and close the door. 
                        You can’t be here for this. 

           Charlotte pauses for a moment... then shakes her head. She 
           sees the white coat in a ball in Joy’s purse. Pulls it out, 
           guides it onto her mother. Then she hands her the curette.

           Off Joy, eyes shining. 

           INT. JULIA’S MANSION - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Julia clears the dishes. 

                                 JULIA
                        How about some dessert? I have your 
                        favorite -- poached pears. I just 
                        need to whip up some cream. 

                                 WARREN
                        I couldn’t possibly. 

                                 JULIA
                        I insist. 

                                 WARREN
                        Please, honey, I’m exhausted. I 
                        just need to sleep. 

           He stands, heads for the stairs. 

           INT. JULIA’S MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Close on Charlotte’s face. She’s trembling, brave, resolute. 
           We can’t see what she’s seeing. 

           INT. JULIA’S MANSION - STAIRS - NIGHT

           Julia follows Warren out anxiously. 

                                 JULIA
                        What about a quick game of 
                        Scrabble?

                                 WARREN
                        No, Julia.
           INT. JULIA’S MANSION - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Julia moves quickly to keep up with Warren. He’s makes it to 
           the end of the hallway, is about to reach for the door to 
           their bedroom... when Julia blocks his path.

                                 JULIA
                        You can’t go in there.

                                 WARREN
                        What’s going on, Julia?

                                 JULIA
                        I didn’t want to tell you-- but... 
                        I just had it fumigated.

                                 WARREN
                        Why would you do that? 

                                 JULIA
                        Mice. 

                                 WARREN
                        Only in our bedroom?

                                 JULIA
                        They’re partial to Egyptian cotton. 
                        I read that somewhere. 

           Warren sighs, gently moves her out of his way, reaches for 
           the door again. 

           Julia braces herself.

           He opens it... 

           INT. JULIA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The bedroom is EMPTY. 

           Suddenly the wind through the window blows the bathroom door 
           OPEN. He walks towards it. 

           INT. JULIA’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Empty. Julia suddenly spots a tray of instruments under the 
           sink. 

           Somehow, Warren doesn’t notice. 
           EXT. JULIA’S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - SAME TIME

           Joy and Charlotte lead a limping, sleepy Erin out the door. 

           INT. CAR - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

           Joy drives. Charlotte sits in the backseat, Erin’s head on 
           her lap. She strokes her hair.

           Erin’s waking up. Groaning a little. 

           INT. LANA’S HOUSE - ERIN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Joy watches as Lana tucks her daughter into bed. 

           Lana turns around, faces Joy. Doesn’t say a word, but there’s 
           gratitude in her eyes. 

           INT. LANA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Lana walks Joy to the door.

                                 LANA
                        If I had what you have, I would 
                        never risk losing it. Ever. 

           Joy doesn’t respond.

                                 LANA (CONT’D)
                        He’s going to leave you for this, 
                        you know that.

           She nods, weary.

                                 JOY
                        Can I use your bathroom?

           INT. LANA’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Joy carefully removes her sweater. Her shirt is entirely 
           soaked with sweat. 

           She cranks open a window. Gulps air greedily. Then starts 
           crying. 

           We suddenly see all of the tension, fear, stress release. 

           She touches her belly, the baby kicking. Exhales. 

                                                     CUT TO BLACK:
           INT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO MEDICAL SCHOOL - LATER

           Close on Joy. Dressed in a suit. 

           SUPER: “TWO YEARS LATER.”

           We see Joy is sitting across from the DEAN of the MEDICAL 
           SCHOOL. He’s looking at a file.

                                 DEAN OF MEDICAL SCHOOL
                        Your application was unconventional 
                        to say the least. No research. 
                        Average MCAT scores. 

           Joy listens calmly, without expectation. 

                                 DEAN OF MEDICAL SCHOOL (CONT’D)
                        You know we have a quota for women. 
                        And most of our applicants are much 
                        younger. And less... encumbered.

           She pretends not to know what he’s talking about. Makes him 
           say it. 

                                 DEAN OF MEDICAL SCHOOL (CONT’D)
                        You have two children, don’t you?

                                 JOY
                        What exactly is your point, Dr. 
                        Harcourt? 

           The Dean shifts uncomfortably in his seat. 

                                 DEAN OF MEDICAL SCHOOL
                        I see you put down surgery as your 
                        intended specialty. 

                                 JOY
                        Yes. 

                                 DEAN OF MEDICAL SCHOOL
                        I’ve interviewed more women this 
                        year than ever before--

                                 JOY
                        May I ask how many?

                                 DEAN OF MEDICAL SCHOOL
                        Five. And they never seem to 
                        understand what the job really 
                        entails. We hold lives in our 
                        hands, Mrs. Griffin. Do you 
                        understand that? People could die. 
                        It’s a staggering responsibility. 
           He holds out her file. 

                                 DEAN OF MEDICAL SCHOOL (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           She takes the file. Stands.

           EXT. MEDICAL SCHOOL - FRONT STEPS - DAY

           Joy walks out, takes off her blazer. We see a tattoo on her 
           bare shoulder -- simply the word JANE. Charlotte is sitting 
           on a bench outside, waiting expectantly, a TODDLER on her 
           lap. Joy kisses Charlotte as she takes the toddler.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        How did it go?

           Joy doesn’t answer. Charlotte understands. They walk out 
           together. 

           INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Charlotte looks sympathetically at her mother. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        It doesn’t change anything, Mom. 

                                 JOY
                        It sort of does. 

           She rolls up her sleeves. 

           INT. JANE CLINIC - WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Melanie guides a BLINDFOLDED WOMAN into a a bustling waiting 
           room in an apartment. Comfortable couches, colorful artwork, 
           a play area for kids. Gwen gently plucks a harp, soothing 
           anxious women of all kinds. Some are accompanied by their 
           boyfriends and husbands, others wait alone. Julia sits behind 
           a reception desk. 

           Melanie takes off the blindfold.

                                 MELANIE 
                        Welcome to Jane. You’re going to 
                        sign in with Julia over there. Then 
                        you’ll meet our ‘Chief of Surgery.’ 
                        She’s performed this procedure on 
                        two thousand women. 
           The door opens. Joy enters, taking off her heels. She walks 
           barefoot over to Melanie and the new patient. 

                                 JOY
                        Hi, I’m Joy. Come on back. 

           INT. JANE CLINIC - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Joy and the patient walk down a hallway decorated with 
           paintings from Julia’s house. They greet women we recognize 
           from the Jane collective. 

           She ushers the patient into a cozy room. Just as she’s about 
           to enter behind her, she sees DEAN, still in his coat, 
           hurrying down the hallway. He looks grumpy. 

                                 JOY 
                        You’re late.

                                 DEAN
                        So is my paycheck. 

                                 JOY
                        You’ll get your money. You always 
                        do.

           She walks past him. 

                                 DEAN
                          (calling after her)
                        I want a raise. 

           INT. JANE CLINIC - PATIENT ROOM - DAY

           Joy leads the patient to a bed, making her comfortable. A few 
           other Janes act as nurses and assistants. 

                                 PATIENT
                        What if something goes wrong?

                                 JOY
                        It won’t. 

                                 PATIENT
                        But if it does. After I go home. Do 
                        I come back here?

                                 JOY
                        You call us. We move to a new 
                        location everyday. 

           The patient nods, watching Joy prepare. 
                                 PATIENT
                        Am I doing the wrong thing?

                                 JOY
                        I can’t answer that for you.

                                 PATIENT
                        How could it be right when it 
                        involves all this sneaking around?

           She’s shaky, her voice rising. Joy looks at her. 

                                 JOY
                        There’s going to be a time when 
                        it’s not like this. 

                                 PATIENT
                        When?

                                 JOY
                        I don’t know. Someday. 

           Joy gently touches her cheek. 

           INT. JANE CLINIC - RECOVERY ROOM - DAY

           Later. The procedure over, Joy pulls a blanket around the 
           patient’s shoulders. Another Jane passes around a tray of 
           cookies. The patient looks at her, grateful. 

                                 PATIENT
                        Will I ever see you again?

           Joy’s answer carries into the next scene...

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Joy pushes the stroller, Charlotte by her side. It’s summer. 
           The streets are crowded with people. 

           Joy makes eye contact with an older woman hanging on a man’s 
           arm. The woman looks away, suddenly uncomfortable. 

           From Joy’s POV, we see dozens of other women, streaming past 
           her. 

                                 JOY (V.O.)
                        Maybe. I see patients, like ghosts, 
                        every day. At the grocery store, 
                        the theater, the park. They smile 
                        or look away. They’ve moved on. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        They’re grateful we gave them a 
                        choice, but it’s a choice they 
                        never wanted to make. And it’s a 
                        choice they had to make alone, 
                        scared, in the dark. 
                          (beat)
                        So months from now, if we pass each 
                        other on the street, I hope you 
                        won’t look away. Because if we all 
                        saw each other, we would discover 
                        there are millions and millions and 
                        millions of us. And we are not 
                        alone. 

           A passing woman locks eyes with Joy. She suddenly smiles. Her 
           hand reaches out to touch Joy’s. Then she disappears into the 
           crowd. 

                                                     CUT TO BLACK:

           The Jane Collective performed nearly 12,000 abortions over 
           four years.

           In 1972, seven Janes were arrested on more than 100 counts of 
           felony homicide and conspiracy to commit abortion.

           The case was dropped when Roe v. Wade passed on January 22, 

           Cook County Hospital in Chicago had two wards dedicated to 
           complications resulting from abortion, the leading cause of 
           death in young women. Those wards are closed. For now.

           1 in 3 women in America will get an abortion during their 
           lifetime.

           Over 90% of counties in the United States do not have an 
           abortion doctor.

           Many parts of the country have abortion restrictions so 
           severe that Roe v. Wade has been rendered irrelevant.
