           MONTAGE - VARIOUS

           A) Independent Bookstore - A BOOKSTORE CLERK (69) with 
           purple-streaked hair stands behind the cash register. She 
           drums impressively on a coffee cup with two pencils.

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        The average person lives 27,375 
                        days. 

           B) Animal Shelter - A BEARDED GUY (40) leads a scared, 
           older beagle down a long row of barking dogs.

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        That’s it. That’s all we get if 
                        we’re lucky. 27,375. Do you know 
                        how I know that? 

           C) Messy Apartment - A TIRED WAITRESS (38) splattered 
           with ketchup and coffee stains stares at her snoring 
           husband on the couch. Bong water spilled all over their 
           mail.

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        Google. I googled it. 

           D) Hospital - A BALDING DOCTOR (59) walks down a hospital 
           corridor flipping through a chart. 

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        At first, I thought it didn’t seem 
                        like a lot. But then again, how 
                        many days do we remember anyway?

           E) Old House - A HUNCHED OLD MAN (83) sits alone watching 
           television and eating a microwaved dinner.

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        There are entire years that I’ve 
                        already forgotten, let alone 
                        remembering specific days. 

           F) Playground Park - A SHY GIRL with GLASSES (6) draws on 
           the sidewalk with chalk. She draws only spirals. 

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        For the most part, we only 
                        remember the days when something 
                        happens. Something great -- or 
                        something terrible.
           G) Retail Space Under Construction - A FEW CONSTRUCTION 
           GUYS in hard hats look over blueprints spread out on a 
           plywood table.

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        Someone is born. Someone gets 
                        married. Someone dies. You 
                        graduate. You break up. You buy 
                        something big. You get a scar. 
                        Some sex thing happens. 

           H) Dorm Room - A concerned COLLEGE FRESHMAN (18) has one 
           hand down the front of his boxers. He’s feeling his 
           testicles. 

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        Great Christmases. Terrible New 
                        Years. That one Halloween. 
                        Something magical happens in the 
                        rain. Something wonderful happens 
                        in the snow. 

           I) Tropical Beach - A 20-SOMETHING WOMAN runs toward the 
           surf and dives into the waves.

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        But, to me, the best days are when 
                        nothing big happens. Those perfect 
                        simple days -- when everything 
                        clicks and you feel you are 
                        exactly where you need to be.

           J) Farmer’s Market - A happy ELDERLY COUPLE stroll the 
           marketplace holding hands.

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        When everything, all of this -- 
                        makes absolute sense.

           END MONTAGE

           EXT. WEST SIDE MARKET - AFTERNOON 

           SOLOMON CHAU (20) and JENN CARTER (20) are shopping in 
           the WEST SIDE MARKET. A large Gourmet marketplace in the 
           heart of Cleveland.

           Sol holds an empty CANVAS BAG. Jenn wears SAGE COLOR 
           CONVERSE SNEAKERS. Sol could be great looking if he just 
           tried -- Jenn is great looking because she doesn’t.

           They stop at a stall filled with FRESH VEGGIES. 
                                 SOL
                        How do you feel about eggplant?

                                 JENN
                        How do I feel about them? Neutral?

           Sol picks up an EGGPLANT that has a smaller eggplant 
           growing out of it. Like a nose on a face.

                                 SOL
                        Look at this guy! 

                                 JENN
                        Looks like that Muppet who plays 
                        sax. What’s his name?

                                 SOL
                        Zoot.

                                 JENN
                        Impressive.

                                 SOL
                        You should know, most of the 
                        impressive things I know -- are 
                        things I probably shouldn’t know.

           Sol takes a longer look at the mutant eggplant.

                                 JENN
                        So he’s... dinner?

                                 SOL
                        Maybe. It’s my first time cooking 
                        for you. I want to make something 
                        you’re going to love. Or at least 
                        not fully hate.

                                 JENN
                        Last night, I sat on the couch in 
                        bra and socks eating leftover Mac 
                        and Cheese with a can of peas 
                        dumped on top. 

                                 SOL
                        I... kind of like that image.

                                 JENN
                        That image you have and the image 
                        it was -- they’re different. 

                                 SOL
                        Is there anything you don’t eat? 
                        Let’s start there.
                                 JENN
                        Zucchini. Gross.

                                 SOL
                        Weird. Why?

                                 JENN
                        Mushy. Tasteless.

                                 SOL
                        Wrong. Next? 

                                 JENN
                        Skittles. Too tangy.

                                 SOL
                        Scratch my Zucchini/Skittle 
                        recipe. Next?

                                 JENN
                        Cilantro. Disgusting. 

                                 SOL
                        Whoa! Why?!

                                 JENN
                        Same reason I don’t grate Irish 
                        Spring all over my food?

                                 SOL
                        What are you, mental? Like, mental 
                        in your mouth? 

           Jenn picks up a tomato that looks like a butt.

                                 JENN 
                        Vegetable Rorschach. Butt or 
                        boobs? 

           Sol is distracted by the Zoot eggplant.

                                 SOL 
                        Even if I don’t cook this guy -- 
                        I’m buying him. Butt.

           Jenn holds up her iPhone. 

                                 JENN
                        Let me get a picture...

           Sol poses with the eggplant and mimics the frowny 
           expression. We hear the camera click.

                                                                  CUT TO:
           IPHONE VIDEO: 

           We’re watching an IPHONE VIDEO in PORTRAIT mode. 

           ON VIDEO: JENN and SOL (now both 25) sit beside each 
           other on a COUCH. He wears a well-worn UFC SWEATSHIRT. 
           Sol is obviously ILL. Thin. He wears a trendy knit-cap 
           but we can tell his hair is patchy and thin underneath. 

           Jenn swiping through an IPAD. She glances up at the 
           camera.

                                 JENN (CONT’D)
                        Other way, Mom. Sideways.

           The iPhone is turned. The video turns to LANDSCAPE.

                                 JENN (CONT’D) 
                        Get closer. Can you see this?

                                 JENN’S MOTHER (O.C.)
                        Hold it still.

           Jenn holds up the iPad screen. She shows an Instagram 
           photo of Sol and his Zoot eggplant.

                                 JENN
                        That was the first one.

                                 SOL
                        I thought Carrot Legs Baby Penis 
                        was first.

           Jenn SWIPES through more photos of Sol and vegetables. 

                                 JENN
                        Zoot was first. Then Carrot Legs 
                        Baby Penis. One-Arm Sumo Potato. 
                        Evil Alien Mango...

                                 SOL
                        Okay. Mutant vegetable obsession. 
                        Check. What else do you want to 
                        talk about?

                                 JENN’S MOM (O.C.)
                        How about your first date?

                                 JENN
                        Yah!... No wait. How we first met 
                        first.

                                 SOL
                        Tell it.
                                 JENN
                        I want to hear how you remember. 

                                 SOL
                        It was five years ago.

                                 JENN
                        Just tell it.

           Sol looks at the camera and talks in a deep voice.

                                 SOL
                        We met on my sailboat on the 
                        Mediterranean. A 90-foot schooner. 
                        I was at the helm, butt naked 
                        except my Captain’s hat. With my 
                        manhood as my compass I...

           Jenn’s Mom laughs. The camera shakes with her giggle. 

                                 JENN
                        I remember it differently.

           A SPEEDING FIST flies across the screen smashing into the 
           jaw of a fighter. 

           INT. LEGENDS SPORTS BAR - HAPPY HOUR

           The bar-goers ‘Oooh!’ at the MMA FIGHT on TV.

           2010 CLEVELAND SPORTS TEAM memorabilia covers the walls. 
           A DEFACED POSTER of LEBRON JAMES is proudly displayed. 

           20-Year Old Jenn sits in a BOOTH flanked by two friends 
           MEGAN FLETCHER (20), buttoned-up and fidgety, and AMANDA 
           DENHOFF (21), a scrappy, curvy shrimp.

           Sol and his two of his friends, KYLE MESSINGER (20), bad 
           jeans/bad haircut/bad sneakers, and DAVE COLELLA (21), 
           too close to too fat, approach their booth. 

                                 MEGAN
                        Uh oh.

                                 AMANDA
                        Hit ignore.

           Dave yells over the bar noise -- louder than necessary.

                                 DAVE
                        You guys look lonely over here!
                                 AMANDA
                        Not lonely though. Very not.

                                 DAVE
                        We are then. I’m Dave. This is 
                        Kyle and Sol... 

                                 SOL
                        They’re actually the lonely ones. 
                        I’m just -- embarrassed. 

                                 MEGAN
                        I’m Megan. Amanda and Jenn.

                                 KYLE
                        Hi Megan. Hi Amanda. And hi Jenny.

                        Just Jenn. Two N’s. 

           Dave gets a little flirty.

                                 DAVE
                        What’s the extra N for?

                                 AMANDA
                        Extra No thanks. Look guys...

                                 DAVE
                        Wait! You want to hear a story?!

                                 MEGAN
                        Is it story time now?

                                 DAVE
                        Cute cat story.

                        We’ll buy drinks. 

           The girls can’t resist. They make room in the booth.

                                 DAVE
                        Sol, your tab still going, bro?

                                 AMANDA
                        Bro. 

           Dave slides into the booth. Sol heads to the bar. 
           INT. LEGENDS SPORTS BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           The bar is energized by the MMA fight. Amanda, Megan, and 
           Jenn are packed in their booth with Dave and Kyle. 

                                 DAVE
                        ... and the cat darts out of 
                        nowhere! Right in front of my 
                        Vespa! I swerve but...

           Dave slaps his own palm.

                                 AMANDA
                        Tell me this has a happy ending.

                                 KYLE
                        Depends how you feel about cats. 

           Jenn notices Sol trying and failing to get the attention 
           of the bartender. She slides out of the booth.

                                 JENN
                        I’m ducking out on this scar.

                                 MEGAN
                        Vespa, cat... finish.

                                 DAVE
                        I swerve but I go right over the 
                        thing. Buh-bum buh-bump. Front and 
                        back wheels. And I hear this big 
                        pop noise. I thought I blew out a 
                        tire but then all the kids in the 
                        playground start screaming and I 
                        feel something wet on the back of 
                        my legs...

                                 MEGAN
                        You said this was a cute cat 
                        story!

                                 DAVE
                        It was a cute cat!

                                 AMANDA
                        I don’t like this story time. I 
                        don’t like this story time.

           Amanda stirs the melting ice in her drink with a cocktail 
           straw and loudly sips whatever is left.
           INT. LEGENDS SPORTS BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Sol waves a $20 bill but is still ignored by the 
           bartender. He turns his attention to the MMA fight -- 
           barely acknowledging Jenn standing right next to him.

                                 SOL
                        There’s gotta be a better bar 
                        somewhere.

                                 JENN
                        So one guy hits and kicks other 
                        guy until the ref guy says no more 
                        with the hitting and the kicking? 

                                 SOL 
                        Basically. 

           Sol holds the conversation while watching the fight.

                                 JENN
                        Seems like a lot of neck gripping. 
                        Why do you like this?

                                 SOL 
                        I like the underdogs. 

           We hear Megan in the booth yell, “Uch!” Sol and Jenn look 
           over at Dave grinning. Megan and Amanda look disgusted.

                                 JENN
                        Your friend is talking about how 
                        he drove over a cat. 

                                 SOL 
                        He thinks that story is a great 
                        icebreaker. No idea why.

           Sol waves for the bartender again and is ignored.

                                 JENN 
                        He’s playing the odds. It’s kind 
                        of a good idea -- all things 
                        considered.

                                 SOL
                        How’s that?

           Jenn crunches some bar nuts. 

                                 JENN 
                        Nine-hundred ninety-nine out of a 
                        thousand girls will hate that 
                        story, right? Hate it.
                                 SOL
                        Okay. Maybe generous.

           Jenn locks eyes with Sol. 

                                 JENN
                        But that one. One out of a 
                        thousand. That one girl who loves 
                        smushed cat stories? It’s a dream. 
                        That’s a soulmate moment for her. 

           Sol listens. Confused. She moves closer. Her voice 
           lowers.

                                 JENN (CONT’D)
                        She will love him for having the 
                        guts to tell that story. Her kind 
                        of story. Smushed cat. It’s a 
                        longshot, yeah -- but if you 
                        believe in destiny -- in finding 
                        that one person who really gets 
                        you... it’s the right idea.

           Sol does the math on her logic.

                                 SOL
                        I’m pretty sure it’s the wrong 
                        idea.

                                 JENN
                        Yeah? If he hit a duck instead of 
                        a cat -- I’d probably be in the 
                        bathroom with him right now... 
                        fully giving it up.

           Jenn holds his look until Sol finally laughs.

                                 SOL
                        Are you... here... ummm... 

           He sees JENN IN FULL at once. Her ease, her funny, her 
           beauty, smarts, quickness, punch.  It’s obvious she’s 
           fully different. He stares -- astounded. 

                                 JENN
                        This stare is two seconds from 
                        turning creepazoid. Blink. Look 
                        left. Do something else with your 
                        eyes.

           Sol looks right then left then shuts his eyes altogether. 
                                 SOL
                        Sorry sorry. Tequila shots! I’m 
                        usually witty and charming.

                                 JENN
                        You ever see James Bond? Dude is 
                        fully hammered 24/7 and he’s 
                        always witty and charming. 

           Jenn waits. Sol nods and accepts the challenge. He 
           composes himself.

                                 SOL
                        You look... like... the... 
                        princess of a... beautiful...

                                 JENN
                        Stop. Stop now. Abort. Abort. 

           She flags down the bartender with one wave. 

                                                                 BACK TO:

           IPHONE VIDEO: 

           We’re back on the couch with LATE-STAGE CANCER Sol and 
           Jenn. Jenn hands him a cup with a bendy straw and two RED 
           PILLS. 

                                 JENN 
                        If you had a couple more tequila 
                        shots we wouldn’t be here now.  

                                 SOL
                        I probably would be. You wouldn’t.

                                 JENN
                        Take your Doxorubicin. 

           Sol looks at the size of the large pills.

                                 SOL
                        What did that nurse guy in chemo 
                        call these?

                                 JENN
                        Red Devils. 

                                 SOL
                        They ought to make these chewable.
                                 JENN
                        Yeah. Fruit flavors like 
                        Flintstones. I’ll call Merck in 
                        the morning.

           Jenn hands him a glass of water. He takes the pills and 
           washes them down then lies back and closes his eyes.

                                 SOL
                        Playing nurse to me or laying on a 
                        tropical beach somewhere? Where 
                        would you rather be?

                                 JENN
                        Here. I have body issues. 

           Jenn kisses his cheek. 

                                 SOL
                        Me too.

                                 JENN’S MOM (O.C.)
                        Are you sure you’re up for this?

           He takes a sudden breath as if he just came up for air. 
           He sits up.  

                                 SOL
                        Yeah. I want to. We have to do 
                        something with the time. But let’s 
                        talk about all of our stuff. I 
                        don’t want this to seem like some 
                        fairy tale fantasy life...

           Sol laughs and starts to cough. It turns into a hard deep 
           chest hacking. The VIDEO PAUSES.

           INT. JENN AND SOL’S KITCHEN - DAWN

           Jenn sits ALONE on a bar stool at the kitchen counter. 
           The image of Sol coughing is paused on her LAPTOP SCREEN. 

           Jenn looks OLDER. The apartment is messy. Dark. Empty. 
           Two medical monitors stand by the door. Unplugged. Wires 
           coiled and tied. She wears the UFC sweatshirt.

           She scrolls a long list of video files and clicks one 
           named FEB-14-SOL.mp4

           ON LAPTOP SCREEN:
           The SHAKY VIDEO is a HIDDEN CAMERA view of Jenn and Sol 
           walking in a PARK. 

           Sol suddenly starts to sing the 2013 hit ‘COUNTING STARS’ 
           by One Republic. He sort of has a singing voice -- but we 
           suspect he thinks it’s better than it really is...

                                 SOL
                        Lately, I've been, I've been 
                        losing sleep. Dreaming about the 
                        things that we could be... 

           There’s a pause. A street violinist strolls up next to 
           them. He accompanies Sol’s singing. 

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        But baby, I've been, I've been 
                        praying hard. Said no more 
                        counting dollars. We'll be 
                        counting stars...

           A guitarist gets off a nearby bench and joins in. It’s 
           Sol’s WEDDING PROPOSAL to her. A complete sneak attack.

           A FLASH MOB emerges in the park. There’s a BRASS BAND. 
           Drums. A piano on wheels. DOLPHIN-SHAPED BALLOONS. A man 
           in a tuxedo on stilts walks out from behind a tree. 

           Sol steps into the group and they all dance a loose 
           synchronized dance as they circle Jenn.

                                 FLASH MOB 
                        I see this life, like a swinging 
                        vine. Swing my heart across the 
                        line. And in my face is flashing 
                        signs. Seek it out and ye’ shall 
                        find...

           Lured by the noise, random people in the park crowd 
           around. Some join in, singing and clapping. It’s an insta-
           party. 

           Jenn clasps her hands over her mouth as tears flow. The 
           man on stilts hands a VELVET BOX down to Sol who then 
           gets down on ONE KNEE. He asks for her hand.

           The mob waits for Jenn’s answer. She tearfully chokes 
           out... 

                                 JENN
                        Of course! Yes!
           Sol stands and puts the ring on her shaking hand. They 
           KISS. Hug. People cheer. The video pauses.

                                                                 BACK TO:

           INT. JENN AND SOL’S KITCHEN - DAWN

           Jenn sits at the laptop. It’s quiet except the hum of the 
           computer fan. She stares at the frozen image of balloons 
           and Sol full of life. 

           She SLAMS the laptop lid.

           INT. JENN AND SOL’S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

           A door SLAMS. Sol walks in. He’s HEALTHY. Handsome.

           Sol is dressed corporate casual. Laptop bag in one hand 
           and a bag of groceries in the other.

           Jenn is UNPACKING a box. ACADEMIC PSYCHOLOGY BOOKS along 
           with notebooks and paperwork. Grad school stuff. 

           We note her modest ENGAGEMENT RING. 

           By the shape of their apartment, we can guess that they 
           JUST MOVED IN. Boxes stacked everywhere. A carpet rolled 
           up leaning against the wall. A couch. A TV. The basics.

                                 JENN
                        How’d it go?

           Jenn gives him a hug. He kisses her quickly on the cheek 
           and puts the grocery bag on the kitchen counter.

                                 SOL
                        Super. 

           He takes a small jar of FLEUR DE SEL SEA SALT out of the 
           grocery bag. Jenn looks at the jar. 

                                 JENN
                                 (Fake French accent)
                        Oh ho. Very nice.

                                 SOL
                        It was on sale. 

           Sol takes out a few ZUCCHINI. 

                                 JENN
                        Yay. Zucchini. My favorite.

                        I’m gonna finally change your mind 
                        about these. You’ll see.

                                 JENN
                        Good luck. I think my feelings 
                        about zucchini are hard wired to a 
                        repressed childhood memory. 

           Jenn expects a laugh. She doesn’t get one.

                        Bathroom Marketing will be the

                        looking at the new Project

           Sol’s grin makes it clear it’s not a cause for 
           celebration. He takes out a skillet and lets it bang down 
           on the stove.

                                 JENN
                        That’s not too too bad.

                        Heat. Clothing. Things in general.

           Jenn tries to MASSAGE the stress out of his shoulders. 

                                 JENN

           Sol clanks the pan.

           Sol starts chopping a zucchini.

                                 JENN
                        Love the plan, Sol. Let me know 
                        how it all turns out. 

           Jenn grabs her coat and leaves the apartment without 
           another word.
           EXT. INDEPENDENT BOOK STORE - LATER - EARLY EVENING

           Jenn walks down an aisle with Amanda. We notice the 
           PURPLE-HAIRED BOOK STORE CLERK (69) is setting up a 
           display of the book LEAN IN by Sheryl Sandberg.

                                 AMANDA
                        Grad school is for suckers. It’s 
                        amazing smart people go.

                                 JENN
                        Spent like $900 on books this 
                        semester. Ree-dick.

                                 AMANDA
                        So what happened?

                                 JENN
                        Came home from work all bitchy. 
                        Again. He’s grumpy and tired all 
                        the time. Slept all weekend last 
                        week. We’re okay but...

           Jenn opens a book. Amanda shuts it and takes it from her. 
           She looks at Jenn seriously.

                                 AMANDA
                        You lost your Big O Glow. When you 
                        first dated you had Big O Glow.

                                 JENN
                        I still have Big O Glow.

                                 AMANDA
                        No. You have sad vibrator dinge. I 
                        know that dinge. I rock that 
                        dinge. I’m telling you -- take 
                        advantage of your pre-marriage sex 
                        life.  

                                 JENN
                        Don’t worry. Our pre-marriage 
                        phase might be forever pre. I 
                        can’t even get him to commit to 
                        getting a dog.

                                 AMANDA
                        What does he want??

           Jenn shrugs. 
                                 JENN
                        I entered him in a cooking contest 
                        at the end of May. Maybe it’ll 
                        snap him out of his funk.

                                 AMANDA
                        Really!?

                                 JENN
                        Bistro Chef Live. One appetizer. 
                        One entree. Winner gets $20,000.

                                 AMANDA
                        Great!! What’d he say?

                                 JENN
                        He feels like I’m pushing him.

                                 AMANDA
                        Good! That’s what a future wife is 
                        for... Start shoving.

           Purple Hair passes by pushing a book cart. We leave Jenn 
           and Amanda behind and follow Purple Hair to the MUSIC 
           SECTION. 

                                 PURPLE HAIR
                        Let me know if you need help.

           She takes a book off the cart called 1975 PUNK. She flips 
           through finds the page she’s looking for -- a grainy 
           PHOTO of a band called THE SPLITS in front of CBGB. 

           Jenn VOICEOVERS:

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        We’re going to get old one day. 

           The young drummer in the photo is a girl with heavy 
           purple eyeliner and a purple mohawk. 

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        Hopefully.

           The young girl sneers at the camera while holding 
           drumsticks over her head like an X. 

           EXT. INDEPENDENT BOOKSTORE - DAY

           Jenn and Amanda WALK OUT of the bookstore. Jenn holds the 
           door open for the HUNCHED OLD MAN from the opening 
           montage. He’s walking alone with a cane. We follow the 
           Old Man into the store. 
           INT. INDEPENDENT BOOKSTORE - MOMENTS LATER

           The Old Man heads down an aisle toward the Travel 
           section. 

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        It sucks. There’s no way around 
                        it. Getting old sucks. 

           The Old Man runs his fingers across the spines of various 
           travel guides. Various countries.

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        When you’re young, it’s hard to 
                        even imagine. It’s so far off.

           He takes down a COFFEE TABLE BOOK titled BEIJING. The 
           weight is a lot for him. He flips through it.

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        But one day, old age will arrive. 
                        With all its baggage. Could-haves. 
                        Should haves. Do-overs. Missed 
                        chances.

           The Old Man walks to the register with the book. Purple 
           Hair reshelves her 1975 Punks book and follows him.

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        But the harder truth is -- 
                        statistically speaking, half of us 
                        don’t get to be old. 

           SHY GIRL with GLASSES walks into the bookstore with her 
           Mother. The Old Man smiles as she passes by.

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        Half of us never get that promised 
                        stretch of time to make peace with 
                        all our regrets. Half of us -- get 
                        cheated.

           We hear an electronic beep as Purple Hair scans the 
           barcode of the book.

           INT. JENN AND SOL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A CHEF KNIFE comes down on an octopus tentacle. KATY 
           PERRY plays. Sol dances a little while cooking.

           All four stove burners are active. Amanda, Megan, Kyle 
           and Dave sit around snacking on canapés. Jenn pours wine.
                                 KYLE
                        I seriously think I should be a 
                        food taster. It would be worth the 
                        occasional poisoning.

                                 DAVE
                        I got poisoned once when I was a 
                        kid. Ate a couple of those laundry 
                        detergent pods. Almost died.

                                 AMANDA
                        Is that why you’re like... this?

           Sol is in his element as he cooks. He doesn’t notice Jenn 
           watching him. She focuses on the grace of his HANDS.

                                 SOL
                        Octopus appetizer up first!

                                 JENN
                        Remember, we’re voting on the best 
                        appetizer and best entree. 

                                 KYLE
                        Do we get a cut after you win the 
                        twenty grand?

                                 SOL
                        This is your cut. 

           Jenn heads into the kitchen. She HUGS Sol from behind. It 
           doesn’t interrupt his rhythm.

                                 JENN
                        All going according to plan?

           Sol blows on a wooden spoon and gives Jenn a taste of a 
           sauce simmering in a pot. Her eyes go wide.

                                 SOL
                        You tell me. How does that taste?

                                 JENN
                        It tastes like... you’re not 
                        fucking around in here. At all.

           Jenn loves the confidence on Sol’s face. Sol loves the 
           pride in hers.

           INT. JENN AND SOL’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Sol begins plating. We watch dish-by-dish perfectly 
           plated. 
           A real FOODIE MOMENT:

           -- Charred OCTOPUS with Chickpeas, Hazelnut, and Basil

           -- Pan Roasted SALMON with Ratatouille and Dill Oil

           -- Seared DUCK Breast with Orange Gastrique, Farro, and 
           Roasted Turnips

           -- CARPACCIO with Shaved Parmesan, Mesclun, and Capers

           Everyone dives into the deliciousness. Sol carefully 
           watches their faces. They obviously love it. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Uch. This is ruining all future 
                        food for me. How am I supposed to 
                        eat Arby’s after this?

                                 SOL
                        What do you think, Ky?

                                 KYLE
                        Meh. What’s the spice on here? 
                        Mrs. Dash?

           Kyle teasingly waves a tentacle on his fork. Sol smirks 
           then looks at Dave.

                                 SOL
                        So Dave, you wanna be my Best Man? 

           Dave talks through a mouthful of food.

                                 DAVE
                        Not really. It’s a whole hassle.

                                 AMANDA
                        God. What did you do to this beef?

                                 SOL
                        Walnut oil. Capers. Good?

                                 AMANDA
                        Good? I want to marry it. Make 
                        babies with it. Then eat the 
                        babies.

           Jenn and Sol watch their friends devour his cooking. Dave 
           holds up his wine glass. He talks while still chewing.
                                 DAVE
                        Mario Batali? Fuck yourself, bro. 
                        Cheers to the new best chef in all 
                        Ohio land.

           They all clink glasses. We sense Dave and Amanda, now 
           boozy, give each other a monetarily flirty look.

           INT. SOL AND JENN’S APARTMENT - LATER

           The kitchen looks like it was attacked by a blind bear. 
           Food splatter. Cabinets open. Dishes sideways in the 
           sink. 

           Dave is ASLEEP on the couch.

           Sol is rubbing his RIGHT SHOULDER. He inhales through his 
           teeth as he’s hit with sharp PAIN. 

                                 MEGAN
                        I still vote salmon.

                                 JENN
                        It’s settled. We voted charred 
                        octopus appetizer and the duck. 

                                 KYLE
                        Salmon never wins, Megs. It takes 
                        the bronze on its best day.

                                 MEGAN
                        Salmon can take gold.

                                 KYLE
                        Nah. Salmon is the chicken of sea.

                                 MEGAN
                        That’s tuna, dope.

                                 AMANDA
                        Sol which is your best dish? 

                                 SOL
                        The duck.

           Sol flops down in a chair and continues rubbing his 
           shoulder. Jenn notices.

                                 JENN
                        Okay guys. This was a huge help. 
                        Now get out in the next ninety 
                        seconds, please. Bye bye. Out now 
                        thanks. Let’s see some hustle.
           Their friends take the cue and start gathering up their 
           things. Kyle shakes a snoring Dave on the couch. 

                                 KYLE
                        Wake up! Yo! Wake up!

                                 SOL
                        He can crash here.

                                 KYLE
                        You sure?

                                 SOL
                        Getting him out the door would be 
                        a whole project. You know that.

           Amanda and Megan put on their coats. 

                                 MEGAN
                        You got this, Sol. That was legit 
                        amazing. 

                                 AMANDA
                        But see a doctor. Your winces are 
                        getting annoying. 

                                 SOL
                        Not paying a doctor five hundred 
                        bucks to tell me to buy Icy Hot.

                                 MEGAN
                        Then just buy some already!

           They hug and leave. Sol looks clammy and beyond 
           exhausted.

           INT. JENN AND SOL’S BATHROOM - NIGHT 

           Jenn and Sol brush their teeth. 

           She MIRRORS his toothbrush brushing. Stopping when he 
           stops. Changing sides when he does. He starts. She 
           starts. He stops. She stops. A nightly ritual that Sol 
           struggles to ignore nightly. She sings:

                                 JENN
                                 (singing)
                        Toothbrush twins. We brush em up. 
                        Toothbrush twins. We brush em 
                        down. Up and down, left and right. 
                        Toothbrush twinnnns. One tooth two 
                        tooth two tooth three...
           Sol suddenly JOLTS like he was electrically shocked. He 
           holds his right shoulder. Jaw hanging low in awe of the 
           PAIN. He steadies himself on the bathroom counter.

           Jenn, wide-eyed, throws her toothbrush in the sink.

                                 JENN (CONT’D)
                        You are calling a doctor tomorrow!

                                 SOL
                        It’s a pinched nerve!

                                 JENN
                        Tomorrow! You’re calling! Or 
                        tomorrow, I swear to God, Sol -- 
                        I’m going to get... a tattoo of... 
                        One Direction on my ass! 

           The pain seems to be fading. Sol laughs.

                                 SOL
                        Stop.

                                 JENN
                        I am swearing to God on this. I 
                        mean it. You’re calling the doctor 
                        or I’m calling a tattoo shop! One 
                        D! Right on it! No joke!

           Sol nods. There’s no fight. 

           INT. JENN AND SOL’S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Jenn, sound asleep, lays next to Sol. His eyes wide open. 
           Drenched in sweat. We watch his BREATHING picks up speed. 
           It speeds up hyperventilating. Jenn wakes up.

                                 SOL
                        Something’s wrong.

           She clicks on the light.

                                 JENN
                        What?! 

           He throws off the covers and stumbles toward the 
           bathroom. He trips on the way holding HIS ABDOMEN.

                                 JENN (CONT’D)
                        Sol!

           Sol looks fully stunned by the sharpness of the pain in 
           his gut. Jenn crouches down to help him.
                                 JENN (CONT’D)
                        Sol! What’s happening?!

           The pain gets worse. He can’t speak. Pain is ripped 
           across his face. Spittle shoots from his mouth. 

           Dave yanks open the door in a half-confused stupor. 

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jenn is on her iPhone. Pacing in her sage Converse shoes. 
           Dave is scrolling through an article on his mobile phone.

                                 JENN (TO PHONE)
                        Maybe appendix.... They say the 
                        pain can... travel.

           Jenn rolls her eyes at Dave. Her patience stays under 
           control. She shifts her tone to methodical.

                                 JENN (TO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Yes. Next time I’ll make the 
                        appointment for him.

           Jenn composes herself.

                                 JENN (TO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Of course, I will be here.

           She clicks off the phone.

                                 JENN 
                        They’ll be here in a few hours.

                                 DAVE
                        No surprise. His Mom wanted to 
                        come to school every time Sol had 
                        a cold to cook him ginger soup.

                                 JENN
                        It makes this feel serious.

           Dave proudly holds up his phone and reads. 

                                 DAVE
                        It’s not. Fibromyalgia. Check it: 
                        The condition is often associated 
                        with tender points, which are 
                        termed “trigger points.” These are 
                        places on the body where even 
                        light pressure causes pain...
                                 JENN
                        I don’t need Dr. Dick Googleman 
                        right now.

           Jenn waves him away.

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - 3AM

           Jenn sees SOL’S MOTHER and FATHER, BEVERLY CHAU (50) and 
           ARTHUR CHAU (55), hustling down the hallway toward the 
           waiting area. Dave sits, legs splayed, looking at his 
           phone.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Any word?

                                 JENN
                        Not yet. 

           They both give Jenn a hug.

                                 BEV
                        Hi David.

                                 DAVE
                        Hi Mrs. Chau. Good to see you. 
                        Well, not good to... but...

                                 ARTHUR
                        What kind of tests are they doing?

                                 JENN
                        All of the above. I don’t know. 

                                 BEV
                        You don’t know??

           Jenn takes a pause with Bev.

                                 JENN
                        I’m waiting on the doctors. 

                                 BEV
                        Don’t wait, Jenn. Ask.

                                 DAVE
                        It’s Fibromyalgia. Trust me. 

           Bev squints an annoyed/confused look at Dave as he holds 
           up his phone at her. 
           DR. ALAN SCHIFFRIN (60), the doctor from the opening 
           montage, walks briskly down the hall. He joins them in 
           the waiting area. 

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN 
                        Are you his wife?

                                 JENN
                        Fiancé.

                                 BEV
                        I’m his mother.

           Jenn desperately reads the doctor’s expression for a 
           single trace of optimism. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Jenn sits next to Sol who is prepped for EMERGENCY 
           SURGERY. Her eyes are bloodshot from crying.

                                 SOL
                        What are you crying about? I heard 
                        the food in this place is sick.

                                 JENN
                        Don’t. You can’t joke right now.

                                 SOL
                        I don’t know what to say.

                                 JENN
                        Say you’re going to be okay.

                                 SOL
                        The doctors all agree. They’re 
                        catching this super early, Jenn.

                                 JENN
                        They only see it in the liver. One 
                        place. One spot.

                                 SOL
                        One tumor. One sad creepy loner 
                        tumor who is about to get evicted 
                        from my premises.

           Jenn’s eyes fill with determination and fear.

                                 JENN
                        We are going to be old people 
                        together. Very old.
                                 SOL
                        Yes. We will. 

                                 JENN
                        Apple sauce old. 

                                 SOL
                        Matching purple and yellow 
                        sweatsuits using the wrong end of 
                        the fork old.

                                 JENN
                        Because I will elbow smash you in 
                        the Adam’s Apple if you change our 
                        old people plans.

                                 SOL
                        No elbow smash necessary. I’ll be 
                        fine. You’ll see.

           Jenn bursts with tears. 

                                 JENN
                        It’s me and you, Solomon Chau.

                                 SOL
                        You and me, Jenn. Always.

           A FEW NURSES enter the room. Sol nods and looks to Jenn. 
           She squeezes his hand and kisses him between the eyes. 
           They wheel him away. 

           Jenn watches him go then CLOSES HER EYES. Leaving us in 
           the DARK. 

           We hear an EKG beeping. The beeping gets louder and more 
           urgent then morphs into an ALARM CLOCK alarm. 

           INT. SOL AND JENN’S BEDROOM - WINTER MORNING

           The alarm clock beeps loudly. It’s SNOWING lightly. Jenn 
           lies next to Sol. She shuts off the alarm with a smack. 

                                 JENN
                        Get up.

           Sol rolls over. 

                                 SOL
                        I’m good.

                                 JENN
                        Sol. It’s six.
                                 SOL
                        How long does snooze go for again?

                                 JENN
                        Til now. Get up.

           Jenn throws back the covers. Sol is in boxers. He has a 
           LARGE SCAR on his abdomen -- pink but fully healed. 

                                 SOL
                        Ten minutes.

                                 JENN
                        I have class at eight. I’m making 
                        coffee. 

                                 SOL
                        Wait! I want to cut a deal!

           Sol grabs her hand as she tries to stand up. 

                                 JENN
                        No deals! 

                                 SOL
                        Hear the offer! You can say no! 
                        Just hear me out!

                                 JENN
                        Go.

                                 SOL
                        Item number one. Foot massage 
                        tonight during Game of Thrones. 
                        Half hour.

           It grabs Jenn’s attention. She’s game.

                                 JENN
                        Both feet? 

                                 SOL
                        Yah. Of course both feet. 

                                 JENN
                        You said foot massage. I’m 
                        clarifying. Plural. Feet.

                                 SOL
                        Okay, counselor. A both feet foot 
                        massage.

                                 JENN
                        What else?
                                 SOL
                        I’ll chuck UFC Tapout in the 
                        trash. No more Playstation. 

                                 JENN
                        You told me last week you were 
                        already bored of it. No deal.

           Jenn starts to walk away.

                                 SOL
                        We’ll go the dog shelter this 
                        week!... To look.

                                 JENN
                        With honest intent?

                                 SOL
                        With honest intent. No promises. 
                        No yappy yaps. No shedders. 

           Jenn accesses. 

                                 JENN
                        Feet massage. Tapout in trash. And 
                        shelter trip with honest intent no 
                        yappy yaps no shedders?

           Sol seductively reels her by the arm back into bed. She 
           nods and doesn’t resist.

                                 JENN (CONT’D)
                        You still need to hurry.

                                 SOL
                        I can be done in five minutes.

                                 JENN
                        You have three. 

           They kiss. She giggles while he flips her on her back.

           EXT. CITY PARK PLAYGROUND - SNOWY MORNING 

           The snow is perfect for snowballs. Kids bundled in winter 
           clothes are having a blast. 

           Our SHY GIRL from the opening montage is sticking snow to 
           the side of an OAK TREE. She fills deep cracks in the 
           bark with sticky snow. Her MOTHER stands close by 
           watching her.
           Another girl wearing PINK SNOW PANTS (also 6) approaches 
           our Shy Girl and watches her smear snow into the bark.

                                 PINK PANTS
                        What you doing?

           Shy Girl doesn’t respond. 

                                 PINK PANTS (CONT’D) 
                        Can I do some?

           From a distance, we see a MAN DRESSED IN WHITE PANTS, 
           WOOL CAP and BLUE SKI PARKA running through the park 
           toward them.

                                 SHY GIRL’S MOTHER
                        Honey, this girl is asking if she 
                        can play too.

           Shy Girl doesn’t respond.

           The Man in White Pants almost crashes into a woman 
           pulling two kids on a sled -- but side steps around it. 

                                 PINK PANTS
                        Does she talk?

                                 SHY GIRL’S MOTHER
                        When she wants to...

           Pink Pants gets right in her Shy Girl’s face. 

                                 PINK GIRL 
                        Why don’t you talk now?!?

           The Man in White Pants -- is Sol. He flies past the tree 
           and we follow him -- leaving the girls behind.

           EXT. CLEVELAND CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Sol runs down the street. Slaloming people. Finally, 
           reaching the alley door of a HIGH-END but casual 
           restaurant called PEPPER & SALT.

           He stands outside for a moment catching his breath -- he 
           slows his breathing, his heart rate, his demeanor. He 
           seems overly winded. 

           INT. PEPPER & SALT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Sol enters the kitchen and takes off his parka. 
           Pans are clanking on stoves. A blur of eggs, bread and 
           sizzling butter.  The grumpy HEAD CHEF, NEIL SUMNER (35) 
           is in full control of the kitchen. 

                                 NEIL
                        Twenty-two minutes late.

                                 SOL
                        I’ll make it up!

                                 NEIL 
                        You’d think you’d want to be here 
                        early. Your dish is on the special 
                        board.

           Sol looks at the CHALKBOARD on the wall of the 
           restaurant. One of the dishes is: Savory French Toast 
           with Poached Egg and Prosciutto. 

           Sol smiles big -- like he just saw his name in lights.

           INT. PEPPER & SALT KITCHEN - LATER

           Sol is plating meals. 

           ROGER SACHS (41), forever-boozy owner of Pepper & Salt, 
           snatches a piece of prosciutto off one of the plates. 

                                 ROGER
                        How you hanging in, Sol? 

                                 SOL
                        Keeping it moving.

           Sol expertly wiggles a poached egg off a spatula onto a 
           piece of French toast. He puts it on the high counter for 
           pick up. 

                                 ROGER
                        Home run dish. Adding it to the 
                        next menu printing.

           Neil passes by looking slightly annoyed. 

                                 NEIL
                        Ham and eggs on toast, Roger. The 
                        revolution is upon us.

                                 ROGER
                        What’s good is good, Neil! It’s 
                        not brain surgery!!

           Roger rolls his eyes at himself.
                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        Shit. Sorry. 

                                 SOL
                        For what?

                                 ROGER
                        What surgery you have last year?

                                 SOL
                        Liver. Liver cancer. 

           Roger snacks on another piece of prosciutto. Ignoring 
           Sol’s glare for disrupting a second plate.

                                 ROGER
                        How do people live without a 
                        liver?

                                 SOL
                        They don’t. They only took a third 
                        of mine. It’ll grow back.

                                 ROGER
                        The cancer?

                                 SOL
                        The liver.

                                 ROGER
                        Livers grow back?

                                 SOL
                        Yah. It’s like our mutant X-Men 
                        organ. 

           Roger pours himself a glass of red wine. 

                                 ROGER
                        Had my appendix out a few years 
                        back. Felt like a gorilla punched 
                        me square in my dick luggage.

           Roger swigs half a glass of wine like it’s water.

           EXT. PEPPER & SALT COURTYARD - LATE AFTERNOON 

           Jenn sits in the chilly courtyard of the restaurant with 
           her mother, HOPE CARTER (50). Hope is dressed layered and 
           frumpy but with care. 
           The courtyard is a mess. Almost a junkyard. Broken 
           concrete with grass growing through it. Worn wooden 
           fence. An old stove sits rusting. 

                                 HOPE
                        This will be ready in time?

                                 JENN
                        August is six months away. 

                                 HOPE 
                        Maybe find one backup place?

                                 JENN
                        Roger is offering this to us for 
                        free. Know any other free places?

           Hope’s chair wobbles. One leg is short. 

                                 HOPE
                        I can call your father. Ask him to 
                        chip in.

                                 JENN
                        Don’t. Just don’t. Leave it.

                                 HOPE
                        And Sol’s parents. Can they help?

                                 JENN
                        They can’t! This is it, Mom! This 
                        is where we’re getting married!

           Roger bursts out of the back door.

                                 ROGER
                        Ignore everything! Don’t look! All 
                        of this stuff isn’t here! In fact, 
                        close your eyes! Close your eyes, 
                        bride!

           Sol follows Roger through the back door. He’s covered in 
           kitchen splatter and wipes his brow as he looks around.

                                 SOL
                        This is gonna be perfect. 

           Jenn smiles. Relieved. 
           INT. CLEVELAND CLINIC HOSPITAL - DAY

           ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. Jenn and Sol walk down a hallway. 
           Valentine’s Day decorations add some color to the beige 
           corridors.

           They pass by the COLLEGE FRESHMAN from the opening 
           montage. He walks with his parents and looks angry.

           Jenn sees how nervous Sol looks.

                                 JENN
                        Ooh! Got an idea!

                                 SOL
                        What?

                                 JENN
                        Your first restaurant? Hospital 
                        Inspired Food. Whoa. Hear me out. 
                        Not tacky. Done right. Like high-
                        end hospital. 

                                 SOL
                        Genius, Jenn.

                                 JENN 
                        You see it? Wait staff in candy 
                        stripes. Harsh florescents. 
                        Surgical utensils on linen. 
                        Authentic bleachy smell. You call 
                        it “Gurney”... Pronounced Gurn-ay. 

           They pass a PATIENT’S ROOM. 

           Our HUNCHED OLD MAN sits beside his wife. She appears to 
           have dementia. The Old Man has the BEIJING book propped 
           on the tray table in front of his wife. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The Old Man shows his wife pictures in the book. Her 
           BLANK EYES look right through it. 

                                 OLD MAN 
                        ... and this... Our view from the 
                        hotel window... Step onto the  
                        terrace!

           The Old Man lets her look at the picture for a while then 
           turns the page. 
                                 OLD MAN (CONT’D) 
                        Orange Blossom Tea. Can you smell 
                        it, Jeannie? Your favorite.

           A tin of ORANGE TEA is open on the tray table. He picks 
           it up and waves it under her nose. 

           INT. DR. SCHIFFRIN’S OFFICE - LATER

           Sol and Jenn sit next to each other. The wall behind the 
           desk is covered with prestigious medical degrees and 
           awards. 

           On the side table sits a framed picture of a TERRIFICALLY 
           UGLY DOG. An ugly dog contest runner-up. 

                                 SOL
                        If we get bad news, we’ll get a 
                        dog immediately. No matter what. 
                        Promise. 

                                 JENN
                        Don’t say that. 

           Dr. Schiffrin walks in and shuts the door.

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        You two talking about Milton?

                                 JENN
                        Is that his name?

           The doctor puts the photo face down.

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        Don’t look at him too long. It’s 
                        like looking into the Sun.

           A large jar of RED LICORICE sits on his desk. 

                                 SOL
                        So?

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        Everything looks good.

           Jenn and Sol exhale.

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN (CONT’D) 
                        How are you doing at work? Energy 
                        up? 
                                 SOL
                        Getting there. Next week, I’ll be 
                        moved to the dinner shift.

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        I’ll have to stop in. Haven’t been 
                        out with the wife just the two of 
                        us in forever.

                                 SOL
                        Why is that?

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        Thirty-five years of marriage 
                        leads to a lot of takeout.

           Sol takes Jenn’s hand and squeezes it. Schiffrin sees how 
           in love Sol is with her.

                                 JENN
                        Should he not be pushing so hard?

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        You’re looking at eighteen-months 
                        before Sol will be a hundred 
                        percent again. Live life. 
                        Twizzler?

           Dr. Schiffrin offers the jar of licorice to Sol and Jenn. 
           Jenn takes one. Sol takes one. So does the doctor. They 
           all chew Twizzlers. 

                                 JENN
                        So... what’s next?

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        We’ll check the blood work. And we 
                        have you booked for a top down 
                        screening on...

                                 SOL
                        Jenn?

                                 JENN
                        Wednesday, March 17th. 11:30.

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        I wish my wife was as organized as 
                        you. She loses her car keys while 
                        driving in her car.

           They all sit chewing their red Twizzlers.
                                 JENN
                        Anything else?

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        What are your plans for the day?

                                 JENN
                        Thinking about getting a dog. 

           Sol gives Schiffrin a look like he’s not convinced.

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        You want this one? I’ll pay you.

           Schiffrin gives the framed photo a long look as if he 
           can’t believe that’s his dog. 

           INT. ANIMAL SHELTER - AFTERNOON

           Dogs bark and the sound echoes down the cement hallways 
           of the animal shelter. Our BEARDED GUY from the opening 
           montage is cleaning out one of the stalls. 

           Jenn and Sol stop by a cage with a quiet, large-sized 
           Pit. Jenn crouches to pet it through the bars.

                                 SOL
                        Careful. 

                                 BEARDED GUY
                        Barney is fine. Friendly.

                                 SOL
                        No Pits, please? 

                                 BEARDED GUY
                        He’s a gentle giant. 

                                 SOL
                        I just have a rule about living 
                        with things that might murder me 
                        if I look at it wrong.

                                 JENN
                        You already do.

           The Bearded Guy glares at Sol and distances himself.

                                 SOL (WHISPERING)
                        Why is it any time I say anything 
                        bad about Pit Bulls people look at 
                        me like I’m racist?
                                 JENN
                        Because shut up your whole mouth.

           Jenn moves on to another stall. An OLDER BEAGLE with a 
           grey muzzle sitting quietly. His name is on the door.

                                 JENN (CONT’D)
                        Ooh. Look at this guy! Otis...

                                 SOL
                        What’s Otis’s deal?

                                 BEARDED GUY
                        His owner went into assisted 
                        living and he couldn’t keep him. 
                        He’s nine. Very loyal. Fully 
                        trained. A real character...

                                 JENN
                        Aww, Otis.

                                 BEARDED GUY
                        You want me to take him out? 

           Jenn smiles at Sol. Eyebrows up.

                                 JENN
                        What do you think?

                                 SOL
                        Nine?? I guess he can be like... a 
                        starter dog. 

                                 JENN
                        You’re gonna be a starter husband.

                                 BEARDED GUY
                        Otis has a lot of life in him. 
                        Believe me. Older dogs get 
                        overlooked. They just crave 
                        purpose. A job.

           Sol looks through the bars at Otis. Otis looks back.

                                 SOL
                        I just...

                                 JENN
                        Do you want a dog? Yes or no?

                                 SOL
                        Yes I do! You do... so I do!
                                 JENN
                        You do so I do?? You said honest 
                        intent.

                                 SOL
                        I am being honest! A nine year old 
                        dog??

                                 JENN
                        Why not?

                                 SOL
                        Vet bills for one! 

                                 JENN
                        There’s always vet bills!

                                 BEARDED GUY
                        You two need to just come back 
                        when you know you’re ready. 

                                 JENN
                        We’re ready! We are...

                                 BEARDED GUY
                        Not yet. It’s important to me all 
                        these dogs find the right home. 
                        You’ll know when you’re ready.

           Bearded Guy walks away and heads into a back room. The 
           door slams behind him. 

                                 SOL
                        Did we just get rejected?

           Sol and Jenn are left alone among the barking dogs. 

           INT. LEGENDS SPORTS BAR - HAPPY HOUR

           Sol and Jenn sit with Kyle, Dave, Megan and Amanda. They 
           sip beers and eat burgers.

                                 JENN
                        Dog is cancelled. 

                                 SOL 
                        On hold. 

                                 MEGAN
                        What about a parrot or something?
                                 KYLE
                        Parrots are cool. Can teach em to 
                        say fuck you or whatever.

                                 AMANDA
                        Word of advice. Women don’t want 
                        any single man who owns a bird. 

                                 DAVE
                        What if it was an ostrich?

           Amanda takes his point. She smiles at Dave.

                                 SOL
                        A dog would be a lot right now. 
                        Jenn in school. Me working nights.

                                 DAVE
                        That’s why you get an old dog. Old 
                        dogs just sleep and fart all day. 

                                 KYLE
                        Like you?

                                 DAVE
                        Maybe soon! I think I’m about to 
                        be offered sev-er-ance! Boom! 

                                 AMANDA
                        Again? You’re the only person I 
                        know who is getting rich getting 
                        fired from start-ups. 

           Sol sips his beer, grimaces, then smells the glass.

                                 SOL
                        Why don’t you take your money and 
                        open a bar? This place is hurting.

                                 DAVE
                        I’ll get right on that. 

                                 SOL
                        Oh by the way. Gotta settle this.

           Sol flips a QUARTER and slaps it on his wrist. 

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        Best Man call. Heads Dave’s my 
                        Best Man. Tails it’s you Kyle.

           The two guys peer over as it’s revealed. Tails. 
                                 KYLE
                        Yes! All you Dave! Deal with it! 
                        Bachelor party! Speech! All that!

                                 DAVE
                        Two out of three!? C’mon, Sol! 

                                 SOL
                        This feels good guys. Feels good.

           Amanda fills their beers from a pitcher on the table. 

           EXT. ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME - EVENING

           Jenn and Sol sit on a bench outside the PYRAMID BUILDING 
           of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Jenn is playing 
           “Pocket Full of Dreams” by HEDLEY on her iPhone. They 
           listen together.

                                 SOL
                        I like it -- but why not a Sinatra 
                        song?

                                 JENN
                        It’s our wedding song not our 
                        fiftieth friggin anniversary song.

                                 SOL
                        Let’s see if we can dance to it. 
                        We have to practice anyway.

                                 JENN
                        I know how to dance.

                                 SOL
                        Slow dance? Not really.

                                 JENN
                        We’ve slow danced before! We just 
                        danced on New Years!

                                 SOL
                        We didn’t dance. We stood there 
                        swaying.

                                 JENN
                        That’s slow dancing!

                                 SOL
                        That’s swaying.

           The song continues to play. Sol stands up, takes her hand 
           and pulls her up off the bench. 
                                 SOL 
                        Don’t resist. That’s the first 
                        rule.

           Sol pulls her close. Jenn nervously looks around at 
           passersbys.

                                 JENN
                        We’re not doing this out here.

                                 SOL
                        If nobody cares -- you shouldn’t.

           Sol starts dancing with her. It’s awkward. Public. He 
           spins her away with a flourish and then spools her back.

                                 JENN 
                        Relax, Tippytoes. We’re going to 
                        be in a restaurant courtyard not a 
                        ballroom.

                                 SOL
                        Why are you making this so hard? 

                                 JENN
                        I like our simple sway! 

           Jenn lowers her tone. She relaxes. She holds Sol close. 
           They sway so slowly it looks like a hug.

                                 JENN (CONT’D)
                        This. This is all I want on my 
                        wedding day, Sol. This moment. 
                        This is the dream for your bride.

                                 SOL
                        Except we’ll be in a restaurant 
                        courtyard.

                                 JENN
                        We could be getting married at 
                        Chuck E. Cheese and I’d be 
                        smiling. 

           Jenn closes her eyes. They melt into each other’s arms.

                                 SOL
                        Probably could get a deal on their 
                        sixty-four ounce beers. That banjo 
                        band comes with the place.

           Jenn talks as if in a dream. Whispery. Seductively. 
                                 JENN
                        Mmm... By the end of the night, I 
                        could be that bride with a black 
                        eye and broken heel. Throw up down 
                        my cleavage. 

           Sol speaks softly back. 

                                 SOL
                        And me. Your new husband. Wearing 
                        my tie as a ninja headband. 
                        Playing skeeball. Overhand. 
                        Pockets bursting with those game 
                        tickets... for a prize. For you. 

           Sol looks into her eyes.

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        For us. 

                                 JENN
                        Me and you always, Solomon Chau.

           He tries to spin her gently. She resists. 

                                 SOL
                        You need to follow my lead! 

                                 JENN 
                        You need to not be all fancy!

           Above them, the night sky sparkles.

           INT. INDEPENDENT BOOKSTORE - LATER

           The girls sit around the table with a stack of bridal 
           books and magazines. 

           We see images of PHENOMENAL WEDDINGS. Beautiful beach 
           weddings. European castle weddings.

           The girls look like they’re suppressing depression.

                                 AMANDA
                        Stellar idea, Megs. Let’s flip 
                        through books with million dollar 
                        weddings to cheer up the girl 
                        getting married in a junkyard! 

                                 JENN
                        Courtyard.
                                 MEGAN
                        We’re just gathering ideas! I like 
                        that ivy on the fence thing. The 
                        bows on the chairs...

           Jenn stares at one particular page.

                                 JENN
                        Look at this. Look at her.

           Jenn holds up a magazine with a BEAUTIFUL BRIDE standing 
           in front of an OLD CASTLE. The bride is shimmering. The 
           MARCHESA WEDDING DRESS is stunning.

                                 MEGAN
                        Wow.

           Jenn turns the magazine back to herself. She looks 
           longingly at the image. 

                                 AMANDA
                        See! See Meg!? You’ve gone and 
                        fucked up her bride brain!

           Amanda grabs the magazine and throws it on the floor.

                                 MEGAN
                        We will make it work back there. 

           Jenn smiles at her friends. Purple Hair passes by.

                                 PURPLE HAIR
                        Which one of you is getting 
                        married?

                                 AMANDA
                        Guess.

           Purple Hair looks at all three. Megan looks shy and 
           weird. Amanda looks hung-over rough. Only Jenn looks 
           together. 

                                 PURPLE HAIR
                        You look like you just got 
                        divorced. And you look like you 
                        probably caused it... so...

           Jenn smiles. Her phone buzzes. There’s a TEXT from Sol. 

           TEXT: Come home

           Jenn stares at the text. She texts back.

           TEXT: At bookstore with the ladies. What’s up?
           The TYPING BUBBLE appears then disappears. That happens 
           twice more. Then a text is finally sent.

           TEXT: Come home please

           Jenn grabs her bag. She rushes out of the bookstore.

           EXT. JENN AND SOL’S APARTMENT - STOOP - DAY

           Jenn pulls up and sees Sol sitting on the stoop with OTIS 
           (9), the old beagle. 

                                 JENN
                        You! Did! Not! Sol! Why didn’t you 
                        take me with you?

           Jenn hops out of the car -- then sees Sol’s face. 

                                 JENN (CONT’D) 
                        What? 

           Sol looks as if he can’t part his lips.

                                 SOL
                        He’s a good dog. Just old. He’s 
                        ours now.

                                 JENN 
                        Why do we have dog?

           Jenn’s eyes look like they’re slowly turning to glass.  
           Sol can’t maintain eye contact. He almost looks ashamed.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON - EARLIER

           Sol walks out of the hospital looking stunned. He wears 
           his UFC sweatshirt. Under his arm are PAMPHLETS and 
           booklets about TREATING CANCER.

           He sits on a BENCH and watches the world pass by. Our 
           Hunched Old Man with his heavy bag sits down next to Sol. 

                                 OLD MAN
                        What is U-F-C?

                                 SOL
                        Ultimate Fighting Championship. 
                        It’s like boxing.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Never seen it.
           Sol notices the BEIJING BOOK sticking out of the old 
           man’s bag.

                                 SOL
                        Not exactly light reading there.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Have you been to China?

                                 SOL
                        I haven’t traveled much. At all.

           Those words give Sol pause. 

                                 OLD MAN
                        If you wait too long, too long 
                        will turn into too late. 

                                 SOL
                        I’m sure that’s true.

                                 OLD MAN
                        I’m the proof.

           Sol looks up at a clock atop a high building. The Old Man  
           notices the reading material Sol carries.

           INT. PETCO - LATER

           Otis rides in a Petco shopping cart. Jenn’s eyes are red 
           from crying. She walks in a daze.

                                 SOL
                        We should keep him on the same 
                        food. It’s called Nutro Senior.

                                 JENN
                        I can’t do this right now.

                                 SOL
                        What do you want to do?

                                 JENN
                        Call other doctors?

                                 SOL
                        I saw the scans. 

                                 JENN
                        He said three months?
                                 SOL
                        Only if treatment doesn’t work. 
                        And it will.

           Sol looks through a stack of dog beds.

                                 JENN 
                        This can’t be real. And we still 
                        have that shitty insurance.

           Jenn sobs more. 

                                 SOL
                        We’ll go step by step. But right 
                        now we have an important decision 
                        to make. You have to be honest. 
                        Look at me! This is serious.

           Sol holds Jenn’s face and looks directly into her eyes.

                                 SOL (CONT’D) 
                        Is Otis is going to sleep on 
                        leopard print or camouflage?

           She looks at Otis. Otis looks up at her. 

                                 SOL (CONT’D) 
                        This could define him.

           She composes herself. She looks at the dog bed selection.

                                 JENN
                        He likes the one with the paw 
                        prints.

           Sol grabs it off the shelf and drapes it over the cart. 

           INT. JENN AND SOL’S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

           They stand in the doorway to their apartment with plastic 
           bags from Petco and Otis on a leash.

                                 JENN
                        What are we supposed to do? Just 
                        go inside and act normal? Make 
                        dinner? Watch Game of Thrones?

                                 SOL
                        We’ll prioritize. Make a list.

                                 JENN 
                        You have to call your parents. 
                                 SOL
                        Not calling anyone tonight. 
                        Tonight is Otis’s night. 

           Otis sniffs around the apartment. 

                                 JENN
                        I think he likes it here. 

           Sol flips through the mail. He opens up a STUDENT LOAN 
           BILL and drops the bill in the trash with smirk. He opens 
           the fridge.

                                 SOL
                        Let’s think about dinner. 

           Jenn slams the fridge door closed.

                                 JENN
                        I can’t just act normal right now! 
                        I can’t! 

                                 SOL
                        No. You can’t.

           He hugs her and talks in a soft, reassuring voice. 

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        Because... you’re not normal, 
                        Jenn. You’ve never been normal. 

           Sol hugs her tight. He strokes her hair. 

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        In fact, any time you’ve tried to 
                        act normal -- it just comes off as 
                        really weird. Really. Not normal.

           Jenn laughs over his shoulder until she notices the SAVE 
           THE DATE CARD pinned on the fridge along with coupons and 
           photos. 

           She focuses on the date -- AUGUST 17TH.

           The calendar next to the fridge shows us -- it’s MARCH. 
           The math hits her. August is five months away.

           INT. LEGENDS SPORTS BAR PUB - DAY

           Dave and Kyle share Nachos. They look greasy and goopy.
                                 DAVE
                        Look at this glop. They’re not 
                        even trying anymore.  

           Dave is disgusted but eats the nachos anyway. Sol walks 
           in and they wave him over. 

                                 KYLE
                        Late.

                                 SOL
                        I got caught up.

                                 DAVE 
                        You want some gross nachos? 

           Kyle picks up the pitcher and pours a glass for Sol. Half-
           way through pouring -- he stops when he sees Sol’s 
           expression. 

           INT. INDEPENDENT BOOKSTORE - DAY

           Amanda and Megan wander around the aisles of the 
           bookstore. 

           Purple Hair is drumming on her coffee cup with two 
           pencils. Jenn walks in.

           Jenn walks down the aisle toward her friends. Her face 
           and slow stride can’t hide anything. She’s looks like 
           she’s going to collapse. 

           They drop their smiles and rush toward her.

           EXT. WEST SIDE MARKET - DAY

           Sol sits drinking coffee with his Mother and Father, Bev 
           and Arthur. The coffee has gone cold.

                                 BEV
                        They’re wrong. That’s all. 

                                 ARTHUR
                        Tell me exactly what he said.

                                 SOL
                        He said I start chemo tomorrow.

                                 BEV
                        A month ago he said you were fine!

           Bev’s voice draws some attention from the shoppers.
                                 SOL
                        And I’m not.

                                 BEV
                        It can change so much so fast?

                                 ARTHUR
                        Beverly! We are where we are!

                                 BEV
                        Can’t they do surgery again?

                                 SOL
                        It’s in... too many places. 

           Sol sips the tea. Arthur holds back tears.

                                 ARTHUR
                        You’ve always been at your best 
                        when life picks a fight. You beat 
                        this once. You’ll go two and oh.

                                 BEV
                        I want Schiffrin’s exact words...

           Arthur sees the truth in Sol’s eyes.

           FLASHBACK:

           INT. DR. SCHIFFRIN’S OFFICE - DAY 

           The jar of Twizzlers is gone. Scans loom on a flat-screen 
           on the wall.

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        ... Anaplasia... which... it’s 
                        extraordinarily aggressive. This 
                        kind of growth is very rare.

           Sol looks at the SCANS. There are six different cloudy 
           forms on various x-rays.

                                 SOL
                        Which ones? That there?

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        Here. Here. And this one here. 
                        This cluster by your lymph nodes 
                        is troubling.

           Sol looks at his scans. Organs. Lungs. His partial liver. 
                                 SOL
                        Cluster?

           Schiffrin nods.

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        When we got your bloodwork back I 
                        knew it had spread but this level 
                        of... of...

                                 SOL
                        Aggression.

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        Extreme.

                                 SOL
                        Worst case scenario?

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        Worst? Three or four months. 

                                 SOL
                        Months? I feel fine!

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        Treatments are advanced. There are 
                        some new drugs on the way. I’ve 
                        seen miracles happen. 

                                 SOL
                                 (incredulous)
                        Is that what I need now? A 
                        miracle?

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        Medically speaking? You need two.

           Dr. Schiffrin stares at him. He’s not sugar coating.

           INT. LEGENDS SPORTS BAR - DAY

           Sol sits with a full beer in front of him. 

                                 KYLE
                        What kind of shitty doctor is he?!

                                 DAVE
                        How’s Jenn?
                                 SOL
                        She’s dealing. We’re putting the 
                        wedding on hold... for now. Just 
                        can’t... think about it.

                                 KYLE
                        My Dad lived with cancer for 
                        years!

           Dave looks like he could cry.

                                 DAVE
                        I’m so sorry, man. 

                                 KYLE
                        No! That doctor is going to be 
                        sorry! He screwed up! My cousin is 
                        an ambulance chaser. You’re suing. 
                        After they fix you -- you’re rich.

           Kyle swigs his beer. Full of anger. They sit in silence.

                                 DAVE
                        We still going to the fight on 
                        Sunday?

           Sol looks fully appreciative for the moment of normalcy.

                                 SOL
                        Yeah. Hold on to the tickets. Oh, 
                        by the way, we got a dog. Beagle. 
                        Otis.

                                 DAVE 
                        Ugh. Can you change his name?

                                 SOL
                        It would be a little rude. He’s 
                        nine.

           Kyle continues staring down at his beer.

           EXT. LAKE ERIE BEACH - DAY

           Jenn and Sol sit on a BLANKET on a chilly LAKE ERIE 
           beach. A LIGHTHOUSE looms in the distance. Weathered 
           lifeguard stands and driftwood pepper the windy beach.

                                 JENN
                        This is the spot?

           Sol is in good spirits.
                                 SOL
                        Every summer. Swimming. Bonfires. 
                        Hot dogs. Must have climbed those 
                        lighthouse steps a hundred times.

           Jenn looks up at the lighthouse.

                                 JENN
                        How many drunk Cap’n Crunches were 
                        crashing their boats on the beach 
                        before they needed to build a 
                        whole lighthouse? 

           Sol reminisces as he looks around.

                                 SOL
                        I had my first kiss right over 
                        there. By that shed.

                                 JENN
                        What was his name?

                                 SOL
                        Mitch.

           Jenn laughs. The wind picks up and chills her.

                                 JENN
                        We could have come here in the 
                        summer when it’s actually fun. 

                                 SOL
                        I wanted to see it with you -- no 
                        matter what.

           She takes a pause.

                                 JENN
                        We will be able to come in the 
                        summer. Together. 

                                 SOL
                        I know. 

                                 JENN
                        What. Was this a now or never 
                        thing? Bucket listing? That’s why 
                        we’re here?

           Sol picks up a rock and skips it across the water. 

                                 SOL
                        No. Maybe. This was a big place in 
                        my life before I met you. 
                        A lot of good memories. That’s 
                        all. We can go.

           He looks like he’s sinking into his new reality.

                                 JENN 
                        No, it’s cool. I’m glad we’re 
                        here. I just didn’t realize we 
                        were doing now or nevers already. 
                        Checking off boxes.

                                 SOL
                        We’re not.

                                 JENN
                        No! This is good timing! I... 
                        never swam in Lake Erie before and 
                        that’s been on my now or never 
                        list forever! 

                                 SOL
                        Jenn... 

                                 JENN
                        Ay! Just because you’re sick 
                        doesn’t mean you’re the only one 
                        who gets to do now or nevers! 
                        We’re in this together!

           Jenn takes off her shoes and coat then quickly strips 
           down to her UNDERWEAR.

                                 SOL
                        Stop. Jenn, I get it...

                                 JENN
                        Just a quick dip...

           Jenn squeals as she kicks off her underwear and runs down 
           the beach toward the water butt naked. A sexy run until 
           her ankle goes wobbly and she starts hopping on one foot.

                                 JENN (CONT’D)
                        Sharp rocks! Sharp rocks!

                                 SOL
                        We don’t have a towel!

           Sol’s mood flips to a smile as Jenn bravely rushes into 
           the lake. We expect a polar bear plunge -- but instead 
           she half stumbles into the surf and falls sideways.

           She flops around as she loses her footing and splashes 
           awkwardly -- hair in her face. She struggles to her feet.
                                 JENN
                        Holy shit! Fuck!

           Jenn stumbles out of the surf. Sol laughs. He grabs the 
           blanket and rushes to meet her. 

                                 SOL
                        I told you!!

                                 JENN
                                 (teeth chattering)
                        Add that to your lake memories.

                                 SOL
                        You’re shaking...

                                 JENN
                        No now or nevers, Sol. I want 
                        nows, please. For now. Only nows. 

                                 SOL
                        Only nows. 

                                 JENN
                        Warm me up. Right now.

           He wraps her up and rubs her shoulders warm. They start 
           walking to the car. Jenn keeps shivering.

                                 SOL
                        Marry me? 

                                 JENN
                        I will.

                                 SOL
                        I mean... soon? 

                                 JENN
                        Right now, the last thing we’re 
                        spending money on is a wedding.

                                 SOL
                        City Hall. Whatever. Be my wife.

           Jenn breaks the hug. She sees he’s serious.

                                 JENN
                        No. Not if it’s a now or never?

                                 SOL
                        It’s an always. 

           Sol hugs her close and keeps warming her up.
           INT. PICKWICK DINER - LATE MORNING

           Jenn and Sol sit in a booth looking over a brochure for 
           DJC FERTILITY and IVF. Sperm donation. Cryonics.

                                 JENN
                        How long should it take?

                                 SOL
                        Based on experience, a minute if 
                        I’m stressed out. If I’m bored and 
                        have the afternoon. Half hour? 

                                 JENN
                        Half hour?! That’s what you do 
                        when I’m at the library studying!?

           Sol shrugs and flips through the brochure. 

                                 SOL
                        Only on weekday-ends.

           Jenn laughs and shakes the salt shaker at Sol. The TIRED 
           WAITRESS from the opening montage approaches the table. 

                                 TIRED WAITRESS
                        What can I get you?

                                 SOL
                        I’d like a Western Omelette.

                                 JENN
                        Same.

                                 TIRED WAITRESS
                        Two Westerns. 

                                 SOL
                        Why do you have to copy me? Why 
                        can’t you get your own omelette?

                                 JENN
                        I can’t help it. I just have to 
                        have what you have. I’m obsessed.

                                 TIRED WAITRESS
                        Anything to drink?

           Sol stares at Jenn.

                                 SOL
                        Strawberry Milkshake.

                        Same.

                                 SOL
                        Yep. One scoop.

           Jenn pauses then calls his bluff.

                        Same. One scoop.

           The waitress, annoyed, shrugs and walks away.

           INT. PICKWICK DINER - MOMENTS LATER 

           Tired Waitress is putting a SPOONFUL OF RELISH into 
           strawberry milkshakes. WAITRESS #2 sees what she’s doing.

                                 WAITRESS #2
                        What are you doing?

                        Couple over there is screwing 
                        around. They’re on their second 
                        date or something.

           Other Waitress looks over at Jenn and Sol’s booth.

                                 WAITRESS #2
                        Jenn and Sol? They’ve been coming 
                        in here for years.

           The Tired Waitress watches Jenn and Sol laughing. Sol 
           takes her hands from across the table. He gives her a 
           kiss on her knuckles. She punches his face a little.

           Our Tired Waitress watches them playing playfully until 
           she can’t watch anymore.
           INT. SPERM BANK WAITING ROOM - LATER

           Jenn flips through a magazine. Sol fills out some 
           information on a clipboard then hands it to the nurse 
           behind the desk. She looks it over quickly.

                        need one. That’s all.

           Jenn leads Sol into the donation room. 

           INT. SPERM BANK DONATION ROOM - LATER

           A worn PLEATHER CHAIR sits in the center of the room. Sol 
           thumbs through the porn library and holds up a hardcore 
           S&M VIDEO. 

                                 JENN
                        Seriously?? You don’t even like 
                        wearing a belt.

                        It’s just weird that it’s here. 
                        Maybe I don’t need a video.

           Sol looks nervous.

                                 JENN 
                        How do you usually do it?

                        down on this floor unless I can 
                        scan it with a black light.

           Sol grimaces at the sparkling clean floor.

                                 JENN
                        It’s a clinic! Not a booth in 
                        Amsterdam! 

           Sol notices the CLOSED DOOR doesn’t go all the way to the 
           floor. There’s a 3-inch gap. When people pass by we see 
           their foot shadows.

                                 SOL
                        I’m just saying it’s weird! Maybe 
                        you should wait outside. 

           Jenn is fed up. She hands him the SPERM DONATION CUP and 
           takes out her phone. 

                                 JENN
                        Sit down.

                        Sit. Now. 

           Sol obediently sits in the chair. Jenn puts on the song 
           RIGHT THURR by Chingy and puts her phone down. She shuts 
           off the overhead light and starts to dance like a 
           stripper. Sol lights up.

                        married this summer when they got 
                        devastating news. Solomon, who was 
                        previously diagnosed with liver 
                        cancer... found out his cancer had

                        Solomon Chau has been working as a 
                        chef at Pepper & Salt. He was to 
                        get married right here on August 
                        17th. And then they got the tragic

                        Because Sol’s prognosis is not 
                        good -- they decided to postpone 
                        their outdoor wedding and get 
                        married at City Hall. With their 
                        medical bills and student loans 
                        they had no money for a new

                        Shoes aren’t about how they look --
                        they’re about how you feel. How do 
                        you feel in those?

                        I like those shoes. What do you 
                        think?

           Shy Girl’s Mom, also trying on shoes, notices Sol talking 
           to her daughter.

                        She’s very shy.

           Sol nods and watches Amanda and Megan argue with Jenn 
           over her shoes. Sol quietly talks to the girl.

                        I used to be shy too. Really shy.

                        And hold my breath. 

           Sol starts quietly singing Katy Perry’s Roar.

                        Scared to rock the boat and make a

           Sol sighs quietly. She’s listening.Shy Girl’s Mom shows 
           her daughter a pair of shoes.

                                 SHY GIRL’S MOM
                        Do you like these shoes?

           Shy Girl doesn’t answer. Sol continues softly singing.

                        So I sit quietly, agree politely. 
                        I guess that I forgot I had a 
                        choice. I let you push me past the 
                        breaking point. I stood for 
                        nothing, so I fell for ever-y-
                        thing.

           Sol can see the girl knows the Katy Perry song. Jenn 
           clops around in another pair of wobbly heels.

                                 SOL  (CONT’D) 
                        One day being shy just went away. 
                        Like a cold. Poof.

           Sol WHISPERS quietly to her. Shy Girl looks up at him. 

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        Wanna see how not shy I am now?

           Sol pops up and SINGS loudly to the entire store. He 
           dances a little.

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        I got the eye of the tiger, a 
                        fighter, dancing through the fire! 
                        'Cause I am a champion and you're 
                        gonna hear me roar! Oh oh oh oh oh 
                        oh oh! Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh! Oh oh 
                        oh oh oh oh oh! You’re gonna hear 
                        me roar!

                                 SHOE SALESPERSON
                        Sir! Please!
           Sol nods and sits down like nothing happened. He thumbs 
           though a magazine. Everyone stares at the skinny weird 
           man who just had a Katy outburst.

           Shy Girl’s Mother nervously hustles her away from Sol. 
           The girl smiles at Sol as they head to the door. It’s her 
           first smile since we’ve seen her. 

           Sol smiles back -- but we can tell the spontaneous 
           performance took a lot out of him. He sits down.

           INT. STONE CASTLE - EVENT SPACE - DAY

           We hear the echo of footsteps on a stone floor.

           Jenn and Sol enter a room with tall, old windows and 
           impressive chandeliers. 

           They’re accompanied by JEROME WEST (30) who is wearing a 
           colorful pocket square and shiny saddle shoes. 

                                 JEROME
                        We had a last minute cancellation. 
                        You’re very lucky. 

                                 SOL
                        We feel very lucky.

                                 JEROME
                        Kids were throwing a 50th 
                        anniversary party for their 
                        parents. Fighting about money the 
                        whole time. Fast forward Thursday 
                        check bounces to the ceiling. 

                                 JENN
                        That’s terrible.

                                 JEROME
                        Not for you though! Look at this 
                        space! This room is usually booked 
                        a year in advance. This a baby 
                        rush? 

                                 JENN
                        A what?

                                 JEROME
                        Preggers? Cooking up?

           Jerome points to Jenn’s belly.
                                 JENN
                        Do I look pregnant?

                                 JEROME
                        No. Maybe. Couple months in? 
                        Pregnant brides’ either want that 
                        big fat belly or no belly. That 
                        five month poochy pouch is what no 
                        bride wants. 

                                 JENN
                        I’m not pregnant!

                                 SOL
                        We were supposed to get married in 
                        August. I just started chemo. It 
                        stepped up our plans. 

           Jerome looks Sol up and down and shrugs.

                                 JEROME
                        My Aunt had chemo like twenty 
                        years back. Cancer. Both boobs. 
                        Old Gal got busted swiping 
                        lipstick from Sephora just last 
                        week. You’ll be okay. Let’s talk 
                        menu.

                                 SOL
                        We’d like to handle it ourselves. 
                        If that’s possible...

                                 JEROME
                        We do have a full kitchen with...

                                 JENN
                        Sol is a chef. We’d like to design 
                        the menu and bring in our own 
                        people. Can we use the kitchen?

                                 JEROME
                        Have at it. Honestly, this place 
                        is beautiful -- but the chefs here 
                        got no game. They think Old Bay is 
                        an exotic spice.

           Jerome continues the tour. You can tell he can talk all 
           day. Jenn and Sol hold hands as the walk across the dance 
           floor following Jerome. They marvel at the space.
           INT. MEN’S BOUTIQUE SUIT SHOP - DAY

           Sol, now with a clean shaved head, and Dave look at 
           various BLACK SUITS. Dave takes one off the rack and 
           hands it to Sol. Sol looks at the price tag.

                                 SOL
                        This suit is fifteen hundred 
                        dollars. 

                                 DAVE
                        People donated to your wedding. 
                        It’s not like you’re stealing from 
                        charity.

                                 SOL
                        Most of that money is going to 
                        medical bills. 

           Sol puts it back and checks out price tags on the suits.

                                 DAVE
                        It’s your wedding. You don’t want 
                        to look like a schlub.

                                 SOL
                        This one is six hundred. 

           Sol slips it on. It hangs TOO BIG on his skinny frame. 
           Sol sees he’s lost weight.

                                 DAVE
                        Is that a 42?

           Dave’s CELLPHONE dings. 

                                 SOL 
                        Let’s look at 40’s.

           Dave glances at his phone then starts angrily texting. 

                                 DAVE
                        What a dick.

                                 SOL 
                        Kyle cancel again?

                                 DAVE
                        Oh? Pussy Kyle? Yeah. Hung up at 
                        work.

                                 SOL
                        I was gonna guess he’d no-show 
                        again.
                                 DAVE
                        What the hell with him??

                                 SOL
                        His Dad had bone cancer.

                                 DAVE
                        So? His Dad was an asshole!

                                 SOL
                        The guy is dead. 

                                 DAVE
                        Still an asshole. Just because 
                        he’s dead I have to be nice? 

                                 SOL
                        Six hundred still seems like a lot 
                        for a suit I’ll wear once.

                                 DAVE
                        C’mon man. You’ll wear it more 
                        than once. 

           Sol takes another look at the suit.

                                 SOL
                        I guess that’s true. Probably 
                        twice.

           Sol waves the tailor over as Dave realizes what Sol means 
           by twice.

           INT. JENN AND SOL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jenn and Sol sit on the couch eating pizza. Behind them 
           there’s a small army of prescription bottles on the 
           kitchen table. Jenn is working on the seating chart.

                                 JENN
                        So my mom and your parents at the 
                        same table with my brother and 
                        grandparents all together.

           Jenn watches Sol take a bite of pizza and chew.

                                 JENN (CONT’D) 
                        Anything? 

           Sol chews like an annoyed cow. He talks through the chew.

                                 SOL
                        Texture and metal.
           He tosses the pizza back in the box. 

                                 JENN
                        They said the Cytotoxan might dull 
                        your taste buds.

                                 SOL
                        Dull? Try murder.

                                 JENN
                        I’m sorry.

           Sol simmers.

                                 SOL
                        I got every single side effect! 
                        Every one! The sores in my throat! 
                        Stomach pains. Migraines. And 
                        shaky shit with my hand...

                                 JENN
                        They said they can control that.

                                 SOL
                        With another med?! With more side 
                        effects??

                                 JENN
                        If it helps... quality of life..

           Sol kicks the table.

                                 SOL
                        Quality of life?? What life?! I’m 
                        just dying. And on the way down 
                        everything... everything I love 
                        snatched away from me?

                                 JENN
                        The clinical trial is happening 
                        this summer.

                                 SOL
                        There’s no guarantee I get that 
                        drug! Clinical trials include 
                        placebos! That’s how they work!

           Jenn’s eyes fill with tears. She’s breaking.

                                 JENN
                        I know... Just... Hold on.
                                 SOL
                        And as an extra bonus, I get to 
                        see your face like that. Looking 
                        at me the way you’re looking at me 
                        now. Your face.

                                 JENN
                        This face... it’s love. No matter 
                        how it looks. It’s love.

           Jenn leans in to hug him. He reaches to take another 
           slice of pizza and changes his mind. Disgusted.

                                 SOL
                        I can’t even enjoy a fucking 
                        pizza!?! What is the point 
                        already?!

                                 JENN
                        There’s a point... We just...

                                 SOL
                        I can’t taste anything, Jenn! I 
                        have five senses! Take the other 
                        four! I’m a chef! Take sight! Take 
                        my hearing!

           Sol sobs. Jenn gets on top of him. Takes control.

                                 JENN
                        Whoa! Sol! Taste is gone! Fine. 
                        But if it took your hearing, you 
                        wouldn’t hear my voice right now. 
                        Right?

           Sol ignores her. Jenn shoves the pizza box away. 

                                 JENN (CONT’D) 
                        Look at me! Right?!

           Sol looks at her and nods.

                                 JENN (CONT’D)
                        And if it took your sight - you 
                        wouldn’t be able to see this 
                        smile. 

           Jenn locks on a GAME-SHOW SMILE. Sol won’t look at her.

                                 JENN (CONT’D) 
                        Look at these chompers, Sol.

           She bobs and weaves in his face until he looks at her. 
           When he sees her goofy smile -- he begrudgingly laughs.
                                 JENN (CONT’D) 
                        And if it took touch -- you 
                        couldn’t feel this. Feel me. Feel 
                        these.

           She puts his hands on her. He feels her hips. Her 
           breasts. 

                                 JENN (CONT’D) 
                        And if it took smell... You 
                        couldn’t... smell... umm...

           Jenn is smiling with tears in her eyes. 

                                 JENN (CONT’D)
                        Smell my new... coconut shampoo! I 
                        don’t know!! I guess smell can go 
                        first!

           Sol laughs. He’s back. He smells her hair.

                                 SOL
                        I like coconut.

           Jenn pulls him up off of the couch. 

                                 JENN
                        And stand up. We need to practice. 
                        Teach me... C’mon. 

           Without music, they SLOW DANCE. At first they sway then 
           Sol starts to lead. He spins her. Hope restored.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

           Jenn and Sol walk down the hallway. Sol walks slowly. He 
           wears his knit cap and UFC sweatshirt which is now far 
           too big.

           They pass the HUNCHED OLD MAN walking the other way. A 
           NURSE walking beside the old man holds a box of stuff 
           from his wife’s room. Books. Tea. Sol recognizes him.

                                 SOL
                        Ay! See you in China one day?

           The Old Man stops walking. He recognizes Sol but it stops 
           him in his tracks. Sol is HALF THE MAN he met before.

                                 JENN
                        Who was that?
           The Old Man is left standing in the hall. He watches Sol 
           walk slowly with his wife.

           INT. DR. SCHIFFRIN’S OFFICE - LATER

           Jenn and Sol look voided of emotion as Schiffrin gives 
           them the update. 

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        ... progress isn’t what we hoped. 
                        No substantial changes. 

                                 SOL
                        So what’s next?

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        If you want to continue with 
                        treatment...

                                 SOL
                        I do.

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        Good. I’m going to up the dosage 
                        of the Doxorubicin at home then we 
                        can begin radiation next week.

           Sol nods. He’s locked in all the way to the end.

                                 JENN
                        And the clinical trial?

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        Still on schedule for PEN-866. 
                        First on the list this summer.

                                 SOL
                        When can we start radiation?

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        You have a wedding this weekend. 
                        But we can start Monday...

                                 JENN
                        Sol insisted we get away for a 
                        quick honeymoon -- let’s say 
                        Wednesday.

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        Great! Where you headed?
                                 SOL
                        It’s a surprise. Only a two hour 
                        drive. 

                                 JENN
                        I’m excited. 

           Sol takes Jenn’s hand and squeezes it. 

                                 SOL
                        Where’s the licorice?

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        I put it out on good news days. 

                                 SOL
                        When I see it again I’m taking 
                        six.

                                 JENN
                        Is there anything else we can be 
                        doing?

           Schiffrin starts writing out prescriptions.

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        There are some questions that are 
                        very hard to ask, Jenn. Ask them. 
                        Be open.

                                 JENN
                        I can’t think of anything else to 
                        ask you right now.

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        Not questions for me. For Sol. 

           Dr. Schiffrin rips the SCRIPT off his pad.

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN (CONT’D) 
                        But I suggest only one a day. 
                        There are side effects.

           Jenn takes the prescription. 

           INT. CHEMOTHERAPY ROOM - DAY 

           Sol sits in the comfy chemo chair with Jenn next to him. 
           Otis, proudly sporting his yellow vest, at his feet. Sol 
           is reading the side of the IV bag. 
                                 SOL
                        Mechlorethamine, Cyclophosphamide, 
                        Ethylenimines, Busulfan. 

           A nurse checks the line. 

                                 NURSE
                        Saturday’s the big day?

                                 SOL
                        It is. Good thing I’m here. Can’t 
                        get married this weekend without 
                        my Bus-ul-fan. Stuff is like 
                        liquid viagra. 

           Another CHEMO PATIENT, the COLLEGE FRESHMAN, sees Otis at 
           his feet. He shoes the dog away with his foot.

                                 FRESHMAN
                        You’re lucky. Mine has been dead 
                        to the world since surgery.

           Jenn flips through a WEDDING TO-DO LIST. 

                                 SOL
                        What are you in for?

                                 FRESHMAN
                        Testicular. They said limp noodle 
                        is not uncommon after they take 
                        one. Extra bonus for me. 

                                 SOL
                        Ouch. That sucks.

                                 FRESHMAN
                        One ball for the rest of my life. 
                        I have to live with that shit. 
                        Believe that? Bout you?

                                 SOL
                        Full house. 

           Sol draws a circular motion around his torso. 

                                 FRESHMAN
                        Oh man. I’m sorry.

                                 SOL 
                        What are you gonna do? 

           Sol holds the FRESHMAN’S STARE for a few beats. 
                                 SOL (CONT’D) 
                        What are you going to do?

           Jenn taps Sol on his leg then points to her NOTEPAD.

                                 JENN
                        Focus Sol. I’m picking up your 
                        suit later today. Neil is getting 
                        a kitchen tour this afternoon. 
                        Duck and octopus have been 
                        ordered. Oh! We gotta talk about 
                        the videographers... 

           Sol watches at the YELLOW CHEMICALS flowing into his arm. 

                                 SOL
                        Can we... not talk about the 
                        wedding? I’m burnt. Talk about 
                        something else. How about... our 
                        first wedding anniversary? 

           Jenn snuggles up to him. She plays along. Sol closes his 
           eyes.

                                 JENN
                        Okay. Where do you want to be in a 
                        year? 

                                 SOL
                        A beach. Oahu. Wearing only a red 
                        Speedo and tanning oil.

                                 JENN
                        Oh God. No Speedo, please. 

                                 SOL
                        Too late. It has been said. So it 
                        is so.

                                 JENN
                        No tanning oil either -- you’ll be 
                        wearing SPF 9000 thank you.

           Sol closes his eyes weathering the storm of chemicals. 
           The Freshman looks at the couple deeply in love. 

           INT. JENN AND SOL’S HONDA ACCORD - LATER

           Jenn drives. The rhythm of the windshield wipers is 
           hypnotic. The streets spattered with reflected colors. 
           Sol puts his head back against the headrest.
                                 SOL
                        Wake me when we get there.

                                 JENN
                        You okay?

                                 SOL
                        Yeah. Tired.

           Jenn takes a long look at him. She watches his breathing 
           as he falls asleep. 

                                 JENN 
                        Can’t believe I’m marrying some 
                        random dude I met in a sports bar.

                                 SOL
                        Dreams can come true.

           Sol takes shallow breaths. He draws a HEART on the fogged 
           PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW.

                                 JENN
                        It’s me and you, Solomon Chau. 
                        Always.

           She stops at a RED LIGHT. The streets glisten red.

                                 SOL 
                        Always.

           Jenn laughs as she watches him quickly fall asleep. The 
           light turns GREEN. The streets sparkle emerald.

           EXT. OLD STONE CASTLE - MORNING

           An CHALKBOARD EASEL with calligraphy writing welcomes us 
           to JENN & SOL’S WEDDING -- APRIL 11TH.

           The place is buzzing. Valets work the parking. 
           VIDEOGRAPHER #1 records the incoming guests.

           We see Sol’s Parents. Roger and a trashy date. Kids. 
           Cousins. Kyle, on his own, looking uncomfortable. 
           Familiar faces from the restaurant and sports bar.

           There’s a couple LOCAL NEWS VANS parked outside. 
           Reporters report from a respectable distance.
           INT. OLD STONE CASTLE - KITCHEN

           VIDEOGRAPHER #2 records Neil in the kitchen with a bunch 
           of helpers. He chops the head off a PLUCKED DUCK. We see 
           fresh octopus in a wooden crate.

                                 NEIL
                        ... everything we’re cooking here 
                        are Sol’s recipes. Appetizers and 
                        entrees. Just following orders.

           Neil reaches into a box and holds up a small octopus.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D) 
                        Along with beef carpaccio. We have 
                        his Charred Octopus appetizer. 

           He puts it back in the box and walks over to supervise 
           the line cooks preparing the duck.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D) 
                        Guests have a choice of entree. 
                        Salmon with Dill Oil or Seared 
                        Duck Breast with Orange Gastrique, 
                        Farro, Roasted Turnips...

           Neil gets a little smug.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D) 
                        Both of those plates are now part 
                        of the menu at the restaurant. 
                        I’ve never allowed menu changes 
                        before so...

           Neil notices one of the line cooks going off script.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D) 
                        Don’t chop the hazelnuts into 
                        dust. Just chop. Once. Twice and 
                        go...

           Neil steps in. The videographer focuses in on him 
           chopping.

           INT. GROOMSMAN SUITE - DAY

           VIDEOGRAPHER #1 is now in the suite with Dave, Sol’s 
           father, and Sol. 

           Sol is half-dressed. He wears a shirt with French cuffs, 
           socks and boxers. 
           Dave is dressed in a sharp suit but he still looks like a 
           bit of a slob. He talks to the camera.

                                 DAVE
                        Here’s the groom. Looking good. 
                        Look at that butt. Get a shot of 
                        it. Zoom in close. 

           Dave points at Sol’s butt.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Can you not, Dave?

           Jerome walks in with Sol’s shoes. They’re polished. 

                                 JEROME
                        Where can I set these down?

                                 SOL
                        Anywhere. 

           He sets them down on a chair. The videographer films the 
           shoes. Zooming in.

                                 JEROME
                        Can I steal the Best Man? I just 
                        want to walk you through this once 
                        more, David.

                                 DAVE
                        You good, Sol?

                                 SOL
                        Yah go. I can handle my pants.

                                 DAVE
                        Careful with the zip. Don’t snag 
                        your frank. It’ll ruin the 
                        honeymoon.

           Dave and the videographer leave with Jerome. Sol is alone 
           with his Dad.

                                 ARTHUR
                        How you feeling?

                                 SOL
                        Good now. I just don’t want to get 
                        tired too early. 

           Arthur helps put his jacket on his son. Sol goes to tie 
           his TIE and misses the knot. 
                                 ARTHUR
                        You’ll find the energy.

           Sol’s hands have a nervous tremor. Arthur takes over and 
           loops the tie over his neck and begins tying it. 

                                 SOL
                        Do you ever wish you did more?

                                 ARTHUR
                        More what? 

                                 SOL
                        Everything. Like do you wish you 
                        did something else? Something... 
                        that did more... 

                                 ARTHUR
                        More than Arthur Chau Home and 
                        Office Carpeting offering the best 
                        service, latest styles, guaranteed 
                        next day service -- now fresh out 
                        of bankruptcy?

           Arthur struggles with the tie. He starts it over.

                                 SOL
                        I’m not taking over the business, 
                        y’know.

                                 ARTHUR 
                        You were never going to. Once you 
                        turned five all you wanted to do 
                        is be in the kitchen with your 
                        Mom.

                                 SOL
                        I mean, don’t you wish you were 
                        leaving something behind. 
                        Something... people remember. 

                                 ARTHUR
                        My son is getting married. That’s 
                        all I need to think about today.

                                 SOL
                        I always thought I would have some  
                        legacy. Write a cookbook or... 
                        open a restaurant. Build 
                        something.
                                 ARTHUR
                        Today is what is in front of you. 
                        You’re here. Marrying an amazing 
                        woman. Be in this moment. 

                                 SOL
                        I know.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Some people end up changing the 
                        world. Good for them. But to get a 
                        gift in life like that bride out 
                        there? No legacy, no building, no 
                        book is ever going to beat that.

           Arthur ties the knot in the tie. He looks at his son in 
           the mirror reflection. It’s a peaceful break. A hush.

           INT. BRIDAL SUITE - SIMULATANEOUS

           The bridal suite is in FULL CHAOS. Music plays loudly.  
           Jenn is sitting in a chair in her bridal lingerie. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Use seltzer!!

           Amanda and Megan are screaming at each other. Hope has 
           her daughter’s wedding dress in the bathroom sink.

                                 MEGAN
                        It’s just rosé! It doesn’t stain!

                                 AMANDA
                        What are you talking about!? Rosé  
                        is half red wine!

                                 MEGAN
                        It’s diluted!!

           Hope yells from the bathroom.

                                 HOPE
                        It’s coming out! Everyone relax!! 
                        Get the hair dryer!

                                 JENN
                        As long as the stain isn’t on my 
                        butt! I don’t care!

                                 HOPE
                        You do care! You don’t want a 
                        stain!
                                 AMANDA
                        Get salt!

                                 MEGAN
                        It’s not going to stain!! 

           Megan pours herself another glass of wine. Amanda takes 
           it from her hand.

                                 AMANDA
                        Nuh uh. No more wine. Don’t you 
                        need to rehearse? You don’t want 
                        to screw up and embarrass 
                        yourself.

                                 JENN
                        Stop making her nervous!!

                                 AMANDA
                        She’s already nervous! I’m trying 
                        to bring it full circle!

                                 MEGAN
                        I’m not nervous!!!

           Jenn smiles at the scene. Her wedding dress in the sink 
           and Megan and Amanda arguing. 

           INT. OLD STONE CASTLE - MAIN ROOM - LATER

           The room looks beautiful. The flowers and centerpieces on 
           point. Glasses sparkling. A page out of one of Jenn’s 
           wedding books come to life.

           Sol stands proudly at the ALTAR and looks out at the 
           attendees. Dave stands by his side. 

           We notice Kyle in the crowd toward the back. 

           Amanda stands proudly to the other side of the altar. 
           Megan will be performing the ceremony.

           The two videographers pan across the room. Jerome stands 
           to the side speaking softly into a headset.

           A solo guitarist plays the JASON MRAZ song “I’m Yours” 
           and we turn our attention to the back of the room. 

           JENN IS THERE. Full smile. Confident. Eyes only on Sol. 
           She is in the same GLITTERY GOWN she admired in the 
           wedding magazine but she wears her SAGE CONVERSE.
           Walking down the aisle at her side is OTIS -- in a little 
           bow tie. Everyone stands. Mobile phones rise. Jenn drifts 
           toward Sol.

           INT. WEDDING ALTAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Jenn holds Sol’s hands in both of hers. Dave holds Otis’s 
           leash. Amanda smiles proudly. Megan begins:

                                 MEGAN
                        Thank you all so much for joining 
                        Jenn and Sol on this special day. 
                        I’ve been friends with Jenn since 
                        tenth grade. Those of you that 
                        know me would not be surprised to 
                        learn that I spilled wine on her 
                        wedding dress a half hour ago. 

                                 JENN
                        You can barely see the stain.

           The crowd laughs. A hush comes over the room -- they wait 
           for Megan to continue.

                                 MEGAN 
                        In all of my days, I have never 
                        known a couple whose love is as 
                        fearless as Jenn and Sol’s...

           Her voice cracks, then she gathers herself.

                                 MEGAN (CONT’D) 
                        Where other couples would have 
                        fallen apart, Jenn and Sol built a 
                        foundation.

           Megan sob... 

                                 JENN
                        It’s okay.

           She gathers her composure. 

                                 MEGAN
                        We know, when we see these two up 
                        here... we see two fighters. Who 
                        everyday... fight to... 

           Megan loses it. She breaks down sobbing.

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh my God... Seriously?!?
           Amanda steps up and snatches the cards from her. Megan 
           happily gives up the honor and steps aside.

                                 MEGAN
                        Thank you. So sorry...

           Amanda flips to the next card. Then the next. Then the 
           next. Then she puts the cards aside and improvises.

                                 AMANDA 
                        Not reading this! Sorry Megs. 
                        Look, today we’re all here to 
                        celebrate you two. Celebrate your 
                        lives. 

           Amanda speaks from the heart.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Every girl dreams of marrying a 
                        guy as solid as Sol. 

           Amanda takes a prolonged break. Trying to contain tears.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        And as brave as Sol. As 
                        passionate. And as much in love... 
                        as he is with you.

           Amanda breaks. Her tears flow. She gathers her emotions. 

                                 SOL
                        Oh God. Who else wants to give 
                        this a try?

           Everyone laughs.

                                 AMANDA 
                        You two can say how you feel 
                        better than I can. Read your vows. 
                        Let me off the hook.

           Jenn and Sol smile at each other as Amanda steps back.

                                 SOL
                        Should I go first?

           Jenn nods. Sol takes out a piece of PAPER. 

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        Jenn Carter. I know I’m not the 
                        easiest guy in the world to live 
                        with. I might have a few... 
                        annoying little quirks that get in 
                        our way.
           Sol shrugs. People laugh. Sol looks deeply at her.

                                 SOL (CONT’D) 
                        But I love you so much, so big and 
                        so completely. I vow that will 
                        never stop as long as I have 
                        breath. I vow to try and make you 
                        smile when it’s the last thing you 
                        want to do. 

           He takes a deep breath. The crowd hushes.

                                 SOL (CONT’D) 
                        I vow to practice dancing until 
                        we’re actually good at it (to the 
                        crowd) -- we’re really not there 
                        yet. Well, I am. She’s not. 

           Jenn shoves him. Sol goes back to reading.

                                 SOL (CONT’D) 
                        You are a gift. You are hope to 
                        me. You are and this is -- 
                        everything I need -- for my life. 

           Sol squats down to Otis.

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        And you, little man, I vow to cook 
                        chicken for you as often as I can -
                        - because even though I’m talking 
                        to a dog on my wedding day -- 
                        you’ve made life easier for us. 

           Jenn gives Otis a kiss too.

                                 SOL (CONT’D) 
                        I love you Jenn Carter. Always. 
                        With all I that I have. All of me. 
                        All I am.

           Jenn bursts out a sob filled with happiness. Fully 
           wrecked. Hope rushes up and hands her a handkerchief and 
           then hustles back to her seat. 

           Jenn takes a deep breath -- and reads her vows. 

                                 JENN 
                        Solomon Chau. When I first met you 
                        -- I’d love to say it was love at 
                        first sight. But it wasn’t. It was 
                        sort of like at first sight. 
                        That probably had something to do 
                        with the fact that you were happy 
                        hour drinking tequila, watching a 
                        MMA fight and barely paying 
                        attention to me.

                                 SOL
                        It was a big fight! 

                                 JENN
                        But once we started talking... you 
                        may have well have told me you hit 
                        a duck with a moped. There was 
                        nobody else for me.

           Sol is the only person in the room who gets the joke.

                                 JENN (CONT’D) 
                        I knew there would be an Us. And 
                        by the first time we walked the 
                        farmer’s market I realized that 
                        our Us was the Us -- I always 
                        hoped to find. 

           She takes a moment -- then turns the page.

                                 JENN (CONT’D)
                        An Us where I can not only be 
                        myself -- but with you... through 
                        you... be my best self. And I’m 
                        always learning from you. To be 
                        passionate. Passionate about life. 
                        Passionate about food. Passionate 
                        about time. Passionate about you.

           Sol smiles through proud tears. 

           INT. COCKTAIL HOUR - LATER

           A JAZZ QUARTET PLAYS music from the 1930’s.

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        And there’s never any place I’d 
                        rather be than standing by you. 
                        Our now. It’s me and you, Solomon 
                        Chau. Always.

           Laughter and clinking glasses. Delicious appetizers spin 
           out of the kitchen. Wine and liquor flows. 

           Bev and Arthur talk with Hope. Dave talks with Kyle. Kyle 
           looks ashamed. Dave is really laying into him.
           Jerome stands off to the side wearing his headset. 
           Orchestrating the occasion. Amanda and Megan talk with 
           THREE WELL-DRESSED MEN. 

           Jenn and Sol enter holding hands. The place erupts with 
           applause as they walk through the room all smiles.

           INT. WEDDING RECEPTION - LATER

           Jenn and Sol sit at their table together. Untouched 
           plates of duck sit in front of them. Everything looks 
           delicious.

           Wedding guests stop by with hugs, best wishes and small 
           talk. Sol talks to an ELDERLY COUPLE.

                                 SOL
                        How’s the food? Food okay?

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                        Delicious. She wouldn’t try the 
                        octopus.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        I find them to be too... 

           The woman wiggles her fingers at Sol. Jenn talks with a 
           BIG HAIRED WOMAN.

                                 BIG HAIRED WOMAN
                        This dress is to die for, Jenn. 
                        Who’s the designer?

                                 JENN
                        Marcheesa. Marchesa. Something 
                        like that.

           The Big-Haired Woman puts on her reading glasses.

                                 BIG HAIRED WOMAN
                        (whispers) Well, your breasts look 
                        spectacular who knew you had such 
                        boobs?

                                 JENN
                        Major bra tricks at play here. 
                        Trust me.

           The line of guests moves along. 

                                 SOL
                        Be right back.
           Jenn notices Sol looks tired.

                                 JENN
                        You okay??

                                 SOL
                        Just have to call my girlfriend. 

                                 JENN
                        Tell her I say hi.

           Jenn smacks his butt as he gets up. He moves through the 
           crowd nodding and smiling as he passes by his guests.

           Jenn watches him concerned. She sees he’s walking slowly.

           EXT. OLD STONE CASTLE - MEN’S ROOM - LATER

           Sol looks in the mirror. In the harsh bathroom light we 
           see he looks gaunt and pale. He splashes water on his 
           face.

           We notice there’s only a HAND DRYER on the wall. No paper 
           towels. He stands there with a dripping face when Kyle 
           walks in.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh. Hey man.

                                 SOL
                        You see any towels in here?

                                 KYLE
                        No. I can go ask if you...

           Sol walks over to the hand dryer and squats down with the 
           grace of an old man. He pushes the loud hand dryer button 
           and points it face upward -- eyes closed. Drying his 
           face.

           He yells over the blower.

                                 SOL
                        Having a good time?? 

                                 KYLE
                        Great. This came together awesome. 
                        The food is pretty standard fare 
                        though.

                                 SOL
                        Next time more Mrs. Dash.
                                 KYLE
                        Jenn looks amazing.

                                 SOL
                        She’ll do. Y’know. Starter wife.

           The hand dryer goes off. Sol reaches up and hits it one 
           more time. It drowns out Kyle’s voice. 

                                 KYLE
                        Sol, I just want...

                                 SOL
                        You’re going to tell me you 
                        freaked out because you watched 
                        your Dad die and to watch someone 
                        else -- fight cancer was too much 
                        and you’re so sorry for not being 
                        stronger when you were needed 
                        most.

                                 KYLE
                        Yes. I ... Yes.

                                 SOL
                        And now, I’m left with two 
                        choices. Remember every other time 
                        you stepped up as a friend and 
                        forgive you. Give you a pass.

           The hand dryer goes off and Sol holds out his hand for an 
           assist in standing up. Kyle helps him stand up. Sol 
           grunts as he gets to his feet.

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        Or I tell you to go fuck yourself 
                        because you don’t get second 
                        chances sometimes. Trust me.

                                 KYLE
                        I am asking for forgiveness.

                                 SOL
                        Let’s leave it to fate.

           Sol takes out a QUARTER. 

                                 KYLE
                        What?

                                 SOL
                        Heads. You’re totally forgiven as 
                        if it never happened. Tails. 
                        I’ll tell you to fuck yourself -- 
                        and let those be my last words to 
                        you. 

           He flips it and slaps it on his wrist. Sol is dead 
           serious. He peels away his hand revealing the coin. 

           Kyle peers under his palm...

           INT. WEDDING RECEPTION - NIGHT

           Jenn and Sol’s WEDDING SONG comes on. 

           They meet in the middle of the dance floor. Friends and 
           family form a circle around them. We see Kyle front and 
           center. Cheering. Forgiven.

           Jenn and Sol take a moment to be in each other’s arms.

                                 SOL
                        Let me lead?

                                 JENN
                        No shoving.

           They dance. Clumsy but beautiful. They slow dance Sol’s 
           way. Then Jenn throws her arms around him. They sway.

                                 JENN (CONT’D) 
                        This is the moment. This is all I 
                        wanted. This.

           Jenn brings his ear close to her mouth and whispers.

                                 JENN (WHISPERING) 
                        Your Aunt told me my boobs looked 
                        spectacular.

                                 SOL
                        Yah! Look at them!

           Jenn holds him tight.

                                 JENN
                        This is our now. I love this now.

           The circle tightens around them as they dance.
           EXT. CLEVELAND PARK - NIGHT

           Jenn and Sol sit on a bench by the SMITH GLASSHOUSE at 
           the CLEVELAND BOTANICAL GARDENS. Jenn in her rumpled 
           wedding dress with Sol’s TUX JACKET over her shoulders. 

                                 SOL
                        What was your favorite part?

                                 JENN
                        All of it. Every bit. 

           They look at the plants growing inside the foggy glass 
           house. Sol is definitely exhausted. 

                                 SOL
                        If I could stop time, I’d stop it 
                        right now. I’d let this night go 
                        on for years. Rewind and re-play.

           An old couple walks by and sees Jenn in her wedding 
           dress.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Congratulations you two!

                                 JENN
                        Thanks so much!

           They watch the couple slowly stroll past the greenhouse. 

                                 SOL
                        We should go.

           Sol tries to push himself up off the bench and flops back 
           down again. Jenn helps him up on the second try.

                                 JENN
                        I got you.

           They walk slowly together. Like the elderly couple.

                                 SOL
                        You know, I legally own you now. 

                                 JENN
                        Oh yeah?

                                 SOL
                        Yeah. It’s all in the paperwork. 
                        Technically your family is 
                        supposed to give me something like 
                        four goats but I’m cutting them 
                        slack.
                                 JENN
                        Aww man... I love goats.

           They turn the corner. We turn to the night sky. Night 
           turns to morning...

           EXT. OHIO AMISH COUNTRY - MORNING

           A few GOATS stand around near some hay. 

           We’re transported to a farm in OHIO’S AMISH COUNTRY. 
           Blasting with natural colors. Flowers. Rolling hills. 

           A cow chews some thick grass. Chickens chase each other. 
           A horse’s eye winks away a fly. We suspect this is a 
           dream. Butterflies flutter. Bees zip. 

           Then a BUGGY trots by with Jenn and Sol in the back. Sol 
           wears an Amish straw hat.

           EXT. AMISH FARM - DAY

           Jenn and Sol stand together by a wooden corral watching a 
           family of goats. The goats watch them back. 

           Sol looks worse -- as if he was keeping up appearances 
           through the wedding -- but now the disease has fully set 
           in. His body is letting go.

                                 SOL
                        I think I could go Amish. Simple 
                        lifestyle. Simple fashion style.

                                 JENN
                        You’d totally burn out on it after 
                        a couple weeks.

                                 SOL
                        I don’t know. Hard day’s work. 
                        Pride in the land. Every night... 
                        fresh cabbage stew or whatever.

                                 JENN
                        No internet. No Playstation. No 
                        way, Sol. And their clothes look 
                        itchy. You put on a wool sweater 
                        and act like you have poison ivy. 

           A goat walks over to Jenn. A DEEP SILENCE sets in.

                                 SOL 
                        You have a question?
                                 JENN 
                        Bad time? 

                                 SOL
                        Hit me.

           Jenn pets the goat. She won’t look at Sol.

                                 JENN
                        How do you want to be... 
                        forever... after...

                                 SOL
                        Cremated. I don’t want some place 
                        that becomes some source for 
                        guilt. Some rock. You’ll find a 
                        place to let me go.

           They watch the goat trot away. 

           INT. AMISH FARM - NIGHT

           Jenn and Sol sit at a dinner table with an AMISH FAMILY. 
           A full spread. Chickens, potatoes, salad, bread.

           An AMISH DAD (50), AMISH MOM (40) and three AMISH 
           DAUGHTERS (ages 7, 9, 11)

                                 JENN
                        We certainly didn’t expect... all 
                        this. Wow.

                                 AMISH MOTHER
                        Our pleasure. We didn’t expect 
                        anybody this weekend.

                                 SOL
                        It all looks delicious.

           Sol cuts into a piece of chicken.

                                 AMISH FATHER
                        We prefer to say grace first.

                                 SOL
                        Of course! I’m sorry.

           The Amish family bows their heads. Jenn and Sol join 
           them.

                                 AMISH FATHER
                        Dear Lord, thank you for this 
                        food. 
                        Bless the hands that prepared it. 
                        Bless it to our use and us to your 
                        service. And make us ever mindful 
                        of the needs of others. Through 
                        Christ our Lord we pray. 

                                 SOL
                        Amen!

           Sol picks up his fork and knife and starts cutting into a 
           piece of chicken.

                                 AMISH FATHER
                        Not done, Sir.

                                 SOL
                        Oh sorry. My God. Jesus. Sorry.

                                 AMISH MOTHER
                        Blessed be His name.

           Sol clanks his fork and knife down. He glances at Jenn 
           then puts his head down.

                                 AMISH FATHER
                        The eyes of all wait upon you, O 
                        God, And you give them their food 
                        in due season. You open wide your 
                        hand and fill all things living 
                        with plenteousness. 

           Sol glances at Jenn and sees she’s hysterically LAUGHING 
           in silence. Bouncing in her seat trying to contain it.  

                                 AMISH FATHER (CONT’D) 
                        Bless, O Lord, these gifts to our 
                        use and us in your service; 
                        relieve the needs of those in want 
                        and give us thankful hearts to...

           Jenn snorts loud. The Amish Father takes a pause. She 
           pretends it was a sneeze. Sol get infected and spits a 
           laugh.

           INT. AMISH BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jenn and Sol lay in bed. Scared. Blanket pulled up to 
           their chins. A bizarre painting of an OLD FARMER hangs on 
           the wall. 
           Distant animal noises drift in from outside. We can hear 
           the odd muffled voices of the family echoing in the 
           house. Heavy boot footsteps walk by their door and stop. 
           Then continue walking.

                                 SOL (WHISPERS)
                        Happy honeymoon, wife.

           They snuggle close. Nervously giggling. A loud thump 
           jolts them. Jenn gets up and puts a chair in front of the 
           door then scrambles back into bed. Running for cover. 

                                 JENN (WHISPERS)
                        Happy honeymoon, husband.

           He gives her a kiss. We hear a loud noise from the barn 
           outside. A squealing pig in the distance. They hold each 
           other in fear. 

           INT. RADIATION ROOM - DAY 

           Sol lays on a TABLE as a massive RADIATION MACHINE spins 
           around him. Red laser lights pulsate on a MESH MASK that 
           he wears over his face.

           Arthur, Bev, and Jenn wait on the other side of the 
           glass. The RADIOTHERAPIST sits at the CONTROL BOARD. He 
           pushes down a MIC button.

                                 RADIOTHERAPIST
                        Okay in there, Sol?

           Sol gives a thumbs up. The machine focuses in and Sol 
           receives treatment. Dr. Schiffrin walks in. 

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        How’s everyone?

                                 BEV
                        When will we get the results?

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        Which session is this? Seventh?

                                 BEV
                        Eight. Last time you mentioned two 
                        of the tumors were smaller?

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        At this point, this is about time 
                        extension -- maintenance. So we 
                        can get to that clinical trial 
                        this summer. 
                                 BEV
                        But if the tumors continue to 
                        shrink via radiation...

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        Most aren’t shrinking. It’s very 
                        unlikely that they will.

                                 BEV
                        Is it impossible?

                                 DR. SCHIFFRIN
                        Nothing is impossible. 

                                 BEV
                        Good. That’s all I need to hear.

           They all stare out at Sol in the machine. Bev is the only 
           one with an expression that still holds hope.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - ENTRANCE - LATER - RAINY DAY

           Jenn and Sol stand under the hospital overhang with Bev. 
           Sol is dressed in layers but still shivers. Thin. He 
           looks his worst.

           Arthur pulls up in his car and opens the back door.

                                 JENN
                        We’ll get you home quick.

                                 SOL
                        I don’t want to go home. We’re 
                        always home.

                                 JENN
                        Where do you want to go?

                                 SOL
                        Any place else. The clocks are too 
                        loud when we’re home.

           Sol ducks into the backseat. Jenn runs around to the 
           other side and gets in.

           INT. INDEPENDENT BOOKSTORE - AFTERNOON - LATER

           Jenn and Sol enter the bookstore. Sol is walking very 
           slowly. He needs Jenn’s arm to keep going.

           Purple Hair is behind the counter drumming. She doesn’t 
           look up at them.
                                 PURPLE HAIR
                        Let me know if I can help you with 
                        anything?

                                 SOL
                        Got any books on mountain 
                        climbing?

                                 PURPLE HAIR
                                 (points)
                        In Travel.

                                 JENN
                        Mountain climbing? Really?

           Purple Hair looks up and recognizes Jenn. She watches 
           them as they pass by her counter. Sol rail-thin.

                                 SOL
                        Not the big mountains. Small ones. 
                        You know. The ones like yea high?

           Sol puts his hand three-feet off the ground.

                                 JENN
                        Mini-mountains. Got it.

                                 SOL
                        Start with a mini. Conquer it. 
                        Plant your flag. One of those 
                        little toothpick flags. Work your 
                        way up to an Everest. 

           Purple Hair watches Jenn and Sol head down the aisle. She 
           looks down at the two pencils in her hands -- and grips 
           them tight. Something clicks.

           EXT. JENN AND SOL’S APARTMENT - RAINY AFTERNOON

           Bev and Arthur help Sol out of the car and up the path 
           back to the apartment.

                                 JENN
                        I’ll catch up with you in a 
                        minute.

           Jenn watches them go inside. The door closes behind them.

           Jenn sits in the car. Windshield wipers going. A NEW BOOK 
           sits in the passenger seat next to her titled Essays on 
           Palliative Care. 
           She shuts off her wipers and lets the world slowly melt 
           on the other side of the windshield glass. We see Sol’s 
           fading heart on the passenger window.

           Suddenly, she lets out a PRIMAL SCREAM.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           IPHONE VIDEO: 

           WE RETURN to the FIRST VIDEO with Sol and Jenn. 

           Sol takes a sudden breath as if he just came up for air. 
           He sits up.  

                                 SOL
                        Yeah. I want to. We have to do 
                        something with the time, right? 
                        But let’s talk about all of our 
                        stuff. I don’t want this to seem 
                        like some fairy tale fantasy 
                        life...

           Sol laughs and starts to cough. It turns into a hard deep 
           chest hacking.

           INT. JENN AND SOL’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Hope shuts off the iPhone video and puts the phone away. 
           Sol keeps coughing. He’s clammy. Jenn pulls a blanket up 
           around him. 

                                 HOPE
                        Miriam?

           MIRIAM BANKS (43) a PALLIATIVE CARE NURSE, comes out of 
           the kitchen with pills in a small cup. She hands them to 
           Sol but his hand shakes too much to hold them.

                                 MIRIAM
                        This muscle relaxant will ease the 
                        tightness in your chest. And these 
                        should help with the pain.

           Jenn takes the pills and puts them in Sol’s mouth. Then 
           she helps him with the water. 

                                 JENN
                        They still don’t make these in 
                        chewables.

           Sol smiles and settles back into the couch. His eyes 
           close. 
           INT. JENN AND SOL’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Dave walks in big and loud. Kyle follows behind him 
           holding a bag of groceries. They sit in chairs across 
           from Sol. 

           Otis jumps up on Sol’s lap.

                                 SOL
                        How is it outside?

           The guys take a pause at Sol’s appearance.

                                 KYLE
                        Coldest July in forever.

                                 DAVE
                        The fight is at nine if you’re 
                        down to watch. G-S-P versus 
                        Williams. 

                                 SOL
                        I’ll be asleep. Or whatever it is 
                        I do now when my eyes are closed. 

           He looks distant. Far offshore. 

                                 JENN
                        Fair warning. He just took a 
                        couple whopper pills.

           Miriam, Jenn and Hope head into the bedroom leaving the 
           guys alone. Sol finally drifts back to our world.

                                 SOL
                        You want a beer?

                                 KYLE
                        I’m okay. 

                                 DAVE
                        Already a little buzzed. Can’t 
                        come in here all sober. 

                                 SOL
                        Telling you. Stop with the start-
                        ups. Open a bar. You can be drunk 
                        all day and it’s just business.

           Sol starts to cough. Kyle looks at him with worry.

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        Stop that look.
                                 KYLE
                        What look?

                                 SOL
                        Your worry face. 

           Kyle laughs nervously.

                                 KYLE
                        I’m allowed to worry right now.

                                 SOL
                        Not about me. I don’t qualify for 
                        worry. You worry when you don’t 
                        know the future -- that’s when you 
                        worry. We know my future. 

           Sol spits out the words quietly.

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        I’m the one who gets to worry now.  
                        Not you.

                                 KYLE
                        What?

           Dave and Kyle look confused.

                                 SOL 
                        About her. I get to worry about 
                        her... future. Her life. I don’t 
                        know what happens to her after 
                        this. 

                                 KYLE
                        She’s strong. 

                                 SOL
                        So strong she could turn to stone. 
                        What is all this doing to her?

                                 DAVE
                        We’re here for you. Both of you. 
                        And we will be here after. We’ll 
                        watch over her. She won’t turn.

           Sol’s eyes roll a bit. The burst of energy exhausts him. 
           Miriam comes over as Sol slowly drifts away into sleep. 

                                 SOL 
                        I’m the only one who gets to 
                        worry.

           She checks his pulse against her watch. 
           INT. SOL AND JENN’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Jenn and Sol brush their teeth. Jenn imitates him for a 
           bit then drops it when he doesn’t play. 

                                 JENN
                        Can I?

                                 SOL
                        Hit me. 

           Jenn looks at Sol in the reflection in the mirror.

                                 JENN
                        Who else do you want to speak at 
                        the funeral?

           Sol keeps brushing his teeth and thinks on it. He talks 
           through the brushing.

                                 SOL
                        Dave... My Dad... Roger.

                                 JENN
                        Roger? Seriously?

                                 SOL
                        I may have spent my... entire life 
                        doing Mobile Bathroom Marketing if 
                        it wasn’t for that guy.

                                 JENN
                        Got it.

                                 SOL
                        And I don’t know where I’d be. 

                                 JENN
                        You’d be here. With me.

           Sol stares at himself in the mirror. 

                                 SOL
                        I wish I was leaving something... 
                        real behind. Proof I was here. 

                                 JENN
                        You inspire people, Sol. Every 
                        where you go. Everyone you see. 
                        You have impact. Even before you 
                        got sick... You did.

                                 SOL
                        That’s not changing the world.
                                 JENN
                        Maybe. Maybe not. Look on the 
                        bright side. Not everyone changes 
                        the world for the better - if you 
                        got the chance to change the 
                        world... you might have gone 
                        fucked things up for the rest of 
                        us.

           Sol laughs and spits in the sink.

           EXT. WEST SIDE MARKET - MORNING

           Sol and Jenn walk through the bustling market. Miriam and 
           Hope walk a few paces behind them. 

           Sol looks gravely ill. Bundled in layers although the day 
           is warm. He stops to smell flowers but we can tell his 
           sense of smell is gone.

                                 JENN
                        What do you want to cook for me 
                        tonight?

           He picks up a zucchini that is curled into a circle.

                                 SOL 
                        Ay! Look at Zucchini Halo here!

                                 JENN
                        Hold it up.

           Jenn takes out her iPhone and Sol holds the zucchini over 
           his head. He smiles. She clicks. 

                                 SOL
                        These look great. 

                                 JENN
                        Let’s cook ‘em up tonight!

                                 SOL
                        I know you hate zucchini. 

                                 JENN
                        Change my mind. Don’t give up on 
                        me. 

           Sol nods. Jenn pays for the zucchini and they put it in 
           the same CANVAS BAG from their first trip. They continue 
           strolling through the market.
           From the back -- Jenn and Sol look like an elderly 
           couple. They pass a POLE covered in promo flyers. 

           We stay on a ROCK CLUB FLYER. 

           It’s the 40 Year Reunion of the band THE SPLITS. We see a 
           NEW BAND PHOTO with PURPLE HAIR FROM THE BOOKSTORE 
           holding up her drum sticks like an X.

           ON IPHONE VIDEO:

           A shaky video shows us ZUCCHINI being sautéed in a pan. 
           It’s sizzling and splattery. We pull back and see Jenn is 
           cooking. 

           Behind her on the fridge still hangs their original SAVE 
           THE DATE CARD. AUGUST 17TH.

                                 SOL (O.C.)
                        You’ve always been a messy cook.

                                 JENN
                        Anything worth cooking is worth 
                        the splattering. That’s what I 
                        always say.

                                 SOL (O.C.)
                        Your heat’s too high. Turn it 
                        down.

                                 JENN
                        What do you call this?

                                 SOL (O.C.)
                        Solomon Chau’s Dill Zinger Crunch 
                        Zucchini. Actually my Mom’s 
                        recipe.

           Sol pans the camera to the ingredients for the recipe on 
           an index card.

                                 JENN
                        Garlic, shallots and chopped 
                        ginger. 

                                 SOL (O.C.)
                        And dill.

           Jenn holds up a hedge-sized bunch of fresh of dill. 

                                 JENN 
                        Who needs this much friggin dill? 
           Jenn shakes it in the camera.

                                 SOL (O.C.)
                        Add the dried pomegranate seeds. 
                        It’s the crunch and zing.

           She sprinkles them on the zucchini. 

                                 SOL (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Okay try it. Watch.

           Jenn takes a forkful and holds it toward the camera. She 
           blows on it to cool it down and takes a bite. Jenn talks 
           through the chew.

                                 JENN 
                        No sale. 

                                 SOL (O.C.)
                        Seriously?! It’s got crunch and 
                        zing!

                                 JENN
                        Still tastes like smushy mush 
                        vegetable with crunch and zing.

                                 SOL (O.C.)
                        You’re mental. Mental in your 
                        mouth.

           Jenn laughs and shows the chewed food in her mouth.  

           INT. JENN AND SOL’S APARTMENT - DAY

           An MMA fight is on TV. Sol lies on the couch. END STAGE. 
           Miriam and Hope talk quietly in the kitchen. 

           Medications are cluttered on the counter. Jenn is 
           organizing them.

                                 HOPE
                        We’re going to head to the store. 
                        Need anything?

                                 JENN
                        Honey Bush tea, please. 

                                 HOPE
                        You got it. Sol? Want anything?

                                 SOL
                        Bottle of Captain Morgan and a 
                        carton of Reds.
           Jenn sits next to him on the couch. 

                                 JENN
                        You should really switch to 
                        lights.

                                 SOL
                        They’re all the same.

           They watch the fighters go at it.

                                 JENN
                        Ready for one?

                                 SOL
                        Hit me.

           Sol mutes the TV. 

                                 JENN
                        Do you want to hear your eulogy?

           Sol adjusts how he’s sitting. We see his discomfort. 

                                 SOL
                        No. Not yet.

           They watch the fighters fight while the TV is muted. 

                                 SOL (CONT’D) 
                        You think you’ll have our baby?

                                 JENN
                        One day. I’d like to. Would you?

                                 SOL
                        I like thinking about it.

                                 JENN
                        Then maybe I’ll have six. 

           Jenn snuggles up to him. 

           INT. JENN AND SOL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sol lies in bed. Deathly. He’s in pain. On the edge. 
           Miriam gives him a shot and he doesn’t flinch. 

           Jenn snuggles up next to him.

                                 JENN
                        We were supposed to get married 
                        this weekend. In that courtyard. 
                                 SOL
                        Did Roger finally finish it?

                                 JENN
                        He did. It’s open.

           Sol looks happy about that. He drifts off to sleep. Jenn 
           stares at his chest rising and falling. 

           She takes out a YELLOW NOTEPAD and starts writing. Sol 
           wakes up.

                                 SOL
                        Is that it?

                                 JENN
                        What?

                                 SOL
                        My Eulogy. 

                                 JENN
                        Yes. I can read it to you 
                        tomorrow.

                                 SOL
                        Read it now.

           Jenn stares at Sol. Tears flow.

                                 SOL (CONT’D) 
                        I’m busy tomorrow.

           She smiles and starts reading off the notepad. She clears 
           her throat.

                                 JENN 
                        My husband, Soloman Chau lived 
                        twenty-six years...

           Jenn takes a deep breath and begins to read. Sol slowly 
           closes his eyes.

           INT. FUNERAL PARLOR - MORNING

           The cover of Sol’s MEMORIAL PROGRAM BOOKLET looks similar 
           to the Save the Date card. Same date. AUGUST 17TH.

           Jenn stands at the podium with her YELLOW NOTEPAD. She 
           looks out at the mourners. We see Sol’s parents. Jenn’s 
           Mom. Guests from the wedding. Otis.

           The words hang in the room. 
                                 JENN (CONT’D)
                        Nine thousand four hundred 
                        seventeen days... and a half.

           She looks down at SOL’S URN and smiles.

                                 JENN (CONT’D) 
                        And I got to have him in my 
                        life... for one thousand seven 
                        hundred and four days... and a 
                        half. I did the math.

           She turns the page. 

                                 JENN (CONT’D) 
                        But if you had him in your life 
                        for just one day. One hour. 
                        There’s a good chance -- he had 
                        impact on you. On your life.

           She inhales.

                                 JENN (CONT’D) 
                        He was inspiring. 

           Slowly exhales.

                                 JENN (CONT’D)
                        Once he realized his days were 
                        limited. Sol wanted more out of 
                        life. Not less. He went out. Not 
                        in. He was inspired by time. And 
                        kept me... living.

           Jenn nods at the casket.

                                 JENN (CONT’D) 
                        And I believe, we believed, a 
                        single, inspired life is 
                        contagious.

           START MONTAGE:

           We watch the OLD MAN standing on a moving sidewalk in an 
           airport. He’s heading toward the terminal for AIR CHINA.

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        Sol would tell you to travel more. 

           BEARDED GUY has TWO PROUD THERAPY DOGS in a cancer ward 
           for children. The dogs are SENIOR DOGS.
                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        Appreciate old age. 

           The FRESHMAN looks healthy and strong. He jogs -- looking 
           very appreciative to be out in the world. 

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        Don’t let setbacks hold you back.

           Our TIRED WAITRESS is packing her things in boxes and 
           suitcases. MOVING OUT. As her stoner boyfriend watches 
           her sadly from the couch.

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        Believe in yourself. 

           SHY GIRL with glasses stands in front of the room reading 
           a report. LOUD and proud. The report is about her father.

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        Speak up. 

           DAVE is in the retail construction site which we now see 
           is a SPORTS BAR. He puts his arm around Amanda 
           affectionately. They kiss. Megan smiles.

                        Do what you love with someone you 
                        love.

                        But if you can’t do what you love. 
                        Do what you do for the right 
                        reasons.

           PURPLE HAIR sits behind her DRUMS in a small rock club. 
           The crowd buzzes. She counts off the beat over her head. 
           Drumsticks like an X.

                                 JENN (V.O.)
                        Because old age... isn’t a 
                        guarantee. 

           She hits her drums HARD.

           We hear ocean waves.

           EXT. HAWAIIAN BEACH - DUSK

           Jenn stands in the surf with Sol’s Urn. She closes her 
           eyes and lets his ASHES scatter into the ocean.

                                 JENN
                        Happy Anniversary, Solomon.

           She turns and heads to shore. 

           INT. OAHU FAIRMONT HOTEL - NIGHT

           Jenn is wearing Sol’s UFC sweatshirt. She sits at a table 
           with her LAPTOP open.

           A PLASTIC BOX tied with a bow sits next to the computer. 
           Her fingers twist around the bow. Written on the box 
           reads: OPEN IN OAHU! 

           Then she opens her laptop and takes a moment before 
           clicking a video file. ALWAYS-US.mp4

           ON VIDEO: 

           It’s Sol. Toward his end.

                                 SOL 
                        Hi. Happy Anniversary. Wherever I 
                        am. I know I miss you.

           Jenn puts her hands to her mouth as she watches.

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        Even if I had lived to be an old 
                        man, without you, if we never 
                        became... us, my life would have 
                        just been... long. I have no 
                        regrets, Jenn.

           Jenn chokes back tears.
                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        I probably would have ended up 
                        some sad old marketing guy. 
                        Clocking time in bathroom stalls. 
                        Not a chef. And I would never have 
                        found this kind of love with 
                        anyone but you.

           She laughs. Sol looks directly at her.

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        So thank you. For believing in me.

           Sol STANDS UP and steps back -- he’s in a RED SPEEDO. We 
           see how thin he is as well.

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        When you think of me... don’t 
                        think of me in this Speedo. I just 
                        want to keep promises. It was a 
                        now or never.

           Jenn bursts out laughing. Sol looks at the camera. Looks 
           at Jenn. They share a moment. He sits down.

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        If you ever decide to have our 
                        baby. There’s a folder on Dropbox 
                        named For Him or Her. I recorded 
                        some for... our baby. Or our five 
                        babies. That’s up to you.

           Sol smiles. He looks at her.

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        Live your life, Jenn. Big. Go. Do. 
                        See. Swim. Always now. And keep an 
                        open mind to everything. Now open 
                        the box.

           Jenn unties the bow and pops open the box. Inside are a 
           few dozen RECIPE CARDS. Jenn laughs. 

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        One day, you’ll be convinced. Or 
                        not. Never keep trying please.

           Each card is a different handwritten ZUCCHINI RECIPE.

                                 SOL (CONT’D)
                        It was me and you, Jenn. Always.

           Sol reaches over and shuts off the video. Black screen. 
           There’s a knock at the door. 
                                 JENN
                        Always. Will be.

           Jenn gets up and opens the door. Amanda, Megan, and Hope 
           burst into the room.

                                 AMANDA
                        Are you not dressed yet!? We have 
                        a reservation at 7:30 and the guy 
                        was a full dick about it on the 
                        phone.

                                 MEGAN
                        Take it easy. This is vacation.

           Hope notices the open laptop and plastic box.

                                 HOPE 
                        What have you been doing in here?

                                 JENN
                        Getting ready to go.

           Jenn shuts her laptop lid and looks at herself in the 
           mirror before hustling out the door.

                                 THE END
