                  A mother's love for her child is like nothing else in the          
                 world. It knows no law, no pity, it dares all things and  
                   crushes down remorselessly all that stands in its path.

           OVER BLACK:

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        Once upon a time there was a 
                        beautiful princess who lived with 
                        her mother, the Queen.

           INT. CHILD’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           At the foot of a twin bed, a PUPPET SHOW, starring two shabby 
           dolls -- “Princess” and “Queen” -- is underway.

                                 RUTH (O.S.)
                        The Princess and the Queen were the 
                        best of friends. Nothing could ever 
                        come between them.

           As Queen gives Princess a kiss, then dips below the bed, we 
           meet the woman performing our show, RUTH STANTON (30s), long 
           blonde hair, penetrating, soulful eyes. A born mother. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Until one day, when the princess 
                        went for a walk all by herself... 
                        and a Gargoyle attacked!

           Ruth “flies” in a plastic GARGOYLE (which looks like 
           something out of a McDonald’s Happy Meal) and begins chasing 
           Princess across the sheets --

           -- REVEALING the sole spectator, NAOMI STANTON (4), adorable, 
           curious, snuggled tightly in her blankets. Enraptured.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        But the princess was too small to 
                        fight the Gargoyle on her own.

           The Gargoyle has Princess by the feet. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        But luckily, she didn’t have to. 
                        You know why?

                                 NAOMI
                        Why?!

                                 RUTH
                        Because the Queen was never far 
                        behind... in her monster truck!

           The Queen triumphantly returns atop her trusty steed, a 
           tattered, hand-me-down TOY TONKA TRUCK. 
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                             (Queen’s voice)
                        You leave her alone, Monster!

           As Ruth puppeteers the epic Queen vs. Gargoyle battle, she 
           really starts getting into it.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Oh no! The Gargoyle’s too strong!

           Naomi cowers under her blanket. Too scared to watch. Ruth 
           notices and stops the show. Chuckling at her over-exuberance.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay, Bug, it’s just pretend.

           Ruth retires the toys, then sits closer to Naomi, who finally 
           has the courage to peek her head out from under the covers.

                                 NAOMI
                        Did the Queen kill the Gargoyle?

                                 RUTH
                             (playful)
                        To be continued... 

           Naomi scowls as Ruth tucks her in. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Who loves you?

                                 NAOMI
                        You.

                                 RUTH
                        Who will always love you?

                                 NAOMI
                        You.

           Ruth leans down to give Naomi a kiss.

                                 RUTH
                        Who’s the hottest mom in 
                        Pennsylvania?

                                 NAOMI
                        Mrs. Docherty!

                                 RUTH
                             (feigning shock)
                        What?! How dare you! 

           Ruth begins tickling Naomi. Then...
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Alright, meanie, get some sleep.

           Ruth makes her way to the door. She stops. Turns to Naomi. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Luv luv, Bug.

                                 NAOMI
                        Luv luv.

           A deep smile grows on Ruth’s face as she watches Naomi roll 
           over and fall sleep. Ruth slowly shuts the door behind her.

           INT. RUTH’S TRAILER - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Humble. Tidy. Ruth, wrapped tightly in an old winter jacket, 
           finishes packing her bag, when her ears perk up. 

           She moves for the door, opening it just before the 
           babysitter, JULIE (19), bookish, has a chance to knock.

                                 JULIE
                        How do you always do that?

           As Ruth grabs her thermos from the counter, we notice how 
           different she is when Naomi’s not around. More reserved. 
           Intense. Safe behind a self-imposed protective barrier.

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        She asleep?

                                 RUTH
                        Yeah. I’ll pick her up after 
                        daycare, okay?

                                 JULIE
                        Cool. Hey, you mind if I hang out 
                        here a bit tomorrow morning and 
                        study? Dorm life is killing my GPA. 

                                 RUTH
                        The place is yours.

                                 JULIE
                        Gawd, I wish. I’d give anything to 
                        have my own crib. I think my 
                        roommate’s bi-polar.

           Ruth looks at Julie, speaks with that matronly tone.
                                 RUTH
                        If you want something to happen, 
                        you just have to make it happen.

           Julie smirks. Appreciates the kick in the butt.

                                 JULIE
                        Yeah, I know, you’re right. 

           Ruth nods encouragement, then grabs her keys and exits.

           EXT. MOTEL ALEXANDRIA - PENNSYLVANIA - NIGHT

           Might as well be a Super 8. Cheap, worn down. On its last 
           legs. Like the town of Alexandria, it’s seen better days.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           A GIANT BLOOD STAIN on the carpet. TWO HISPANIC MAIDS stand 
           over it, staring down, horrified.

                                 OLDER MAID
                             (in Spanish)
                        What kind of people do this?

           The room is destroyed. Remnants of a redneck rager. Empty 
           beer cans, broken liquor bottles. Piss and puke. 

                                 YOUNGER MAID
                             (in Spanish)
                        Maybe it’s wine.

                                 RUTH
                             (in perfect Spanish)
                        No, it’s blood.

           REVEAL Ruth, the third maid, in her tacky motel uniform.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Here. Let me.

           The Older Maid nods appreciation as Ruth gets down on her 
           knees and vehemently SCRUBS at the blood splatter. 

           Harder. Faster. Determined to remove the stains.

           EXT. MOTEL ALEXANDRIA - PARKING LOT - DAWN

           The graveyard shift of Hispanic Maids, and Ruth, slog towards 
           their beater cars. Exhausted after another long night.  
           Just as Ruth reaches for her driver’s door --

                                 OLDER MAID
                        Work is not a prison... 

           Ruth turns to see the Older Maid standing nearby.

                                 OLDER MAID (CONT’D)
                        Yet you work harder than any 
                        prisoner I’ve ever known. Why? 

           With a purposeful grin --

                                 RUTH
                        Because I have to.

           The Older Maid seems intrigued. She takes off a thin metal 
           NECKLACE. Offers it to Ruth. Who declines.

                                 OLDER MAID
                        To watch over you. 
                             (then)
                        It’s okay. I buy them in bulk at 
                        the county fair. One dollar each.

           This time Ruth accepts the necklace. Rubs her fingers over 
           the worn SAINT CHRISTOPHER pendant.

                                 RUTH
                        Thank you.

           The Older Maid smiles big as Ruth opens her car door. 

                                 OLDER MAID
                        Where do you always go every 
                        morning in such a hurry?

           Ruth enters her car. 

                                 RUTH
                        Work.

           Off the Older Maid’s confounded expression as Ruth shuts the 
           door, then drives her car out of the parking lot...

           Onto the cold, desolate rural highway.

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        My name is Ruth Stanton. I’m a 
                        single mother. And I work two jobs. 

           SERIES OF SHOTS:
           EXT. PETERSBURG GLASS COMPANY - DAY

           Ruth’s car pulls into the quintessential rustbelt factory.

           INT. PETERSBURG GLASS - DAY

           Giant melting furnaces. Glass blowing machines. Conveyor 
           belts. Rack movers. Rivers of molten glass.   

           Ruth works the production line. Inspecting trays of freshly 
           molded bottles. The work is hard and hot. 

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        I’ve been in recovery since my 
                        daughter was born four years ago...

           As Ruth changes out of her sweat-soaked shirt, we can’t help 
           but notice her athletic, toned body --

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        But every day still feels like a 
                        struggle...

           -- and the plethora of SCARS imprinted on her torso. 

           EXT. SACRED TRINITY CHURCH - DAY

           Old. Stone. Weathered.

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        I think it probably goes back to my 
                        own childhood. I never knew my 
                        father, and my mother, she was this 
                        revered career woman...

           INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY

           Addicts Anonymous Meeting. Various attendees sit in metal 
           chairs. But we’re not paying attention to them... 

           We’re only focused on Ruth, who continues her story.

                                 RUTH
                        Everybody respected her. But she 
                        chose work over me. So when I had 
                        Naomi, I knew I was gonna do things 
                        differently than she did... 
           INT. SHOP N’ SAVE - DAY

           Generic market. Everything from toothpaste to motor oil. Ruth 
           CASHES her meager paychecks. Gets crumpled bills in return.

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        And I wasn’t gonna let anything get 
                        in the way of what mattered most... 

           Double-checking her clipped coupons, Ruth peruses the aisles, 
           filling a small basket with healthy options of cheap food.

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        So I left my old life, and 
                        everything in it, behind. But yeah, 
                        sometimes I still think about it... 

           At the checkout, Ruth’s EYES land on a liquor display, 
           riveted by TWO HORSE DOLLS “HAULING” A BOTTLE OF GIN.

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        And even though that life was 
                        filled with abuse... the sex and 
                        drugs... the violence... 

           After a moment of deliberation, Ruth motions for the 
           attendant to pull down the bottle of gin for her.

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        I still wonder if in some ways it 
                        might’ve been better than the life 
                        I have now...

           EXT. ALEXANDRIA DAYCARE - DAY

           School’s out as NAOMI maneuvers through the sea of children.

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        But when I look into Naomi’s eyes 
                        and see the way she looks at me... 

           Naomi sprints towards Ruth, who eagerly waits by her car.

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        How much she needs me... and how 
                        much I need her...

           Ruth offers Naomi the HORSE DOLL she bought from the store 
           (she wasn’t buying liquor). Naomi smiles. Hugs Ruth tightly.
           INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY

           CAMERA PANS across the many somber faces, including the 
           seasoned group leader, FATHER THEO (60s), before once again 
           landing on Ruth, who struggles to finish.

                                 RUTH
                        I just put one foot in front of the 
                        other. Every day. And I keep 
                        living. And I’m not gonna stop 
                        until I know Naomi has the future 
                        she deserves.

           The group nods. Supportive. 

                                 FATHER THEO
                        Thank you, Ruth. Let’s all thank 
                        Ruth for sharing her story. She’s 
                        been coming to group for months and 
                        we finally got her to talk!

           The group chuckles, vocalizing their gratitude. Ruth grins. 

                                 FATHER THEO (CONT’D)
                        But seriously guys, just remember, 
                        it’s not about where you come from, 
                        but where you’re going. And more 
                        importantly... how you get there. 

           Off Ruth as she takes a deep, restorative breath...

           END SERIES:

           EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY

           Ruth drives past rows of staggered double-wides. Most are 
           dilapidated. Poverty-stricken. Hers is simple. Clean. 

           As soon as Ruth parks, Naomi hops out, and runs into the 
           trailer, playing with her new horse doll. 

           Ruth grabs the groceries and follows her in.

           INT. RUTH’S TRAILER - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           SCRAMBLED EGGS sizzle in a frying pan. Ruth, wearing the 
           Saint Christopher pendant, stands by the stove, preparing 
           breakfast for dinner.

           In the living room, Naomi plays with her toy truck.
                                 RUTH
                             (calling to Naomi)
                        You want cheese? 

                                 NAOMI (O.S.)
                        Yeah cheese!

           Ruth sprinkles some cheese on the eggs, when her phone 
           BUZZES. Ruth checks it. Text message from an UNKNOWN CALLER. 

           The text reads: “Long time no see my little worker bee.” 

           This elicits a smile. Ruth texts back: “Yeah, really long 
           time little ant. How’d you find me?”

           -- “I may be old but I still have my ways. Dinner soon? I 
           should be your way on Friday.”

           Ruth replies: “See you then, grandpa.”

           -- “:) that’s a smiley face FYI. Damn, I really am old!”

           Ruth smiles again. It’s nice. Then...

                                 RUTH
                             (calling to Naomi)
                        Okay, it’s ready.
                             (no reply)
                        Dinner’s ready!

           Just then, Ruth hears a loud CRASH. Concerned, she turns off 
           the stove and runs over to the living room --

           -- where she finds Naomi crouched on the floor next to a 
           shattered PORCELAIN BALLERINA DOLL.

           It belongs to a set of SIX PORCELAIN DOLLS that are lined up 
           perfectly on the mantle. All of the “girl dolls” are a bit 
           stereotypical (maid, secretary, nurse, teacher, librarian).

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Hey, you okay?

           Ruth circumvents the couch, sees that Naomi discovered 
           something that was HIDDEN INSIDE the broken doll.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        You found mommy’s special doll.

           Naomi holds up a RECTANGULAR ITEM wrapped in a faded 
           handkerchief, along with a brimming ENVELOPE. 
                                 NAOMI
                        It fell. It was an accident.

                                 RUTH
                        It’s okay.

           Ruth sits beside Naomi and opens the envelope for her. 

           Inside, we see a stack of old PHOTOGRAPHS. All of them show 
           YOUNG RUTH (from baby to teenager) with her mother, VICTORIA 
           (30-40s), statuesque, intimidating. From the look of the 
           pictures, they seem to have travelled the globe together. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Who’s that?

                                 RUTH
                        Your grandmother, Victoria.

                                 NAOMI
                        I have a grandmother?

                                 RUTH
                        You did. But she died many years 
                        before you were born.

           Emotions threaten to bubble to the surface as Ruth flips 
           through the old pictures. Memories stirring.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Come on, we can look at these 
                        later. I’m starving.

           Naomi jumps to her feet. Runs to the kitchen.

           As soon as she’s gone, Ruth carefully opens the item wrapped 
           in the faded handkerchief --

           -- revealing one FULL CLIP OF 9MM AMMO. 

           Ruth nimbly spins the magazine in her hand. Thumb caressing 
           the exposed jacketed hollow point round like it were a long 
           lost friend. Ruminating.

                                 NAOMI (O.S.)
                        I said I didn’t want cheese!

           Snapped from her reverie, Ruth wraps the ammo clip back in 
           the handkerchief before heading into the kitchen for dinner. 

                                 RUTH
                        You better be joking!

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. MOTEL ALEXANDRIA - NIGHT

           QUICK SHOTS. Another long night on the job. Ruth vacuums the 
           hallway. Throws away trash. Scrubs a dirty toilet.

           EXT. MOTEL ALEXANDRIA - DAWN

           Ruth says goodbye to the Older Maid. Gets in her shitty car 
           and drives away. Same morning routine.

           INT. PETERSBURG GLASS - DAY

           QUICK SHOTS. Another long day on the job. Ruth lugs boxes of 
           defective bottles to the trash. Stacks pallets of material.    

           As Ruth takes a water break, chugging from her thermos, she’s 
           hit with a pounding headache. Feels like a migraine.

           INT. BREAK ROOM - DAY

           LOCKERS line the concrete walls. Flanked by coffee and snack 
           machines. The social hub of the manufacturing plant. 

           Ruth leans against her locker, POPS some Advil, squeezes her 
           eyes shut, still trying to fight off the headache. 

           TWO MALE CO-WORKERS huddle together at the locker directly 
           behind Ruth, ogling her backside as they tease each other 
           about what they “would do with that ass.”  

           The TALL WORKER gives his friend a slick little nod just as 
           he “accidentally” bumps into Ruth, his hand grazing her rear.

           ** What happens next... is both unexpected and beyond fast.

           In one smooth motion, Ruth blindly SNATCHES his groping hand, 
           spins, and using his own body weight and momentum --

           -- SLAMS him into the locker. TWO FINGERS instantly jab into 
           the pressure point right between his ear and jaw.

           Tall Worker is shocked at the pain. Immobilized. 

                                 OTHER WORKER
                        Let him go!!

           Ruth is jolted from her trance-like focus. She releases Tall 
           Worker, who stares at her like she were some kind of witch. 

           A tense beat. But before anyone can say anything --
           -- a homely ASSISTANT approaches.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Ruth. Charlie wants to see you.

           Ruth regains her composure, follows the assistant out. The 
           two co-workers huddle together again, nursing their egos. 

           Their expressions can say only one thing... 

           “What the fuck just happened?” 

           INT. CHARLIE’S OFFICE - DAY

           STAINED TEETH gnaw on a pencil. Reveal CHARLIE FULLER (50), 
           former college football player, former ladies man. Now a 
           greasy factory manager. The fat fish in a tiny pond. 

           Gnawing turns to slurping as Charlie eye-fucks Ruth, who sits 
           in a small chair across from his oversized desk.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You been here, what, almost a year? 
                        How come I feel like we don’t 
                        really know each other?

                                 RUTH
                        I’m just here to work.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, well people are talking about 
                        you. They won’t stop. 
                             (with a wink)
                        Course I can understand why. 

           Ruth sits there. Blank. Accustomed to sexual harassment. 

           Charlie leans back, pores over a written REQUEST FORM. He 
           pretends to contemplate long and hard about some decision.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        You know you’re the first line 
                        worker I ever had who actually 
                        requested overtime.

           Charlie stands, circles his desk, sits in front of her. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Whatcha need the extra dough for? 
                        You got your eyes on a nice dress?
                             (no reply)
                        You’re right. None of my business.
           Charlie leans closer. Ruth can smell his testosterone.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        You got something special, Ruth. 
                        Something men want, bad. And if you 
                        were, say, to give it to one of 
                        them... well, I bet your money 
                        problems would just disappear... 

           Charlie rests a hand on Ruth’s leg. She doesn’t flinch.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        And you wouldn’t need overtime. 

           A tense moment. We wonder what Ruth will do. Fight? 

                                 RUTH
                             (then, firm)
                        I just need an extra shift.

           Charlie stares at Ruth. Everything about her may say she’s 
           damaged. But in her eyes... there’s strength. 

           Ruth swallows down her frustration in order to keep her job. 

           A long beat. A stand off.    

           Finally, Charlie breaks. Realizes she’s not for sale.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, well I’ll think about it.

           Like a petulant child who didn’t get what he wanted, Charlie 
           circles around his desk and sits. When Ruth stands to leave --

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        One of the men’s toilets on three 
                        is clogged. It’s a real shit show. 
                        Be a good girl and go clean it up.

           Ruth stares at Charlie. Another little stand off.

                                 RUTH
                        Yes, sir.

           Manhood restored, Charlie puffs his chest. As Ruth turns...

                                 CHARLIE
                             (under his breath)
                        That’s what I thought, Bitch.

           Ruth says nothing. Just quietly exits and gets back to work.
           INT. PETERSBURG GLASS - MAIN FLOOR - DAY

           Back on the line, Ruth struggles to straighten a FAULTY 
           CONVEYOR PISTON that keeps firing off track. Like the machine 
           were throwing wild punches. KNOCKING bottles to the ground.

           Realizing it’s futile, Ruth jumps down and begins picking up 
           the shards of glass that have scattered all over the floor. 

           Surrounded by cauldrons of molten glass, the heat waves 
           practically singe her skin.

           Ruth takes a long drink from her water thermos -- 

           -- when another headache hits. 

           VEINS in her head bulge. More sweat.

           Suddenly, things go cloudy. Distorted. Her head THROBS.

           Ruth tries to stand up, but she stumbles. 

           Knees wobbling as she COLLAPSES to the ground... 

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           MRI SCANS backlit against the wall. Unnerving discolorations 
           spot various areas near the brain stem. This is not normal.

           DR. GATE (30s), baby face, fresh out of his residency, 
           scrutinizes the scans. Eyes straining. Clearly stressed. 

                                 RUTH (O.S.)
                        My daughter?

           Dr. Gate turns to reveal Ruth, sitting in bed, just waking.

                                 DR. GATE
                        She’s outside. Someone named Julie 
                        brought her.

           Ruth breathes a sigh of relief.

                                 RUTH
                        What happened? 

                                 DR. GATE
                        You fainted and hit your head.
                                 RUTH
                        Another concussion?

                                 DR. GATE
                        Have you had many concussions?

           Ruth tightens her hospital gown. Glimpses of more SCARS.

                                 RUTH
                        Yes. 

           Dr. Gate approaches her. More than nervous.

                                 DR. GATE
                        I’m afraid this is more serious 
                        than a concussion. You, uh... 

           His anxiety starts to concern Ruth. But she remains calm.

                                 RUTH
                        Just breathe. Say it slow.

           Dr. Gate takes a mindful breath, then -- 

                                 DR. GATE
                        It’s called Glioblastoma. 

           This hits Ruth.

                                 RUTH
                        Cancer?

                                 DR. GATE
                        It’s a rare and aggressive form. 
                             (referencing MRI)
                        You see this discolored area in the 
                        pons region? That’s the tumor.

           Ruth’s face hasn’t changed. She remains strangely even.

                                 RUTH
                        A brain tumor?

                                 DR. GATE
                        I’m afraid so. 

                                 RUTH
                        Operable?

           Dr. Gate can barely hide his anguish. The answer is no.
                                 DR. GATE
                        The tumor is already located in a 
                        hard to reach area, but there’s 
                        also the vascularization we’d have 
                        to contend with. It’s entangled 
                        with too many blood vessels for us 
                        to attempt surgery.  
                             (disappointed in himself)
                        I’ve never had to give this sort of 
                        diagnosis before. I’m sorry I’m not 
                        better at it.

           Ruth is deep in thought. Processing it all. Dr. Gate tries to 
           remain optimistic. 

                                 DR. GATE (CONT’D)
                        I sent your scans to one of the 
                        best neurosurgeons in the state who 
                        also happens to be an old mentor of 
                        mine. He’s a specialist. He thinks 
                        there’s a small chance that a 
                        certain type of radiation therapy, 
                        stereotactic radio surgery, might 
                        slow down the --

                                 RUTH
                        How long?

           A beat. Dr. Gate doesn’t want to answer.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                             (matter-of-fact)
                        According to the Kaplan–Meier 
                        curve, how long do I have left?

                                 DR. GATE
                        Six months. Maybe less.

           Ruth stares blankly for a long, agonizing moment. Then, like 
           she somehow just decided to accept her fate... she nods. 

                                 DR. GATE (CONT’D)
                        I can prescribe you some medication 
                        to help manage the symptoms. But 
                        the headaches, along with the loss 
                        of vision and balance. Well, it’s 
                        only gonna get worse until...

                                 RUTH
                        Until it can’t get any worse.

           Dr. Gate nods. 
                                 DR. GATE
                        You should really see a specialist.

           Ruth starts to get up.

                                 RUTH
                        No. I only need to see one person 
                        right now.

                                 DR. GATE
                        Who?

                                 RUTH
                        My daughter.

           Ruth exits the exam room. Through the window, Dr. Gate 
           watches as Naomi runs into Ruth’s arms. Ruth’s face betrays 
           nothing. She seems perfectly healthy as they walk away.

           Off Dr. Gate’s sorrowful expression...

           INT. NAOMI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ruth smiles as she tucks Naomi into bed like it were just 
           another night. But her daughter can sense something more --

                                 NAOMI
                        Mommy, are you okay?

           Ruth gently caresses Naomi’s cheek. Staying strong for her.

                                 RUTH
                        Who loves you?

                                 NAOMI
                        You.

                                 RUTH
                        Who will always love you?

                                 NAOMI
                        You.

           Ruth leans down and gives Naomi a tender kiss.

                                 RUTH
                        Get some sleep.

           Ruth makes her way to the door. She stops. Turns to Naomi. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Luv luv, Bug.
                                 NAOMI
                        Luv luv.

           Ruth smiles as she slowly shuts the door behind her...

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           ... but the smile quickly fades as Ruth leans against the 
           door for a long moment. Vulnerable. Scared.

           And then... she folds to her knees and silently sobs.

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           EXT. NEWMAN LAW SERVICES - DAY

           Strip mall. Squeezed between a Chinese buffet and H&R Block.

                                 DOUGLAS (PRE-LAP)
                        According to state law, without a 
                        blood relative to take custody...

           INT. LAW OFFICE - DAY

           Fighting another headache, Ruth sits across from lawyer, 
           DOUGLAS NEWMAN (40s), kind, educated, salt of the earth. 

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Upon your death, Naomi will become 
                        a ward of the state. 

           This hits Ruth with more punch than the cancer diagnosis.

                                 RUTH
                        An orphanage?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        And then foster care, perhaps.

           This is Ruth’s worst nightmare.

                                 RUTH
                        No, she can’t. She’s strong-- she 
                        is, but not that strong. There has 
                        to be something I can do.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        I’m sorry, there’s nothing --

                                 RUTH
                        What about life insurance?
                                 DOUGLAS
                        Unfortunately, no insurance company 
                        will cover you because your illness 
                        is considered a “pre-existing 
                        condition.”  

           Ruth shakes her head. At a loss.

                                 RUTH
                             (thinking out loud)
                        And if I had money?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        I’ve run your financials. With 
                        total assets, including your car 
                        and trailer, in the neighborhood of 
                        thirty thousand dollars... in the 
                        long run, that’s not gonna make 
                        much of a difference. 

                                 RUTH
                        What if I had more money?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        How much?

                                 RUTH
                        A lot.

           Douglas shrugs.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Everything is a function of money.

                                 RUTH
                        What does that mean, exactly?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        It means that if you had sufficient 
                        funds, we’d be able to open a trust 
                        for Naomi. One that would be 
                        properly managed until she turns of 
                        legal age. Then she’d have all the 
                        things she needed to prosper. She’d 
                        attend a top-tier boarding school. 
                        Be surrounded by caring and 
                        passionate professionals. Get a 
                        proper education...
                             (then, poignant)
                        She’d have a chance at a real 
                        future.

           Ruth’s wheels are already spinning. 
                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        Why? Do you have access to that 
                        kind of money?

           Off Ruth... a glimmer of hope... and fear...

           EXT. HOWARD’S DINER - NIGHT

           Local version of Denny’s. Big rigs and muddy trucks clutter 
           the parking lot. Last stop for slop before leaving town.

           INT. HOWARD’S DINER - NIGHT

           SPOON SWIRLS COFFEE. Ruth sits in the corner booth. Staring 
           down at her cup. Lost in thought. Still contemplating it all. 

                                 GARRETT (O.S.)
                        I see a little worker bee.

           Ruth glances up to find GARRETT WARD (50s), rugged, handsome 
           in a Harrison Ford way. The air of an architect/contractor. 

                                 RUTH
                        Hey little ant.

           Ruth stands up and they share a warm hug. They both seem 
           genuinely happy to see each other. Been a long time. 

                                 GARRETT
                             (re: diner)
                        What, the Four Seasons was booked?

                                 RUTH
                             (sarcastic)
                        You joke now, but wait till you try 
                        the scrapple. To die for.

           Garrett makes a ‘disgusted’ face and Ruth grins. Then they 
           sit down across from each other. Garrett soaks her in.  

                                 GARRETT
                        You look like shit.

           Ruth snorts.

                                 RUTH
                        Thanks, grandpa.

                                 GARRETT
                        So what gives? The ordinary life’s 
                        not all it was cracked up to be? 
                                 RUTH
                        It has its moments.

                                 GARRETT
                        You don’t miss the city?

           Ruth shakes her head.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        Bullshit.

           Ruth smiles.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        How’s the little one? Naomi, right?

                                 RUTH
                        She’s good. Tough for her age.

                                 GARRETT
                        Like her mother.

           An awkward beat. They both know what question comes next. 

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        And Bryce? Have you talked to him?

           At the mention of that name, Ruth closes herself off a bit.

                                 RUTH
                        Not since I left. You?

                                 GARRETT
                        Nah, I’m running with a different 
                        crowd these days.

           Garrett knows not to push. Bryce is obviously a sore subject.

                                 RUTH
                        I’m really glad you reached out 
                        when you did... I need some advice.

                                 GARRETT
                        Wow, this is a first.

           Ruth takes a moment... unsure how to proceed. 

                                 RUTH
                        I’ve got a situation.

                                 GARRETT
                        Then what do you need me for? I’ve 
                        seen how you handle “situations.” 
                                 RUTH
                        This one’s different. 

           Ruth struggles to find the phrasing.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        I’m thinking about going back.

           Garrett seems utterly surprised.

                                 GARRETT
                        That bad, huh?

                                 RUTH
                        It’s a function of money.

           A beat. Garrett nods. He understands.

                                 GARRETT
                        Well, the reason I tracked you down 
                        in the first place was I wanted to 
                        tell you in person...
                             (dramatic pause)
                        I’m retiring. 

                                 RUTH
                        Seriously? I thought you’d be 
                        working till you were old and gray. 
                        Oh wait, you are.

                                 GARRETT
                        Ha fucking ha. No, I landed a big 
                        contract. Huge payday. Now I’m 
                        gonna spend the rest of my days on 
                        a beach somewhere pounding cheap 
                        tequila and cheaper women.

           Ruth chuckles slightly. He hasn’t changed.

                                 RUTH
                        Well, congratulations. If anyone 
                        deserves to be a fat drunk with 
                        venereal disease it’s you. 

           Garrett chuckles back. Then...

                                 GARRETT
                        You really want my advice? 

           Ruth nods sincerely. Garrett leans in. 

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        If money can help your situation... 
                        then Bryce is your man.
           Ruth takes another moment. A decision made. 

           Just then, a hefty WAITRESS approaches. Asks for their order.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                             (big, sarcastic grin)
                        I hear the scrapple’s to die for.

           Ruth smiles. Off these two old friends...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RUTH’S TRAILER - MORNING

           Overcast. Rain begins to drizzle. Ruth says goodbye to Naomi 
           before sending her off with Julie, who waits by her already 
           running car.

           Ruth leans down. Eye-to-eye with her daughter.

                                 RUTH
                        I want you to be good at daycare, 
                        today, okay? And listen to Julie. 
                        She’s in charge. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I wanna be in charge.

                                 RUTH
                        You will be soon. Listen, I won’t 
                        be here when you get home. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Why, where you going?

                                 RUTH
                        I’ve got someone I need to go see. 
                        But don’t worry, it’s a special 
                        trip. And when I get back 
                        everything’s gonna be perfect.

           Naomi doesn’t realize the weight of the conversation. She 
           fidgets, ready to get out of the rain.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        I want you to have something.

           Ruth takes off the SAINT CHRISTOPHER pendant and clasps it 
           around Naomi’s little neck.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Always wear this, okay? It will 
                        protect you until I get home.
           Naomi rubs the pendant. She likes it.

                                 NAOMI
                        It’s raining.

           Ruth smiles.

                                 RUTH
                        Okay, go on. I’ll talk to you soon.

           Naomi gives her mom a big hug, then runs into Julie’s car.

           Ruth approaches Julie. Unsure what to say.

                                 JULIE
                             (then)
                        Don’t worry, she’ll be fine.

                                 RUTH
                        I’m counting on it.

           With that, Julie gets into her car and drives away with 
           Naomi. Rain falls harder as Ruth stands there... 

           Watching them disappear into the distance. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           INT. RUTH’S TRAILER - BATHROOM - DAY

           RUTH stares in the mirror. One hand clutches her long blonde 
           hair. The other lifts up a pair of SCISSORS.

           With each cut of her hair, she begins to transform slightly --

           -- hardening right before our eyes.

           INT. RUTH’S TRAILER - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A PORCELAIN MAID DOLL shatters against the hard floor --

           -- revealing another FULL AMMO CLIP inside, along with THREE 
           INTERNATIONAL PASSPORTS.

           INT. RUTH’S TRAILER - KITCHEN - DAY

           Ruth peruses some of the OLD PHOTOGRAPHS of her mother, 
           Victoria, before throwing them away.
           Ruth rubs her temple. Another headache. Then she pops open a 
           bottle of PRESCRIPTION PILLS. Dry-swallows one.

           INT. RUTH’S TRAILER - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A SECRETARY DOLL shatters. Inside, a 9MM BARREL.

           A NURSE DOLL EXPLODES, revealing an OLD CELLPHONE.

           Then the teacher... and the librarian... 

           Hidden within each doll are pieces of Ruth’s past: a pistol 
           slide... recoil spring... more passports... ammunition. 

           INT. RUTH’S TRAILER - KITCHEN - DAY

           Sitting at the table, Ruth plugs the OLD CELLPHONE in. 

           Powers it on. Then types a message.

           TO BRYCE: “I need to see you.”

           As she hits send... the CAMERA PANS across the table... 

           Finding a 9MM HANDGUN freshly assembled. 

           INT. RUTH’S TRAILER - BATHROOM - DAY

           Ruth lifts her head up. Hair now short. Edgy. 

           The transformation complete.

           END SERIES:

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WASHINGTON, DC - DAY

           QUICK SHOTS establishing the city. Capitol Hill. Washington 
           Monument. White House. Pentagon. We’ve seen it all before.

           MORE SHOTS as we move away from the familiar. Into Southeast 
           DC. Crime ridden. Congested. Dilapidated Industrial parks. 

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL PARK - DAY

           Graffiti and barbed-wire. Homeless. Junkies. 
           TAXI drops Ruth off. The second she exits, the cab speeds 
           away. Even to a local cabbie this is a rough neighborhood.

           As Ruth stands in front of an abandoned OFFICE BUILDING, we 
           notice how different she looks. Dressed in a form fitting 
           outfit. Tailored pants. Crisp white shirt. 

           The air of a fierce businesswoman.

           INT. ABANDONED OFFICE BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

           Flickering fluorescent lights. More graffiti. Cobwebs. Piles 
           of trash. All mixed with the stench of piss and puke.

           Ruth walks to the front desk where a HOMELESS WOMAN has made 
           camp. Stained mattress. Overstuffed shopping cart. 

                                 HOMELESS WOMAN
                        Who the hell is you?

                                 RUTH
                        I need to see Bryce.

           Homeless Woman stares at Ruth like she’s crazier than her.

                                 HOMELESS WOMAN
                        You in the wrong damn place.

           Ruth notes an oddly high-tech SURVEILLANCE CAMERA fixed to 
           the lobby ceiling. It moves slightly. Watching her.

                                 RUTH
                        I don’t think I am.

           The way Ruth says it makes the Homeless Woman stand at 
           attention. Her face changes. Maybe Ruth isn’t so crazy.

                                 HOMELESS WOMAN
                        You wanna see Bryce?

                                 RUTH
                        Tell him it’s Ruth --

           Just then, a hallway DOOR opens and out struts BRYCE SHAW 
           (30s), buttoned-up, glasses. More hipster than gangster. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Would you look who the cat dragged 
                        in. The Queen Bee herself.

           Ruth offers a small smile. 
                                 BRYCE (CONT’D)
                        I thought your text was some kind 
                        of joke. But here you are.

           Bryce stands in front of Ruth. A loaded moment.

                                 BRYCE (CONT’D)
                        You look amazing.

           Bryce smiles. Ruth smiles back. 

                                 RUTH
                        Thanks. 

           They hug... but it lasts a little longer than expected. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Four years. I wasn’t sure I’d ever 
                        see you again.

           He clears some newspaper from a bench. They sit. 

                                 RUTH
                        I wasn’t sure I wanted to be seen.

           Bryce stares at her. Their history deep.

                                 BRYCE
                        When you left... I didn’t know what 
                        happened. Or where you went. 

                                 RUTH
                        Pennsylvania.

                                 BRYCE
                        Pennsylvania? 

                                 RUTH
                        To raise my daughter.

           Bryce’s jaw goes slack. He had no idea.

                                 BRYCE
                        Holy shit. A daughter? 

                                 RUTH
                             (nodding, proud)
                        Her name’s Naomi. She’s four.

           Bryce leans back in disbelief.

                                 BRYCE
                        Wow. You’re a mom.
                                 RUTH
                        Trying to be.

                                 BRYCE
                        So what are you doing here? I mean, 
                        shouldn’t you be at a PTA meeting 
                        or something?

                                 RUTH
                        I need to work.

           This piques his interest.

                                 BRYCE
                        You want to come back?

           Ruth nods. Then... like she were just stating a fact...

                                 RUTH
                        I’m dying, Bryce.

                                 BRYCE
                        What do you mean, you’re dying?

                                 RUTH
                        Brain cancer. I’ve got six months 
                        left. Maybe less.

           Bryce reels from all this new information.

                                 BRYCE
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 RUTH
                        It’s fine. I’m fine. But I need 
                        money to make sure Naomi doesn’t 
                        end up in the system when I’m gone. 

                                 BRYCE
                        What happened to your cash?

                                 RUTH
                        I spent everything I had to buy my 
                        way out. Lots of grudges that 
                        needed clearing up. Couldn’t risk 
                        any retaliations. Then there’s the 
                        papers, and everything else I 
                        needed to make a fresh start.

                                 BRYCE
                        Sorry, I didn’t know you were 
                        having such a rough go of it.
                                 RUTH
                        I had to choose between the job and 
                        Naomi. I don’t regret my choice.

                                 BRYCE
                        Yeah, of course.

           Ruth stands firm. Trying not to show desperation.

                                 RUTH
                        I need one job, Bryce. That’s it. 
                        But it needs to be big. Really big.

           Bryce ponders the request. Then...

                                 BRYCE
                        Maybe someone up there’s looking 
                        out for you, cause I actually have 
                        a job. A big fat whale that no one 
                        seems able to catch --  

                                 RUTH
                        I can.

           Bryce smiles.

                                 BRYCE
                        Glad to see you haven’t changed...

           Just then, the front door OPENS and FOUR HIRED THUGS enter.

                                 BRYCE (CONT’D)
                        Babylon hasn’t changed either. At 
                        least not when it comes to this.

                                 RUTH
                        I’m ready.

                                 BRYCE
                        You sure?

           THUG #1 moves towards Ruth. Sizing her up. 

                                 THUG #1
                        This is her? You’re kidding?

                                 RUTH
                             (to Bryce)
                        Just give me the job.

           The Thugs stand right over her now. 
                                 BRYCE
                        There’s always a test. You know 
                        that. Even for you.

           Ruth nods. Like a gymnast remembering an old routine, she 
           takes a deep breath. Settles herself.  

           Just then, Thug #1 lays his hand on Ruth’s shoulder --

                                 THUG #1
                        Let’s go bitch --

           -- which is the biggest mistake he’ll ever make.

           In one smooth motion, Ruth TWISTS Thug #1’s wrist and stands 
           upright, using the upward momentum of her shoulder to 
           grotesquely SNAP his arm at the elbow. 

           He screams.

           Thug #2 throws a punch. 

           Ruth dodges. 

           JAMS her extended fingers into his Adam’s apple.

           His eyes go wide. Gagging. Spitting. 

           Thug #3 lifts Ruth up. About to slam her against the wall 
           when she spins and SIDE KICKS him in the spinal column. 

           We hear the CRACK of a vertebrae as he collapses. 

           Thug #4 bearhugs her from behind. Bad move. 

           Ruth SMASHES her fist into his balls. 

           Grabs a handful and RIPS down like she were yanking a lemon 
           from the tree. He cries like a baby. 

           As Ruth tears them limb from limb (which takes all of ten 
           seconds) we see how flawless and mechanical her technique is. 

           She is an iron ballerina. Graceful. Precise. Dangerous.

           When it’s over, Ruth stands above the four motionless heaps. 

           She fixes her blouse. And her hair. 

           Then nods over to Bryce --

                                 RUTH
                        I pass?
           Bryce grins, then walks through the hallway doors. 

                                 BRYCE
                             (over his shoulder)
                        Let’s talk in my office.

           Ruth follows.

           INT. BABYLON INC - SAME

           As Ruth breaches the hallway doors, the dilapidated look of 
           the exterior and lobby are immediately gone. Now replaced 
           with modern design, architecture, and technology. 

           It’s like walking into a completely different building. More 
           Google headquarters. All right angles. Lots of glass.

           As Ruth follows Bryce through the main floor, dozens of 
           HIPSTER WORKERS, in their little cubicles, whisper and 
           gossip. All eyes on Ruth. The prodigal daughter returns. 

           -- “...That’s Ruth Stanton. The Ruth Stanton? She was 
           Babylon’s youngest contractor. She’s Victoria Stanton’s 
           daughter. They’re both legends. The best ever. I can’t 
           believe she’s back. Someone is so fucked...”

                                 BRYCE
                        Business has been booming since you 
                        left. We’ve doubled our contracts 
                        and taken over as the number one 
                        contract service in the country.

                                 RUTH
                             (re: hipsters)
                        They all look so young.

                                 BRYCE
                        We’re recruiting out of the top 
                        colleges now. Only the best for our 
                        corporate team. It’s all about 
                        technology, software, and 
                        application management. 

                                 RUTH
                        I thought it was all about killing.

                                 BRYCE
                             (sly grin)
                        Well, that too.
           INT. BRYCE’S OFFICE - LATER

           Large. Pristine. Overlooking the buzzing floor below. 

           Bryce sits with Ruth on a designer couch. Giant LCD display 
           on the wall near them. We note various NEWS programs. Every 
           country. Every language. But one thing connects them all:

           Every story is about some murder or accident.

           Bryce fixes on a report from France. A fatal car crash.

                                 BRYCE
                        Client wanted it to look like an 
                        accident. They always do. I think 
                        that’s another five-star rating.

           Ruth is impressed. Slightly puzzled.

                                 RUTH
                        These are all Babylon?

                                 BRYCE
                        We’ve gone Global.

                                 RUTH
                        Who’s doing all the actual work?

                                 BRYCE
                        Well, the ones like you, the real 
                        pros, they’re all retiring because 
                        they don’t like progress. It’s all 
                        new technology. The darknet markets 
                        have pretty much taken over the 
                        business and ninety-percent of my 
                        contractors are now freelance. They 
                        go through a rigourous application 
                        process of course, but I’ve got 
                        people doing jobs in every corner 
                        of the world. Some of them I’ve 
                        never even met. 

                                 RUTH
                        And you call that progress?

           Bryce shrugs.

                                 BRYCE
                        Babylon has become the Angie’s List 
                        of contract killing. It’s not a 
                        “look them in the eye business” 
                        anymore.

                                 BRYCE (CONT'D)
                        Now it’s a “hire someone online and 
                        let them do the dirty work” kind of 
                        business.

                                 RUTH
                        Guess I got out at the right time.

                                 BRYCE
                        I don’t know, someone with your 
                        skillset. You’d be a whole new 
                        category on our site.  

           Ruth rubs her temple. Another headache.

                                 RUTH
                        I only have time for one job. 

           This brings Bryce back to earth. A solemn beat. 

                                 BRYCE
                        You sure about this? 

                                 RUTH
                        I’m sure. 

           Bryce is still skeptical.

                                 BRYCE
                        When you left, you said you didn’t 
                        think you were the kind of person 
                        who could kill anymore. 

           A beat. Ruth stares at Bryce. 

                                 RUTH
                        Look at me now. What do you see?

           Bryce stares back. She is stone cold ready. 

                                 BRYCE
                        I see a killer.

           Ruth nods. 

                                 RUTH
                        So how much does this job pay?

                                 BRYCE
                        It’s a Platinum level assignment.

           Ruth is confused. Bryce smirks. Lets the anticipation mount.
                                 BRYCE (CONT’D)
                        Ten million U.S. 
                             (then)
                        Your daughter will never have to 
                        worry about anything ever again.

           Ruth exhales. This is what she was hoping for. 

                                 RUTH
                        Where’s the mark?

           Bryce leans back. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Well, he just so happens to be in 
                        one of your old stomping grounds. 
                             (then)
                        I hope your passport’s up to date. 

           Off Ruth’s curiosity...

                                                              SMASH TO:

           EXT. RIO DE JANEIRO - BRAZIL - DAY

           QUICK SHOTS. Christ the Redeemer. Sugarloaf mountain. 
           Copacabana. Maracanã Stadium.  

           EXT. INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Ruth exits among the crowds. Walks with purpose. Sunglasses 
           and hat cover her face as she hails a yellow taxi.

           MORE SHOTS as Ruth is driven away from the familiar. Towards 
           the south zone. Between São Conrado and Gávea. Into the slum.

           EXT. ROCINHA - DAY

           Rio’s largest favela. A city within a city. Steep. Built into 
           the hillside overlooking the beaches. Colorful. Dangerous.

           Ruth’s taxi drops her off in front of a small HOTEL wedged 
           between businesses in a crumbling concrete building. 

           Ruth exits. Scans the crowded street near the base of the 
           slums. Watches a group of young children play among the trash 
           laden sidewalks. Poor. But resilient.
           INT. HOTEL BOA VIAGEM - DAY

           Ruth approaches the hotel ATTENDANT, who glares at her 
           sideways. Curious about this gringo woman.

           (Note: Italics = Portuguese).

                                 RUTH
                             (perfect accent)
                        I need a room. Two weeks. Top 
                        corner and I’ll double your rate.

           The Attendant is surprised. But happy to rent out a room.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Sim Senhora.

           INT. RUTH’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Ruth peers out the window. The slums scattered before her 
           like discarded Legos on a hill. Mind already working.

                                 BRYCE (V.O.)
                        His name is Sebastian Volkov. “Lobo 
                        Russo”. The Russian Wolf.  

           On a bare wall, Ruth tacks up a picture of SEBASTIAN VOLKOV 
           (40s), balding, dark skin. Eyes of an egomaniac.

                                 RUTH (V.O.)
                        I need everything you have on him. 
                        Tell me every detail. 

           Ruth sits on the bed. Large FILE FOLDER on her lap.

                                 BRYCE (V.O.)
                        Sebastian wasn’t born in the 
                        favela. Mother was Brazilian. 
                        Father was a Russian diplomat.

           Ruth pores over various PHOTOS and PAPERWORK that document 
           every recorded moment of Sebastian’s life.

                                 BRYCE (V.O.)
                        He was your typical spoiled rich 
                        kid. And when his dad died, he left 
                        him a fortune, but that wasn’t 
                        enough for Sebastian. He didn’t 
                        want money. He wanted power.

           We see an old NEWSPAPER obituary on Sebastian’s father.
                                 BRYCE (V.O.)
                        When he came back to Brazil with 
                        his mother, he saw that power in 
                        the drug lords of the favela. He 
                        wanted to be feared and loved like 
                        they were. So he bought his way in. 
                        Started cutting down all of his 
                        competition until he was running 
                        his own section of the slum.

           PICTURES of Sebastian’s victims. Gruesome dismemberments. 
           More newspaper CLIPPINGS. The work of “Lobo Russo”.

                                 BRYCE (V.O.)
                        Sebastian was nothing like the 
                        people he controlled. He made them 
                        big promises and they believed he 
                        had their best interests at heart. 
                        The more he lied to them, the more 
                        they trusted him. The more they 
                        loved him.

           On her tablet, Ruth watches old SURVEILLANCE VIDEO of 
           Sebastian Volkov in the slum alleyways. The poorest people 
           flock around him, worshipping at his feet. Even in this 
           grainy footage, he has the air of a psychopathic cult leader. 

                                 BRYCE (V.O.)
                        Now he runs the favela and an army 
                        of soldiers that he’s used to gain 
                        control of Rio’s shipping ports. 
                        Drugs. Guns. He controls it all. 
                        Anything going in or out.

           PHOTOS of Sebastian’s soldiers patrolling the port. 

                                 BRYCE (V.O.)
                        And as you can imagine, this has 
                        made a lot of people very unhappy. 
                        Cartels, smugglers, even some 
                        corporations are having their goods 
                        stolen, then Sebastian turns around 
                        and sells them back at a mark up. 
                        That’s why the contract is so high. 
                        They’re pooling resources.

           More SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS of soldiers commandeering trucks and 
           shipping crates filled with cocaine and machine guns.

                                 BRYCE (V.O.)
                        But now he seems to be getting more 
                        paranoid. He’s locked himself in 
                        his compound, running his empire 
                        from the highest point of Rocinha.

                        Protected night and day by armed 
                        soldiers. Like a God perched on his 
                        very own Mount Olympus.

           AERIAL PHOTOS of Sebastian’s compound built in the highest 
           point of the favela. Made of metal and barbed-wire. Embedded 
           in the mountain. Guarded by armed soldiers. Dozens of them.

                                 BRYCE (V.O.)
                        But if you can find a way to storm 
                        the castle and bring this “god” to 
                        his knees... Naomi will be taken 
                        care of when you’re gone... 

           Ruth sits on the edge of her bed. Staring down at her tablet.

                                 BRYCE (V.O.)
                        She’ll have a future. 

           Ruth scrolls through pictures of Naomi. Her motivation.

           PULL BACK to see the wall behind Ruth. Now completely filled 
           with pictures, papers, schematics, and handwritten notes on 
           Sebastian Volkov and his operation. It’s like seeing the mind 
           of a mad genius at work. Purposeful chaos.

           Off this wide shot...

           EXT. ROCINHA - SLUM STREETS - DAY

           A MOTORCYCLE TAXI DRIVER approaches a line of 125cc 
           motorbikes parked outside a pharmacy. Full face helmet. 
           Wrinkled orange “taxi” vest. Gloves. Completely covered.

           As the driver hops on a bike and expertly maneuvers through 
           the crowded street... REVEAL it to be Ruth...

           Her mission begun.

           EXT. SEBASTIAN’S COMPOUND - LATER

           Row of fortified metal shanties connected by barbed-wire 
           fencing. The base of Sebastian’s compound. 

           One narrow gate, guarded by SIX ARMED SOLDIERS, rattles open, 
           allowing a caravan of reinforced Toyota TRUCKS to exit.

           The caravan of six vehicles barrels down the hill --

           -- followed by Ruth on her motorcycle taxi.
           EXT. SLUM STREETS - DAY

           SERIES OF SHOTS as Ruth tails the caravan through a condensed 
           labyrinth of narrow alleyways snaking down the hill.       

           EXT. PORT OF RIO - DAY

           One of South America’s largest ports. Shipping containers 
           piled high. Giant cranes. Layers of dirt and rust.  

           The caravan circles a CONTAINER with Colombian markings until 
           it’s completely surrounded. 

           FIFTEEN SOLDIERS jump out of the trucks. Guns aimed. But 
           there are two men in command. Sebastian’s generals:

           First is MATHEUS (40s). Greasy. Intelligent. Manic. The air 
           of a coke head. He seems to be the brains of the operation. 

           Then there’s NANDO (40s). Sinewy. Sadistic. The gaze of a 
           rabid pitbull. Takes pleasure in pain.  

           BEHIND A NEARBY CRATE

           Ruth turns off her motorcycle engine. In neutral, she coasts 
           closer. Watching. Listening.

           Ruth takes note as Matheus and Nando confront a small crew of 
           COLOMBIAN DRUG SMUGGLERS. Tensions run high. 

                                 MATHEUS
                        You know the rules. You know the 
                        price. Why is there confusion?

           The LEAD COLOMBIAN spits on the ground. Confers with his men.

                                 LEAD COLOMBIAN
                        One day Sebastian will get what’s 
                        coming to him. So will you.

           Matheus eye-conferences with Nando. Then smirks

                                 MATHEUS
                        You gonna pay or not?

                                 LEAD COLOMBIAN
                        You’d be willing to start a war 
                        over one container?
                                 MATHEUS
                        There’ll be no war. 
                             (then)
                        Only blood.

           In a flash, Nando lunges forward --

           -- SNATCHES the Lead Colombian’s head and begins SAWING at 
           his pulsing neck with a jagged knife. It’s gruesome and lasts 
           a long, agonizing minute. Blood everywhere.

           Sebastian’s Soldiers lift their guns. Ready to mow the 
           Colombians down. They shake with anger. And fear.

                                 MATHEUS (CONT’D)
                             (to next Colombian)
                        You gonna pay or not?

           The Second Colombian nods. Throws over a satchel of CASH.

                                 MATHEUS (CONT’D)
                             (smirking)
                        See you next week.

           With that, Matheus nods to Nando, who drops the body of Lead 
           Colombian. His neck dangling like a broken Pez dispenser.

           Sebastian’s Soldiers enter their caravan and drive off.

           Ruth starts her motorcycle, about to follow the caravan --

           -- when three of Sebastian’s BIKER SOLDIERS cut her off. 

                                 BIKER #1
                        What are you doing here?

           Ruth remains still. If she takes off her helmet, her cover 
           will be blown. A blonde American woman is too suspicious. 

                                 BIKER #2
                        Get off the bike! Now!

           Another long beat -- 

           -- before Ruth TWISTS the throttle. 

           Tires SMOKE as she whips the bike around and BARRELS towards 
           the center of the shipping yard. 

           The Three Bikers pursue. 
           EXT. SHIPPING CONTAINERS - DAY

           AERIAL VIEW as Ruth speeds between two towering walls of 
           containers. On the outside, the three bikers run parallel to 
           her. Until they split apart. Trying to head her off.

           Ruth senses the attack and breaks hard as Biker #1 crosses 
           directly in front of her. 

           Now Ruth pulls out. Chases him. Just as Biker #1 realizes 
           he’s being followed --

           -- Ruth pits his back tire with her front, causing him to  
           fiercely wobble and SMASH head first into the metal side of a 
           container. Flattened like a pancake.

           Ruth slides her bike around, searching for her next target.

           BIKER #2 slowly drives through an aisle of containers, 
           looking down every alley as he passes. 

           When he reaches a clearing -- 

           -- Ruth’s bike SHOOTS OUT like a heat-seeking missile.

           She pops the front wheel and SLAMS rubber into the side of 
           his body. Knocking him down. His bike topples to the ground 
           as Ruth rides right over the top of him --

           -- SPINNING the back tire on his chest and helmet. RIPPING 
           his jacket to shreds. SHATTERING his face mask. 

           Just then, a RIBBON OF BULLETS ping off the container. 

           Sparks shower Ruth as she dodges gunfire. 

           BIKER #3 now on her tail. 

           Ruth evades. Speeding down a long runway towards the water.

           More BULLETS pock the dirt around her -- 

           -- but she’s an expert rider. Weaving aggressively around 
           equipment, crates, and parked vehicles.

           Ruth gains speed. 

           STEERS for a RAMP that shoots directly into the water and a 
           departing TUG BOAT fifty yards out. 

           She’s gonna try and jump onto it.

           Biker #3 gains. UZI raised. Firing. 
           He sees Ruth crest a small hill in front of him, CATAPULTING 
           through the air towards the tug boat...

           But she misses the landing and CRASHES into the water.

           Biker #3 slams his brakes just in time. Stopping at the edge 
           of the ramp, he watches the churning water to see if Ruth 
           emerges. He waits. Gun at the ready.

           When without warning, he takes a HARD KICK to the helmet.

           He falls to the ground. Uzi snatched from his hands.

           RATATATATATATATAT. A barrage of bullets riddle his body.

           As he dies, Biker #3 gazes up...

           Shocked to see Ruth standing above him. 

           Sans helmet. Hair blowing in the wind.

           A blonde angel of death.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RUTH’S HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

           Standing at the window, overlooking the orange gloom of the 
           favela, Ruth talks on her new work cellphone. 

                                 RUTH 
                             (on phone)
                        I followed his top lieutenants but 
                        lost them. It’s like you said, he’s 
                        locked himself in his compound. 

                                                              INTERCUT:

           INT. BRYCE’S OFFICE - SAME

           Bryce sits at his desk. Watching more news reports.

                                 BRYCE
                             (on phone)
                        Then find a way in. Quick. I’m 
                        getting word that the contract is 
                        heating up again.
           INT. RUTH’S HOTEL ROOM

                                 RUTH
                        You said it was mine.

                                 BRYCE
                        It is. But I never said it was 
                        exclusive. There’s been at least 
                        two recent failed attempts, which 
                        means Volkov’s on high alert.

                                 RUTH
                        How many contractors are active? 

                                 BRYCE
                        Not sure. But I wouldn’t be 
                        surprised if other networks are 
                        involved. All I do know is that the 
                        client will pay the first person to 
                        complete the job. So make it you.

           Ruth paces. A beat.

                                 BRYCE (CONT’D)
                        Ruth?

           Ruth sits on the bed. A large SHOPPING BAG beside her.

                                 RUTH
                        Yeah.

           Bryce takes a moment. Emotions surfacing.

                                 BRYCE
                        Promise me something.

                                 RUTH
                        What?

                                 BRYCE
                        That you’ll be careful.

           Ruth opens the bag and extracts its contents.

                                 RUTH
                        I can’t promise that.

                                 BRYCE
                        Then what can you promise?

           Ruth stares down at something on the bed. 
                                 RUTH
                        That Sebastian Volkov will die.

           Bryce can’t help but smile as Ruth hangs up the phone.

           Ruth stands, kisses her hand and touches a PICTURE of Naomi 
           tacked to the wall amidst the mission details. 

           As Ruth heads into the bathroom to shower... 

           CAMERA PANS over to the bed... REVEALING a gorgeous WHITE 
           DRESS with her 9MM laying on top of it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. VALHALLA NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

           Rocinha’s hottest dance club. No velvet ropes and red carpets 
           here. Just a massive crowd of people. Ready to party.

           INT. VALHALLA - NIGHT

           CIRCULAR ROOM encased in mirrors. Like being inside a disco 
           ball. Light pulsates. Hundreds of gyrating bodies dance and 
           push against the glass. Smell of sweat. Drugs. Sex.

           FOLLOW that white dress as it saunters its way through the 
           crowd. People part. Staring. Gawking. Drooling.

           As Ruth finally makes it to the quieter back bar, we get our 
           first clear view of her... and we are not disappointed. Dress 
           fits her body like a glove. Hair. Make-up. Sexy personified.

           Ruth orders a rum. Takes a long drink. Every eye in the place 
           is on her. Sparkling like a diamond. 

           Ruth spots something across the room that draws her 
           attention... 

           Or more accurately.. someone. 

           BRUNALDO, a ridiculously hot Brazilian, dances. His stomach 
           muscles throb, peaking out from his unbuttoned shirt. Shorts 
           so tight you can see everything. A boy toy piece of meat. 

           Ruth finishes her drink and slides over. He eyes her.

                                 RUTH
                        I want to see how well you move 
                        your body. 

           Brunaldo turns towards her. Starts dancing closer.
                                 BRUNALDO
                        Like this?

                                 RUTH
                        No.

           Brunaldo seems confused. His confidence wanes.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        I want to see how well you move 
                        your body inside me.

           This catches him off guard. But he smiles.

                                 BRUNALDO
                        I live close by.

                                 RUTH
                        Anything closer?

           Now he smirks.

                                 BRUNALDO
                        I bartend here. There is a room in 
                        the back. Yes?

           Ruth leans in. Sensually kisses his lips. That’s a ‘yes’.

           Brunaldo turns and escorts Ruth behind the bar. The Bartender 
           winks at them as they step through a hidden back door.

           INT. BACK HALLWAY - SAME

           Sudden silence. Just the vibration of throbbing bass as they 
           walk a circular hallway surrounding the dance floor. Clubbers 
           on display behind the glass like fish at an aquarium.

           A sexy couple dances against the one-way glass. No idea 
           they’re being watched from the other side. 

                                 RUTH
                        They can’t see me?

           Brunaldo moves up. Presses his crotch into her back.

                                 BRUNALDO
                        They can’t hear you either. The 
                        back rooms are all soundproof.

           He kisses her. The throng of dancers gyrating behind them. 

                                 RUTH
                        What goes on in these rooms?
                                 BRUNALDO
                        Whatever you want.

           Ruth spins him around. Now pressing her crotch into his back.

                                 RUTH
                        I heard some girls talking about a 
                        Russian Wolf. Is that you?

           She licks his ear. Manhandling him. He likes it.

                                 BRUNALDO
                        No. Sebastian. He owns the club.

                                 RUTH
                        Is he your friend? Is he here?

           She reaches around. Rubs the outside of his shorts.

                                 BRUNALDO
                        No. He never comes here. But his 
                        Lieutenant has his own room down 
                        the hall. He has many party favors 
                        if you want some.  

           Ruth pushes him harder into the glass. His face pressing 
           against it. Inches from the dancers on the other side.

                                 RUTH
                        Good... 

           Ruth runs her hand through his hair. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Because I like to party -- 

           -- then SMASHES his face against the glass.

           KNOCKING him out cold. 

           The dancers on the other side look curious for a brief moment 
           as the mirror wobbles ever so slightly. 

           Ruth scans the circular hallway. No one around. 

           She drags Brunaldo into a NEARBY CLOSET. 

           NEXT CUT:

           BARREL of a 9MM slides into position. Locked. Loaded.

           Gun at her side, Ruth makes her way down the hallway, peaking 
           around the first corner to see FOUR SOLDIERS standing guard 
           at a door marked, “PRIVATE. NO ENTRY”.
           Ruth tucks the gun into her garter belt. Lifts up the bottom 
           of her dress. Showing her legs. Giving them room to maneuver.

           She then stumbles around the corner. Big sloppy smile. Acting 
           like a drunk, flirtacious American bimbo.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the party? I wanna party.

           The Four Soldiers share glances. Like lions and a lamb.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Who wants to have some fun?

           The Four Soldiers let down their guard. Slowly circle.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Cause this is gonna be fun.

           The first to meet the lioness and find out who the lambs 
           really are... is Soldier #1.

           As he leans into Ruth, she KNEES him in the balls then 
           sidekicks Soldier #2 in the throat. 

           Both of them stumble.

           Ruth is brutal and precise in her attack. 

           ELBOW to Soldier #3’s jaw. Followed by a series of powerfully 
           fast JABS to his neck. Collapses his trachea.

           Soldier #4 gets in a RIGHT HOOK to Ruth’s face. She shakes it 
           off -- HEADBUTTS his nose. Cracks it. Blood pours.

           Soldier #1 and Soldier #2 join forces and begin WAILING on 
           Ruth. She takes the pain. Welcomes it. 

           Ruth SPINS, parries, goes low -- SWEEPS Soldier #1’s leg. He 
           falls. Ruth STOMPS her heel into his face. 

           She then FRONT KICKS Soldier #2 in the chest -- 

           -- SLAMS him back against the glass. It cracks. Now we can 
           hear the music from the club leaking through. More bass.

           In one final flurry of brutal attacks, Ruth SNAPS the leg of 
           Soldier #3 and PISTOL WHIPS Soldier #4. 

           As the glass spiderwebs... the distorted reflection reveals 
           Ruth to be the last one standing. 

           With a quick breath, Ruth enters the “private” door.
           INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

           One SURVEILLANCE GUARD watches a security monitor of the main 
           room, where NINE MEN (including Matheus) mill around, 
           laughing, drinking, doing drugs. 

           At the center of the main room, a TEENAGE SLUM DWELLER sits 
           on a chair. He looks petrified. 

           Before the Surveillance Guard can even turn around --

           -- Ruth WHIPS him in the head with the butt of her gun.

           As he falls to the ground, Ruth gets a clear view of the 
           monitor. Now realizing what’s happening in the main room. 

           Blood boils as she grabs a GUN from the Guard’s holster.

           Now with a gun in each hand, Ruth studies the monitor, 
           watching how the nine men move inside the room.

           She begins twirling her arms like an orchestra conductor. 

           The same motion. Over and over and over again. 

           Burning the arm movements into her muscle memory.  

           INT. MAIN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           THE BARREL OF A REVOLVER pressed to the Young Slum Dweller’s 
           head. CHAMBER rotates into position. Hammer slides back. 

           Finger on the trigger... CLICK. 

           Young Slum Dweller cries silently as Matheus and the eight 
           other men laugh, cheer, and exchange sweaty wads of cash in 
           their twisted game of Russian roulette.

                                 MATHEUS
                        My turn! My turn!

           Matheus grabs the pistol. 

           PUSHES it into the mouth of the Young Slum Dweller before 
           making some bets with the other men.

                                 MATHEUS (CONT’D)
                        Come on come on come on!

           CHAMBER rotates into position. The glint of a silver bullet.

           The Young Slum Dweller shudders. 
           Just as the bullet is about to discharge --

           -- Ruth KICKS through the door.

           The men reach for their guns but they’re too late. 

           Using the practiced “orchestra conductor” arm movements, Ruth 
           fires EIGHT perfectly precise shots --

           -- and eight Men, sans Matheus, crumble to the floor. Dead.

           Matheus is in shock. He pulls the gun out of the Slum 
           Dweller’s mouth. But before he can get a fix on Ruth --

           -- she UNLOADS two bullets. One into each of his knees.

           With an agonizing scream, Matheus falls to the ground.

           Ruth surveys the scene. Lets the Young Slum Dweller free 
           before turning her attention to Matheus.

           She hoists him onto the chair. Grabs the roulette REVOLVER.

                                 MATHEUS (CONT’D)
                             (mumbling, in pain)
                        Fuckin bitch. 

           Ruth hovers over him. SPINS the revolver chamber.

                                 RUTH
                        How do I get into Sebastian’s 
                        compound?

           Matheus laughs. 

                                 MATHEUS
                        Who the fuck are you? 

                                 RUTH
                        Someone who has a job to do.

                                 MATHEUS
                        Another assassin? You? You’ll never 
                        kill him, you stupid little cunt --

           Ruth presses the revolver barrel to the fatty underside of 
           Matheus’s bicep. RAPID SQUEEZES the trigger five times -- 

           -- CLICKCLICKCLICKBANGCLICK.

           The flesh of his arm RIPS apart. Matheus SCREAMS in agonizing 
           pain. The shrill sound causes Ruth to squint. A migraine. 
           Her head pounds. Things go blurry. She stumbles. But Ruth 
           fights through the pain and gathers herself. 

           Hands shaking slightly, she loads another bullet.

                                 RUTH
                        I asked you a question. How do I 
                        get into Sebastian’s compound?

                                 MATHEUS
                        Fuck you! He can’t be killed. Even 
                        if you get inside, one sound and an 
                        army will descend on you.

           Ruth shakes her head. Wrong answer. 

           She TRIGGER SQUEEZES again, pointing at his other bicep -- 

           -- CLICKBANGCLICKCLICK.

           Both of Matheus’s shredded arms now hang limp at his side. 

           The shock setting in.

                                 RUTH
                        I could put this gun to your head 
                        and kill you with it, understand? 
                        But if you tell me how to get into 
                        Sebastian’s compound I will not 
                        kill you with this gun. 
                             (repeating)
                        Do you understand?

           Ruth loads another bullet.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        How do I get into the compound?

           She shoves the revolver against his forehead -- CLICKCLICK --

                                 MATHEUS
                        There is a way! There is a way!

           Ruth lowers the gun.

                                 MATHEUS (CONT’D)
                        Northwest side. In the market. 
                        There’s a door. We have passageways 
                        we use for certain deliveries. They 
                        lead all the way up the mountain. 

           Ruth peers down at Matheus. Then she lifts her 9MM --
                                 MATHEUS (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing? You said you 
                        wouldn’t kill me?

                                 RUTH
                             (re: revolver)
                        I said I wouldn’t kill you with 
                        that gun. 

           Ruth FIRES her 9mm point blank. Blows his brains out.

           But before Ruth exits, she does something strange...

           She SMEARS blood on her arms and face. RIPS her skirt. 

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Looking beaten and battered, Ruth stands outside of the 
           closet door. Hears BANGING from inside. 

           She opens the closet. Brunaldo is inside. Confused.

           Ruth is now crying, hysterical. A bloody mess.

                                 RUTH
                        They killed everybody! They’re 
                        dead! All dead!

                                 BRUNALDO
                        Who? What happened?

                                 RUTH
                        I think they were Colombians. After 
                        they hit you, they took me. 

           Brunaldo is frantic, overwhelmed.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        They killed everybody!

           Brunaldo runs down the hall, leaving Ruth.

           Soon as he’s gone, she calmly wipes the blood from her face.

           EXT. VALHALLA - NIGHT

           GROUP OF SOLDIERS and POLICE run into the club. Crowds of 
           panicked partygoers scatter. Total chaos. Confusion.

           SNIPER POV
           From an adjacent rooftop, ANOTHER ASSASSIN, who we never get 
           a clear look at, scans the front of the club. 

           Rifle scope FINDS Ruth in her white dress. 

           CROSSHAIRS stay locked on her as she pushes her way through 
           the gathering crowd...

           And then she vanishes. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SEBASTIAN’S COMPOUND - NIGHT

           Flickering street lights cast shadows on the structure.

           INT. SEBASTIAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           KNIFE saws into a bloody steak. Sebastian Volkov sits at his 
           gold-plated desk, in his gold-plated room, filling his fat 
           face. Everything about him and the decor is ostentatious.

           Sebastian is heavier than his pictures. Bloated. Hair spread 
           thin over his balding head. Leather skin unnaturally dark.

           Sebastian talks to Nando and a group of Soldiers that we 
           recognize from the club. Mouth always full.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Ten men and nobody saw anything?

                                 CLUB SOLDIER #1
                        We believe it was the Colombians.

                                 NANDO
                        They weren’t happy about the last 
                        shipment. I sent a message.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        And this is their reply?

           Sebastian chugs vodka from a gold chalice.

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        If no one saw anything, then who 
                        said it was the Colombians?

           Just then, two Soldiers walk Brunaldo in. A bundle of nerves.

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        You work the bar?
                                 BRUNALDO
                        Yes. Three days a week.

           Sebastian’s fork pierces meat. He takes another bite. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        What were you doing there tonight?

                                 BRUNALDO
                        I was just having fun.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        And you saw what happened?

                                 BRUNALDO
                        Well, no. I was knocked out. But 
                        the girl I was with. She saw.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Girl?

                                 BRUNALDO
                        A gringo. Blonde. American I think.

           Sebastian finds this curious.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        American?

                                 BRUNALDO
                        They beat her. She was bleeding.

           Sebastian stands up. KNIFE in one hand. Fork in the other.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Where is this girl now? I would 
                        like to hear her story.

           Sebastian approaches. Brunaldo eyes the knife. Trembling.

                                 BRUNALDO
                        I don’t know. I never got her name. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Then you’re useless --

           In a flash, Sebastian STABS Brunaldo’s neck with the fork. 

           Brunaldo clutches his throat. Blood seeps out as he stumbles. 

           Sebastian nonchalantly walks back to his desk.
                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Double the compound guards. And 
                        find the Blonde American girl.
                             (to Nando)
                        I’m counting on you to handle this.

           Nando nods with reverence, then turns and exits. 

           Sebastian goes back to his meal as Brunaldo flounders on the 
           ground like a dying fish.

                                                                CUT TO:

           TEXT MESSAGE ON RUTH’S PERSONAL PHONE

           FROM GARRETT: “How’s your situation?”

           INT. RUTH’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Fresh out of the shower, Ruth sits on her bed, texting.

           Ruth: “Everything’s good. Back to work.”

           Garrett: “Gimmme a call if you wanna talk. I am retired. 
           Plenty of free time. Good luck with the job.”

           Ruth: “Thanks. It’s the last one before MY retirement ;) -- 
           that’s a winkey face fyi.”

           The tiny smile on Ruth’s face dissipates, replaced by a more 
           sorrowful expression. 

           CLOSE ON the word “retirement”. Which now takes on an 
           entirely new meaning. Just as she pops another pill --

           -- a facetime call comes in from “JULIE BABYSITTER”. But in 
           Ruth’s screen, we see Naomi’s chubby cheeks.

                                 RUTH
                             (answering)

                                                              INTERCUT:

           INT. RUTH’S TRAILER - LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Upside down on the couch, Naomi talks to her mom. Giddy.

                                 NAOMI
                             (on phone)
                        Hey mom!
           INT. RUTH’S HOTEL ROOM 

           Ruth can’t help but smile at her little bundle of energy.

                                 RUTH
                        What’re you doing? Where’s Julie?

                                 NAOMI
                        Cooking. We’re having meatloaf.

                                 RUTH
                        Sounds yummy. Everything else okay?

           Naomi sits upright. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You never finished the story.

                                 RUTH
                        What story?

                                 NAOMI
                        About the Queen and the Gargoyle.

                                 RUTH
                        Oh yeah.

                                 NAOMI
                        Did she kill him?

                                 RUTH
                        Well, I was gonna finish that story 
                        when I got home. How’s that?

                                 NAOMI
                        Okay, mommy.

           Naomi is distracted. We can hear Julie calling her to eat.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Time to eat. Luv luv, BUG!

           Naomi kisses the screen. Then hangs up.

           Ruth takes a moment. A sad smile on her face. 

                                 RUTH
                        Luv luv.

           Another beat before Ruth puts her phone away. She then takes 
           a deep breath to center herself. There’s still work to do.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. COPACABANA BEACH - DAY

           Miles of golden beaches. Tanned bodies. Like the opening of a 
           Travel Channel show. South America at its most glorious. 

           EXT. MAMA’S DEEP DISH PIZZA - DAY

           “Original Italian” pizza on the less populated side of the 
           boardwalk. Seems like a terrible idea for this location.

           INT. MAMA’S DEEP DISH PIZZA - DAY

           Small. Quaint. Mostly empty except for the smiling older 
           WOMAN who works the counter, dishing out a slice to a young 
           local. This is MAMA (60s), full of energy, joy, wisdom. You 
           get the feeling that she’s “mama” to everyone she meets.

           Ruth enters. Stops to get a good look at Mama. 

                                 RUTH
                        You got anchovies?

           Mama turns to see Ruth. Her eyes light up. 

                                 MAMA
                        Ruthie!

           Mama bounds around the counter, swallows Ruth up in a loving 
           hug. Ruth smiles. For a moment, she seems like a happy kid.

                                 RUTH
                        Hey Mama.

           Mama sets Ruth down. Soaks her in. Can’t stop smiling.

                                 MAMA
                        Oh my little Ruthie, you look more 
                        beautiful than you did the last 
                        time I saw you. When was that? 

                                 RUTH
                        ‘08.

                                 MAMA
                        Oh yeah, I remember now. Your 
                        mother was working outta the city, 
                        you two came up for a beach day. 
                             (then)
                        That was the year she died.

           Ruth nods. 
                                 MAMA (CONT’D)
                        You look just like her. Guess 
                        you’re similar in other ways too.

           A slight glimpse of emotion in Ruth. Then --

                                 MAMA (CONT’D)
                        Lemme show you round the place. 

           Mama leads Ruth into --

           THE KITCHEN

           Where a giant BRICK OVEN takes up half the space. The fire 
           inside its mouth burns bright. And hot.

                                 MAMA
                        I’ve got something that’ll really 
                        wet your appetite.

           Mama uses a long wooden pizza peel/spatula to reach inside 
           the oven and --

           -- CLICK. On the broad side of the oven, a HIDDEN DOOR slides 
           open. Mama smiles. Motions for Ruth to enter. She does.

           INT. THE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Total contrast to the grungy pizza shop. Modern, sleek, airy, 
           and sophisticated. Every inch of it filled with high-tech, 
           cutting edge weaponry. The “Apple Store” of weapon shops. 

                                 MAMA
                        You shoulda seen this place back in 
                        your mom’s day. I started selling 
                        pistolas outta the back of an old 
                        truck. She was my best customer.  

                                 RUTH
                        She loved her guns. Taught me how 
                        to blind reload a Sig 25 before I 
                        could tie my shoes.

                                 MAMA
                        You say that like it’s a bad thing. 
                        She was one of the first women in 
                        the business. That means something.

                                 RUTH
                             (flippant)
                        It means she was a terrible mother.
           Mama seems to take offense.

                                 MAMA
                        You turned out pretty good. 

                                 RUTH
                        I am who I am in spite of her, not 
                        because of her. 

                                 MAMA
                        Yeah, well it was a different time 
                        back then. Trying to have a career 
                        and be a mother was unheard of. 

                                 RUTH
                        I know. She had a choice. And we 
                        both know how that went.

                                 MAMA
                        And you?

                                 RUTH
                        I choose my daughter.

                                 MAMA
                        But you’re here, still working.

                                 RUTH
                        It’s a one time job.

           Mama sizes up Ruth. Then...  

                                 MAMA
                        At the end of the day, all you can 
                        really do for a child is love them.
                             (sincere)
                        And I know your mother loved you.

           Ruth wants to believe that. But she doesn’t.

           A long beat. Then Mama changes the subject.

                                 MAMA (CONT’D)
                        I think that’s enough reminiscing 
                        for one day, let’s get down to 
                        business. When you put in your 
                        order, you said the job was covert 
                        and needed to be done in stealth... 

           Ruth nods. Mama escorts her towards the back -- 

           -- where a LARGE BLACK METALLIC CASE waits.
                                 MAMA (CONT’D)
                        I think this should suffice. 

           Mama clicks open the case. Ruth peers in. Smiles.

                                 MAMA (CONT’D)
                        A lady should always have the 
                        perfect outfit for every occasion.

           Mama stands next to Ruth. Puts a loving arm over her shoulder 
           as they both stare down at what’s inside the weapons case.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MARKET - NIGHT

           The base of Volkov’s compound. Bottom of the hill. An old 
           sign that simply reads: “Mercado.” 

           Two of Sebastian’s SOLDIERS enter, followed moments later by 
           a MUSLIM WOMAN in a burqa.

           CAMERA LINGERS... 

           LANDS on a shadowy figure, carrying a shoulder-strapped rifle 
           case, moving quickly across the street. 

           The other assassin. 

           INT. MARKET - NIGHT

           Thick layer of dust covers every aisle, which are all filled 
           to the brim with ten-year old products. 

           The Two Soldiers confer with a MUSCULAR GIRL (20s), tattoos, 
           piercings, bad attitude, who works the counter.

           The Muslim Woman peruses an aisle. Intense blue eyes peak 
           through the dark veil... REVEALING her to be Ruth. 

           RUTH’S POV

           Soldiers mumble something about a delivery. The Muscular Girl 
           seems annoyed. Until finally, she agrees to their request.

           The Two Soldiers walk towards the far wall. Stand and wait in 
           front of the polished steel FREEZER DOOR.

           The Muscular Girl grunts a few Portuguese curse words, then 
           reaches under the counter and PRESSES A BUTTON.

           A light next to the freezer door BLINKS. CLICKS. Unlocked. 
           The Two Soldiers open the sizeable door and enter.

           NEXT CUT:

           Muscular Girl leans against the counter, reads a copy of VIP 
           magazine. Grinning to herself about some pop culture joke.

                                 RUTH (O.S.)
                        Do you have cigarettes?

           Muscular Girl glances up to see Ruth, in burqa, approaching.

           Ruth sets down a dusty BOTTLE OF RED WINE. 

           The Muscular Girl eye-rolls the burqa. Shakes her head in 
           disapproval. Blatant xenophobia.

                                 MUSCULAR GIRL
                        I thought you people weren’t 
                        allowed to smoke or drink.

           Ruth clocks the area behind the counter. Spots the FREEZER 
           DOOR BUTTON. She lifts up the bottle of wine --

                                 RUTH
                        You could join me.

                                 MUSCULAR GIRL
                        I would never drink with you --

           In a flash, Ruth WHIPS the bottle across Muscular Girl’s 
           face. KNOCKS her to the ground with a deep THUD.

           Ruth hops the counter and pushes the DOOR BUTTON.

           She then runs over to the freezer door. CLICK. Unlocked

           But before opening the door, Ruth removes the burqa like a 
           magician shedding her cloak. 

           As the cloth flutters to the ground in SLOW MOTION...

           REVEAL Ruth in all her badass glory. Black Kevlar tactical 
           vest, fully equipped with two compressed Ruger SR22s, and a 
           syringe gun loaded with 5ml cartridges of some unknown drug.   

           Ruth puts on the final pieces of her outfit:

           Two “Serb-Cutters”: custom fit gloves with razor-sharp blades 
           that jut out from the bottom of each palm like shark fins. 
           This allows for full use of her hands and fingers while 
           simultaneously being able to slice and stab.  

           Now dressed to kill... Ruth opens the door and enters --
           INT. HIDDEN CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Narrow passageways built between the walls of multiple 
           shanties and shacks. A string of harsh fluorescent bulbs 
           illuminate the dank, squalid labyrinth of corridors.   

           Ruth moves stealthily --

           -- when she hears Soldiers approaching.

           Ruth quickly tucks herself under a pile of old wood pallets 
           as FIVE ARMED SOLDIERS march past. These corridors allow 
           Volkov’s Soldiers to covertly navigate the entire hillside.

           Ruth slips out of the shadows, moves in the opposite 
           direction. Peaks around a corner --

           -- and clocks FOUR SOLDIERS standing guard.

           Ruth grabs a silenced Ruger SR22 for each hand. Holds the 
           guns to her head in prayer. Takes a moment. 

           Thinks of Naomi.

           And then...

           Like a whirling dervish, Ruth runs the gauntlet --

           -- FIRING a barrage of shots.

           Three SILENCED BULLETS take out Soldier #1. 

           Two to the chest. 

           One to the face. 

           Dead before he hits the ground.

           The other THREE SOLDIERS raise their guns --

           -- but Ruth is too fast. 

           They never get off a shot. 

           A bullet to Soldier #2’s chest. 

           About to scream, Ruth’s curved blade SLICES his throat. 

           She never stops. Never slows. 

           Soldier #3 has his finger on the trigger. 

           Takes TWO SHOTS to his arm and hand. Drops the gun.
           Ruth descends on Soldier #4. 

           Three precise movements. 

           SLITS a tendon in his arm. 

           STABS a pressure point in the neck. 

           With a final spin, she executes the kill blow to his jugular. 

           Soldier #3 regroups. Charges. Terrible idea. 

           Ruth ducks. Dodges. Slices and dices. Stabs and kicks. 

           He was dead two moves ago. 

           They’re all dead.

           But Ruth doesn’t take any time to admire her handiwork. She 
           just keeps moving. Resolute. 

           After a moment, Ruth rounds a corner and finds a rusty LADDER 
           built into the wall. 

           Ruth climbs up. Exits through a small hatch.

           EXT. VOLKOV’S COMPOUND - LOWER TIER

           Ruth emerges into the night air. Surrounded by another maze 
           of metal shanties and shacks. All spiralling upward. She’s 
           like a rat stuck inside a mountain of trash. 

           ONE CONTINUOUS TAKE as Ruth navigates through nooks, 
           crannies, aisles, and alleys. Covertly makes her way higher.

           Up ahead, a small stream of SMOKE leaks around the corner. 

           On the other side, a SOLDIER puffs a cigarette. He takes one 
           last drag. Drops the butt. 

           Just when he stomps his foot on the cherry --

           -- A BLADE glints from the shadows and slices his ankle.

           As the Soldier folds down to his knees, Ruth slinks out of 
           the darkness and STABS the life out of him. 

           But now she’s exposed, and one of Sebastian’s Soldiers gets 
           the drop on her. Massive. All muscle. We’ll call him BIG BOY.

           Big Boy UPPERCUTS Ruth and she drops her gun. Then he LIFTS 
           her up and SLAMS her down. Hard. She drops the other gun.
           Ruth scurry-crawls towards the corner of the roof, but Big 
           Boy chases. SNATCHES her leg. LANDS an ELBOW into her spine. 

           Ruth anguishes in pain as Big Boy pounces. Two-hundred forty 
           pounds of muscle straddles her as he unloads HAMMER FIST 
           after HAMMER FIST.

           Ruth struggles to deflect the powerful blows, but many of 
           them connect. 

           Big Boy YANKS her up and HURLS her against the wall --

           -- SLAMMING her head. Everything goes fuzzy... distorted. 

           Ruth tries to focus. To fight. But she can’t lock in.  

           Ruth HEADBUTTS Big Boy. Nothing.

           Big Boy HEADBUTTS Ruth. Cracks her nose. Blood GUSHES. 

           Big Boy throws Ruth to the ground. Nearly unconscious.  

           It’s almost over.

           As Big Boy bounds towards Ruth, she makes one desperate and 
           final reach for the SYRINGE GUN on her vest.

           CLOSE ON a small label. Reads: “5ml adrenaline.”

           Ruth loads THREE CAPSULES and injects herself.

           And then...

           The adrenaline kicks in. 

           Ruth rises to her feet. Eyes flutter. Lips quake.

           For a moment, Big Boy seems confused. But he attacks anyway. 

           His confusion soon replaced by pain.

           Ruth is a wild animal. She KICKS him in the groin. STOMPS his 
           foot. HEADBUTTS the lower side of his chin, causing him to 
           bite off his tongue and GURGLE blood.

           Ruth SWEEPS his leg and Big Boy falls. 

           After a ferocious barrage of attacks, Big Boy lets the final 
           twitch of his life escape. Now just a hump of grisly meat.

           Ruth GASPS for air as the adrenaline subsides. 

           In so much pain, she POPS more medication.
           Ruth then lifts her eyes. Glances up at the top-floor WINDOW 
           of the compound. Sebastian’s so close she can smell him.

           Ruth gathers all her strength... and rises to her feet.

           The job’s not finished yet.

           INT. MARKET - NIGHT

           MUSCULAR GIRL is lifted to her feet. Still dazed. Nando 
           stands nearby. Surrounded by armed Soldiers.

                                 NANDO
                        Who did this?

           TWO SOLDIERS enter from the freezer door. Panicked.

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        There’s more men here. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        All dead.

           Muscular Girl looks up. Cheek swollen. Eye black.

                                 MUSCULAR GIRL
                        She was covered. I couldn’t --

                                 NANDO
                        She?

           Muscular Girl nods. Concerned, Nando dials his phone.

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                             (to soldiers)
                        Alert our men. 

           INT. SEBASTIAN’S OFFICE - SAME

           SCREAMS OF A YOUNG GIRL named ISADORA (18). Terrified. Tied 
           to the wall. Crying as Sebastian LASHES her with a dog whip. 

           With each THRASH, Sebastian licks his lips, grinding his 
           crotch into Isadora’s back as he drools.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Your screams make me hard.

           She trembles. Sebastian whips her again. And again.

           -- interrupted by his RINGING PHONE. 
                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                             (answering)
                        What?!

                                                              INTERCUT:

           INT. MARKET - SAME

           Nando paces. More Soldiers arrive. Locked and loaded.

                                 NANDO
                             (on phone)
                        The girl. The blonde American. 
                        She’s here.

           INT. SEBASTIAN’S OFFICE - SAME

           Sebastian’s face changes.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        What do you mean, she’s here?

                                 NANDO
                        Inside the compound. She’s a 
                        professional.

           For the first time... we sense fear in Sebastian.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Then what are you waiting for? 
                        Bring me her fucking head! 

           Out of frustration, Sebastian WHIPS Isadora again.

           She SCREAMS.

           EXT. SEBASTIAN’S OFFICE - SAME

           Ruth is right outside so she can hear the SCREAM.

           Just as Ruth is about to enter, TEN SOLDIERS burst out of a 
           nearby door, chattering about a “blonde assassin” as they run 
           into Sebastian’s office. 

           Ruth hides. Pissed. There goes her element of surprise.

           TWO SOLDIERS take up the rear. Standing guard.

           Ruth clocks their weaponry. UZIs.

           She takes a deep breath. Still battered. Drained.
           Ruth squints. Another headache. POPS more medication --

           -- then INJECTS herself with her last capsule of adrenaline.

           EYES DILATE. WIDE. READY.

           Ruth jolts out of her hiding place --

           -- and attacks with renewed vigor.

           INT. SEBASTIAN’S OFFICE - SAME

           Sebastian stands, circled by his TEN SOLDIERS, when he hears 
           the sounds of MACHINE GUNS and MAYHEM right outside.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                             (panicked)
                        Kill her!

           The Ten Soldiers run through the door.

           SCREAMS and more GUNFIRE.

           Sebastian can do nothing but listen to the symphony of 
           violence playing out on the other side of the walls.

           BULLETS riddle the plaster.

           CRACK. A body THUDS into a section of wall.

           More RATTLING SHOTS.

           Pictures fall. Shatter on the ground.

           The action moves around Sebastian... circling... 

           His imagination runs wild.

           Another SCREAM.

           Followed by a BLOODIED HEAD crashing through wood.

           Finally... the long murderous orchestra ends in SILENCE.

           Just Sebastian’s labored breathing and Isadora’s sniffles.

           MORE SILENCE.

           -- CRAAAAAAAASH --
           A Soldier’s body BURSTS through the front door. Shredded with 
           bullet holes. A pulverized jumble of blood and flesh.

           Then... entering through the now gaping doorway...

           Is Ruth.

                                 RUTH
                        Sebastian Volkov.

           Uzi at her side, Ruth emerges. Hair matted. Blood trickling 
           down her face. Pale. Etched in fresh scars. 

           The very embodiment of death itself.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Listen to me. I can pay...

           Sebastian backs away. Cornered by his gold-plated desk.

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll double your fee. Double --

           -- cut off by the snap of GUNFIRE.

           A ribbon of BULLETS rip through Sebastian’s body as he 
           collapses to the ground. Blood pools. Dead.

           A moment as Ruth stands there. Inhales a deep breath. 

           Her mission complete.

           The moment is broken by Isadora, who looks upon Ruth, her 
           savior, with both surprise and adulation --

                                 ISADORA
                        Who are you?

           Ruth says nothing. Just frees Isadora from bondage.

           Outside, Ruth hears the commotion of approaching Soldiers. 

                                 ISADORA (CONT’D)
                        Nando will be here soon. 

           Ruth offers Isadora a small nod, then glances down at 
           Sebastian’s body. BANG. One more shot between the eyes for 
           good measure before she just turns and walks away.

           EXT. LOWER TIER - MOMENTS LATER

           The whole favela is awake. Even the SIRENS of la policía.
           In a dark alley, Ruth is kneeled down. Extracts a flat, 
           vacuum-sealed PACKAGE from underneath her vest.

           INT. SEBASTIAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           SEBASTIAN’S BULLET RIDDLED BODY. Standing over him are Nando 
           and a team of their most dangerous Soldiers. 

           A glint of emotion flickers behind Nando’s sadistic eyes.

                                 NANDO
                        One million US dollars to anyone in 
                        the favela who kills her.

           Soldiers glance at each other. Eager. This is HUGE.

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                        I want every man, woman, and child 
                        in Rocinha hunting this bitch.

           Nando kneels down. Lovingly caresses Sebastian’s cheek.

           EXT. SEBASTIAN’S COMPOUND - NIGHT

           The narrow gate rattles open allowing a caravan of SOLDIER’S 
           TRUCKS to enter, along with the corrupt police force.

           A CROWD has gathered to see the commotion.

           CAMERA FINDS Ruth, wearing a brunette wig and “favela 
           clothes.” She blends in perfectly with the slum dwellers as 
           she limps down the hill... away from the compound.

           As Ruth gets a few steps from the entrance, she pulls out her 
           work phone and begins typing out a text.

           TO BRYCE: “Job is done --”

           We now realize that the CAMERA POV is actually...

           SNIPER POV

           Crosshairs hover over Ruth’s heart.

           In a stroke of luck, she gets bumped by a Slum Dweller --

           -- just as the SHOT RINGS OUT.

           BULLET explodes in Ruth’s shoulder.

           She FALLS to the ground. 
           CROWD screams. Police scramble over. Blood puddles.

           RUTH’S POV

           On a nearby rooftop, she spots a SHADOWY FIGURE perched 
           behind the scope of a sniper rifle... 

           But then everything goes blurry...

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. SEBASTIAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           RUTH’S EYES SNAP OPEN. 

           Her POV of a fist slamming into her face.

           Ruth, in tattered black pants and a T-shirt, takes the hit. 

           SPITS blood.

           Ruth is tied to a chair at the center of the room. Surrounded 
           by more Soldiers, including Nando, who PUNCHES her again.

                                 NANDO
                        Who hired you?

           Ruth clocks her familiar surroundings. 

                                 RUTH
                             (bloody, sarcastic smile)
                        Where’s your boss? 

           Nando furiously WAILS on Ruth. 

                                 NANDO
                             (getting tired)
                        Who hired you!?

           Ruth is a pulpy wreck.

                                 RUTH
                        Just shoot me. Save us the time.

           Ruth smiles again. Nando backs off. 

                                 NANDO
                        You’re ready to die? 

                                 RUTH
                        Gotta go sometime.
                                 NANDO
                        And you have no reason to live?

           A flicker of emotion in Ruth. She swallows it down.

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                        What about for revenge?

                                 RUTH
                        Revenge is poor motivation. 

           Nando gathers himself. Walks towards the desk.

                                 NANDO
                        If it were me, I’d want to know who 
                        tried to kill me.

                                 RUTH
                        Someone got mad that I did a job 
                        they couldn’t. Simple as that.  

                                 NANDO
                        Or maybe someone wanted to take 
                        credit for the job you did. 

           Ruth shakes her head. Not buying it.

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps Bryce.

           Nando now holds Ruth’s WORK CELLPHONE. He shows her the 
           phone. Unsent Text message on screen. 

           TO BRYCE -- “Job is done.” 

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                        Bryce is the one who sent you, 
                        right? Who is he? Your handler?
                             (no reply)
                        He knew you were in Rio, didn’t he? 
                        So he let you do the job, and when 
                        it was done, he did you.  

           Ruth’s head pounds. Eyes straining.

                                 RUTH
                        He wouldn’t --

           Nando circles closer.

                                 NANDO
                        Are you sure? How much was the 
                        contract? Sebastian was a very 
                        wanted man. 
           Ruth SQUINTS. Fighting the migraine. Her eyes close. Trying 
           to remember, but it’s hard. It’s all so foggy. 

           FLASH CUT:

           Back to Ruth lying on the pavement. Bleeding out.

           She stares up at the adjacent rooftop. Her POV of a SHADOWY 
           FIGURE perched behind his sniper rifle.

           The image is fuzzy... clouded... but then it focuses...

           REVEALING a glimpse of the man who shot her... 

           Bryce.

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Nando smirks at Ruth’s expression.

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                        I was right, wasn’t I? You work for 
                        Bryce and he betrayed you. 

           Anger bubbles in Ruth. 

                                 RUTH
                        Bryce hired me to kill your boss. 
                        But you don’t have to worry about 
                        him.

                                 NANDO
                        Why is that?

                                 RUTH
                        Because I’m going to kill him 
                        myself.

           Nando smiles. Finding a bit of joy in this game.

                                 NANDO
                        Yes, now I see the life flickering 
                        back into your eyes. You have a 
                        purpose. A burning desire to live. 
                        To finish what you started.

           Nando grabs something else from the desk. A STEAK KNIFE.

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                        And now I am going to take that 
                        from you. To make sure you never 
                        get what you want. That Bryce walks 
                        away with your money. And you die 
                        here in the slums for nothing. 
           Nando presses the KNIFE under Ruth’s cheek.

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                        You hear me? For nothing.

           A sudden rage ignites in Ruth’s eyes as she SNAPS down her 
           jaw. Biting Nando’s hand.

           He pulls back. Cutting her cheek with the knife. 

           SCREAMING at the top of her lungs, Ruth stands and CHARGES 
           like a bull towards the window --

           -- SHATTERING glass as she leaps out --

           EXT. SEBASTIAN’S COMPOUND - SAME

           -- and PLUMMETS twenty feet. 

           PINBALLING off the metal rooftops until she SLAMS into the 
           hard dirt road.

           Ruth glances up. Sees Nando and his Soldiers scrambling.

           Somehow, Ruth finds the strength to lift her mangled body up 
           and hobble-sprint down the hill.

           EXT. SEBASTIAN’S COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

           Narrow gate still ajar. Crowd’s gone. Commotion over.

           Ruth scans her surroundings. DARTS across the street and into 
           another set of tight alleyways.

           EXT. SLUM STREETS - NIGHT

           Ruth may be out of the compound, but she’s still stuck high 
           up in the favela. More than a mile to the bottom of the hill.

           In a narrow alley, Ruth staggers against the wall. Blood from 
           her shoulder wound SMEARS the cement. She needs medical help.

           Up ahead, Ruth spots a YOUNG BOY kicking a soccer ball 
           against the embankment. 

           Ruth approaches.

                                 RUTH
                        I need help. A doctor?

           The Young Boy locks on her. Curious. And then --
                                 YOUNG BOY
                             (screaming)
                        I found the blonde girl!

           Nearby doors swing open. CLATTER of feet. 

           Everyone within earshot is sprinting this way.

           Ruth turns and runs. Young Boy keeps screaming.

           NEXT CUT:

           Ruth rounds a corner. It seems safe. Until --

           GUNFIRE rings out. 

           PEPPERS the metal wall next to her.

           Ruth takes off as a group of LOCALS chase after her. FIRING.

           BULLETS thisclose to her head.

           She keeps running... her head pounds... but she won’t stop.

           NEXT CUT:

           Ruth limps down a narrow path flanked by brick walls.

           She’s completely drained. Wounded.

           Ruth spots an opening where part of the wall has crumbled 
           like a bomb recently exploded.

           Ruth achingly climbs the rubble and enters --

           EXT. CONCRETE COURTYARD - NIGHT

           Lit by a string of white Christmas lights powered by a small 
           gas generator, SIX GANGSTERS mill about, throwing knives and 
           play fighting with sticks. Placing bets.

           They immediately spot Ruth. 

                                 RUTH
                             (annoyed)
                        Fuck.

           She tries to back away. But they’re piqued.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Please. I just want to pass.

           They know exactly who Ruth is. 
                                 GANGSTER #1
                        She’s the one who killed Sebastian. 
                        Which means she must be good.

           Two Gangsters move between Ruth and the exit. 

           Knife blades GLINT in the torchlight. 

                                 RUTH
                        You don’t have to do this.

           The Gangsters surround her.

           Gangster #1 gestures to the others with his knife.

                                 GANGSTER #1
                        We split the bounty.

           Ruth clocks the encroaching gangsters. There’s too many of 
           them. She’s badly injured, and this time, she has no weapon. 

           If Ruth wants to win this fight, she needs an advantage. 

           That’s when Ruth hobbles towards the generator and flips off 
           the power, plunging the courtyard into moonlit darkness.

           FOOTSTEPS on the concrete. BLADES shimmer. Men GRUNT. 

           Ruth’s piercing BLUE EYES scan her surroundings...

           And the onslaught begins.

           FLASHES of carnage as flesh is sliced and stabbed. BODIES 
           fall to the ground. A flurry of brutal GLIMPSES.

           Until we hear a FINAL SCREAM. 

           Then silence. Followed by the RATTLE of the generator. 

           The Christmas lights FLICKER to life, revealing Ruth standing 
           in the middle of the mortally wounded gangsters.

           She YANKS a knife out of her leg. Tosses it aside.

           Ruth tries to move, but she’s hurt. Bad. Off balance -- 

           -- she topples to the ground.

           Luckily, there’s someone there to help her. The young girl 
           from Sebastian’s office... Isadora. 

                                 ISADORA
                        I live close. I can help.
           Isadora helps Ruth to her feet. Ruth is too exhausted to 
           doubt or argue. As they exit the courtyard... 

           ANGLE ON one of the wounded Gangsters... watching.

           INT. ISADORA’S HOME - LATER THAT NIGHT

           One room shanty. Small cot. Electric griddle. Gas lamp. But 
           thoughtful details show us that Isadora takes pride in her 
           home. Curtains. Art. A shelf of trinkets. This is true 
           poverty... yet somehow feels cozy. 

           Looking better, Ruth sits by the fire. Tightens a leg bandage 
           made out of her shirt sleeve. Another one on her shoulder. 

           Isadora never takes her admiring eyes from Ruth. 

                                 RUTH
                        I need to get out of Rocinha 
                        tonight. Is there a way?

                                 ISADORA
                        Impossible. Nando has the entire 
                        favela surrounded. Every exit is 
                        guarded by an army of his men, 
                        including the police. And there is 
                        a one million dollar price on your 
                        head. Which means every person in 
                        the slum is now your enemy. 

           Ruth glares at Isadora. Cautious.

                                 RUTH
                        What about you? That’s a lot of 
                        money. Why didn’t you take it?

           Like it were the greatest gift --

                                 ISADORA
                        Because you killed Sebastian.

                                 RUTH
                        Was that the first time he...?

                                 ISADORA
                        No. He and Nando. They do much 
                        worse together. Much worse.
                             (then)
                        They have been like a cancer to the 
                        favela. Thanks to you, part of it 
                        is now gone. But Nando will 
                        continue to infect the people. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ISADORA (CONT'D)
                        And he will not stop coming after 
                        you until you’re dead.

           With a morbid grin --

                                 RUTH
                        I’m already dead.

           Isadora is confused. Ruth doesn’t want to get into it.

                                 ISADORA
                        I’ve never seen someone like you. 
                        Smarter, stronger, deadlier than 
                        the men. I want to be like that.

                                 RUTH
                        You’re a woman. You already are.

           They share a small smirk.

                                 ISADORA
                        Can I ask you a question?

           Ruth nods.

                                 ISADORA (CONT’D)
                        How did you learn to kill?

           A beat.

                                 RUTH
                        My mother.

                                 ISADORA
                        Your mother was an assassin?

                                 RUTH
                        One of the first. One of the best.

                                 ISADORA
                        That must have been good for you to 
                        grow up with.

                                 RUTH
                        Not really. I just wanted to go to 
                        prom. Not weapons training.

                                 ISADORA
                             (perplexed)
                        You are not close with your mother?
                                 RUTH
                        I was. In the beginning. But she 
                        was always working, always so 
                        paranoid. She would move us around 
                        from place to place at the drop of 
                        a hat. One day she left for a job 
                        and never came home. They say she 
                        got killed by her mark, but who 
                        knows. 

           Isadora takes that in. She can relate.

                                 ISADORA
                        My mother is dead too. She died in 
                        the drug wars. When Sebastian first 
                        took over. My father died then too. 

                                 RUTH
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ISADORA
                        I wish she was here. Whether she 
                        was a farmer, a shopkeeper, or a 
                        killer like you. Just knowing she 
                        loved me would be enough. 

           This hits Ruth in the heart.

                                 RUTH
                        She does love you. A mother always 
                        does. Even in death. I promise.

           Isadora smiles. She likes the thought of that.

                                 ISADORA
                        And you? Do you have a child?

                                 RUTH
                        Yes. A daughter. Naomi.

                                 ISADORA
                        And you need to get home to her?

                                 RUTH
                        Yes.

           A beat. Isadora makes a decision.

                                 ISADORA
                        Okay. I can help you.

                                 RUTH
                        How?
                                 ISADORA
                        Cow’s blood.

           Off Ruth’s curious expression...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAWN

           Sun peaks over the patchwork of shanties. Sunlight falling on 
           the modest store front. Crates and pallets stacked outside. 

           At the end of the street, a barricade. Police patrol.

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY

           Yesterday’s meat hangs on hooks. Cows, pig, goat. Dangle like 
           flesh and bone chandeliers. Bugs swarm. No refrigeration.

           Isadora ladles cow blood from a brimming trough into a LARGE 
           CONTAINER the size of a bathtub.

                                 ISADORA
                        Every morning the owner sends a 
                        container to the port. He sells 
                        them to the Chinese. Says it’s from 
                        rainforest monkeys. They think it’s 
                        medicine or something.

                                 RUTH
                        And no one checks inside?

                                 ISADORA
                        Would you?

           Ruth glances at the tub of murky blood. Shakes her head.

                                 ISADORA (CONT’D)
                        I’ve worked here for two years. You 
                        will make it out. I promise.

           Ruth nods. Accepts her word.

                                 ISADORA (CONT’D)
                        The driver will be here soon. Make 
                        sure you don’t move until you get 
                        past the favela boundary.

           Ruth climbs into the tub of blood. 

                                 RUTH
                        Thank you.
                                 ISADORA
                        Maybe one day I will see you again. 
                        And your daughter and I can ride 
                        horses together.

           Isadora offers Ruth a hopeful smile.

                                 RUTH
                             (lying)
                        Yes. Definitely.

           Isadora secures a metal lid to the top of the tub. Save her 
           nose, mouth, and eyes, Ruth is fully submerged. Through a 
           tiny crack in the seam, she can see outside the container.

           Isadora gives the tub a gentle tap as TWO DRIVERS arrive at 
           the door. Their truck idles out front.

           RUTH’S POV

           From inside the sloshing container as the Driver’s wheel her 
           through the shop and towards the entrance.

           Isadora stands alone. Watching. Smiling. But then...

           Isadora’s moment of joy transforms into panicked fear.

           Ruth tries to get a better vantage --

           EXT. BUTCHER SHOP - SAME

           -- but now she’s outside. In the street. 

           As the container gets loaded onto the truck, Ruth hears a 
           recognizable voice -- 

                                 NANDO (O.S.)
                        Is that her?

           Ruth catches a quick glimpse of Nando, three Soldiers, two 
           Policemen, and the Wounded Gangster from the courtyard.

                                 WOUNDED GANGSTER
                        Yes. I saw them together.

           Nando and his posse enter the butcher shop.

           Ruth squirms for a moment. A decision being made. 

           But then... she lays still... 

           And the truck rambles away.
           INT. BUTCHER SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           ISADORA GETS SLAMMED against the wall. Shrinks to the ground.

           Nando and his men tower over her.

                                 NANDO
                        Where is the American?

                                 ISADORA
                        I don’t know.

                                 WOUNDED GANGSTER
                        She’s lying. I saw her.

           Nando leans down. Inches from Isadora’s face.

                                 NANDO
                        Tell me or die. 

           Isadora says nothing.

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                        You’re willing to die for this 
                        gringo woman?

           She glares into his sadistic eyes. With a morbid grin --

                                 ISADORA
                        I’m already dead.

           Nando shakes his head in disgust. He stands. GUN aimed at the 
           cowering girl.

                                 NANDO
                        You’re right about that.

           ANGLE ON a nearby wooden table. BUTCHER KNIFE rests there,  
           until a BLOOD-COATED HAND reaches for it.

           Isadora remains defiant. Nando grips the gun tighter.

                                 NANDO (CONT’D)
                             (to Gangster)
                        You’re sure it was her?

                                 WOUNDED GANGSTER
                        Yes. She helped --

           BUTCHER KNIFE flies across the room. THUDS into Wounded 
           Gangster’s back. Folds him over. 
           Nando, the three Soldiers, and two Policemen draw their 
           weapons. Begin FIRING at Ruth --

           -- who darts behind slabs of SWAYING meat.

           BULLETS rip into flesh. But not hers.

           Ruth SOMERSAULTS low. KNIFES the leg of Soldier #1.

           As he loses balance, Ruth SNATCHES his gun. FIRES two shots 
           to his skull. Fragments and blood.

           Ruth is relentless. Possessed. Sheathed in crimson blood.

           She RATTLES off a barrage of shots --

           -- MOWS down the two Policemen.

           Soldier #2 sneaks up behind her, but Ruth is ready -- 

           -- DROPS, spins, and FIRES three shots to his abdomen.

           Soldier #3 sees the carnage. Then sees Ruth covered in cow’s 
           blood. Demonic. Like the grim reaper herself. 

           He’s had enough. And runs.

           Ruth has the killshot, but doesn’t take it. Instead, she 
           turns her attention to Nando, who clutches Isadora’s neck. 

           Pistol to her head.

           Ruth inches closer. Eye-conferences with Isadora.

                                 RUTH
                        What about you, Nando? Are you 
                        ready to die?

           Nando’s FINGER tickles the trigger.

                                 NANDO
                        I have nothing left to live for.

           Ruth gives Isadora the slightest glance --

                                 RUTH
                        Well I do.

           -- and Isadora DROPS. 

           It’s all the opening Ruth needed. TWO PERFECT SHOTS. Nando’s 
           brain splatters the wall behind him. Morto.

           Before Ruth can lower her gun, Isadora jumps into her arms.
                                 ISADORA
                        You came back for me.

           Isadora hugs Ruth tight. Like a daughter. 

           And Ruth accepts the embrace like a mother. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOTEL BOA VIAGEM - DAY

           BLACK TRAVEL BAG thrown into the back of a taxi. Ruth, who 
           looks just patched up enough to travel without too much 
           suspicion, slams the trunk. Isadora stands on the sidewalk. 

                                 ISADORA
                        When will I get to meet your 
                        daughter? 

           Ruth takes a moment.

                                 RUTH
                        One day. I’ll make sure of it. 

           Isadora smiles. Bittersweet. Ruth moves for the taxi.

                                 ISADORA
                        What are you going to do now?

                                 RUTH
                             (then)
                        I’m gonna go get paid.

           Ruth hops in back and slams the door closed. 

           INT. TAXI - DAY

           The taxi drives off as Ruth types a text message on her 
           personal cellphone.  

           TO GARRETT: “I need a favor. Can you help?”

           A long pause before reply... 

           Garrett: “Of course. Everything okay?”

           Ruth: “Need you to watch Naomi. Protect her from Bryce.”

           Garrett: “Bryce?????”

           Ruth: “I’ll explain everything soon. Thanks.”
           With that, Ruth hangs up the phone.

           As the Taxi speeds away from the buzz of the favela, it seems 
           to sparkle with a more vibrant, lively, and joyful energy... 

           Like a disease has been cured.

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL PARK - DAY

           LEATHER BOOTS bound down a concrete sidewalk. They turn and 
           stop. Ruth stands in front of a familiar office building.

           This time she’s wearing a BACKPACK. Carrying a 9MM.

           INT. ABANDONED OFFICE BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

           Ruth marches with furious purpose. The Homeless Woman at the 
           desk sees her. About to say something --

           -- when Ruth SHOOTS out the surveillance camera.

                                 HOMELESS WOMAN
                        The fuck are you doing!?

           Ruth leaps the counter. JAMS her gun into the Homeless 
           Woman’s temple.

                                 RUTH
                        I need to see Bryce.

           Homeless Woman stares at Ruth like she’s crazy.

           INT. BABYLON INC - MOMENTS LATER

           Ruth breaches the hallway doors --

           -- and FIRES three rounds into the ceiling.

           The buzz of the office falls silent. Dozens of Hipster 
           Workers stop what they’re doing. Frozen in fear.

                                 RUTH
                        Bryce!

           Ruth empties her backpack onto the floor.

           A myriad of EXPLOSIVES. 
                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Bryce?!

           Hipster Workers quiver. Exchanging nervous glances.

           Now holding a detonator in her other hand --

           -- Ruth FIRES again.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        WHERE IS BRYCE??!!

                                 BRYCE (O.S.)
                        Ruth?!

           Ruth turns to see Bryce running over. In shock.

                                 BRYCE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 RUTH
                        Give me my money and I’ll let you 
                        die slowly.

           Bryce is taken back. Almost insulted.

                                 BRYCE
                        What money? 

                                 RUTH
                        It was you. You set me up.

                                 BRYCE
                        What are you talking about? The 
                        contract got paid to someone else, 
                        and when I didn’t hear from you, I 
                        thought you were dead. 

                                 RUTH
                        Someone else? Who?

                                 BRYCE
                        I don’t know. But it was paid out.

           Ruth struggles. Another HEADACHE comes on strong.

                                 RUTH
                        I saw you. In Rio.

                                 BRYCE
                        Rio? What are you talking about? 

           Ruth is sweating. VEINS bulge. Everything is fuzzy.
                                 RUTH
                        You were there. You shot me.

                                 BRYCE
                             (worried)
                        I haven’t been there in years. 
                        Ruth, you need to calm down. You’re 
                        not well. You’re sick. 

           Ruth points her wobbling gun at Bryce. He stays back.

                                 RUTH
                        I saw you...

           Ruth squeezes her eyes shut. Straining.

           FLASH CUT:

           Back to Ruth lying on the pavement in Rio. Bleeding out.

           She stares up at the adjacent rooftop. Her POV of a SHADOWY 
           FIGURE perched behind his sniper rifle.

           The image is murky... clouded... and it never focuses...

           Maybe it wasn’t Bryce after all.

           BACK TO SCENE:

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                             (confused, unsure)
                        No... I saw... I saw...

           Ruth’s head THROBS. She reaches for her medication. 

           STUMBLES. Knees wobble.

           Bryce runs to help as Ruth COLLAPSES hard to the ground --

           -- PILLS scattering everywhere. 

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           RUTH’S EYES FLUTTER OPEN. She’s laying on a bed inside a 
           pristine, white-walled room. Cutting-edge medical equipment. 

           Bryce sits next to her.

                                 BRYCE
                        Hey. How you feeling?
           Ruth blinks her eyes. Cracks her neck.

                                 RUTH
                             (surprised)
                        Good.

           Bryce moves closer. Sincere in his concern.

                                 BRYCE
                        I thought you were...

                                 RUTH
                        I am. Just not yet I guess.  

                                 BRYCE
                             (trying to cheer her up)
                        Yeah, well, if you weren’t already 
                        dying, I’d kill you myself.

           A small moment of relief. Then Ruth leans her head back. 

                                 RUTH
                        I’m sorry I accused you... I 
                        just... haven’t been myself. The 
                        headaches. Everything’s so foggy.

                                 BRYCE
                        It’s okay. I understand.

           Bryce takes a beat. Treads carefully.

                                 BRYCE (CONT’D)
                        Have you gotten your affairs in 
                        order? I mean, is everything ready? 

                                 RUTH
                        Not yet. Not until I find out who 
                        set me up and stole Naomi’s money.

                                 BRYCE
                             (fishing)
                        What about her father? Maybe he can 
                        help. Who is her father?

           Ruth stares at Bryce. She wants to answer, but can’t.

                                 BRYCE (CONT’D)
                        Ruth? 

           Ruth locks eyes with Bryce. A long moment. And just as she 
           begins to open her mouth... the doctor walks in.

           That’s what he’s called. DOCTOR (50s). Brilliant, impolite.
                                 DOCTOR
                        I’d say it was nice to see you 
                        again, Ruth, but that’d be a lie.

                                 RUTH
                        Doctor.

           Doctor checks his folder. Peruses some MRI scans.

                                 BRYCE
                        So what’s the diagnosis?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Still waiting on a few tests... 
                             (referencing file)
                        But we’ve got a bullet wound to the 
                        right supraspinatus, clean exit. A 
                        three-inch laceration to the left 
                        vastus lateralis. Needed a Tetnis 
                        shot for that one. Then there’s the 
                        plethora of abrasions and 
                        contusions. I guess the diagnosis 
                        is... just another day on the job.

                                 RUTH
                        What about my head?

                                 DOCTOR
                        As thick as it’s always been.
                             (checking another file)
                        But when did you start taking 
                        Amaryl for diabetes?

                                 RUTH
                             (confused)
                        I don’t have diabetes.

           Doctor glances at Ruth. Intrigued.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Then why the hell’re you on Amaryl?

                                 RUTH
                        My pills? The doctor said they 
                        would help with the headaches.

           Doctor is confounded.

                                 DOCTOR
                        If you don’t have diabetes, this 
                        medication would cause headaches. 
                        Along with dizziness, fainting, 
                        short term memory loss, even loss 
                        of vision and hallucinations.
                                 RUTH
                        What about the cancer?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Whose cancer?

                                 RUTH
                        Mine. Glioblastoma. Brain cancer.

           Doctor points to an MRI scan of her brain.

                                 DOCTOR
                        See that right there? 

                                 RUTH
                        I don’t see anything.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Cause there’s nothing to see.

                                 RUTH
                        Are you saying I don’t have cancer?

                                 DOCTOR
                        That’s exactly what I’m saying.

           Ruth still can’t believe it.

                                 RUTH
                        Are you sure? 

           Doctor glares at her. Insulted.

                                 DOCTOR
                        When I give a diagnosis, it’s an 
                        accurate one. Otherwise, with my 
                        clientele, I would’ve been dead a 
                        long time ago. 

           Ruth is shell-shocked. Bryce too.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Cancer? Who the hell told you that?

           Fuming, Ruth rises up from the bed. Grabs her clothes.

                                 BRYCE
                        What are you doing? 

           Ruth reaches the door.

                                 BRYCE (CONT’D)
                        Wait, Ruth, is there something I 
                        can do to help? Can I call someone? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRYCE (CONT’D)
                        At least tell me where you’re 
                        going? Ruth, where are you going!?

           Calling over her shoulder --

                                 RUTH
                        To a get a second opinion.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           A MAN’S FACE SHATTERS a wall of MRI scans. Hard to tell 
           because of all the blood... but it’s the baby-faced Dr. Gate. 

           Ruth drags him across the floor. Then she props him up and 
           SHOVES her gun under his chin.

                                 RUTH
                        Talk.

           Dr. Gate squirms. Petrified.

                                 DR. GATE
                        I was just doing what he paid me to 
                        do. That’s all. 

                                 RUTH
                        Who paid you?

                                 DR. GATE
                        I don’t know his name. He needed a 
                        drug that would cause the headaches 
                        and then he made me give you a 
                        terminal diagnosis. I’m sorry, I 
                        am, but I needed the money --

           Ruth WHIPS her gun across his face.

                                 RUTH
                        Who paid you?

                                 DR. GATE
                        I told you I don’t know! He was 
                        older. Tough looking guy. Kept 
                        saying I was his “worker bee” --

           The breath is knocked out of Ruth. 

           FLASHBACK TO:

           HOWARD’S DINER -- PREVIOUS SCENE --
           After just getting her diagnosis, Ruth sits in the corner 
           booth... as Garrett enters. 

                                 GARRETT
                        I see a little worker bee.

                                 RUTH
                        Hey little ant.

           Ruth stands up and they share a warm hug. 

           LATER --

           Ruth and Garrett talk. Every word takes on new meaning now.

                                 GARRETT
                        You really want my advice? 

           Ruth nods sincerely. Garrett leans in. 

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        If money can help your situation... 
                        then Bryce is your man.

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Ruth staggers. Head now clear as she realizes the truth.

           FLASH CUT:

           Ruth lying on the pavement in Rio. Bleeding out.

           She stares up at the adjacent rooftop. Her POV of a SHADOWY 
           FIGURE perched behind his sniper rifle.

           The image is now sharp and focused... REVEALING a clean view 
           of the man who shot her... GARRETT. 

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Ruth is snapped out of her memory, interrupted by her RINGING 
           PHONE. She glances at the screen. Incoming call: Garrett.

                                 RUTH
                             (answering phone)
                        You’re dead, you know that?

                                                              INTERCUT:

           INT. PETERSBURG GLASS - SAME

           CLOSE ON Garrett walking down the main floor. Phone to ear. 
                                 GARRETT
                             (on phone)
                        So were you until a few minutes 
                        ago. And now you have a new 
                        appreciation for life. You should 
                        thank me. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME

                                 RUTH
                        I will. Right before I kill you.

                                 GARRETT
                        You know what, I think we should 
                        talk this out in person. Mano-e-
                        womano. Clear the air a bit.

                                 RUTH
                        Name the time and place.

           Garrett stops in the middle of the floor.

                                 GARRETT
                        How about the old day job? It’s the 
                        weekend. We can be alone. And I 
                        still have the key I made to sneak 
                        into the break room and spike your 
                        thermos with Amaryl.

           Garrett smirks. Ruth clenches her teeth.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        And Ruth. Come alone. Or my little 
                        guest here will end up like you 
                        were supposed to. 

           For the first time... we sense fear in Ruth...

           REVEAL that Garrett has Naomi. He’s been dragging her behind 
           him like a sack of rocks. Naomi is scared. Confused.

                                 NAOMI
                        Mommy --

                                 GARRETT
                        See you soon.

           Garrett hangs up. 

           Off Ruth... fear transforming to wrath...

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. PETERSBURG GLASS - DAY

           AERIAL VIEW of the expansive industrial complex. Like the 
           blue collar version of a medieval castle. Smoke stacks 
           replace castle towers. Metal fences and concrete castle 
           walls. And an empty parking lot for a moat.

           A DOZEN ARMED MERCENARIES covertly patrol the fortress. And 
           overhead, perched on scaffolding, are the SNIPERS.

           These are not third-world slum soldiers. But military 
           trained, the “best money can buy,” Grade A killers.

           INT. PETERSBURG GLASS - MAIN FLOOR

           AUTOMATED CONVEYORS run alongside the center aisle, molding 
           bottles from sheets of molten glass. Nearby furnaces glow.  

           The factory whirs with life. Operating without personnel.

           INT. BREAK ROOM - DAY

           WHISKEY pours into a paper cup. Garrett screws the lid on his 
           flask. Savors a long sip. Offers a drink to Naomi, who cowers 
           in an adjacent chair. Duct tape over her mouth.

           Garrett takes another drink. Leans close. He spots the Saint 
           Christopher medallion around her neck. RIPS it off.

           Naomi wriggles. Garrett stares deep into her eyes, recognizes 
           the strength glinting there. 

                                 GARRETT
                        You are your mother’s daughter.

           Garrett’s HANDHELD RADIO chirps.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                             (answering)
                        Yeah.

                                 SNIPER #1
                             (on speaker)
                        It’s time.

           Garrett smirks. Takes another drink.

                                 GARRETT
                        She’s here.

           He YANKS Naomi up from her chair. Exits with her in tow.
           EXT. SCAFFOLDING TOWER - DAY

           SNIPER #1 scans the perimeter. Through his rifle scope, we 
           see a BLACK SUV approaching in the distance. 

                                 SNIPER #1
                             (in earpiece)
                        Eyes on possible target. North side 
                        entrance.

           CROSSHAIRS lock onto the vehicle’s front windshield. From 
           this angle it’s impossible to see who’s driving.

           EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE

           BLACK SUV speeds through the parking lot and BURSTS through 
           the front gate --

           EXT. COMPOUND COURTYARD

           -- before BREACHING the courtyard and violently CRASHING into 
           the far wall of the building.

           BLACK SUV is crumpled metal. Smoke. Spinning tires.

           TEN MERCS slowly surround the vehicle. M16’s trained.

                                 MERC #1 
                             (in earpiece)
                        Center courtyard. We’ve got her.

           MERCS inch closer to the destroyed SUV.

                                                              INTERCUT:

           INT. MAIN FLOOR

           Garrett listens on his radio. Naomi beside him. 

                                 GARRETT
                             (in radio)
                        Do you have eyes on? 

           EXT. COMPOUND COURTYARD

           Merc #1 angles to get a better vantage. 

                                 MERC #1
                        Negative.
           Garrett shakes his head. Grins.

                                 GARRETT
                        It’s rigged. She’s not inside. 
                        She’s drawing you close. Soon as 
                        you’re in range, KABOOM. Dead. 

           Merc #1 steps onto an embankment so he can get a better view 
           of the wrecked SUV. It’s empty.

                                 MERC #1
                        Roger that. Bitch is smart.

                                 GARRETT
                        Do not engage. 

                                 MERC #1
                        Copy. Back to the perimeter.

           Merc #1 motions to his men. They abandon the EMPTY SUV and 
           return to their posts. Snipers pivot back to the outside. 

           INT. BLACK SUV

           Front seats are empty. But something in the back moves.

           ANGLE ON a blanket covering the floor. It twitches. 

           On closer inspection, we realize it’s a BALLISTIC BLANKET --

           -- and emerging from underneath... is Ruth.

           Dressed for battle, Ruth pulls out her mouthgard, grabs a 
           large duffle, and slow-crawls away from the wreckage.

           EXT. SCAFFOLDING TOWER

           Sniper #1 continues scanning the outside perimeter of the 
           factory. The parking lot. Adjacent roads. Sees nothing.

                                 SNIPER #1
                        North side clear.

                                 SNIPER #2 (O.S.)
                        South side clea--

           A distinctive PFFHT-THUMP transmits through the radio. 

                                 SNIPER #1 
                        Repeat. South side?
                                 GARRETT 
                        What’s happening? Report.

           Suddenly, static and PANICKED CHATTER fill the airwaves.

                                 SNIPER #3 (O.S.)
                        South side is down. I don’t --

           PFFHT-THUMP. Across the courtyard, Sniper #3 tumbles out of 
           his perch. Fifty feet to the ground.

                                 GARRETT 
                        Hell is going on out there?

                                 SNIPER #1
                        We’re taking fire!

           Sniper #1 stays down. Continues scanning the outside of the 
           factory, searching for the shooter.

                                 SNIPER #1 (CONT’D)
                        Anybody have eyes on?

                                 SNIPER #4 (O.S.)
                        I can’t see her! I can’t --

           On the completely opposite side of the courtyard, Sniper #4 
           cartwheels off the scaffolding. They’re dropping like flies.

                                 SNIPER #1
                        We’re losing men at every post. She 
                        must have help out there!

                                 SNIPER #5 (O.S.)
                        She’s not out there. She’s --

           PFFHT-THUMP. Sniper #5 lets out a muffled SCREAM. 

           At a loss, Sniper #1 turns and crouches low. Protecting 
           himself from an outside shot...  

           When he sees Ruth perched on the middle smokestack, inside 
           the courtyard, sniper rifle to her shoulder.

           INT. MAIN FLOOR

           Surrounded by TEN MERCS, Garrett listens via his radio. 

                                 GARRETT
                             (on radio)
                        What’s going on? Where is she?
                                 SNIPER #1 (O.S.)
                        She’s here --

           PFFHT-THUMP. Sniper #1’s radio goes silent.

                                 GARRETT
                        Goddamnit! 

           Garrett SLAMS his fist into the metal conveyor. Knows she got 
           the better of him. Then he laughs. Amused with himself.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        She was inside. Their backs were 
                        turned, they were sitting ducks...  
                             (back on radio)
                        Everyone fan out. Now!

           As the Mercs charge out, Garrett glares down at Naomi.

           EXT. COMPOUND COURTYARD

           With a gun in each hand, Ruth strides into the open.

           A DOZEN MERCS closing in. And then...

           It begins.

           Ruth DROPS four Mercs with three precise shots into each of 
           them. Two to the body. One to the head.

           She EJECTS the spent clips. SLAPS in replacements while 
           simultaneously spinning behind a cement pylon.

           ANGLES around with one arm. FIRES three shots at an incoming 
           Merc. Dead before he hits the ground.

           It’s a violent ballet of gunfire as Ruth moves in and out of 
           cover. Constantly firing. Constantly moving.

           SIX more perfect shots. Three more Mercs fall.

           Out of ammo, Ruth somersaults, retrieves an ASSAULT RIFLE 
           from a dead Merc, unfolds the stock --

           -- and rises to her feet FIRING.

           It’s graceful. And savage. Every bullet hits flesh and bone. 

           Killshot. 

           After killshot.

           CLICKCLICK. She’s out of ammo again. 
           THREE more MERCS run through the center of the courtyard, 
           guns trained as they pass the wrecked SUV.

           Ruth extracts a small detonator and triggers it --

           -- BOOOOOOOM! The SUV explodes in a massive fireball that 
           completely engulfs the surrounding Mercs.

           Just as the flames subside --

           -- the two remaining MERCS blindside her.

           Merc #1 throws a wild PUNCH, but Ruth ducks and SNAPS his arm 
           over her right shoulder like a breadstick. 

           Merc #2 drives a KNEE into Ruth’s back, but with a blinding 
           quick reversal, she lands a vicious ELBOW into his jaw. 

           Merc #1 connects a PUNCH with his good arm and DROPS Ruth.

           In a flash, they converge and attack while she’s vulnerable 
           and on the ground.

           Merc #1 uses his body and good arm to pin her legs while Merc 
           #2 WRAPS his meaty hands around her neck, strangling her.

           Ruth can’t get leverage. Eyes bulge. Suffocating. 

           She GASPS for air... about to go unconscious.

           Merc #2 pushes down harder on her trachea. Tries to put all 
           his weight behind his grip. It’s working. 

           As he continues to SQUEEZE, his head ends up dangerously 
           close to Ruth’s face --

           -- so she BITES off his ear.

           In one lightning fast motion, Ruth squirms free, SPINS, and 
           wraps her arms around Merc #1’s neck and her LEGS around Merc 
           #2’s neck. 

           She has them both by the throat in a death grip. Squeezing 
           like a python. TWISTING violently. Until finally --

           -- she SNAPS Merc #2’s neck with a sharp thigh-twist.

           Now she clings to Merc #1 with all her might. 

           She doesn’t have the strength to break his neck with her bare 
           hands... but she uses her leverage to keep squeezing... 

           And squeezing... and squeezing...
           Until he suffocates and the life slips out of his eyes.

           Nearly spent, Ruth rises to her feet, grabs the PISTOL from 
           another dead Merc, and enters the building.

           INT. MAIN FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Automated conveyor belts hum loudly as Ruth runs in. She 
           immediately spots Naomi zip-tied to a tangle of metal pipes, 
           duct tape wrapped tightly over her mouth and eyes.

           Just as Ruth’s about to run for her, Garrett appears on the 
           center aisle, between her and Naomi. Pistol in hand.

           The two trained killers size each other up...

                                 RUTH
                        I thought you were gonna retire.

                                 GARRETT
                        I was going to, I really was. The 
                        Volkov job was supposed to set me 
                        up for life.

                                 RUTH
                        But you couldn’t do it.

           Garrett smirks.

                                 GARRETT
                        I had two months on him and I 
                        couldn’t find a crack. 

                                 RUTH
                        So you drugged me and paid a doctor 
                        to tell me I was gonna die.

                                 GARRETT
                        I knew you had a kid. Knew I could 
                        talk you into going back and doing 
                        one last job for her.

                                 RUTH
                        You played me from day one.

                                 GARRETT
                        Oh come on, it was a smart move. I 
                        was stuck. You have connections in 
                        Brazil. I figured it’d be a job you 
                        might be able to do. 
                                 RUTH
                        I can do any job. Including this 
                        one.

                                 GARRETT
                        Well there is one big difference 
                        between me and Volkov... 

           Garrett pulls out a second gun. One in each hand.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        He wasn’t a professional killer.
                             (then)
                        Tell you what. I’ll make you a 
                        deal. You leave now, you can have 
                        your daughter and you can go off 
                        and live happily ever after. Or you 
                        can stay and fight. Possibly die. 
                        Then you get no money, and she gets 
                        no mommy. 

           Ruth stands firm. 

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        That’s what I thought.

           Garrett FIRES two rapid shots, but Ruth was ready and quickly 
           dives out of the way, rolling behind the conveyor.

           Ruth pops up. RATTLES off her own gunfire. But Garrett is 
           already on the move. Ruth runs after him. Enters --

           INT. GLASS ROOM

           Warehouse stocked full of glass panels. Lined up like 
           dominos. Rows upon rows upon rows. Like a giant funhouse.  

           Ruth moves cautiously. The reflections playing tricks on her 
           eyes. Every bit of movement amplified by the glass.

           In the corner of her eye, something flashes.

           Ruth FIRES. Glass EXPLODES. 

                                 GARRETT
                        Missed me.

           Garrett’s behind her. UNLOADS a barrage of lead.

           Ruth SPRINTS along the aisles of glass.

           Bullets SHATTERING dozens of panels, but Ruth stays ahead, 
           dive-rolls behind a metal frame for safety.
           Like chess masters, they move in and out of the rows of glass 
           panels. Using reflections to seek and hide from each other.

           Finally, after a masterful dance of gun play, the last glass 
           panel shatters, and they’re both out of ammo --

           -- Ruth TACKLES Garrett to the ground.

           Time for hand-to-hand combat.

           Garrett may be a bit older, but he’s still strong and fast.

           Ruth, who’s exhausted after her courtyard ordeal, is unable 
           to get a jump on him.

           Garrett UNLEASHES a flurry of punches and kicks.

           Ruth tries to block, but a few slip past her defenses.

           Ruth rebounds. Goes for a SIDE KICK.

           Garrett SNATCHES her leg from the air --

           -- HURLS her to the ground as she rolls over broken glass 
           like cheese on a grater. Clothes and skin shredded.

           Ruth grabs a nearby SHARD of glass. Wraps a piece of her torn 
           shirt around the bottom, creating a makeshift knife.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        Now we’re talking.

           Garrett finds his own shard. Does the same.

           Now the two master assassins engage in a glass-knife fight... 

           And it does not disappoint.

           Ruth charges. Garrett parlays. LUNGES.

           SLICES a piece of Ruth’s arm.

           Ruth returns with a vengeance. PUSHES Garrett backwards.

           Cornered, he hops on the CONVEYOR BELT. Ruth joins him.

           The glass-knife fight continues as the conveyor moves them 
           through the factory, past rivers of molten glass --

           INT. MAIN FLOOR

           -- and into the main floor where the bottles are molded.
                                 GARRETT
                        If you kill me you get nothing, you 
                        do know that, right?

                                 RUTH
                        As long as you’re dead. I can live 
                        with that.

           Garrett lifts the Saint Christopher medallion from under his 
           shirt. The necklace dangles there. Taunting Ruth.

                                 GARRETT
                        And Naomi? What’ll you do? Take her 
                        on jobs with you like Victoria did? 
                        Always on the move. Always one step 
                        ahead of a bullet. That who you 
                        wanna end up like?

           Ruth takes a moment. Thinking of her mom.

                                 RUTH
                        Maybe.

           Ruth attacks. Garrett deflects. But she SLICES his arm, 
           causing him to drop his glass-knife.

           As Ruth advances, Garrett spots a blowing STICK on the next 
           conveyor. He leaps over and grabs it. Wields it like a fiery 
           hot sword dripping with molten glass.

           Ruth jumps over and the fight continues, but Ruth’s knife is 
           no match for his fire stick. 

           The liquid glass flings from the iron, burning into her skin.

                                 GARRETT
                        You can still walk out of here.

           Ruth spots her own fire stick. Retrieves it.

                                 RUTH
                        I intend to.

           Ruth attacks again. Swinging wildly.

           Garrett blocks her. Iron SPARKS at contact.

           They parry, dodge, and riposte. But it’s not poetic. It’s 
           violent. Desperate.

           As the conveyor continues to move them along the factory 
           floor, the fight seems evenly matched. 
           Behind Garrett, Ruth notices the FAULTY PISTON that was 
           firing off track earlier, knocking bottles to the ground.

           Getting an idea, Ruth begins a flurry of swings, but they 
           seem sloppy and slow and Garrett evades them easily.

           Finally, Ruth loses grip on her weapon and it CLANGS to the 
           ground. She’s now unarmed. Vulnerable.

                                 GARRETT
                             (big grin)
                        You should’ve left when you had the 
                        chance. 

           The conveyor moves. The faulty piston approaching.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        That’s why I always thought women 
                        shouldn’t be in this business. You 
                        think with too much emotion.

           Now Ruth grins.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        Something funny?

           Garrett inches forward. Fire hot iron in hand.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        You might as well share with the 
                        class. You can consider them your 
                        dying words.

                                 RUTH
                        You’re a man. 

           Garrett stops. Curious smile. Conveyor keeps moving.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        And just like a man... 

           Garrett is oblivious to the faulty piston right behind him. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        You talk too much.

           Like it were throwing a wild punch, the faulty PISTON shoots 
           out, knocking Garrett off the belt and to the concrete.

           It gives Ruth the moment she needed to pounce.

           She unleashes her fury. WAILING on him with every fiber of 
           strength she has left in her body... until Garrett is beaten.
           Ruth finds a SHARD OF GLASS from a shattered bottle. Lifts it 
           underneath Garrett’s chin. Ready to take his life.

                                 GARRETT
                        Wait! Just wait!

           She does.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        How about we split the money? It’s 
                        already in my account. You’ll never 
                        get access. Just let me live and 
                        I’ll give you half. 

           Ruth presses the glass to his skin. Draws blood.

                                 RUTH
                        Remember that night in Berlin. We 
                        both finished jobs early. You said 
                        you could drink me under the table. 
                        But instead you drank me into bed.
                             (then)
                        It was four years ago, but it’s a 
                        night I’ll always be grateful for. 

           Garrett’s face goes pale with a dawning realization. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        I’m not sure if you know this, but 
                        if there’s no will explicitly 
                        stating otherwise, then biological 
                        children are entitled to all of 
                        their parent’s estate. 

           Garrett glances to the far side of the room where Naomi is 
           bound, gagged, and blindfolded.

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        So our daughter will be just fine.  

           And with that, Ruth PRESSES the glass into Garrett’s neck.

           Killing him instantly.

           Ruth pulls off the Saint Christopher necklace as she staggers 
           to her feet. Looks over at Naomi.

           NEXT CUT:

           Ruth unties her daughter, careful to leave the blindfold on. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Bug.
                                 NAOMI
                        Mommy?!

           Ruth hugs her tightly for a long moment. Tears welling.

                                 RUTH
                             (then)
                        I’m gonna take you home now, okay?

                                 NAOMI
                        Okay.

           Ruth picks up Naomi and carries her down the main floor... 

           Leaving the carnage in their wake.

           EXT. COMPOUND COURTYARD - DAY

           As soon as Ruth and Naomi step outside, the sleazy factory 
           manager, Charlie, enters from the parking lot. In shock. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (seeing Ruth)
                        What in God’s name happened?

           Ruth sets Naomi down. Then she calmly picks up a 9MM from the 
           ground. Strides over and presses it to Charlie’s forehead. 

           Charlie shakes in his boots.  

                                 RUTH
                        I think it was some kind of gang 
                        turf war. But either way, I was 
                        never here, do you understand?

           Charlie nods. Near tears. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Good. Oh, and I quit.

           CLICK. The sound of Ruth expending the clip makes Charlie 
           piss his pants. Literally.

           With just the slightest hint of satisfaction in her grin, 
           Ruth takes Naomi by the hand and they continue walking.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Once they’re in the clear, Ruth stops and finally removes 
           Naomi’s blindfold. Gives her daughter a big smile. 
                                 RUTH
                        You okay, little Bug?

           Naomi nods. Wipes her eyes. Like she woke from a nap.

                                 NAOMI
                        Is the story over? 

                                 RUTH
                        Yeah.

                                 NAOMI
                        What happened? Did the Queen kill 
                        the Gargoyle?

           Ruth takes a long, contemplative moment. Then smiles...

                                 RUTH
                        She did.

           Naomi smiles back. She likes that answer.

                                 NAOMI
                        Cool.

           Naomi takes her mom’s hand and they just keep walking...

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

           INT. RUTH’S TRAILER - DAY

           RUTH hands the trailer keys to Julie. It’s her house now. 

           Julie leaps up and down. Hugging Naomi and Ruth. Overjoyed.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

           SAINT CHRISTOPHER medallion rests on top of a white envelope, 
           sitting on a freshly made bed.

           Curious, the Older Maid picks up the envelope and opens it to 
           find a HUGE WAD OF CASH. 

           She nearly faints. Then opens the letter inside. It reads:

           -- I gave your necklace to my daughter, but we won’t need it 
           anymore. We’ll be watching over each other now. 

           The Older Maid smiles. Sniffs the money. BIG smile.
           EXT. MOTEL ALEXANDRIA - DAY

           Naomi stands next to a new CORVETTE as Ruth approaches.  

           Ruth looks back at the motel. A tiny grin.

                                 NAOMI
                        Where are we going now?

                                 RUTH
                        Ever heard of Brazil? There’s some 
                        people there I want you to meet.

           Naomi shakes her head. She seems nervous. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        Who loves you?

                                 NAOMI
                        You.

                                 RUTH
                        Who will always love you?

                                 NAOMI
                        You.

           Naomi smiles. Her nerves settled. 

           As they both enter the car and Ruth speeds out of the parking

                        Who’s the hottest mom in 
                        Pennsylvania?

                                 NAOMI (O.S.)
                        Mrs. Docherty!

           Over the sweet sound of mother/daughter giggles...

           THE CAMERA BOOMS up... 

           And off this epic wide shot, we...

           FADE IN:

           INT. BRYCE’S OFFICE - BABYLON, INC - DAY

           At his desk, Bryce pores over a new assignment file. Sitting 
           across from him, looking fresh, rested, and happy... is Ruth.

                                 BRYCE
                        Now that you’re back and Naomi’s 
                        all situated, I got a job --

                                 RUTH
                        I told you I was out.

                                 BRYCE
                        I know. But this is... complicated.

                                 RUTH
                        I’m sure one of your other 
                        contractors can handle it.

           Bryce shakes his head.

                                 BRYCE
                        The assignment just came in. Big 
                        payday. The mark is another 
                        contractor. A real pro. Maybe one 
                        of the best ever. 

                                 RUTH
                        I’m not ready for a job like that.

                                 BRYCE
                        I don’t want you to do the job. I 
                        want you to find the mark before 
                        the contract can be completed.

                                 RUTH
                             (confused)
                        And what am I supposed to do when I 
                        find the mark?

           Bryce hands Ruth a PHOTO from the folder. It’s a surveillance 
           picture of a CLASSY WOMAN in her fifties. 

           We immediately recognize her as Ruth’s mother, Victoria.

                                 BRYCE
                        I’m sure you’ll think of something.

           Off Ruth... floored...

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.
