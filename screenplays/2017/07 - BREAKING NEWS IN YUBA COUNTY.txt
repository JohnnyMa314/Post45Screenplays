           EXT. SMALL TOWN, YUBA COUNTY - DAY.

           The dry heat is visible in this small Northern California 
           town. The slow, soothing sounds of a British woman’s voice-- 

                                 BRITISH WOMAN (VO)
                        You are capable. You are confident. 
                        You are enough. 

           INT. SUPER STORE - BAKED GOODS SECTION - CONTINUOUS.

           SUE BOTTOMS (mid 40s, a face you forget) waits in line, 
           listening intently to the voice coming out of her headphones. 
           These are her daily affirmations and she takes them very 
           seriously.  

                                 BRITISH WOMAN (VO)
                        You are important. You are strong. 
                        Your life is unfolding beautifully.

           The indifferent CLERK signals Sue that she’s next. Sue takes 
           off her headphones and cheerfully approaches the counter. 

           Another CUSTOMER bumps into her as he cuts through the bakery 
           line. Sue reflexively moves out of the way.

                                 SUE
                        Sorry.

           Customer doesn’t acknowledge Sue’s apology as he passes her. 
           This isn’t weird for Sue. She continues on to the counter.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        Picking up an order for Sue 
                        Bottoms. 

           Clerk goes to get her order.  

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        The worst thing about the heat is 
                        that everyone feels the need to 
                        blast the AC. You must be freezing, 
                        working in here all day. Or, I 
                        guess you’re probably used to it. 

                                 CLERK
                        Sure. Here’s your cake.

           Sue looks down at her cake. It reads “Happy Birthday Suc!”

                                 SUE
                        Oh. I think someone forgot to 
                        finish the e. It should say Happy 
                        Birthday Sue. Not Suc. 
           Clerk glances down at the cake.

                                 CLERK
                        Weird. Your total is 43.50. Cash or 
                        credit?

                                 SUE
                        Oh...

           We hear the faint sounds of Sue’s affirmations coming from 
           the headphones around her neck. 

                                 BRITISH WOMAN (VO)
                        You are powerful. You are bold. 

           Sue forces a smile and hands over her credit card. 

                                 SUE
                        Credit. Thank you. 

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY.

           BILL BOTTOMS (mid 40s, lanky nerd, wants more from life) is 
           on the phone. He reads from a print out titled: “How to Give 
           Great Phone Sex (Yes YOU Can Do It!)”

           The NEWS plays on a TV in the background.

                                 BILL
                             (on phone)
                        Now move those soft, fat fingers 
                        down and touch your... 
                             (barely audible)
                        ...clit. 

           Bill takes a sip of his protein shake and rubs his brow. He 
           really doesn’t like this.

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        I said touch your clit. Mhm, rub it 
                        and - Jesus... It’s just weird. 
                        Saying this stuff and I can’t even 
                        see you. I feel-- 

           Bill’s phone buzzes with a new call. He checks it.

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Shit, it’s Nancy. My wife’s sister. 
                        I am trying to ignore the call! 
                        Okay, she’s gone. Yeah, she’s gone.
                             (back to phone sex)
                                 (MORE)
                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Spread your legs and - shit, what 
                        if I hit the wrong button and I 
                        thought I was ignoring her but I 
                        actually conferenced her in! Nancy? 
                        Nancy, are you there? Okay, I don’t 
                        think she’s there. Sorry hotstuff. 
                        Do you want me to keep going? Okay. 
                        But I’ll still see you tonight, 
                        right? Great. I’ll make this up to 
                        you then - with my penis!   

           Bill cringes at the lameness of his comment. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Oh, yeah, I have to go too. I’ll-- 

           Whoever he was talking to has already hung up. Bill drops his 
           phone on the table, frustrated with his poor performance. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Idiot.

           Bill folds his phone sex script into a square and tucks it 
           into his gym bag. His phone rings. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Not now, Nanc--

           Bill tenses up when he sees who’s calling: KAVI. 

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           Bill holds his breath and stares at his phone until it stops 
           ringing. The back door opens and Sue enters with her cake.

                                 SUE
                        Good, you’re still here. What’s 
                        wrong?

           Bill turns to the TV.

                                 BILL
                        That Tammi girl is still missing. 

           Sue turns her attention to the TV. On the news we see a 
           school picture of TAMMI ROSE (13, that wholesome little angel 
           whose disappearance makes national news).

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)
                        The search continues for 13-year-old 
                        Tammi Rose, who disappeared last 
                        Wednesday on her way to school.

                        Her parents made a desperate plea at 
                        a press conference today.

           The news cuts to HILARY & JONATHAN ROSE (late 30s, suburban 
           beauties) at a press conference. 

                                 JONATHAN ROSE (ON TV)
                        To whoever has my little girl, 
                        please - please let her go. 

                                 HILARY ROSE (ON TV)
                        Tammi, we love you.

                                 BILL
                        Crazy world.

                                 SUE
                        Yeah.
                             (beat)
                        I bought a cake.

                                 BILL
                        That’s nice.

           Bill goes to the blender and starts to blend another protein 
           shake. 

                                 SUE
                        They spelled my name wrong.

           Bill doesn’t hear her over the sound of the blender. Sue 
           quietly watches his back. The phone in the hall rings.

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS.

           Sue answers the phone.

                                 SUE
                        Hello?

           INT. NANCY’S CAR - SAME TIME.

           Sue’s sister, NANCY (late 30s, ambitious with a desperate 
           edge) talks on the phone and puts on make-up while driving.

                                 NANCY
                        Where’s Bill?

           Intercut phone conversation.

                                 SUE
                        He’s in the kitchen. You want me to 
                        get him? 
                                 NANCY
                        I don’t want to wait. Just remind 
                        him about the loan. If the station 
                        goes under, I’m on your couch.

                                 SUE
                        Okay. Did you call for anything 
                        else? 

                                 NANCY
                        What else would I be calling about?

                                 SUE
                        You should come over for dinner 
                        tonight.

                                 NANCY
                        Why?

           Nancy cuts off a car and it honks at her. She honks back. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you, Prius!

                                 SUE
                        Come on, Nancy, it’ll be fun. I 
                        bought a cake.

                                 NANCY
                        I don’t eat dinner. Gotta go. This 
                        moron’s on my ass. 

           Nancy hangs up. 

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS.

           Sue hangs up the phone. She catches her reflection in the 
           hallway mirror. 

                                 SUE
                        You are important. You are strong.

           Re-convinced of her self worth, Sue heads back to the 
           kitchen.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        Bill, if you don’t want my sister 
                        moving in, you better not forget--

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS.

           Sue stops abruptly and deflates in the doorway. Bill is gone. 
           He left without saying goodbye. Her cake catches her eye.  
           Sue takes the cover off of her birthday cake and looks at it - 
           “Happy Birthday Suc!” Sue takes the frosting from the 
           exclamation point to finish the e. “Happy Birthday Sue.” 

           Sue looks around. She’s alone. It’s quiet. 

           INT. GEORGE’S ELECTRONICS - DAY.

           Top 40 music blares in this small, family-owned electronics 
           store. PETEY BOTTOMS (early 30s, tattoos, reformed petty 
           criminal) stocks a glass case with new cell phones.  

           DEBBIE (mid 40s, mom jeans all day every day, nothing gets by 
           her) watches Petey suspiciously from the front. 

           Petey’s phone buzzes. He takes it out and looks at the 
           message. It’s a picture of a pregnant belly with a caption: 
           “he kicked!” Petey smiles, texts a heart emoji, and puts his 
           phone back in his pocket. Debbie makes a beeline towards him.

                                 DEBBIE
                        What did you just put in your 
                        pocket? Are you stealing from us? 
                        George! GEORGE! 

           GEORGE (mid 40s, at the start of his mid-life crisis) appears 
           behind Debbie.

                                 GEORGE
                        Honey, remember how we agreed you 
                        wouldn’t scream my name unless you 
                        were dying or receiving pleasure?

                                 DEBBIE
                        This little felon you hired is 
                        stealing from us!

                                 PETEY
                        What?! No, I’m not!

                                 DEBBIE
                        I saw him put a phone in his 
                        pocket.

                                 PETEY
                        It was my phone.

                                 DEBBIE
                        It looked like one from the new 
                        shipment.

           Petey takes his phone out of his pocket.
                                 PETEY
                        Really, Debbie? My crappy old phone 
                        looks like one of these brand new 
                        phones that are sealed in a box and 
                        tied up with security wires?

                                 GEORGE
                        Honeybear, it appears you were 
                        wrong and should apologize.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Well, he shouldn’t be messing with 
                        his pockets on the job.

                                 PETEY
                        Messing with my pockets on the-- 
                        Should I stock the shelves naked?! 
                        Though I guess even then I could 
                        smuggle out phones up my butt! 

                                 DEBBIE
                        I wouldn’t put it past you, you 
                        little convict!

                                 PETEY
                        I knew I shouldn’t have told you 
                        about that. You’re the reason why 
                        people lie on their job applications! 
                        You’re what’s wrong with America!

                                 DEBBIE
                        I love America!

                                 GEORGE
                        Okay, you two, that’s enough. 
                        Petey, you can’t talk about 
                        sticking stuff up your naked butt 
                        in front of my wife - not cool. And 
                        Debs, we don’t need no hateration 
                        holleration up in here, okay? Now, 
                        let’s all get back to work.  

                                 DEBBIE
                             (whispering to George)
                        Don’t let the criminal out of your 
                        sight.

                                 PETEY
                        Real good whispering, Debbie. I 
                        didn’t hear anything you said.

           Debbie shoots him a dirty look and stalks off. 
                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        I really appreciate the job, 
                        George.

                                 GEORGE
                        I know.

                                 PETEY
                        I swear I don’t steal anymore.

                                 GEORGE
                        I know. I know. But listen... 

           George looks to make sure Debbie is out of earshot.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay if you still want to 
                        commit crimes every now and then.

                                 PETEY
                        I don’t!

                                 GEORGE
                        Okay. But if you ever need a 
                        partner for one of your crime jobs, 
                        promise you’ll consider me.

                                 PETEY
                        What? No!

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m too old?

                                 PETEY
                        No, it’s - look, that’s a real nice 
                        offer, but when Jonelle got pregnant, 
                        I promised her I’d quit. I’m about to 
                        be a dad, you know? It’s time for me 
                        to stop stealing stuff and start 
                        paying taxes and be a family man. 

                                 DEBBIE (O.S.)
                        George!

                                 GEORGE
                        Believe me kid, you don’t want to 
                        be a family man. 

                                 DEBBIE (O.S.)
                        George! 

                                 GEORGE
                             (as he walks off)
                        Honeybear, are you dying or 
                        receiving pleasure?
           As George walks away, Petey sees RAJ (30s, a massive, stone-
           faced, Indian man) & KAVI (20s, a tom-boyish, sociopathic 
           Indian woman) enter the store. They approach Petey. Petey 
           looks around nervously for Debbie.

                                 PETEY
                        You can’t be here.

                                 KAVI
                        You get us Bill. You get to leave. 
                        Wasn’t that the deal, Petey? 

                                 PETEY
                        Yeah and I set you up with Bill, so--

                                 KAVI
                        We went to clean our money and 
                        guess what? Bill doesn’t work at 
                        the bank anymore.

                                 PETEY
                        That’s weird, I’m sure-- 

           Raj slams Petey’s head into the counter. He presses the side 
           of Petey’s face into the glass surface. 

                                 KAVI
                        We treated you okay, Petey. Didn’t 
                        we treat you okay?

           Petey tries to lift his head, but Raj pushes it back down.

                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        We gave you work. We paid you well. 
                        And after all the kindness we 
                        showed you, you wanted to leave us. 
                        I mean, talk about no respect.

                                 PETEY
                        Kavi--

                                 KAVI
                        And we never let anyone leave. But 
                        you said you could get us a money 
                        guy. You remember that, Petey?

           No response. Raj squishes Petey’s face harder into the glass.

                                 PETEY
                        Yes!
                                 KAVI
                        We do too. So you can imagine our 
                        frustration when the money guy we 
                        traded you for up and disappears 
                        after a few jobs. This is my 
                        frustrated face! I’m frustrated!

           Raj rolls his eyes. He’s not a fan of Kavi’s dramatics.

                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        Now, you know my dad’s not a 
                        patient man when it comes to his 
                        money. Which means that I can’t be 
                        patient. Where’s Bill?

                                 PETEY
                        I don’t know.

           Raj lifts Petey’s head and slams it into the counter again.

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        He switched branches! He’s at the 
                        Stanlow Bank on 4th and Clarke!

                                 KAVI
                        Wow. One minute to sell out your 
                        brother. Thought you’d at least 
                        make it to five. 

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        Let him go.

           Kavi and Raj turn to see George pointing a gun at them.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Or I’ll shoot you in the face with 
                        this gun. 

           Beat. Kavi smiles.

                                 KAVI
                        Has anyone ever told you that you 
                        look just like- shit, who sings the 
                        beautiful day in the neighborhood? 

                                 GEORGE
                        Mr. Rogers.

                                 KAVI
                        Yeah, Mr. Rogers.

           Kavi slowly approaches George, singing. 
                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        The beautiful day in the 
                        neighborhood.

           She keeps walking until the gun is pressed against her head. 
           Beat. Then, in one swift motion, Kavi knocks George’s gun out 
           of his hand and headbutts him. George falls to the floor. 
           Kavi pulls a pocket knife and presses it to George’s neck.

                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        It’s not nice to point guns at 
                        people, Mr. Rogers. 

           A CUSTOMER enters the store, sees what’s going down and 
           quickly heads back out.

                                 RAJ
                        Kavi, let’s go. Let’s go.

                                 KAVI
                        I’m sorry, I can’t kill you right 
                        now, Mr. Rogers, cuz of Old Man 
                        Grumps over there. But maybe we can 
                        do this later. 

           Kavi gets up and heads over to Petey. 

                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        Good seeing you, Petey. Do us a 
                        favor and don’t tell Bill we’re 
                        coming. I’d hate to have to come 
                        back here if he disappeared again.

           Kavi and Raj leave. George pops up. His nose is bleeding. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Woooo! Wow! Did you see that? 

                                 PETEY
                        Are you okay? You’re bleeding.

                                 GEORGE
                        I can’t believe I was in a street 
                        fight!

           George picks up his gun.

                                 PETEY
                        This isn’t a game, George! Where’d 
                        you get a gun from?

                                 GEORGE
                        Found it in the Whole Foods parking 
                        lot. Looks good on me, right?
                                 PETEY
                        You shouldn’t have done that. Those 
                        are really bad guys. 

                                 GEORGE
                        You know who’s a bad guy? The guy 
                        with the gun. 

                                 PETEY
                        Do you even know how to use that 
                        thing?

           George points the gun at Petey and pulls the trigger. Petey 
           screams and ducks away. 

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        No-no-no!

           George laughs.

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s broken. See? 

           George points the gun to his head and pulls the trigger. 
           There’s a click, but no bang. Petey walks away, unamused. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Oh come on, that was funny! 
                             (he poses with the gun)
                        This feels right.

           INT. RAJ’S CAR - LATER.

           Raj drives. Kavi has an open briefcase of money on her lap.

                                 KAVI
                        The beautiful day in the 
                        neighborhood. 

           Kavi grabs a stack of bills and holds it up to her face.

                                 RAJ
                        Stop messing around.

           Kavi looks at Raj. Then sticks her hand out the window and 
           lets the bills blow away.

                                 KAVI
                        Whoops. My daddy’s money just blew 
                        away. You gonna tell on me, 
                        babysitter?

           Raj closes the briefcase and grabs it away from Kavi.
                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, Grumps. We’ll just 
                        take it out of Bill’s payment. 

                                 RAJ
                        I don’t trust this money guy. We 
                        should get rid of him.

                                 KAVI
                        Sure. Then you can tell my dad why 
                        we weren’t able to get his money 
                        clean.

           Raj doesn’t respond.

                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        That’s what I thought... The 
                        beautiful day in the- ugh, now that 
                        stupid song is stuck in my head. 
                        You should’ve let me kill him.

           INT. LARGE GRAY OFFICE - DAY.

           CUBICLES. The place where dreams go to die a long, monotonous 
           death. We push past cubicles of lifeless PENCIL PUSHERS, 
           until we reach-- 

           INT. SUE’S CUBICLE - CONTINUOUS.  

           Sue hunches over her computer. She’s on Facebook, but there 
           are no posts on her wall. She refreshes her Facebook page - 
           still no posts. Sue clicks away with desperate optimism. 
           Refresh. Refresh. So far, nobody has remembered her birthday.

           Sue takes out her phone and drafts a text to Bill: “Let's do 
           something tonight honey.” She erases the word “honey” and 
           replaces it with “Bill.” She hits send. And waits.

           INT. STANLOW COMMUNITY BANK - BILL’S OFFICE - SAME TIME.

           Bill sits behind his desk, doing absolutely nothing. His cell 
           buzzes with a message from Sue. He reads it and ignores it. 
           Bill turns to look in his wall mirror. He flexes his muscle.  

           INT. STANLOW COMMUNITY BANK - CONTINUOUS.

           Raj and Kavi enter and are immediately accosted by STEVE, 
           that over-achieving guy at the office.

                                 STEVE
                        How can I help you two?

                                 KAVI
                        We’re looking for Bill.
                                 STEVE
                        Are you currently banking with us? 
                        If not, I would be happy to help 
                        you set up some accounts.

                                 KAVI
                        We’re looking for Bill.

                                 STEVE
                        If you need a loan or have any 
                        other financial questions, I’m your 
                        guy. Stanlow Banker of the Year, 
                        three years running. 

           Steve points to his three Banker of the Year plaques that are 
           hanging on the wall. He shakes Kavi’s hand.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Name’s Steve. Numbers are my thing.

           Steve moves to shake Raj’s hand, but Kavi holds onto Steve’s 
           hand and squeezes it a bit tighter.

                                 KAVI
                        Nice to meet you, Steve. We’re 
                        looking for Bill.

           Steve, startled by the pressure that Kavi is putting on his 
           hand, tries to remain professional.

                                 STEVE
                        Oh. Okay. Right this way.

           INT. STANLOW COMMUNITY BANK - BILL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS.

           Through his window, Bill sees Steve pointing Raj and Kavi in 
           his direction. 

                                 BILL
                        Shit!

           Bill ducks down under his desk and holds his breath. Beat.

                                 KAVI (O.S.)
                        We’re not happy, Bill.

           Bill knows he’s been caught. He comes out from under his 
           desk. Raj and Kavi are sitting in the chairs across from him.

                                 BILL
                        Hey! I didn’t see you come in. 
                        Dropped my thing, and was just-- 
                        what’s up? How’s it going?
                                 KAVI
                        You changed branches. 

                                 BILL
                        Yes, didn’t I tell you? I thought I 
                        sent you an e-mail. It might have 
                        gone to your spam folder.

           Kavi takes out her pocket knife.

                                 KAVI
                        Would you rather have one eye or 
                        one ear? 

                                 BILL
                        No, oh God, I can’t do this 
                        anymore! Please, I don’t want to do 
                        this anymore. I can get fired. I 
                        can go to jail!

                                 KAVI
                        One eye, or one ear?

                                 BILL
                        Um... One ear.

           Raj places the briefcase on the desk.

                                 RAJ
                        One million, minus your cut. 

                                 KAVI
                        Which will be a thousand less than 
                        usual cuz I threw some money out 
                        the window. 

           Bill opens the briefcase. It’s full of hundreds.

                                 BILL
                        Jesus Christ! I can’t wash this! 
                        It’s too much!

                                 RAJ
                        Clean accounts. By tomorrow.

           Kavi and Raj get up to leave. Kavi turns back.

                                 KAVI
                        Oh, and if you try this 
                        disappearing act again, I’ll cut 
                        off your ear. Good choice, Billy.

           Raj and Kavi leave. Bill looks down at the money.
                                 BILL
                        Shit.

           INT. SUE’S OFFICE - EMPLOYEE KITCHEN - LATER.

           Sue eats at a table with JANET & ROBERTA (40s, the office 
           gossips). She listens and nods intently along to their 
           conversation, which she is clearly not a part of.  

                                 JANET
                        I mean, it’s really sad that young 
                        girls can’t leave their homes 
                        anymore without some sick pervert 
                        snatching them up. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        We don’t know what happened. She 
                        could’ve run away.

                                 JANET
                        She’s way too pretty to run away. 
                        It was definitely a pervert.  

                                 SUE
                        Crazy world.

           Janet turns to Sue.

                                 JANET
                             (sincere)
                        Did you say something?

           Before Sue can respond, Janet’s attention is pulled by a 
           GROUP OF EMPLOYEES who enter the kitchen, holding a birthday 
           cake and singing Happy Birthday. 

           Sue’s eyes light up - they did remember! Sue smiles and 
           touches her cheeks, just as she’d seen other women do in 
           moments of happy surprise. And then she notices that Janet is 
           also smiling and touching her cheeks. Sue looks back to the 
           group of employees and it becomes painfully clear that they 
           are not singing to her. She slowly lowers her hands. 

                                 GROUP OF EMPLOYEES
                        Happy birthday dear Janet! Happy 
                        birthday to you!

           The room erupts in cheers as Janet blows out the candles. A 
           moment of crushing sadness flashes across Sue’s eyes, but 
           then she smiles and cheers along with everyone else. 

                                 JANET
                        You guys are too sweet! It’s not 
                        even my birthday yet. 
                                 ROBERTA
                        Well, since we won’t be able to 
                        sing to you on Saturday for your 
                        actual birthday, we figured we 
                        would do it for you now.

                                 JANET
                        Stop. You’re going to make me cry.

                                 EMPLOYEE
                        Are you doing anything special to 
                        celebrate?

                                 JANET
                        My husband’s taking me to that new 
                        french restaurant that just opened 
                        downtown, La Femme Aimée. 

                                 EMPLOYEE
                        I heard that place is super swanky.

                                 JANET
                        It better be!

           Everyone laughs as pieces of cake are passed around. Sue also 
           laughs and smiles and eats cake, but with no one in 
           particular. She’s alone in a room full of people. 

           INT. SUE’S CUBICLE - LATER.

           Sue makes a phone call.

                                 SUE
                        Hi, I would like to make a dinner 
                        reservation for two tonight. I hear 
                        your place is super swanky.   

           INT. STANLOW COMMUNITY BANK - BILL’S OFFICE - LATER.

           Bill paces in his office, eyeing the briefcase of money. His 
           phone rings. He rushes to it - it’s only Sue. He ignores the 
           call. Bill makes a phone call.

                                 BILL
                        Petey, pick up your freaking phone! 
                        I don’t know how, but those slumdog 
                        thugs found me at the new bank. 
                        They came by today and-- Petey, you 
                        gotta help me out here. I can’t do 
                        this anymore. I thought I wanted-- 
                        look, the money’s not worth it. You 
                        gotta help me out. 
           Bill hangs up. He peeks through his office window and watches 
           as the last of the bank tellers leave for the night. He takes 
           a deep breath, grabs the briefcase and leaves his office.

           INT. STANLOW COMMUNITY BANK - CONTINUOUS.

           Bill moves quickly towards the back vault. Steve appears out 
           of nowhere.

                                 STEVE
                        New guy! You’re here late.

                                 BILL
                        Oh. Yeah. Had to finish some work. 

                                 STEVE
                        Bringing in referrals, working late 
                        - I know what you’re up to.

                                 BILL
                        What? I’m not-- 

                                 STEVE
                        You’re trying to get your face on 
                        that wall.

           Steve points to his three Banker of the Year plaques.

                                 BILL
                        Hahaha. You caught me.

                                 STEVE
                        Well, Steve isn’t afraid of a 
                        little competition. I’m going to 
                        keep my eye on you, new guy.

                                 BILL
                        Okay.

                                 STEVE
                        You walking out?

                                 BILL
                        Yeah. Oh, actually I forgot 
                        something in my office. You go 
                        ahead. I’ll see you tomorrow.

           Bill turns and scurries back to his office. 

                                 STEVE (O.S.)
                        Hey, new guy!

           Bill turns back. Steve points at his eyes and then points at 
           Bill (ie I’m watching you). Bill laughs nervously.
                                 BILL
                        Okay. Good night.

           Bill slips back into his office.

           INT. STANLOW COMMUNITY BANK - BILL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS.

           Bill throws the briefcase across the room. It falls open and 
           some of the money falls out. His phone rings - it’s Sue.

                                 BILL
                        Goddammit, Sue! Call someone else!

           Bill ignores the call. He looks at the stacks of money on his 
           floor. It’s a lot of fucking money... 

           Bill grabs his gym bag and dumps everything out. The folded 
           phone sex script from earlier flutters underneath his desk. 
           Bill quickly throws all of the money into the gym bag and 
           tosses his gym clothes on top. The phone sex script goes 
           unnoticed under his desk. Bill makes a phone call.

                                 BILL (CONT’D)
                        Hey hotstuff, I’m on my way. I’ve 
                        got news.

           Bill smiles and leaves his office.

           INT. SUE’S CAR - SAME TIME.

           Sue pulls up across the street from Bill’s office. She parks 
           and fixes her hair in the rearview mirror.

                                 SUE
                             (practicing)
                        Bill, you are not working late 
                        tonight! You are taking me out to 
                        dinner because it’s my birthday!

           Sue moves to exit her car, but stops when she spots Bill 
           through her window. He’s buying flowers from a street vendor. 
           Sue smiles, a weight lifted. 

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        I thought you forgot. Shoot, now 
                        I’ve ruined the surprise. That’s 
                        okay, I’ll act surprised.

           Sue puts her hands to her face and gasps, practicing her 
           surprised reaction.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        Oh honey! Thank you for the 
                        flowers! I love them!
           Bill gets into his car and drives off. Sue follows happily 
           behind him. Her smile wanes slightly when Bill turns his car 
           in a different direction than she expected... 

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

           EXT. QUALITY TIMES MOTEL - LATER.

           Bill’s car pulls into the motel parking lot. Sue’s car pulls 
           up across the street.

           INT. SUE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS.

           Sue watches as Bill gets out of his car with the bouquet of 
           flowers and enters the motel, the realization that those 
           flowers aren’t for her setting in. She can’t breathe.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS.

           Sue falls out of her car and stumbles into the street. The 
           world is spinning. She tries to calm herself. 

                                 SUE
                        You are important. You are strong. 
                        You are enough. You are enough. 

           A blaring horn cuts through the fog of Sue’s breakdown. She 
           turns just in time to see a car full of teenaged boys swerve 
           around her. The passenger shouts out the window. 

                                 TEENAGE BOY
                        Get the fuck outta the street, you 
                        stupid cunt!

                                 SUE
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry. 

           Sue hurries back into her car.

           INT. SUE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS.

           Sue’s hand trembles as she tries to start her car.    

                                 SUE
                        You are important. You are strong. 
                        You are enough. 

           Sue catches her reflection in the rearview mirror. 

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        You are nobody. You are nothing. 
                        You are nothing! YOU ARE NOTHING! 
           Sue tries to rip the rearview mirror off of the windshield, 
           but can’t. She falls back into her seat, defeated. She closes 
           her eyes and quietly recites her mantra.   

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        You are important. You are strong. 
                        You are enough. 

           Sue opens her eyes. There’s a darkness there we haven’t seen 
           before. 

           INT. QUALITY TIMES MOTEL - MINUTES LATER. 

           A SWEET ELDERLY MOTEL CLERK watches a soap opera behind the 
           desk. Sue enters. 

                                 SWEET ELDERLY MOTEL CLERK
                        Hello dear. Would you like a room?

                                 SUE
                        I’m looking for my husband.

                                 SWEET ELDERLY MOTEL CLERK
                        Well, let me just check the husband 
                        lost and found. I’m just kidding, 
                        dear. A little Friday night humor. 
                        What room is he in?   

                                 SUE
                        He forgot to tell me.

           Clerk gives Sue a confused look.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        He just walked in, holding flowers. 
                        Today’s my birthday.

                                 SWEET ELDERLY MOTEL CLERK
                        How lovely. Men don’t give flowers 
                        like they should anymore. My 
                        Charlie used to give me flowers 
                        every day. Daisies. But men these 
                        days, they just don’t give flowers 
                        like they should. Not your husband 
                        though. A true gentleman, getting 
                        flowers for his wife on her 
                        birthday. How lovely.  

                                 SUE
                        Yes.
                                 SWEET ELDERLY MOTEL CLERK
                        Yes indeed. But here I am talking 
                        your ear off when you have a 
                        romantic night to get to. 

           Sweet elderly motel clerk hands Sue Bill’s room key.

                                 SWEET ELDERLY MOTEL CLERK (CONT’D)
                        Happy birthday, dear.

           Sue holds onto the clerk’s hand a bit longer than necessary. 
           She’s been waiting to hear that all day. 

                                 SUE
                        Thank you.

           INT. BILL’S MOTEL ROOM - LATER.

           The sounds of porn-style sex fill the room. We pan the floor - 
           clothes, Bill’s gym bag, the flowers. Sue’s feet appear 
           beside the flowers. She bends to pick them up and we follow 
           her back up to see what she sees - Bill fucking his mistress, 
           LEAH (40s, extremely overweight, clearly nasty in the sack) 
           at the foot of the bed. It’s not pretty.

           Sue stands, inches from the oblivious sexing couple’s heads, 
           holding the flowers.

                                 SUE
                        Bill.

           Bill looks up and sees Sue. He opens his mouth and emits a 
           sound that could best be described as half horrified scream 
           half incredible orgasm. His body goes limp and he slumps over 
           on top of Leah.   

                                 LEAH
                        Bill? Bill?!

           Bill doesn’t respond. Cuz Bill’s dead. Leah screams bloody 
           murder as she struggles to get Bill’s limp body off of her. 
           Sue watches, completely shocked at what just happened. Leah 
           finally pushes Bill off and jumps out of bed.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        AAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! 

           Sue snaps into action. She sees a pair of scissors on the 
           desk, grabs it, and points it at Leah.

                                 SUE
                        Stop! Stop screaming!
                                 LEAH
                        I have kids! Please, I have kids! I 
                        have kids!

           Sue lowers the scissors. Beat.

                                 SUE
                        What’s your name?

                                 LEAH
                        Leah.

                                 SUE
                        Leah. Can I have these flowers?

                                 LEAH
                        What?

                                 SUE
                        I know that he bought them for you, 
                        but it only seems fair that I should 
                        have them. Because I’m his wife and 
                        it’s my birthday. Can I have them?  

                                 LEAH
                        Yes.

                                 SUE
                        Thank you.

           Sue stands over Bill’s body and looks down at him.

                                 LEAH
                        Is he okay?

                                 SUE
                        No Leah. He’s dead.

                                 LEAH
                        Oh God! Oh God! 

           Sue points the scissors at Leah. 

                                 SUE
                        Stop it. You stop it.

           Leah whimpers naked in a corner. Sue relishes in this power 
           she has never felt before.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        I am important. I am strong. I am 
                        enough. Don’t you think so Leah?
                                 LEAH
                        Yes.

                                 SUE
                        I do too. I don’t think Bill 
                        thought so. But look at him now. 

                                 LEAH
                        Please. I won’t tell anyone.

                                 SUE
                        What? That your vagina killed my 
                        husband? No, I don’t imagine you 
                        will... Hey, don’t cry.

           Sue wipes Leah’s tears away.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        Everything is going to be okay, 
                        Leah. Because I’m going to take 
                        care of everything. Okay?

                                 LEAH
                        Okay.

                                 SUE
                        Okay. Now go.

           Leah grabs her clothes and runs from the room. Sue stands 
           over Bill, unsure what to do next. She makes a phone call.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        Hi, I have a dinner reservation for 
                        two tonight that I need to cancel. 
                        Under the name Bottoms. Yes, I’m 
                        disappointed too, but my husband 
                        isn’t feeling well, so we won’t be 
                        able to make it. Thank you.

           Sue sits next to Bill.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        You forgot my birthday... What are 
                        we going to do with you, Bill?

           Sue turns on the TV. Sobbing Mom & Dad of missing Tammi Rose 
           are giving a press conference. Sue changes the channel - 
           sobbing Mom & Dad of missing Tammi Rose. Sue changes the 
           channel - sobbing Mom & Dad of missing Tammi Rose. Their 
           faces are on EVERY. SINGLE. CHANNEL. Sue looks down at her 
           dead naked Bill. She looks at sobbing Mom & Dad of missing 
           Tammi Rose. Light bulb!  
           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT.

           Sue digs a hole in the woods behind the motel. She practices 
           her lines.

                                 SUE
                        My husband! Oh God, why is this 
                        happening! 

           Sue drags Bill’s naked, sheet-wrapped body across the dirt 
           and rolls him into the hole.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        My husband! Please, you have to 
                        help me!

           Sue throws Bill’s shoes and clothes into the hole. Sue grabs 
           Bill’s gym bag (the one with 1 million dollars in it) and 
           gives her dead, naked Bill one last look. 

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        My husband, Bill! He’s missing!

           Sue throws the gym bag of money down the hole. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY.

           A small-town police station. They don’t see too much hard 
           crime. The front door swings open and DETECTIVE CAM RAMIREZ 
           (30s, smart, the job is her life) leads in a TEEN ASSHOLE. 
           OFFICER JONES (mid 20s, rookie, eager) falls in step with her 
           and hands her a cup of coffee.  

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        Morning, Detective Ramirez.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Got a bus of teen assholes coming 
                        in for tearing up the county mall. 
                        Half of them are on something this 
                        little Heisenberg wannabe cooked. 
                        Take him to booking for me.

                                 TEEN ASSHOLE
                        My dad has lawyers. I’ll be out in 
                        an hour.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Ted Bundy had lawyers. We executed 
                        him.

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        Okay, daddy’s boy, let’s go to 
                        jail.
           Officer Jones leads Teen Asshole away. Ramirez continues onto 
           her desk. CAPTAIN JESSICA RIGGINS (50s, company woman) 
           approaches her.

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        Ramirez.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Captain.

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        I just got a call from Councilman 
                        Becker. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Who?

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        He says his son was arrested this 
                        morning. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Ah, the dad with lawyers.

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        He’s on his way over here now. 
                        Let’s hold off on booking his son. 
                        See if we can straighten this out. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Manufacturing and distributing 
                        illegal narcotics. What else is 
                        there to get straight?

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        Let’s see what we can do.

           Riggins clasps Ramirez on the shoulder and walks away. 
           Ramirez picks up her desk phone and calls down to booking.

                                 RAMIREZ
                             (on phone)
                        Hey, did Jones just drop off a kid, 
                        last name Becker? Great, let’s put 
                        a rush on that booking. Thanks.

           Ramirez hangs up the phone. She stands and comes face to face 
           with Sue. Ramirez steps back, startled.

                                 SUE
                        Sorry. I didn’t mean to startle 
                        you.
                                 RAMIREZ
                        Can I help you?

                                 SUE
                        I need to report a missing person. 
                        My husband, Bill! He’s missing!

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Okay. Someone can help you fill out 
                        a report up front.

                                 SUE
                        There wasn’t anyone at the front 
                        desk when I came in. 

           Ramirez looks around to see if there’s an officer nearby to 
           help Sue. There isn’t. She pulls out a note pad and signals 
           Sue to take a seat.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Your name?

                                 SUE
                        Sue. Sue Bottoms.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Mrs. Bottoms, when was the last 
                        time you saw your husband?

                                 SUE
                        Yesterday.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Okay, in situations like this, we 
                        recommend checking in with family 
                        and friends first. I can’t tell you 
                        the number of times a man goes out 
                        of town for the weekend and forgets 
                        to tell his wife.

           Officer Jones races by Ramirez and Sue.

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        Ramirez, your bus just showed up!

           At the front we see several police officers trying to control 
           a horde of DRUGGED OUT TEENS who are in the process of 
           screaming and kicking over things.  

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Shit.
                             (to Sue)
                        Wait here!
           Ramirez rushes towards the chaos. Sue follows. An officer 
           bumps into Sue as he tries to restrain a drugged out teen. 
           The teen screams in Sue’s face. 

                                 DRUGGED OUT TEEN
                        WHO ARE YOU?!

                                 SUE
                        My husband--

                                 OFFICER
                        Ma'am, you can’t be here!

                                 SUE
                        I need to report--

                                 OFFICER
                        Move!

           The officer pushes Sue out the door. Sue watches the chaos in 
           the lobby from the doorway. Like always, she’s invisible. The 
           sounds of the station fade to the background as we push in on 
           Sue’s helpless face.

           PRE-LAP the piercing whistle of a tea kettle. We pull out to 
           REVEAL-- 

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER.

           Sue sitting at the kitchen table, staring off into space. Her 
           birthday cake is on the table, a small slice on a plate in 
           front of her. Muffled sounds of the news plays from the TV. 

           The kettle whistles louder and Sue snaps to attention. She 
           stands and makes herself a cup of tea. From behind her, she 
           hears the news anchor move on to the next story.  

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (O.S.)
                        And in heartbreaking news, 13 year 
                        old Tammi Rose is still missing.

           Sue tenses at the sound of Tammi’s name. She turns to face 
           the TV, clenching her mug tightly. The reporter on screen is 
           a woman we will later come to know as GLORIA MICHAELS (bright 
           suit, big hair).

                                 GLORIA MICHAELS
                        Her parents spoke at a press 
                        conference this morning.

           On the news we cut to a press conference with Hilary & 
           Jonathan Rose. Sue clenches the mug tighter. 
                                 HILARY ROSE
                        I know that people are starting to 
                        lose hope. Because of how long it 
                        has been. But I know that my Tammi 
                        is out there and I know that I’ll 
                        see her again.

                                 JONATHAN ROSE
                        Tammi, we--

           Sue lets out a frustrated growl and hurls her mug at the TV. 
           The TV screen cracks, but she can still see those fucking 
           weeping parents. She lunges at the TV and throws it to the 
           floor, shattering it. She tears her kitchen apart in a rage - 
           knocking things over and throwing things to the floor. She 
           picks up her birthday cake, but can’t bring herself to throw 
           it. She sets it back down on the counter. 

           Sue looks around her trashed kitchen, and starts to clean up. 
           The doorbell rings.

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER.

           Sue opens the door and Nancy storms in without acknowledging 
           her. She is yelling at someone on her cell.

                                 NANCY
                             (on phone)
                        I swear to God, Lennie, if they 
                        find that girl before I get an 
                        interview with the parents, I will 
                        lose my fucking shit.  
                             (calling out)
                        Bill!
                             (on phone)
                        Then do your fucking job and get me 
                        another story.

           Sue’s eyes light up when she hears “story” - that’s it!

           Nancy hangs up the phone and continues through the house 
           looking for Bill. Sue pauses at the mirror in the hall. She 
           messes up her hair and sags her shoulders.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Seriously, Bill, if you weren’t 
                        going to show up, you shouldn’t 
                        have taken the job. Made me look 
                        like a fucking--

           Nancy cuts off when she enters--
           BOTTOMS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS.

           Nancy takes in the mess. She finally turns and addresses Sue. 
           Leaning in the doorway, Sue looks so small and fragile.

                                 NANCY
                        Jesus. What happened in here?

                                 SUE
                        Someone destroyed my kitchen.

                                 NANCY
                        What? Who?

           Sue covers her face with her hands.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Sue, what’s going on!

                                 SUE
                        I don’t know. I don’t know. 

           Nancy wraps her arms around Sue.

                                 NANCY
                        Hey, hey, it’s okay. It’s okay. 

           Sue relaxes into Nancy’s chest. Over Sue’s shoulder, Nancy 
           takes in the mess in the kitchen.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Bill?

                                 SUE
                        He’s gone. 

           Nancy pulls back from the embrace and looks at Sue.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        I woke up and... I think someone 
                        took him. Someone took Bill!

                                 NANCY
                        Oh my God! Did you call the police?

                                 SUE
                        I tried. I went to the police, but 
                        they wouldn’t help.

                                 NANCY
                        Are you serious?

                                 SUE
                        Bill is missing and nobody cares.
                                 NANCY
                        The police can’t ignore an 
                        abduction! It’s their job...

           Nancy’s wheels start spinning.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Sue, let me help you.

                                 SUE
                        How?

                                 NANCY
                        If the police won’t do anything, 
                        then we’ll use the media to find 
                        Bill. You’ve seen the Tammi Rose 
                        story? 

                                 SUE
                        The missing girl?

                                 NANCY
                        I can do that. I mean, for you. For 
                        Bill. I can make the public aware, 
                        like with Tammi, so that people are 
                        looking for him. 

                                 SUE
                        Shouldn’t we... go to a bigger news 
                        station?

                                 NANCY
                        No! They wouldn’t give you the 
                        attention you deserve. But I will. 
                        Because you’re family.

           Nancy wraps Sue in another hug.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I can take care of all of this for 
                        you. Okay?

                                 SUE
                        Okay.

           Nancy breaks away and pulls out her cell. She’s back to 
           business as she exits the kitchen.

                                 NANCY
                             (on phone)
                        Lennie, get the crew together. Now!
           Sue exhales as if she’s been holding her breath this whole 
           time. She looks around her trashed kitchen. Finally, unable 
           to contain her excitement, she let’s out a little squeal.

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER.

           The hustle and bustle of the small, clearly low-budget KTV1 
           NEWS CREW: Nancy and her segment producer, LENNIE (40s, 
           schlubby, nervous) argue in a corner; the TECH GUY fiddles 
           with some old lights; the super old MAKEUP WOMAN works on 
           Sue’s face; the CAMERA MAN takes a light test shot of Sue.  

                                 CAMERA MAN
                        We need more light. She’s fading 
                        into the background. 

                                 TECH GUY
                        Dude, this is all we got. Donna’s 
                        gonna have to fix it with make-up.

                                 MAKE UP WOMAN
                        Yeah, cuz I’m a miracle worker.

           Nancy walks away from Lennie. Lennie follows.

                                 LENNIE
                        Nancy, we can get into a lot of 
                        trouble for this.

                                 NANCY
                        We’ll call the police after we get 
                        the shot. Just don’t touch 
                        anything.

                                 LENNIE
                        Jesus!

           Lennie nervously wipes his finger prints off of the last 
           thing he touched. Nancy looks at the shot Camera Man set up. 

                                 NANCY
                        How are we looking?

                                 CAMERA MAN
                        This is the best we’re gonna get. 

           They watch on the camera as Sue fidgets with her hair - how 
           is this plain, boring woman going to save the station?

                                 CAMERA MAN (CONT’D)
                        You sure about this? I mean, 
                        she’s...

           Camera Man has no words to describe the meh in front of him.
                                 NANCY
                        She’s a story.

           Nancy walks up to Sue and gently fluffs up her hair.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to be great.

                                 SUE
                        Thank you.

                                 NANCY
                        You’re sad. 

                                 SUE
                        Yes.

                                 NANCY
                        You feel like crying.

                                 SUE
                        Yes.

                                 NANCY
                             (to the team)
                        Let’s go!

           The team clears and Nancy hits her mark like a pro. 

                                 CAMERA MAN
                        Rolling!

           The camera guy counts Nancy in - 3, 2, 1.

           EXT. STREET - DAY.

           JONELLE (late 20s, very fit, very pregnant) sprints down the 
           sidewalk in workout clothes, focused. This super intense 
           cardio workout is easy for her, even with the huge belly. 

           INT. JONELLE & PETEY’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - DAY.

           Jonelle enters, drops her things down and turns on the TV and 
           exits the room. 

           On TV: Nancy reports from Sue’s house. 

                                 NANCY
                        Local banker, Bill Bottoms, 
                        abducted from his home in what 
                        appears to be a violent struggle. 

           Jonelle re-enters at the sound of Bill’s name. She picks up 
           the remote and raises the volume.
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Bill’s wife, Sue Bottoms, woke up 
                        this morning to find her kitchen 
                        destroyed and her husband missing. 
                        Local police have yet to respond to 
                        the incident.

           Jonelle throws down the remote, annoyed by the inconvenience 
           Bill’s disappearance is sure to cause in her life.

                                 JONELLE
                        God dammit!

           INT. GEORGE’S ELECTRONICS - DAY.

           George talks nonstop as Petey tries to work. 

                                 GEORGE
                        So, in a shoot-out, do you look at 
                        everything you shoot? Or do you 
                        just close your eyes and hope you 
                        hit something?

                                 PETEY
                        Never been in a shoot-out, George.

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s so cool, I-- 

           Petey’s phone rings. It’s Jonelle.

                                 PETEY
                        Gotta take this. Baby. You know.

           Petey quickly walks away before George can keep talking. He 
           answers his phone.

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        Hey babe... what’s wrong? What!
                             (calling to George)
                        George, put the TVs on channel 9!

           George changes the channel and Bill’s picture pops up on all 
           the TVs lining the wall.

           On TV: Nancy reports on Bill. 

                                 NANCY
                        If you have any information 
                        regarding the disappearance of Bill 
                        Bottoms, who is believed to have 
                        been abducted from his home 
                        yesterday, please call the number 
                        on the screen below. 
                                 PETEY
                        Holy shit. They kidnapped my 
                        brother!

                                 GEORGE
                        Should I get my gun? I’ll get my 
                        gun!

           George runs off to get his gun.

           EXT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - LATER.

           The members of the KTV1 News Crew lounge in the grass by 
           their news van.

           Nancy and Sue sit quietly on the porch steps, waiting. Nancy 
           smokes a cigarette. She offers the cigarette to Sue. 

           Sue takes the cigarette. She holds it “the cool way” between 
           her two fingers, but doesn’t smoke. Sue looks down at the 
           cigarette in her hand, relishing this moment of inclusion.

           Nancy puts her hand on Sue’s knee. 

                                 NANCY
                        He’s going to be okay.

                                 SUE
                        Thank you.

           Sue passes the cigarette back to Nancy.

           A police car rolls to a stop in front of the house. Ramirez 
           and Officer Jones get out and walk up to Sue and Nancy, who 
           stand to meet them. Ramirez nods towards news crew.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Usually in a missing person case, 
                        people call the police before they 
                        call the media.

                                 NANCY
                        She tried. 

           Ramirez indicates towards the door.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        May we?

                                 SUE
                        Oh yes, of course. Please come in. 
           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           Ramirez looks around the house. Officer Jones asks Sue the 
           standard initial questions. 

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        When was the last time you saw your 
                        husband?

                                 SUE
                        Yesterday morning. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Kitchen?

                                 SUE
                        This way.

           Sue leads them to...

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS.

           Ramirez closely examines the scene, taking pictures.  

                                 SUE
                        It looks like there was a struggle, 
                        right? With everything thrown all 
                        about. That’s how I knew something 
                        bad had happened. 

           Ramirez clocks the untouched birthday cake with a slice cut 
           out, sitting nicely on the counter. She takes a picture. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        You said missing, not abducted.

                                 SUE
                        What?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Why didn’t you mention a struggle? 
                        This morning at the station.

                                 SUE
                        I tried to tell you. But then all 
                        of those teenagers came in and no 
                        one would listen to me. 

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        When did you realize your husband 
                        was missing?
                                 SUE
                        This morning. When I woke up I 
                        realized that Bill never came home 
                        last night. Then I saw the kitchen. 
                        And I knew something bad had happened.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        You didn’t see the kitchen last 
                        night?

                                 SUE
                        No. It was my birthday and we had 
                        dinner reservations at La Femme 
                        Aimée. It’s that swanky new French 
                        restaurant downtown. But I was 
                        exhausted when I got home, so I 
                        went right upstairs and I lay down 
                        to do my evening affirmations. I 
                        must have fallen asleep because 
                        then it was morning. I knew 
                        something was wrong because Bill 
                        hadn’t woke me. And I came 
                        downstairs and saw the kitchen. And 
                        Bill was gone.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Evening affirmations?

           Sue takes out her phone and plays her affirmations for them.

                                 BRITISH WOMAN (V.O.)
                        You are confident. You are capable. 
                        You are strong.

           Ramirez looks at Jones. He stifles a laugh. Who is this woman?

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER.

           Sue looks at the photos on the fireplace. Officer Jones and 
           Ramirez stand behind her. 

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        Can you think of anyone who would 
                        want to harm your husband?

                                 SUE
                        Oh goodness. I don’t think so. Bill 
                        was such a sweet man. Why would 
                        anyone take him?

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        We’ll do everything we can to find 
                        him, Mrs. Bottoms.
                                 SUE
                        Thank you.

           Sue picks a photo off the fireplace and hands it to Ramirez.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        What’s this?

                                 SUE
                        A photo of me and Bill. For all the 
                        press conferences.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Oh. Right.

           EXT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER.

           Ramirez and Officer Jones walk back to their car. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        She kept talking about him in the 
                        past tense. 

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        You think she knows something?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        I don’t know.

           Ramirez and Officer Jones arrive at their car and look back 
           at Sue, who’s standing in the doorway with Nancy. Sue waves 
           at them. Officer Jones waves back.

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        I mean, she’s a little weird, but 
                        that woman’s definitely not a 
                        criminal mastermind.

                                 RAMIREZ
                             (not 100% convinced)
                        Yeah.

           They get in their car.

           EXT. DINER - DAY.

           Raj and Kavi eat at a table outside. Raj is eating a salad. 
           Kavi watches him curiously, a half eaten burger on her plate. 

                                 KAVI
                        Do you think you’re a grumpy, old 
                        man because you stopped eating 
                        meat? 
           Raj pauses mid bite and looks up at Kavi. Kavi picks up her 
           burger and sticks it in Raj’s face.

                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        Eat it. Come on, what are you guju 
                        now?

                                 RAJ
                        You don’t have to be guju to not 
                        eat meat. I’m being healthy.  

                                 KAVI
                        I bet if you ate burgers like a 
                        normal person you’d smile more?

           Raj silently resumes eating. Kavi starts to smoke.

                                 RAJ
                        You shouldn’t do that.

                                 KAVI
                        Why? Cuz you want me to live 
                        forever so you can stare at my ass 
                        every day?

           Raj looks away, embarrassed. Kavi smiles. She enjoys messing 
           with Raj and making him uncomfortable.

                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, Grumps. I won’t tell 
                        my dad that you think I’m a hottie 
                        with a body. 

           Kavi touches Raj’s hand. He enjoys the touch for a brief 
           moment, but then remembers that she’s the Boss’ daughter and 
           pulls his hand away. Kavi smirks at his discomfort.   

           Petey comes running up.

                                 PETEY
                        What did you do with my brother?!

           Raj shoots up, throws Petey down on the table and presses his 
           fork into Petey’s neck. 

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit! Oh shit! 

                                 KAVI
                             (laughing)
                        No bodyguard today, Petey?
                                 PETEY
                        Look guys, I’m real sorry about 
                        yesterday. George - he was just 
                        kidding around, you know.

           Raj presses his fork harder into Petey’s neck. Petey starts 
           to bleed. Other diners look on uncomfortably, but nobody 
           moves to help Petey. 

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        Aaaah! Fuck! I swear I didn’t mean 
                        any disrespect! I swear! Come on 
                        man, y’all are real fucking scary - 
                        you know I’d never mess with you.

           Raj releases Petey. He sits, wipes off his fork and continues 
           eating his salad. Petey hops off of the table and covers his 
           bloody neck with a napkin.

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        Look, I know Bill screwed up with 
                        the whole changing banks thing. But 
                        he’s sorry and it won’t happen 
                        again. So, just let him go, okay?

                                 KAVI
                        What the fuck are you talking 
                        about?

                                 PETEY
                        Bill’s missing and I know you have 
                        him. 

                                 KAVI
                        What?

                                 PETEY
                        He’s okay though, right? You 
                        haven’t hurt him or anything?

                                 KAVI
                        We don’t--

                                 PETEY
                        Just tell me what you want! What do 
                        you want?

           Kavi leans back and smiles. 

                                 KAVI
                        Twenty grand.

                                 PETEY
                        What?
                                 KAVI
                        That’s his ransom, dumbass. Give us 
                        twenty Gs, and we’ll give you Bill.

                                 PETEY
                        Where am I gonna get twenty grand?!

                                 KAVI
                        Yikes, that sounds like a personal 
                        problem. Tick tock, Petey.

                                 PETEY
                        Okay. Okay. I’ll get you your 
                        money. Just don’t hurt Bill.

           Petey runs off. Kavi bursts out laughing.

                                 KAVI
                        Looks like I’m about to make some 
                        easy cash. 

           Kavi reaches for her burger, but before she can pick it up, 
           Raj stabs it with his knife. Kavi leans back, amused.

                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        See? That’s why you should eat 
                        meat.

                                 RAJ
                        We don’t have Bill.

                                 KAVI
                        So? 

                                 RAJ
                        So, where is he? And where’s your 
                        dad’s million?

           Kavi’s smirk disappears. Oh shit.

           INT. SUE’S CAR - DAY.

           Sue parks. She checks herself in the mirror and fixes her 
           hair. She gets out of her car and looks up at--

           EXT. NEWS STATION - CONTINUOUS. 

           A fancy news station. She smiles.

           INT. NEWS STATION - CONTINUOUS.

           Sue enters the newsroom, which is in go mode as the crew 
           there works to put together that night’s broadcast. 
           This crew is clearly more advanced than Nancy’s. Sue moves 
           through the room unnoticed, taking in everything in awe:

           WRITERS going over notes with PRODUCERS. EDITORS cutting 
           together footage in the editing bay. GLAMOROUS REPORTERS 
           getting their make up done as they rehearse lines.

           GLORIA MICHAELS, the famous anchor from TV, stands near the 
           news desk, doing tongue twisters. Sue watches her, 
           mesmerized. Gloria notices Sue watching her.

                                 GLORIA MICHAELS
                        Can I help you?

                                 SUE
                        Yes. I would like to give you an 
                        exclusive story to play on the 
                        news. 

                                 GLORIA MICHAELS
                        You can drop off any potential 
                        stories at the front desk.

           Gloria Michaels signals an ASSISTANT to come get Sue.

                                 SUE
                        It’s a missing person story.

                                 GLORIA MICHAELS
                        Child?

                                 SUE
                        I’m sorry?

                                 GLORIA MICHAELS
                        Is it a missing child?

                                 SUE
                        No.

                                 GLORIA MICHAELS
                        Senior citizen? Mentally ill? 

                                 SUE
                        No. It’s my husband Bill. 

           Gloria Michaels is clearly not interested. The Assistant 
           appears by their side.

                                 GLORIA MICHAELS
                        My assistant can take your story 
                        and contact info. 
           Gloria Michaels turns back to her work as the assistant leads 
           Sue away. On the monitors, Sue sees footage of Tammi Rose, 
           which will clearly be running again that night. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        If you follow me up to the front-- 

           Sue turns and calls back to Gloria Michaels.

                                 SUE
                        TAMMI ROSE!

           Gloria Michaels looks back up at Sue.

                                 GLORIA MICHAELS
                        What?

                                 SUE
                        She’s the reason my husband is 
                        missing.

           Gloria Michaels walks over to Sue, now very interested.

                                 GLORIA MICHAELS
                        What are you talking about?

                                 SUE
                        Bill figured out who took Tammi 
                        Rose. He was going to tell the 
                        police and I think that’s why he 
                        was taken. I think, if we find 
                        Bill, we’ll find Tammi Rose.  

           Sue puts on her best concerned wife slash citizen face. For a 
           second we believe that if we find Bill, we actually might 
           find Tammi Rose. But then we remember that Bill’s dead. And, 
           let’s be real, that girl’s probably dead too. 

           Gloria Michaels’ eyes widen at the delicious scoop that just 
           fell into her lap. Sue knows she has her. 

           INT. STANLOW COMMUNITY BANK - DAY.

           Raj and Kavi enter and head straight for Bill’s office. Steve 
           appears at their side and falls into step with them.

                                 STEVE
                        Good to see you two again.
                        Steve, Stanlow Banker of the Year.

           He offers his hand. Neither shake.
                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Bill’s actually not in today, but 
                        perhaps I can help you with--

           Raj grabs Steve and throws him into--

           INT. STANLOW COMMUNITY BANK - BILL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS.

           Kavi closes the door behind them. Steve picks himself up off 
           the floor in a huff. 

                                 STEVE
                        I think you two should leave... I’m 
                        calling security.

           Kavi takes out her knife and Steve throws his hands up.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        I live with my mother! She’s very 
                        sick! I give her her medication! I 
                        bathe her! 

                                 KAVI
                        Yo, shut-up! 

                                 STEVE
                        Please don’t kill me.

                                 KAVI
                        I should for making me picture you 
                        bathing your old ass mother. Nasty.

                                 STEVE
                        Please. What do you want?

           Raj gives a piece of paper to Steve.

                                 RAJ
                        Was any money deposited into these 
                        accounts yesterday?

           Steve sits nervously behind Bill’s desk and puts on his best 
           professional banker face. 

                                 STEVE
                        I can certainly check account 
                        balances for you. Thank you for 
                        choosing Stanlow Community Bank for 
                        your banking needs. We appreciate 
                        your business. Wow, these are a lot 
                        of accounts - that’s fine! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEVE (CONT'D)
                        Nothing wrong with having multiple 
                        accounts under different names, 
                        because you two are clearly 
                        businessmen, and I respect that. My 
                        father was a business man. A very 
                        honest profession.

           Steve looks up at them, scared shitless, but trying his 
           darnedest to remain professional.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, it appears that all of 
                        these accounts are empty.   

           Kavi runs her knife along Steve’s face.

                                 KAVI
                        You wouldn’t happen to know where 
                        your colleague Bill is?

                                 STEVE
                        No. He didn’t come in to work 
                        today. I don’t know. I’m so sorry.

                                 RAJ (O.S.)
                        He took it.

           Kavi turns, her knife still pointed at Steve, and sees Raj 
           holding the empty briefcase.

                                 RAJ (CONT’D)
                        He took the money.

                                 KAVI
                        Go ahead. Say I told you so.

                                 RAJ
                        We don’t have time for I told you 
                        so.

           Steve eyes the door, nervously. He makes a break for it! But 
           he trips and falls RIGHT ONTO KAVI’S KNIFE.  

           Steve falls back, blood gushing from his neck. Raj shoots 
           Kavi an annoyed look. Kavi wipes the blood off her knife.

                                 KAVI
                        What? It’s not my fault the mother 
                        bather threw himself onto my knife. 

           Raj puts on gloves and starts to wipe down everything they 
           touched. Kavi squats over Steve, talking to him as he dies.
                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, I’ll wash your old ass 
                        mom for you. I’m kidding, I’m not 
                        gonna do that. 

           Steve dies. Kavi stands.

                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        Okay, let’s go get our money.

           INT. POLICE STATION - LATER.

           Ramirez hangs pictures of Sue’s destroyed kitchen on the 
           board behind her desk. She sits and studies them. She puts a 
           post-it on the picture of the cake with a slice cut out.

           Jones enters holding a file.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Got anything for me?

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        Bill has a younger brother - Peter 
                        Bottoms.  

           Jones hands Ramirez the file. She opens it and we see a 
           mugshot of Petey.

                                 OFFICER JONES (CONT’D)
                        Small timer. Mostly petty theft. 
                        Did some time last year on B&E 
                        charges. Hasn’t been in any trouble 
                        the last few months.

                                 RAMIREZ
                             (grabbing her coat)
                        That we know of.

           INT. GEORGE’S ELECTRONICS - STOCKROOM - LATER.

           Petey stuffs new cell phones and cameras into a duffle bag. 
           The barrel of a gun is pressed against the back of his head.

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        You’re stealing from me?

           Petey slowly stands and turns around. He sees a pissed George 
           pointing his gun at him.

                                 PETEY
                        It’s not what it looks like. I--

           George gets right in Petey’s face and presses the gun against 
           Petey’s forehead.
                                 GEORGE
                        After everything I did for you? 
                        You’re stealing from ME!

                                 PETEY
                        George.

           George pulls the trigger. There’s a click but no bang. Petey 
           screams and ducks away. George starts to laugh.

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck! Fuck! Fuck you, George!

                                 GEORGE
                        Oh come on, that was funny. But 
                        real talk, you’re stealing from me? 

           They both look down at the duffle bag that Petey was stuffing 
           electronics into. Awkward silence. 

           Debbie bursts in. Petey stands in front of his duffle of 
           stolen goods. George hides his gun behind his back.

                                 DEBBIE
                        George! There are police officers 
                        here for the felon!

                                 PETEY
                        What?!

           Petey looks out the stockroom door windows and sees Ramirez 
           and Jones standing at the front. 

                                 DEBBIE
                        What did I tell you, George? What 
                        did I tell you? What’s going on 
                        back here?

                                 GEORGE
                        Nothing. Tell the officers we’ll be 
                        right out.

           Debbie shoots Petey a dirty look as she huffs past him. As 
           soon as she’s gone, Petey turns to George, panicked.

                                 PETEY
                        You called the cops?! Look, I’m 
                        sorry! I need money for Bill’s 
                        ransom! I was going to pay you 
                        back! I swear!

                                 GEORGE
                        Hey, I’m no rat!
                                 PETEY
                        Then what are they doing here?

                                 GEORGE
                        Have you committed any other crimes 
                        lately?

           Petey leans against the wall - it’s all too much.

                                 PETEY
                        I just want to work and be a father. 

                                 GEORGE
                        You should make a break for it! 
                        I’ll distract the pigs! 

           Petey sighs and exits the stockroom to--

           INT. GEORGE’S ELECTRONICS - MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS.

           The front of the store, where Ramirez and Jones are waiting. 
           George follows behind him. He shoos a nosy Debbie away, but 
           then hangs back to watch - Petey’s life is so cool! 

                                 PETEY
                        Can I help you?

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        Peter Bottoms?

                                 PETEY
                        Yeah. Petey. 

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        We’re here about Bill.

                                 PETEY
                        Bill?

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        Your brother, Bill. His wife 
                        reported him missing this morning. 

                                 PETEY
                        Right. I saw that on the news.

           Ramirez jots down a note in her note-pad.

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        When was the last time you spoke to 
                        Bill?

                                 PETEY
                        I want to say a week or two.
                                 RAMIREZ
                        Which is it?  You want to say it or 
                        you’re saying it?

                                 PETEY
                        I’m saying it.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Are you and Bill close?

                                 PETEY
                        Well, he’s my brother, so yeah.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        And you haven’t talked to him in a 
                        week or two?

                                 PETEY
                        I’ve been busy. Work, I’m having a 
                        baby - my girlfriend is.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Can you think of anyone who might 
                        want to harm your brother?

                                 PETEY
                        No I cannot. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Are you okay, Petey?

                                 PETEY
                        Yes.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        You seem nervous.

                                 PETEY
                        Well, I don’t like talking to cops.   
                        Is that a crime?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Can you think of anyone who might 
                        want to harm you?

                                 PETEY
                        What?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Someone who might have taken Bill 
                        as a way to hurt you.
                                 PETEY
                        No, is there anything else? I need 
                        to get back to work.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        We’re trying to help you find your 
                        brother, Petey.

                                 OFFICER JONES (O.S.)
                        Whoa, check this out.

           Ramirez turns to where Jones is looking. Sue is on the TVs 
           lining the walls. Ramirez gets closer.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Turn that up!

           George quickly raises the volume. On the TVs we see--

           Sue sitting across from Gloria Michaels, mid-interview. Sue 
           looks like she’s been crying - she’s getting good at this.

                                 GLORIA MICHAELS
                        And you’re sure he said the name 
                        Tammi Rose?

                                 SUE
                        Yes. Yesterday morning. He made me 
                        breakfast for my birthday. And 
                        while we were eating he said, I 
                        know who took Tammi Rose.

                                 GLORIA MICHAELS
                        Why didn’t you immediately call the 
                        police?!

                                 SUE
                        I didn’t think anything of it. I 
                        don’t watch TV, so I hadn’t heard 
                        about poor Tammi Rose. It wasn’t 
                        until I heard her name at your 
                        station today that I put two and 
                        two together.

                                 GLORIA MICHAELS
                        Even if you didn’t know who Tammi 
                        Rose was - if my husband says that 
                        he knows who took someone, anyone - 
                        I’m going to ask questions. 
                                 SUE
                        I know, and I wish I had. But, you 
                        have to understand Gloria, my 
                        husband Bill is a conspiracy 
                        theorist. He’s always saying things 
                        like he knows who killed JonBenet 
                        Ramsey and he knows who kidnapped 
                        Natalee Holloway-- I thought it was 
                        another conspiracy theory. But then 
                        he went missing and I heard the 
                        Tammi Rose story and-- He knew 
                        something that got him taken!

           Sue starts to cry. Gloria Michael’s addresses the camera. 

                                 GLORIA MICHAELS
                        If you’re just joining us, I’m here 
                        with Sue Bottoms. Is there a link 
                        between the disappearance of her 
                        husband Bill and the disappearance 
                        of thirteen year old Tammi Rose? 

           Jones turns to Ramirez.

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        Guess we don’t need to hold that 
                        press conference.

           Ramirez turns to Petey?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        When was the last time you spoke 
                        with your sister-in-law?

                                 PETEY
                        I don’t know. Sue’s pretty quiet. 
                        We don’t talk much.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        She didn’t reach out to see if you 
                        knew where Bill was?

                                 PETEY
                        No. 

           Ramirez hands Petey her card.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Give me a call if you remember 
                        anything else.

           Ramirez and Jones head toward the exit. Ramirez turns back.
                                 RAMIREZ (CONT’D)
                        What was Bill’s favorite conspiracy 
                        theory?

                                 PETEY
                        What?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Call if you hear anything.

           Ramirez and Jones exit. Petey breathes a sigh of relief. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Do you think the same people who 
                        took Tammi Rose took your brother? 

                                 PETEY
                        No, George, Raj and Kavi took my 
                        brother. And they’re holding him 
                        for ransom! This is fucked. This is 
                        all so fucked. Where am I gonna get 
                        twenty grand? 

                                 GEORGE
                        We have to steal it.

           Petey looks at George. He knows he’s right. 

                                 PETEY
                        Fuck.

           EXT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - LATER

           Sue pulls into her driveway. Her co-workers, Janet & Roberta, 
           are waiting at her doorstep. Janet is holding a casserole 
           dish. She waves when she sees Sue.

                                 JANET
                        Sue! 

           Sue is surprised that her co-workers know her name.

                                 SUE
                        Hello.

                                 JANET
                        We saw you on Gloria Michaels. I am 
                        so sorry about Bill.

                                 ROBERTA
                        So sorry! I can’t even imagine what 
                        you must be going through.

           Roberta hugs Sue.
                                 ROBERTA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll say a prayer for him tonight.

                                 SUE
                        Thank you.

                                 JANET
                        I made you a casserole. I know it’s 
                        hard, but you have to remember to 
                        eat.

           Janet hands her the casserole.

                                 SUE
                        How kind.

                                 ROBERTA
                        If you need anything, let us know, 
                        okay? You’re not alone.

                                 JANET
                        You’re not alone.

                                 SUE
                        Thank you.

           Roberta and Janet turn to go. Sue catches their conversation 
           as they walk away.

                                 JANET (O.S.)
                        Poor thing.

                                 ROBERTA (O.S.)
                        So brave.

           Sue smiles. 

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER.

           Sue clicks through the TV channels until she finds a station 
           that’s playing her story. She picks up the casserole that 
           Janet made her and eats straight out of the pan, enjoying her 
           face on TV. She’s basically a celebrity. 

           The doorbell rings. 

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER.

           Sue answers the front door and finds Nancy there.

                                 NANCY
                        How could you do this to me?
                                 SUE
                        What?

                                 NANCY
                        Gloria Michaels! I broke this 
                        story! This was my story! 

                                 SUE
                        Nancy, my husband is missing. This 
                        isn’t just a story.

           Sue leans in the door frame - the weight of the world on her 
           shoulders. Nancy looks away, embarrassed.   

                                 NANCY
                        How are you holding up?

                                 SUE
                        Okay.

                                 NANCY
                        Can I come in?

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           Sue sits on one end of the couch. Nancy sits on the other. 
           The casserole sits between them. Sue holds it up.

                                 SUE
                        Are you hungry?

                                 NANCY
                        I’m okay.

                                 SUE
                        My friend Janet made it for me. 

                                 NANCY
                        That was sweet of her... Is there 
                        anything I can do for you?

                                 SUE
                        I’m just happy you’re here.

                                 NANCY
                        Of course.

           Nancy reaches across the couch and takes Sue’s hand. Sue 
           smiles at the touch. It feels good to be with her sister. 

                                 SUE
                        Do you remember when we were little 
                        how we would always hold hands when 
                        we walked to school? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SUE (CONT'D)
                        And you would squeeze my hand 
                        whenever we walked by a dog because 
                        you thought they were all out to 
                        get you.

           Nancy smiles to herself. 

                                 NANCY
                        Dogs are the fucking worst. 

                                 SUE
                        And then in sixth grade Shelley 
                        Davis called me ugly, and you said 
                        you didn’t want my ugly to rub off 
                        onto you, so you stopped holding my 
                        hand.

                                 NANCY
                        I was such a little bitch.

                                 SUE
                        Yeah.

           The sisters look at each other and start to laugh.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        I used to pray that you would get 
                        bitten by a dog.

                                 NANCY
                             (laughing)
                        No, you didn’t!

                                 SUE
                        Yeah! Every morning when I was 
                        walking behind you and your friends 
                        on the way to school, I would say - 
                        Dear God, please let a dog bite 
                        Nancy today, right in her pretty 
                        little face. 

                                 NANCY
                        Ouch! Right in the face?  

                                 SUE
                        Yeah. God never answered. But I 
                        don’t think he ever listens to me.

           Nancy is taken aback by the casualness of Sue’s last 
           statement. The phone in the hall rings. 

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be right back.
           Sue smiles at Nancy, gives her hand one last little squeeze 
           and exits to answer the phone. 

           Nancy watches her go, it’s as if she’s seeing her sister for 
           the first time. Nancy takes in the living room - she’s been 
           here before, but she’s never noticed the photos on the walls. 
           There are pictures of Bill and there are pictures of Nancy - 
           these two are the only people Sue has. 

           The sound of the TV catches Nancy’s attention. 

                                 GLORIA MICHAELS (O.S.)
                        And you’re sure he said Tammi Rose?

           She turns and sees Sue on with Gloria Michaels. 

                                 SUE (ON TV)
                        I didn’t think anything of it. I 
                        don’t watch TV, so I hadn’t heard 
                        about poor Tammi Rose. It wasn’t 
                        until I heard her name at your 
                        station today that I put two and 
                        two together.

           Nancy frowns. Something isn’t right. Sue enters.

                                 NANCY
                        Didn’t you know who Tammi Rose was? 

                                 SUE
                        What?

                                 NANCY
                        Before you went to Gloria Michaels. 
                        When I was with you, you called her 
                        the missing girl. 

                                 SUE
                        That was Tammi Rose’s parents. On 
                        the phone. 

                                 NANCY
                        Are you serious? What did they 
                        want?

                                 SUE
                        They want to meet with me. To talk.

           Nancy’s wheels start spinning.

                                 NANCY
                        To talk? Okay. Okay. We need to do 
                        a joint interview. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NANCY (CONT'D)
                        While there’s still buzz about a 
                        possible connection between Tammi 
                        and Bill.

                                 SUE
                        I don’t know.

                                 NANCY
                        Sue, I know you don’t want to think 
                        of this case in terms of the story. 
                        But the media is your best friend 
                        right now and this interview would 
                        be good for both families. It would 
                        bring more attention to Bill’s 
                        story and keep Tammi’s story fresh. 
                        And I know you think it’s gross - 
                        me thinking about the story when 
                        people are missing, and maybe it is 
                        gross. But remember, the bigger the 
                        story, the bigger the chances of 
                        finding Tammi and Bill.

                                 SUE
                        Okay.

                                 NANCY
                        I’ll set it up for you. We’re going 
                        to solve this thing. Together.

           Nancy hugs Sue. Sue smiles.

           INT. TOY WAREHOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - SAME TIME.

           Small, gray and empty. There are a few shelves stocked with 
           boxes of toys from a decade ago and a TV in the corner, but 
           mostly it’s open space. This place is clearly a front. 

           We push through the warehouse, until we get to the back. 
           Through the huge glass window of the back office, we see-- 

           The BOSS (late 60s, Indian, fear-inducing presence). 

           INT. TOY WAREHOUSE - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS.

           Boss takes his time talking to Raj and Kavi, who sit silently 
           across from him. 

                                 BOSS
                        People don’t fear you.

                                 KAVI
                        Dad--

           Boss silences Kavi with a look.
                                 BOSS
                        He took my money because he thinks 
                        he can get away with it. He thinks 
                        he can get away with it because he 
                        doesn’t fear you. I can’t trust you 
                        to handle my business if PEOPLE 
                        DON’T FEAR YOU!

           Boss turns to Raj.

                                 BOSS (CONT’D)
                        She is just a girl. I expected more 
                        from you.

           Kavi tenses at the comment, but knows not to speak.

                                 RAJ
                        We’ll find him.

           Boss signals them to leave. Kavi storms out of the office. 
           Raj follows. 

           EXT. JEWELRY STORE - NIGHT.  

           Sound of a security alarm. Two masked men run from the store, 
           holding bags of jewelry. They jump into a car and take off.

           INT. PETEY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS.

           Petey and George pull off their ski masks as Petey zooms down 
           the street. George screams in exhilaration.

                                 GEORGE
                        Wooooo! Yes! 

           George rolls down his window and sticks his whole torso out 
           until he’s sitting on the window. He screams into the night.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        I’M THE KING OF THE WORLD! I’M THE 
                        KING OF THE WORLD!!!

                                 PETEY
                        Would you get back inside! 

           Petey rolls his eyes, but smiles. He kinda missed the danger.  

           INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT.

           Ramirez is working late. She looks up at her board, which has 
           some new stuff up on it: a picture of Bill, Petey’s mugshot, 
           a screen shot of Sue on the news, a picture of Tammi Rose. 
           Question marks - how is this all connected? 
           Jones approaches her desk holding a folder. 

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        No recent activity on any of Bill’s 
                        credit cards. Last purchase he made 
                        was a bouquet of flowers last night.

           Ramirez stands at her board and looks through the pictures of 
           Sue’s kitchen.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        There are no flowers.

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        What?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        He buys a bouquet of flowers. 
                        Presumably a last minute purchase 
                        for his wife’s birthday. He goes 
                        home. He’s forcibly taken from his 
                        kitchen. Where are the flowers?

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        Maybe the kidnappers took them.

           Ramirez looks up at Jones. She isn’t amused.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Or he never made it back home.

           Captain Riggins appears by their side.

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        We got a body.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Bill?

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        No, but the body was found in his 
                        office.

           INT. STANLOW COMMUNITY BANK - LATER.

           There are several police officers and lab techs and an 
           inconsolable CLEANING LADY. We move towards--

           INT. STANLOW COMMUNITY BANK - BILL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS.

           Steve’s dead body is on the floor. Lab techs take pictures 
           and dust for prints. Jones and Ramirez inspect the scene 
           while the BANK MANAGER gives them all the info he has. 
                                 BANK MANAGER
                        The cleaning lady found him. That’s 
                        Steve Perkins, our best employee.  

                                 LAB TECH
                        He’s been dead about eight hours.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Your best employee is murdered in 
                        your bank in the middle of the day 
                        and nobody notices?

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        Yes. It’s quite unfortunate. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Quite. 

           Ramirez notices the folded phone sex script near Bill’s desk. 
           She picks it up and opens it - “How to Give Great Phone Sex 
           (Yes YOU Can Do It!)”. Ramirez frowns, curious, and hands it 
           to the lab tech.

                                 RAMIREZ (CONT’D)
                        Bag this.

           The Bank manager hands Ramirez a DVD and some pictures.

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        Here’s the surveillance footage you 
                        requested. I’ve also printed out 
                        screen shots of the people who 
                        Steve was last seen with. If that 
                        helps.  

           Ramirez looks at the pictures and then holds it up to Jones.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Officer Jones, who do these people 
                        with our dead banker Steve look 
                        like to you?

           Jones studies the pictures.

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        Let’s see, we’ve got fuzzy blob 1 
                        and fuzzy blob 2.

           Ramirez holds the picture in Bank Manager’s face. We can now 
           see that the image he gave her is worse than crappy. You can 
           barely make out Steve, let alone the mystery clients.
                                 RAMIREZ
                        Okay, we have missing banker Bill 
                        and dead banker Steve. A lot of bad 
                        things are happening to the bankers 
                        at your bank, and this is the 
                        picture you give me? 

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        We’ve never had any trouble before. 
                        It wasn’t cost effective to update 
                        our surveillance system.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Let’s see if Steve agrees.

           Ramirez leans over Steve’s body.

                                 RAMIREZ (CONT’D)
                        Steve do you agree? I don’t think 
                        Steve agrees because Steve is dead 
                        and this joke of an image won’t 
                        help us catch the people who killed 
                        him. 

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        I’m sorry.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Apologize to Steve. 

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        I’m sorry, Steve.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Get me records of all transactions 
                        that Bill and Steve worked on in 
                        the last few months.

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        Well, see, that will be difficult,

                        Believe me, you don’t want to get 
                        in her way.

                        I’ll see what I can do.
           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING.

           Sue sips coffee in her bathrobe. Her kitchen is still a mess. 
           Sue looks at the TV she smashed, sitting in the corner. 

           INT. GEORGE’S ELECTRONICS - LATER.

           Sue browses the TV section. Debbie bounces up to her.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Can I help you?

                                 SUE
                        I want a new TV. A big one.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Bigger is better.
                             (then)
                        Have we met before? You look 
                        familiar.

                                 SUE
                        I’m Sue. Sue Bottoms. 

                                 DEBBIE
                        Ohmygoodness yes! Your husband Bill 
                        is missing!

                                 SUE
                        Yes.

                                 DEBBIE
                        And you’re TV shopping?

           Sue immediately realizes the bad optics of TV shopping while 
           your husband is missing. She covers. 

                                 SUE
                        Bill and I would watch TV together 
                        every morning. And our TV was 
                        destroyed during the abduction. I 
                        just want something to go back to 
                        normal. To keep me from losing my 
                        mind. You think I’m crazy?  

                                 DEBBIE
                        Of course not! I can’t even imagine 
                        what you’re going through. I’d kill 
                        anyone who tried to hurt my George. 
                        Stab them right through the heart.

           Debbie stops in front of a huge flat screen TV.
                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        How about this Samsung? 50 inches, 
                        LED, HDTV, really good picture. 

                                 SUE
                        It’s perfect.

           INT. GEORGE’S ELECTRONICS - STOCK ROOM - SAME TIME.

           George and Petey stand over an open duffle bag full of 
           sparkling jewels.

                                 GEORGE
                        I want to make love to this bag of 
                        bling.

                                 PETEY
                        Please don’t. 

           George picks up a HUGE DIAMOND RING.

                                 GEORGE
                        We should keep some for our ladies. 
                        Debs would have sex with me so hard 
                        if I gave her a diamond.

           Petey takes the ring from George and puts it back in the bag.

                                 PETEY
                        You don’t keep the shit you steal. 
                        That’s how you get caught. This has 
                        gotta be worth at least twenty 
                        grand. I’ll give it to them, I’ll 
                        get Bill and everything will go 
                        back to normal. 

           Petey spots Sue in the store through the stock room window.

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        Shit, it’s Sue!

                                 GEORGE
                        Have you talked to her yet?

                                 PETEY
                        What the hell am I supposed to say? 
                        Hey, it’s been a while, by the way, 
                        I’m the reason your husband got 
                        kidnapped!

                                 GEORGE
                        Well, I wouldn’t lead with that.
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        You can at least let her know that 
                        we’re handling it. Poor thing looks 
                        so sad on TV.

           Petey knows he has to go talk to Sue.

                                 PETEY
                        Shit.

           INT. GEORGE’S ELECTRONICS - CHECK OUT - MOMENTS LATER.

           Sue pays for the TV, which is in a shopping cart next to her. 
           Debbie hands back her credit card. 

                                 DEBBIE
                        Five percent discount. For Bill. 

           Sue smiles in gratitude and heads towards the exit. 

           EXT. GEORGE’S ELECTRONICS - CONTINUOUS.

           Sue pushes her cart towards her car. Petey chases after her.

                                 PETEY
                        Sue! Sue!

           Sue turns back, surprised to see Petey.

                                 SUE
                        Oh, hi Peter. What are you doing 
                        here?

                                 PETEY
                        I work here now. How are you 
                        holding up? With everything.

                                 SUE
                        Not great.

                                 PETEY
                        I’m going to get Bill back.

                                 SUE
                        What? How? I mean... do you know 
                        where he is? 

                                 PETEY
                        No! I don’t know where he is or who 
                        took him or why or anything really. 
                        I don’t know anything. Do you know 
                        anything?

                                 SUE
                        I don’t know anything. 
                                 PETEY
                        Me neither. But I wanted you to 
                        know that I’m handling it. I’m 
                        going to get Bill back. 

           Petey turns and heads back to the store. Sue watches him go, 
           nervous. What does he know? 

           INT. GEORGE’S ELECTRONICS - LATER.

           Petey enters the store and is immediately hit in the head 
           with a giant purse. He turns to see a pissed off Jonelle. 

                                 JONELLE
                        You didn’t come home last night, 
                        jackass!

                                 PETEY
                        Shit. I meant to call you. I ended 
                        up working late, so I crashed at 
                        George’s place upstairs.

                                 JONELLE
                        Try again.

                                 PETEY
                        Jo--

                                 JONELLE
                        Where were you?!

                                 PETEY
                        I was working late! Ask George if 
                        you don’t believe me. Yesterday was 
                        fucked, okay? With everything going 
                        on with Bill. I needed to work, to 
                        keep myself from going crazy. 

                                 JONELLE
                        I’m here for you.

                                 PETEY
                        I know. 

                                 JONELLE
                        You can’t just not show up.

                                 PETEY
                        I should’ve called. I’m an idiot. 

           Petey kneels and talks to Jonelle’s belly.

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        Daddy’s an idiot. But he’s trying.
           Petey looks up at Jonelle.

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        He’s really trying.

                                 JONELLE
                        You didn’t do anything bad last 
                        night?

                                 PETEY
                        No. I’m done with that, I told you.

                                 JONELLE
                        Okay.

                                 PETEY
                        Your boyfriend is now a boring 
                        shelf stocker.

           Petey stocks some equipment onto a shelf in a very boring 
           fashion for emphasis. Jonelle laughs.

                                 JONELLE
                        That’s all I want.

           Jonelle kisses Petey. 

                                 JONELLE (CONT’D)
                        Come home on your lunch break.

                                 PETEY
                        I want to... and I will.

           Jonelle smiles up at Petey.

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATER.

           Sue drags her new flat screen through the front door and 
           leans it against the wall. She closes the door, turns and 
           comes face to face with Raj and Kavi. Sue backs up, scared. 

                                 SUE
                        Who are you? How did you get into 
                        my house?

                                 KAVI
                        We’re looking for Bill.

                                 SUE
                        Bill’s missing.

                                 KAVI
                        Do you have any idea where he might 
                        have gone missing to?
                                 SUE
                        No.

           Kavi approaches Sue. Sue backs up until she is pressed 
           against the wall. Kavi is right in Sue’s face. She runs her 
           finger along Sue’s neck. Kavi looks at Raj to see if he is 
           watching. He is. Raj looks away uncomfortably. Kavi smiles. 

                                 KAVI
                             (to Sue)
                        You don’t know where Bill is?

                                 SUE
                        No.

                                 KAVI
                        Are you sure?

                                 SUE
                        Yes. 

                                 KAVI
                        Are you sure?

                                 SUE
                        Yes.

                                 KAVI
                        Where’s Bill?

                                 SUE
                        I don’t know.

                                 KAVI
                        Where’d you get the money for this 
                        TV?

                                 SUE
                        Credit card. They gave me a five 
                        percent discount. You can have it. 

                                 KAVI
                        We want to find Bill.

                                 SUE
                        Me too.

                                 KAVI
                        Do you want us to help you find 
                        him?

                                 SUE
                        Yes.
                                 KAVI
                        We’ll help you find him.

                                 SUE
                        Okay.

           Kavi takes out a card with a number on it. She tucks it into 
           the top of Sue’s shirt. 

                                 KAVI
                        You’ll call if you hear from Bill?

                                 SUE
                        Yes.

           Kavi caresses Sue’s face.

                                 KAVI
                        You won’t talk to the police?

                                 SUE
                        No.

                                 KAVI
                        It would make it hard for us to 
                        help you find Bill.

                                 SUE 
                        Yes.

                                 KAVI
                        Are you afraid?

                                 SUE
                        Yes.

           Kavi touches her forehead to Sue’s forehead... for an 
           uncomfortably long time. And then-- 

           Kavi turns and leaves through the front door. Raj follows her. 
           Sue sinks down to the floor, shaken. Shit just got real. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - LATER.

           Ramirez looks at her board. There are new things on it: the 
           crappy grainy image of Raj and Kavi and the phone sex script. 
           She is wearing the same clothes from the night before. 

           Jones enters holding coffee.

                                 OFFICER JONES 
                        Please don’t tell me you’ve been 
                        here all night.
                                 RAMIREZ
                        Please don’t waste my time with 
                        small talk. 

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        The bank is stalling on the 
                        transaction records, but I’ll keep 
                        working that lead. See if I can 
                        uncover our fuzzy blobs.   

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Bill was having an affair.

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        What?

           Ramirez points to the phone sex script on her board.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        From his office.

           Officer Jones reads from the script.

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        Move your fat fingers down and 
                        touch your - whoa.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Does Sue strike you as the phone 
                        sex type? 

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        No. And she definitely isn’t fat.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        And then there’s the cake. 

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        What?

           Ramirez points out the pictures of the cake.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        She said they never got a chance to 
                        celebrate. But a slice is missing. 
                        Who wakes up, finds their kitchen 
                        destroyed and their husband missing 
                        - and then eats cake?
                                 OFFICER JONES
                        So, you think Sue violently 
                        kidnapped her own husband, reported 
                        him missing, then went to his 
                        office and stabbed his coworker 
                        Steve to death?

           Ramirez hears how strange that sounds. Jones points to the 
           grainy image of Raj and Kavi.

                                 OFFICER JONES (CONT’D)
                        These are our killers. Fuzzy blob 1 
                        and fuzzy blob 2. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Yeah.

           Ramirez leans back in her seat. She stares at Sue’s picture. 
           Something’s off.

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER.

           Nancy’s crew sets up for the interview. Sue is still visibly 
           rattled from her encounter with Raj and Kavi. Nancy clips a 
           small mic to Sue’s collar. The Camera Man flashes his camera 
           in Sue’s face. For the first time, Sue is overwhelmed by all 
           of the attention.     

                                 NANCY
                        Are you okay?

                                 SUE
                        Yes.

                                 NANCY
                        You seem jumpy.

           The doorbell rings. Sue jumps. Nancy rubs her shoulders. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I’m here. You’re okay. Lennie get 
                        the door!

           Lennie scurries out to get the door. The camera flashes in 
           Sue’s face again. Sue begins to unravel. 

                                 SUE
                        I don’t want to do this anymore.

                                 NANCY
                        What?

                                 SUE
                        I can’t.
                                 NANCY
                        Don’t do this, Sue.

           Lennie enters with Hilary and Jonathan Rose. They are 
           surprised to see the camera and crew. 

                                 JONATHAN ROSE
                        Sue? 

           Nancy approaches them.

                                 NANCY
                        Hi, I’m Nancy, Sue’s sister. I’ll 
                        be hosting the interview.

                                 JONATHAN ROSE
                             (to Sue)
                        You said Bill knew who took Tammi 
                        Rose.

                                 NANCY
                        We’ll discuss all of that during 
                        the interview.
                             (whispering)
                        Lennie get them mic’d.

                                 HILARY ROSE
                        Please, Sue, do you know anything 
                        about my daughter?

           Sue’s world starts to spin, as she begins to have a panic 
           attack, very similar to the one she had outside the motel. 
           She can see everyone watching her, but can’t quite make out 
           what they’re saying. 

           A voice behind Sue cuts through the fog of her breakdown.

                                 LEAH (O.S.)
                        Hi, Sue.

           Sue turns and sees Leah standing in the doorway. Sue freezes. 
           Quick images flash through Sue’s head: Bill fucking Leah, the 
           flowers, Leah whimpering naked, the scissors, Bill fucking 
           Leah. Under this we hear the slow, soothing sounds of a 
           British woman’s voice: 

                                 BRITISH WOMAN (VO)
                        You are capable. You are confident. 
                        You are enough. 

           Leah smiles and takes in the scene. 
                                 LEAH
                        Are you going to be on the news 
                        again?

                                 NANCY
                        Who’s she?

           Sue snaps into action. 

                                 SUE
                        A friend. I’ll be right back.

           Sue grabs Leah and drags her--

           EXT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           To the front porch.

                                 SUE
                        What are you doing here?

                                 LEAH
                        Where’s the money?

                                 SUE
                        What money?

                                 LEAH
                        Maybe I go on the news too. Tell 
                        them what really happened to Bill.

           Sue drags Leah down the porch steps and away from the house. 
           Leah pulls her arm away.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        You get your hands off me! I’m not 
                        scared of you. I can tell everyone 
                        about Bill, so don’t mess with me!

                                 SUE
                        I’m sorry, you must be mistaken. 
                        You know nothing about Bill.

                                 LEAH
                        Oh yeah? Maybe I go to the police.

                                 SUE
                        Don’t forget, I’m doing you a favor 
                        here. Or do you want the world and 
                        your kids to know that it was your 
                        poisonous vagina that killed my 
                        husband? 
           Sue reaches out and runs her finger along Leah’s neck, just 
           as Kavi did to her earlier.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think you do. So, as I 
                        said, you know nothing about Bill.

                                 LEAH
                        I don’t have any kids. Yeah. I only 
                        said that because you were pointing 
                        scissors at me like a crazy psycho 
                        and I didn’t want you to kill me.

           Leah imitates what Sue did to her that night at the motel.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        I am important! I am strong! I am 
                        enough! Don’t you think so, Sue?   

           Sue doesn’t respond.

                                 LEAH (CONT’D)
                        I want that money.

           Leah walks towards her car. Sue’s eyes darken as she watches 
           her go. She takes the card that Kavi gave her out of her 
           pocket and looks at it. She makes a phone call.

                                 SUE
                             (on phone)
                        Hi. This is Sue. I know someone who 
                        can help you find Bill. 

           Sue looks across the street. She sees Ramirez sitting in her 
           car, watching her.

           INT./EXT. RAMIREZ’S CAR - CONTINUOUS.

           Ramirez watches as Leah gets into her car. She quickly jots 
           down Leah’s plate number as she drives off. She turns back to 
           Sue, who hangs up her phone and approaches her car.

                                 SUE
                        Hi Detective. Have you made a break 
                        in the case?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Not yet. Just checking in.

                                 SUE
                        That’s so sweet of you. I’m sick 
                        with worry, but I’m holding up 
                        okay. The community has been a 
                        really great support. 
                                 RAMIREZ
                        Who was that woman you were talking 
                        to?

                                 SUE
                        An old friend.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        It didn’t look like a friendly 
                        conversation. 

                                 SUE
                        Well, to be honest, she hasn’t made 
                        the time to show her support like 
                        others have. My friend Janet, she 
                        made me a casserole. But I 
                        shouldn’t have snapped at her. I 
                        can’t expect everyone to stop their 
                        lives and come to my aid because my 
                        husband is missing.  

           Ramirez studies Sue. Is she crazy for thinking something’s 
           off with this sweet simple woman?

           Ramirez points to the KTV1 News van in Sue’s driveway.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Do you have any new information for 
                        me? Or do I have to wait to find 
                        out on tonight’s news with the rest 
                        of the world? 

                                 SUE
                        Nothing new, unfortunately. We’re 
                        just doing everything we can to 
                        raise awareness. I should get back 
                        inside. Thank you for stopping by 
                        Detective Ramirez.

           Sue heads back across the street. Ramirez calls after her.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        When did you eat the cake?

           Sue turns back around.

                                 SUE
                        I’m sorry?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        You said you didn’t have a chance 
                        to celebrate your birthday that 
                        night. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RAMIREZ (CONT'D)
                        And Bill was gone when you woke up 
                        in the morning. So, when did you 
                        eat the cake?

           There is a moment - a quick moment - where both women really 
           see each other. Ramirez sees the master manipulator who knows 
           more about her husband’s disappearance than she says. Sue 
           sees the cunning detective who is onto her act. 

           And as quickly as they came down, the masks are back up. And 
           the game is back on.

                                 SUE
                        I guess Bill must have snuck a 
                        piece. Before he was taken.

           Sue starts to cry.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        Detective Ramirez, please find my 
                        husband and bring him home. I just 
                        want my husband back.

           Ramirez smiles slightly at Sue - good one.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        I’ll do all I can, Mrs. Bottoms.

                                 SUE
                        Thank you.

           Ramirez starts her car and drives off. Sue immediately stops 
           crying and frowns as she watches Ramirez’s car disappear 
           around the corner.

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        Mr. and Mrs. Rose, please wait!

           Sue turns to see--

           EXT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           Hilary & Jonathan Rose hurrying out of her house, followed by 
           Nancy. Sue hurries back across the street.

                                 SUE
                        What’s going on?

                                 JONATHAN ROSE
                        We can’t do this. It’s too much for 
                        her - all of the constant cameras. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JONATHAN ROSE (CONT'D)
                        It feels like the world is taking 
                        some sort of sick pleasure in 
                        watching our pain. We just want our 
                        little girl back.

           Jonathan joins Hilary, who is already waiting in the car. The 
           Roses drive off. Nancy accosts Sue.

                                 NANCY
                        They lost their nerve waiting on 
                        you. I needed this interview! 

                                 SUE
                        I’m sorry. Detective Ramirez 
                        stopped by to check in. We can 
                        still do the interview.

                                 NANCY
                        We can’t do the interview without 
                        the Roses, the Roses were the hook, 
                        no one is going to want to watch 
                        just you!

           Sue’s face falls - that hurt. Nancy knows she went too far.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. That was a stupid thing 
                        to say... Let’s do the interview.

                                 SUE
                        It’s okay. I think it would be best 
                        for me to do my interviews with 
                        Gloria Michaels anyway. She’ll 
                        reach a larger audience. For Bill.

           Sue heads back to the house. Nancy watches her go. Her sister 
           may not be the powerless victim she thought she was - there’s 
           a darkness there. 

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           Sue pauses in the entrance to the living room and addresses 
           Nancy’s crew.

                                 SUE
                        Thank you for coming. I won’t be 
                        filming today. You can go.

           Sue continues upstairs.

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER.

           Sue sits in front of her vanity, looking at herself in the 
           mirror. We can hear Nancy’s crew packing up downstairs.
                                 SUE
                        You are powerful. You are strong. 
                        You don’t need the Roses. Your 
                        story is important. You are 
                        important.  Who’s important?

           Sue points at herself in the mirror.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        You’re important!

           Sue smiles, because for the first time, she believes it.

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER.

           The shades are drawn. The only light in the room comes from 
           Sue’s giant new flat screen TV. The news is on, but Sue’s not 
           on it. 

           Sue sits in the middle of the floor, working intently on 
           something. From behind we can’t quite make out what she is 
           doing. But as we travel around, we see magazines, lots of 
           magazines. Sue is wearing plastic gloves. She carefully cuts 
           letters out of a magazine.

           INT. JONELLE & PETEY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER.

           Jonelle is asleep in bed. Petey quickly and quietly gets 
           dressed. He looks at Jonelle before he leaves. He gently puts 
           his hand on her belly.

                                 PETEY
                             (whispering, a promise)
                        I’m going to pay taxes and I’m 
                        going to be a family man.

           Jonelle stirs slightly.

                                 JONELLE
                        Hmm?

                                 PETEY
                        Best afternoon delight ever. 

           Jonelle smiles in her sleep.

                                 JONELLE
                        I love you.

                                 PETEY
                        I love you too.
           Petey gives her a kiss and turns to go. He grabs his hoodie 
           on the way out the door. The HUGE DIAMOND RING that George 
           was holding earlier falls out. Petey doesn’t notice. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - LATER.

           Ramirez runs the drivers license number she took down at 
           Sue’s house. Her phone is to her ear - she’s on hold. Leah’s 
           drivers license pops up on her screen.  

                                 RAMIREZ
                             (on the phone)
                        Yes, hello? Yes, Sue Bottoms, two 
                        nights ago. You’re sure she 
                        canceled the reservation? Okay, 
                        thank you.

           Ramirez hangs up the call. She writes “La Femme Aimée” on a 
           piece of paper and pins it to her board. She prints out 
           Leah’s drivers license.

                                 RAMIREZ (CONT’D)
                        Who are you, Leah Norton?

           Jones hurries over, excited.

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        The numbers came in from the bank. 
                        Dead banker Steve was clean. But 
                        missing banker Bill has been up to 
                        no good. He’s been laundering money 
                        through the bank for months now. 
                        AND--

           Jones holds up two grainy images.

                                 OFFICER JONES (CONT’D)
                        These are from the day that Bill 
                        went missing. Fuzzy blob 1 and 
                        fuzzy blob 2. The guys who killed 
                        Steve definitely met with Bill the 
                        day he disappeared! 

           Ramirez, who has been staring at her board this whole time, 
           doesn’t respond. 

                                 OFFICER JONES (CONT’D)
                        Okay, I don’t need a gold star, but 
                        I think we can both admit that this 
                        is a major break. Ramirez.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        She canceled their dinner 
                        reservation that night.
                                 OFFICER JONES
                        Don’t tell me you’re still on the 
                        wife.

           Captain Riggins storms over.

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        Ramirez!

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        Hi Captain Riggins!

           Riggins ignores Jones and goes in on Ramirez.

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        Have you been following Sue 
                        Bottoms?! Sitting outside her 
                        house?!

                                 RAMIREZ
                        I have not been following her.

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        What do you think you’re doing, 
                        Ramirez?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        I think I’m working my case.

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        By harassing the victim’s grieving 
                        wife? Her sister’s a reporter! We 
                        don’t need more bad press on this.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Captain, something is not right 
                        with that woman.

           Ramirez goes to her board and points out all of the evidence 
           as she talks.

                                 RAMIREZ (CONT’D)
                        She canceled their dinner 
                        reservation the night Bill 
                        disappeared. Why cancel your dinner 
                        plans, unless you already know that 
                        your husband won’t be there for 
                        them? And then the whole Tammi Rose 
                        thing - no one else in Bill’s life 
                        has ever heard him talk about 
                        conspiracy theories. But now all of 
                        a sudden, according to Sue, he’s a 
                        conspiracy theorist who has 
                        information on who took Tammi Rose. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RAMIREZ (CONT’D)
                        And then the birthday cake. Her 
                        story keeps changing and it doesn’t 
                        add up. Not to mention her odd 
                        obsession with being on the news. 
                        Captain, she knows something. I can 
                        feel it.  

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        Do you hear yourself, Ramirez? 
                        Birthday cakes and dinner 
                        reservations? That’s your evidence?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Captain--

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        What do you think Officer Jones? Do 
                        you share Detective Ramirez’s 
                        “feelings?” 

           Ramirez looks to Jones to back her up. Jones averts his eyes 
           uncomfortably. 

                                 OFFICER JONES 
                        Oh, um, well, I think Mrs. Bottoms 
                        is strange for sure. But I don’t 
                        think she has anything to do with 
                        her husband’s disappearance. Our 
                        strongest lead is the bank. Bill 
                        was laundering money and he’s 
                        somehow connected to these men who 
                        we believe killed Steve Perkins.

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        And that Ramirez is actual 
                        evidence.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Sue--

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        Stand down, Ramirez. Or you’re off 
                        the case.

           Captain Riggins turns and walks away. Ramirez seethes at her 
           desk. Jones stands awkwardly by her side.

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        I think if we focus on--

                                 RAMIREZ
                        I am the senior officer on this 
                        case. You back me up!
                                 OFFICER JONES
                        I can’t back you up when what 
                        you’re saying doesn’t make sense!

           A tense silence. Ramirez grabs the print out of Leah’s 
           drivers record and heads out.

                                 OFFICER JONES (CONT’D)
                        Ramirez--

                                 RAMIREZ
                        You keep working that bank lead, 
                        Officer Jones. Gold star.

           Ramirez walks away.

           EXT. SHOPPING CENTER PARKING LOT - DAY.

           Raj’s car is parked in an empty section of a large outdoor 
           parking lot. Kavi leans against the outside of the passenger 
           door, smoking. Through the window, we can see Raj sitting in 
           the drivers seat.

                                 RAJ
                        We don’t have time for this. 

                                 KAVI
                        Relax, Grumps.

           Petey’s car pulls up next to them. Petey gets out, clutching 
           a duffle bag.

                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        Took you long enough. We were about 
                        to leave and go kill Bill. You have 
                        the money?

                                 PETEY
                        Yeah.

           Petey unzips the duffle bag and shows Kavi the jewels.

                                 KAVI
                        What the fuck is this?

                                 PETEY
                        It’s at least twenty grand, 
                        probably even more! Come on. It’s 
                        the best I could do on short 
                        notice. Please.

                                 KAVI
                        You know what? I’m feeling 
                        hospitable. 
           Kavi grabs hold of the bag, but Petey doesn’t let go.

                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        This is the part where you let go 
                        of the bag.

                                 PETEY
                        Where’s Bill?

                                 KAVI
                        He’s with the Boss. Just waiting 
                        for us to get back with the ransom 
                        so that he can go home. 

                                 PETEY
                        I’m not giving you the bag until 
                        you give me Bill.

                                 KAVI
                        How about this? You let go of the 
                        bag and then we let Bill go. Or, I 
                        kill you, take the bag, and then go 
                        kill Bill. 

           Petey lets go of the bag. Kavi smiles and clasps him on the 
           shoulder.

                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        You gotta be more trusting, Petey. 
                        Suspicion is bad for the soul.

           Raj calls from inside the car, annoyed.

                                 RAJ
                        Let’s go.

           Kavi hops into the car with the bag of money. Raj starts the 
           car and pulls out. Kavi gives Petey one last reassuring smile 
           and wave through her window as they drive away. 

           INT. RAJ’S CAR - CONTINUOUS.

           Kavi unzips the duffle and takes another look at the bling.

                                 KAVI
                        Easiest money I’ve ever made. 

                                 RAJ
                        Congratulations. Now how about you 
                        focus on getting your dad’s million 
                        back?

           Kavi zips up the bag.
                                 KAVI
                        Don’t kill my vibe, Old Man Grumps. 
                        Today’s a good day.

           Kavi turns to put the bag on the back seat. We REVEAL: Leah, 
           bound and gagged, lying on the floor of the car. 

                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                             (to Leah)
                        Don’t you think it’s a good day?

           Leah tries to scream, but all we hear is a muffled sound.

                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                             (to Leah)
                        No?

           Kavi turns back around in her seat.

                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        Well, I think it’s a good day.

           Raj and Kavi drive on.

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - LATER.

           Ramirez pulls up in her car and gets out. She checks an 
           address on a piece of paper and walks up to a house. She 
           knocks on the door. No answer. Ramirez sees Leah’s car parked 
           in the driveway. She knocks again.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Police! Ms. Norton?

           Ramirez tries the door handle. It’s unlocked. Ramirez 
           hesitates... but then goes inside.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           Ramirez enters cautiously and calls out her presence.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Police! Leah Norton?

           Ramirez moves through the house and sees:

           Leah’s purse, keys and cellphone sitting on the hall table.

           A home cooked dinner sitting on the kitchen table, untouched.

           The fridge door, open.

                                 RAMIREZ (CONT’D)
                        Ms. Norton?!
           Something doesn’t feel right. 

           INT. TOY WAREHOUSE. BACK OFFICE - LATER.

           Boss works at his desk. Through the window, he sees Kavi and 
           Raj enter the warehouse dragging a gagged Leah. Kavi holds up 
           Leah’s hand like a prize and screams across the warehouse.

                                 KAVI
                        We got you a present!

           INT. TOY WAREHOUSE. MAIN FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER.

           Boss walks over to Kavi and Raj, who are in the process of 
           tying Leah to a chair.

                                 KAVI
                        It’s the mistress. The wife put us 
                        on her.

           Leah’s eyes widen - Sue sent these bad guys after her!

           Boss takes off Leah’s gag. She immediately screams. Boss 
           backhands her to silence. Leah whimpers and starts to cry.

                                 BOSS
                        So, you’re the little mistress?

                                 KAVI
                        Little? Ha.

           Kavi turns on the TV and starts to channel surf. 

                                 LEAH
                        Tell Sue I’m sorry.

                                 BOSS
                        I don’t care about your infidelity. 
                        What do you know about Bill?

           Leah remembers how Sue told her to respond. Is this a test? 
           She gives the answer she thinks they want to hear, hopeful.

                                 LEAH
                        Nothing. I promise. I know nothing.

           Boss slaps her.

                                 BOSS
                        Where’s Bill?

                                 LEAH
                        I know nothing!
           Boss slaps her again, hard.

                                 BOSS
                        Are you lying to me, little 
                        mistress?

           Leah is dizzy, bleeding and sobbing. She honestly doesn’t 
           know what they want her to say.

                                 LEAH
                        I don’t know.

                                 BOSS
                        You don’t know if you’re lying?

                                 LEAH
                        I won’t tell anyone about Bill! I 
                        promise!

                                 BOSS
                        What do you know about Bill?

                                 LEAH
                        I know nothing.

                                 KAVI
                        Is this chick retarded?

           Raj brings over a tool box. Leah looks helplessly at her 
           captors. 

                                 LEAH
                        What do you want me to say? I’ll 
                        say whatever you want me to say!

           Raj pulls out a bolt cutter.

                                 BOSS
                        Cut off her fingers.

                                 LEAH
                        Wait!

                                 KAVI (O.S.)
                        Holy shit!

           Everyone turns to Kavi, whose eyes are on the TV. She raises 
           the volume. Gloria Michaels is mid segment.

                                 GLORIA MICHAELS
                        A ransom note was sent to the wife 
                        of Bill Bottoms, demanding $50,000 
                        for his safe return. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GLORIA MICHAELS (CONT'D)
                        Bill was reported missing yesterday 
                        morning by his wife, Sue. She spoke 
                        at a press conference earlier 
                        today. 

           The news segment cuts to a clip from Sue’s press conference. 
           Sue stands alone in front of her house, as the lights and 
           cameras flash around her. 

                                 SUE
                        We aren’t wealthy. We aren’t bad. 
                        We are good, normal people. Please. 
                        Whoever has my husband, please let 
                        him go. Bill, if you are watching, 
                        I love you. 

           Kavi turns to Boss and Raj.

                                 KAVI
                        Yoooo, Bill was actually kidnapped!

           INT. NANCY’S CAR - LATER.

           Nancy watches Sue’s house from across the street and a few 
           houses down. Her passenger door opens and Lennie climbs in.

                                 NANCY
                        Did you bring the camera?

           Lennie holds up the video camera. 

                                 LENNIE
                        I don’t know what you think we’re 
                        going to get from watching Sue. We 
                        should just work another story.

                                 NANCY
                        Sue’s lying. 

                                 LENNIE
                        You’re upset that she didn’t tell 
                        you about the press conference.

                                 NANCY
                        I bet that ransom note’s fake. I 
                        think Sue knows what happened to 
                        Bill.

                                 LENNIE
                        What?

                                 NANCY
                        She was mic’d.
           Nancy takes out a tape recorder and hit’s play. We hear Sue 
           and Leah’s voices from their porch conversation.

                                 SUE (V.O.)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 LEAH (V.O.)
                        Where’s the money?

                                 SUE (V.O.)
                        What money?

                                 LEAH (V.O.)
                        Maybe I go on the news too. Tell 
                        them what really happened to Bill.

           We hear the rustle of movement and then the audio cuts out.

                                 NANCY
                        Found this when I was going through 
                        the audio from earlier. They must 
                        have moved out of signal range 
                        because it cuts out, but it’s clear 
                        that Sue’s lying about Bill. 
                        There’s way more to this story than 
                        we thought. Way more. 

                                 LENNIE
                        Oh my God! We have to give that to 
                        the police!

                                 NANCY
                        I will. After I uncover the truth 
                        and break the story. 

                                 LENNIE
                        Nancy, you can’t hold onto evidence! 
                        That’s obstruction! You could go to 
                        jail!

                                 NANCY
                        There’s a big fucking story here 
                        and I’m not giving anything to the 
                        police until I get it. If you can’t 
                        deal with that, then leave the 
                        camera and get the fuck out of my 
                        car. 

           Lennie sits back in his chair and holds the camera. He’s in. 
           Nancy looks across the street and watches Sue’s house. 
           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER.

           Sue stands in front of her flat screen critiquing a news 
           segment of her press conference.

                                 SUE
                        Come on, my face is over there! 
                        What is this angle? Zoom in! Well, 
                        that is the last press conference I 
                        invite you to, channel 4.

           Sue changes the channel to a different news stations segment 
           of the same press conference. They have a better angle.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, see, now this is nice camera 
                        work. Channel 4, you can learn a 
                        thing or two from channel 9. Look 
                        how they captured the emotion.

           Sue rewinds the segment and plays it again.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        Stunning.

           The doorbell rings. Sue pauses the TV and exits to--

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS.

           Sue answers the door and finds Ramirez standing there. 

                                 SUE
                        Detective Ramirez.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Where is she?

                                 SUE
                        Who?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        I saw you arguing with her this 
                        morning and now she’s gone.  

                                 SUE
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        You need to come to the police 
                        station with me.

                                 SUE
                        Am I under arrest?
           Ramirez hesitates. 

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        Then I will not be going to the 
                        police station with you.

           Sue and Ramirez stare at each other - standoff. Ramirez 
           notices the empty TV box for Sue’s new flat screen.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Did you buy a new TV?

                                 SUE
                        Is that a crime?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Turn around and put your hands 
                        behind your back.

                                 SUE
                        What?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        I’m detaining you for questioning 
                        regarding the disappearances of 
                        Bill Bottoms and Leah Norton. 

           Sue turns around and puts her hands behind her back.

                                 SUE
                        I think you’re going to regret 
                        this, Detective Ramirez.

           The look on Ramirez’s face lets us know that she thinks the 
           same exact thing, but it’s too late to turn back now.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Let’s go.

           Ramirez walks Sue to her car, puts her in the back and drives 
           off, past Nancy’s car.

           INT. NANCY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS.

           Nancy smiles behind the camera. She got the whole arrest on 
           video. Nancy hands the camera to Lennie and starts the car.

                                 NANCY
                        Tip off the other stations. 

                                 LENNIE
                        Wait, you’re giving away the lead?
                                 NANCY
                        The bigger the arrest story, the 
                        more people watching when we reveal 
                        something that no one else has.  

           Nancy holds up the tape recorder and starts her car. 

           INT. GEORGE’S ELECTRONICS - STOCKROOM - LATER.

           Petey paces, enraged. George fiddles with his gun.

                                 GEORGE
                        I told you you should’ve brought my 
                        gun. You can’t go to a ransom drop 
                        without a gun.

                                 PETEY
                        All that talk about trust. A second 
                        ransom?! They said they would let 
                        Bill go!

                                 GEORGE
                        Bad guys lie, Petey. 

                                 PETEY
                        That’s it. I’m going to the police.

                                 GEORGE
                        You can’t do that!

                                 PETEY
                        I should’ve gone to them in the 
                        first place. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah, well, you didn’t. You go to 
                        the police now, and they’re going 
                        to ask a lot of questions. Like, 
                        where did you get the twenty grand 
                        to pay the first ransom.

                                 PETEY
                        FUCK! 

           Petey sinks to the floor.

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t just do nothing.

                                 GEORGE
                        I never said we should do nothing. 
                        An eye for an eye, Petey. An eye 
                        for an eye.
           INT. RAMIREZ’S CAR - LATER.

           Ramirez looks at Sue in her rearview mirror. Sue looks calm 
           and confident. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        He was cheating on you. With Leah. 
                        But you know that. You’re the kind 
                        of woman who could accept an 
                        affair. Until you couldn’t. 

           Ramirez checks in with Sue in the rearview mirror.

                                 RAMIREZ (CONT’D)
                        He bought flowers that night. But 
                        they weren’t for you. It was your 
                        birthday, and he was buying flowers 
                        for another woman.

           Sue tenses and looks away. Ramirez clocks this - she has her.

                                 RAMIREZ (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I would’ve killed him too.

           They pull up to station. There are a ton of reporters and 
           cameras waiting outside.

                                 RAMIREZ (CONT’D)
                        What the hell?

           Sue looks out the window, surprised. Then she smiles. 

           EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS.

           Reporters pounce as Ramirez walks Sue into the station. 

                                 REPORTER 1
                        Detective Ramirez, why did you 
                        arrest Sue Bottoms? 

                                 REPORTER 2
                        Do you think Sue had something to 
                        do with the disappearance of her 
                        husband Bill?

           Sue cries for the cameras.

                                 SUE
                        I don’t know why this is happening! 
                        I’ve done nothing wrong!

           Ramirez pushes past the reporters and leads Sue into--
           INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS.

           Jones rushes up to Ramirez and Sue.

                                 JONES
                        Ramirez!

           Ramirez ignores Jones as she walks briskly past him. She 
           leads Sue to an interrogation room. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           Jones moves to follow Ramirez into the interrogation room. 

                                 JONES
                        Ramirez--

           Ramirez turns and gets in his face.  

                                 RAMIREZ
                        No! No.

           Ramirez closes the door in Jones’ face. Ramirez sits Sue in a 
           chair. She sits across from her and opens a folder of notes. 

                                 SUE
                        Did you see all of those cameras?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Tell me what happened the night of 
                        your birthday.

                                 SUE
                        They were all there for me.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        You say you were at home sleeping 
                        all night.

                                 SUE
                        Yes.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        But I know you called La Femme 
                        Aimée to cancel your dinner 
                        reservation at around 8:00pm. 

                                 SUE
                        Oh yes. I called them before I fell 
                        asleep. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Why’d you cancel your dinner 
                        reservation?
                                 SUE
                        I suppose because we weren’t going 
                        to dinner anymore.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        When we first questioned you, you 
                        said-
                             (reading from her notes)
                        “I fell asleep after work. Bill was 
                        supposed to wake me up when he got 
                        home. He was going to take me to 
                        dinner for my birthday.” 

                                 SUE
                        Yes, that’s right.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        But now you’re saying that you 
                        weren’t going to dinner. Which is 
                        it?

                                 SUE
                        What?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Were you going to dinner or were 
                        you not going to dinner?

                                 SUE
                        You’re trying to confuse me.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        The truth is never confusing. 

                                 SUE
                        My husband is missing! 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        There are no cameras here, Sue.

                                 SUE
                             (standing)
                        I don’t want to talk to you. This 
                        is harassment. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Sit down!

           The interrogation door flies opens and an angry Captain 
           Riggins sticks her head in.

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        Ramirez!
                                 RAMIREZ
                        I’m in the middle of--

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        Now!

           Ramirez stands and follows Captain Riggins out of the 
           interrogation room.

           INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS.

           Ramirez confronts Captain Riggins. Jones quietly watches.  

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Captain--

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        I told you to stand down.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        I have her, Captain. Just give me 
                        twenty minutes. Ten minutes!

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        Every fucking reporter in town is 
                        out on my doorstep right now!

                                 RAMIREZ
                        She killed her husband! And Leah 
                        Norton-- 

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        Who? 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        I saw her arguing with Sue, so I 
                        tracked her through her plates. But 
                        when I went to her place to talk to 
                        her, she was gone. Her car was in 
                        the driveway and her dinner was on 
                        the table and her keys and her 
                        purse - everything was there, but 
                        she was gone! I think she was 
                        having an affair with Bill and I 
                        think Sue did something to her. 

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        Does she have a dog?

                                 RAMIREZ
                        What?
                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        Is it possible that Ms. Norton was 
                        out walking her dog or anywhere 
                        else minding her business, while 
                        you were busy conducting an 
                        unauthorized and illegal search of 
                        her home! 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Captain--

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        You’re off the case.

           Riggins turns and heads back towards the interrogation room. 
           Ramirez calls after her.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        She killed her husband! Captain! 
                        She killed her husband! 

           Ramirez hits the wall, frustrated. She turns and notices 
           Jones watching her, concerned.

                                 RAMIREZ (CONT’D)
                        I’m right about this, Officer 
                        Jones.

                                 JONES
                        I think, that you believe you’re 
                        right.  

           Ramirez walks away. She’ll solve this case without them. 

           INT. TOY WAREHOUSE - BACK OFFICE - LATER.

           Boss and Raj sit at the desk. Kavi leans against the wall.

                                 BOSS
                        Whoever took Bill has my money.

                                 KAVI
                        We can go to the ransom drop. Grab 
                        whoever shows up. 

           Boss considers this.

                                 BOSS
                        Raj, look into this ransom 
                        situation. Bring Kavi with you. 

                                 RAJ
                        Okay. 
           Kavi picks up the closest thing to her - a whiskey bottle - 
           and smashes it onto the floor. She storms out of the office. 
           Raj watches her storm across the warehouse floor.

                                 RAJ (CONT’D)
                        She wants your respect.

           The look Boss gives him lets him know he should not continue. 
           Raj changes the subject and points to Leah, who is still tied 
           to a chair on the warehouse floor.

                                 RAJ (CONT’D)
                        What should we do with the fat one?

                                 BOSS
                        She’s too big to move dead. Take 
                        her out once it’s dark. 

           EXT. TOY WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           Kavi huffs out of the warehouse. She lights a cigarette and 
           starts to smoke. She turns back to the warehouse and holds up 
           both middle fingers at it. 

           A gun presses against the back of her head. Her eyes go wide 
           and the cigarette falls from her mouth.

           A masked man whispers into her ear.

                                 MASKED MAN
                        Scream and you’re dead.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - LATER.

           Flashing cameras. Captain Riggins and Sue speak to the 
           reporters outside the police station.

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        Mrs. Bottoms is not, and has never 
                        been considered a suspect in the 
                        disappearance of her husband, Bill 
                        Bottoms.

                                 REPORTER 1
                        Captain Riggins, why was Sue 
                        brought into your station in 
                        handcuffs?

                                 CAPTAIN RIGGINS
                        This has all been a 
                        misunderstanding.
                                 SUE
                        I’m grateful to Captain Riggins and 
                        the entire police force, who’ve been 
                        working hard to find my husband. 

           In the crowd, Nancy and Lennie watch Sue. 

                                 NANCY
                        She loves this. All of the cameras. 
                        This is what she wants.
                             (an idea)
                        Let’s go.

           INT. JONELLE & PETEY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER.

           Jonelle wakes up. There’s a post-it on the night-stand lamp 
           that reads, “Ur one sexy pregnant beast!” She laughs. Jonelle 
           gets out of the bed and steps on something hard.

                                 JONELLE
                        Motherfuckin shit!

           Jonelle picks up what she stepped on - the diamond ring that 
           fell out of Petey’s pocket. She’s taken aback by its beauty. 
           She puts the ring on her finger and grins.   

                                 JONELLE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God.

           Jonelle’s face falls as she realizes that the very expensive 
           ring on her finger was probably stolen.

                                 JONELLE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God.

           EXT. GEORGE’S ELECTRONICS - SAME TIME.

           A “CLOSED” sign hangs on the window. We push through to--

           INT. GEORGE’S ELECTRONICS - CONTINUOUS.

           We move through the empty aisles until we get to-- 

           INT. GEORGE’S ELECTRONICS. STOCK ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           Kavi is tied to a chair. She looks more annoyed than scared 
           that she’s been kidnapped by... Petey and George, who stand 
           side by side in front of her. 

                                 PETEY
                        We don’t want to hurt you.

                                 GEORGE
                        But we will. With this gun.
                                 KAVI
                        I think I’ll kill you first, Mr. 
                        Rogers.

                                 GEORGE
                        Not if I kill you first, Miss 
                        Pocahontas.

                                 KAVI
                        Wrong Indian, asshole. You’re going 
                        to die tonight.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re going to die tonight!

                                 PETEY
                        Nobody’s dying tonight! 

           Petey fishes Kavi’s phone out of her pocket.

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        We’re just gonna call the Boss and 
                        make an even trade. You for Bill. 
                        Now everyone just, chill out.   

           Petey makes the call on Kavi’s phone. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah, chill out. 

           George strikes his best badass stance and points the gun at 
           Kavi.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Before I take you out. 

                                 KAVI
                             (laughing)
                        You ain’t gonna do shit, old man. 

           George pulls the trigger. The gun goes off and a bullet 
           whizzes past Kavi’s face, taking her ear off. There is a 
           momentary breath of silence as everyone freezes, completely 
           shocked at what just happened. And then--   

                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        Aaaaaaaah! You shot my fucking ear 
                        off!

                                 PETEY
                        HOLY SHIT! 

                                 GEORGE
                        WHOA! The gun works!
           Over the commotion, we hear the Boss’s voice coming faintly 
           from the phone in Petey’s hand. 

                                 BOSS
                             (V.O.)
                        Kavi? Kavi?

                                 PETEY
                        Shit!

           Petey puts his hand over Kavi’s mouth to silence her screams. 
           George grabs the phone from Petey and puts on his best, 
           gravelly kidnapper voice. 

                                 GEORGE
                             (on phone)
                        We have your daughter. Release your 
                        hostage or we will kill her. With 
                        our gun.

           George hangs up. Petey grabs a roll of tape off of a shelf.

                                 KAVI
                        You’re dead! When I get out of 
                        here, I’m going to rip-- 

           Petey tapes Kavi’s mouth shut. It’s quiet. Well, aside from 
           Kavi’s muffled threats, cuz she’s still going. But compared 
           to before, it’s quiet... 

                                 PETEY
                        You shot me with that gun. Twice.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah... Good thing it didn’t go off 
                        before, right?

           Petey’s phone buzzes with a text. George, startled, pulls the 
           trigger, sending a bullet flying across the room. Beat.

                                 PETEY
                        George. Put down the gun.

           George puts down the gun. Petey checks his phone.

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God. OH MY GOD! I have to go!

                                 GEORGE
                        What?

                                 PETEY
                        I have to go!
           Petey runs towards the door, but turns back.

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t shoot her again! Matter of 
                        fact, don’t do anything ‘til I get 
                        back!

           Petey bolts out the door.

           INT. TOY WAREHOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT.

           Raj unties Leah. She looks up at him, oh so hopeful.

                                 LEAH
                        Are you letting me go?

                                 RAJ
                        Yes. I’m going to take you home.

                                 LEAH
                        Thank you.

           Boss storms over and backhands Leah to the floor.

                                 BOSS
                        Who do you work for!

                                 LEAH
                        What?

                                 BOSS
                             (to Raj)
                        Her people have Kavi.

                                 LEAH
                        What? No! I don’t have any people! 

           Boss takes out his gun and points it at Leah’s head.

                                 BOSS
                        Who do you work for!

                                 LEAH
                        Sue! It was Sue! Bill’s wife! She 
                        killed him and she took your money! 
                        I saw it! It was a bag full of 
                        money! Bill said it was a million 
                        dollars. And that’s all I know, I 
                        swear, that’s all I know!

                                 BOSS
                        Sue has my money?
                                 LEAH
                        Yes! I saw it!

                                 BOSS
                        And she has my daughter?

                                 RAJ
                             (realizing)
                        Bill’s idiot brother, Petey. Kavi 
                        told him we had Bill. I should have 
                        stopped her.  

           Boss shoots Leah in the head and then looks at Raj.

                                 BOSS
                        I trust you will bring my foolish 
                        daughter home safely.

                                 RAJ
                        Yes.

                                 BOSS
                        Good. I’m going to get my money. 
                             (gesturing to Leah’s body)
                        Clean this up.

           INT. POLICE CAR - LATER.

           Officer Jones drives Sue home. Sue stares out the window in 
           the backseat. Officer Jones looks at her in the rearview 
           mirror. Beat.   

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        Ramirez - she’s not a bad cop. She 
                        just... We’re all sorry for what 
                        you’re going through. 

                                 SUE
                        How could she think that I could do 
                        such terrible things?

           Officer Jones looks at Sue in the rearview. He doesn’t know 
           how to answer that. He drives. 

           EXT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - SOON AFTER.

           The police car pulls up in front of Sue’s house. Jones gets 
           out and opens the back door for Sue. 

                                 OFFICER JONES
                        We’ll find him.

                                 SUE
                        Thank you.
           Sue smiles as she walks towards her house. 

           EXT. JONELLE & PETEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT.

           Petey screeches up in his car and races up to the front door. 
           He bursts into-- 

           INT. JONELLE & PETEY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           He looks for Jonelle.

                                 PETEY
                        Jonelle! Jonelle!

                                 JONELLE  (O.S.)
                        In here!

           Petey follows her voice to--

           INT. JONELLE & PETEY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS.

           Jonelle is setting the table.

                                 JONELLE
                        Hey.

                                 PETEY
                        I’m here! Are you okay?! Let’s go!

                                 JONELLE
                        I made eggplant parm.

                                 PETEY
                        What?!

                                 JONELLE
                        It’s good, I promise. Sit down.

                                 PETEY
                        What’s going on? I thought the baby 
                        was coming.

                                 JONELLE
                        Nope.

                                 PETEY
                        You said you were in labor!

                                 JONELLE
                        Oh, I lied.

                                 PETEY
                        What?!
                                 JONELLE
                        I lied. Sit down. We should eat 
                        before this gets cold. 

           Jonelle sits and starts eating.

                                 PETEY
                        Jesus Christ, Jo! 

                                 JONELLE
                        Now we’re both liars.

                                 PETEY
                        What are you talking about?

           Jonelle puts the diamond ring on the table in front of her. 
           Petey is surprised to see it.  

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        Where - fucking George. 

                                 JONELLE
                        You said you were done stealing.

                                 PETEY
                        I am.

           Jonelle slides the ring across the table.

                                 JONELLE
                        I don’t want it. And I don’t want 
                        the man who stole it.

                                 PETEY
                        Jo--

                                 JONELLE
                        You lied to me!

                                 PETEY
                        Fuck. Okay, yes, but you don’t 
                        understand. I needed the money to 
                        pay off Raj and Kavi.

                                 JONELLE
                        You said you were done with those 
                        guys.

                                 PETEY
                        I am.

                                 JONELLE
                        Get out.
                                 PETEY
                        Wait!

                                 JONELLE
                        Petey, you can have this - me, our 
                        baby, homemade eggplant parm - or 
                        you can have your stealing and your 
                        secrets and your scary bad guys. 
                        You can’t have both. 

                                 PETEY
                        Jo--

                                 JONELLE
                        You can’t have both!

                                 PETEY
                        They have Bill!

                                 JONELLE
                        What?

                                 PETEY
                        Raj and Kavi. They’re the ones who 
                        kidnapped Bill. I needed the money 
                        to pay his ransom. But then those 
                        fuckers didn’t let him go! So we - 
                        George and me - we kidnapped Kavi. 
                        And we’re holding her hostage. I 
                        mean, we’re not torturing her or 
                        anything! There was an accident, 
                        but it’s a real civil hostage 
                        situation, as far as that goes. 
                        We’ve already sent our demands to 
                        the Boss and now we’re just waiting 
                        to hear back. So we can set up an 
                        even trade - Kavi for Bill.  

                                 JONELLE
                        My dad spent my entire childhood in 
                        jail.

                                 PETEY
                        Did you hear what I just said?

                                 JONELLE
                        I’m not going to do this, Petey.

                                 PETEY
                        They have my brother! And they 
                        wouldn’t if it weren’t for me. 

                                 JONELLE
                        I don’t care. 
                                 PETEY
                        Wow.

                                 JONELLE
                        I care about you. I care about our 
                        baby. I care about our family. I 
                        don’t care about Bill. What do you 
                        care about?

                                 PETEY
                        Are you seriously asking me to 
                        choose between you and my brother?

                                 JONELLE
                        Yes.

           Petey looks at Jonelle. He knows that she means business. 
           Beat. Petey takes out his phone and makes a call, never 
           taking his eye off of Jonelle.

                                 PETEY
                             (on phone)
                        Hey George. Call me back when you 
                        get this. I think it’s time we went 
                        to the police. 

           Petey hangs up his phone. He sits. Jonelle scoops some 
           eggplant parm onto his plate. They eat. Jonelle reaches 
           across the table and takes his hand. 

           INT. GEORGE’S ELECTRONICS - STOCK ROOM - SAME TIME.

           Close on George’s cell phone on the floor. A voice mail 
           notification pops up. We pan across the floor and see George 
           with a bullet in his head.  

           We pull out and find Raj untying Kavi from the chair. When 
           Kavi’s arms are free, she pulls the tape off her mouth. 

                                 KAVI
                        Next time, try saving me before 
                        they shoot my fucking ear off!

           Raj pours gasoline on George and around the stock room.

                                 RAJ
                        Go home.

                                 KAVI
                        We need to take care of Petey.

                                 RAJ
                        Your father wants you home. I’ll 
                        take care of Petey.
                                 KAVI
                        Fuck no! 

                                 RAJ
                        You’ve caused enough trouble for 
                        one day.

                                 KAVI
                        Aw, Old Man Grumpy, are you mad at 
                        me? Because I got kidnapped. Were 
                        you scared that you would never see 
                        me again? 

                                 RAJ
                        GO HOME!

                                 KAVI
                        NO!

           Beat.

                                 RAJ
                        Stay here if you want. You’re not 
                        coming with me.

                                 KAVI
                        Stop being dumb.

           Kavi takes out a cigarette and lights it.

                                 RAJ
                        Put that out.

                                 KAVI
                        Don’t worry, Grumps, I won’t set us 
                        on fire. 

           Kavi walks up to Raj and blows smoke in his face.

                                 KAVI (CONT’D)
                        Unless you want me to.

           Raj takes the cigarette from her and puts it out on his 
           finger. He puts the cigarette in his pocket. 

                                 RAJ
                        Grow up.

                                 KAVI
                        Why?

           The stock room door flies open. Debbie runs at them with a 
           giant butcher knife, screaming like a mad woman. Raj and Kavi 
           duck as Debbie swings her knife wildly at them. 
           Finally, Raj shoots Debbie and she falls down dead. Raj looks 
           at his shoulder - its bleeding. 

                                 RAJ
                        This is why. All this trouble for 
                        twenty grand. 

           Raj turns and sees Kavi lying on the floor, bleeding from the 
           neck. She looks up at him and tries to talk. Raj falls to his 
           knees beside her. He covers her stab wound with his hands, 
           trying to stop the bleeding. Kavi gives him a devilish little 
           smile as the life drains from her eyes.  

           Raj bolts up and empties his clip into Debbie’s lifeless 
           body. He looks over at Kavi and, for a moment, his tough 
           exterior falls. We see a broken man who has lost everything.   

           George’s cell rings on the floor. Raj looks over at it. It’s 
           Petey. And as quickly as it fell, his tough exterior is back 
           up. Raj sets the room on fire. He picks up Kavi and with a 
           calm intensity, carries her out. He has people to kill. 

           INT. LEAH’S HOUSE - LATER.

           Leah’s front door opens and Ramirez enters, gun raised.  

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Police!

           Ramirez checks to make sure the house is clear. Once she’s 
           sure that she’s alone, Ramirez moves through the house 
           looking for something, ANYTHING, that might help the case.

           In the kitchen, she sees Leah’s cold dinner and purse, still 
           where she last saw them. In the bedroom, she finds a huge 
           array of sex toys. She opens closets and drawers. She looks 
           through papers.

           Ramirez comes across an old credit card statement. She scans 
           it and sees QUALITY TIMES MOTEL listed on it a few times. 
           Ramirez quickly opens another old credit card statement. She 
           scans it and sees QUALITY TIMES MOTEL listed a few times. 
           Ramirez quickly opens another old credit card statement. Sure 
           enough - QUALITY TIMES MOTEL. That’s it!   

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT.

           Sue eats birthday cake while happily singing the chorus of 
           Missing You (I Ain’t Missing You At All) by John Waite. 

                                 SUE
                        I ain’t missing you at all (missing 
                        you) / Since you’ve been gone away 
                        / I ain’t missing you at all.
           The doorbell rings.

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER.

           Sue opens the door. Boss is standing there. 

                                 BOSS
                        Hi Sue.

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER.

           Sue sits on her couch, trying to remain calm. Boss sits in a 
           chair across from her, a gun resting on his leg.

                                 BOSS
                        You have caused me lots of 
                        problems, Sue.

                                 SUE
                        Who are you?

                                 BOSS
                        Where’s my money?

                                 SUE
                        What? 

                                 BOSS
                        You mistake me for a patient man. I 
                        will ask once more and you will not 
                        make the same mistake. Where is my 
                        money?

                                 SUE
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about. You have the wrong person.

                                 BOSS
                        Bill took something from me.

                                 SUE
                        Bill’s missing.

                                 BOSS
                        Bill’s dead. We both know this. 
                        Now, the night he died, he had with 
                        him one million dollars that 
                        belonged to me. Where is it?

                                 SUE
                        Bill’s dead? 

           Boss takes a small case of bullets out of his breast pocket. 
           He starts to load his gun.
                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        Why are you doing this? I don’t 
                        know anything! Bill was taken. 
                        Someone kidnapped him. Maybe the 
                        people who took him took your 
                        money. Maybe-- 

           Boss stands and points the gun at Sue’s head.

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

           There’s a crash in the kitchen. Boss grabs Sue’s arm and 
           drags her to--

           INT. BOTTOMS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS.

           Boss and Sue enter the kitchen and find Nancy and Lennie 
           (with the camera) standing there, like deer in headlights. 
           Beat. Lennie turns and bolts for the back door. Boss shoots 
           him in the back and he crashes to the floor. Nancy screams. 
           Boss turns his gun on her and she backs away, terrified.  

                                 NANCY
                        Please.

           Nancy turns to Sue for help.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Sue!

           Boss shoots Nancy in the head. She falls down, dead.  

           Sue crumples to the ground. Time slows down. All Sue can see 
           is her sister’s bloody head. All Sue can hear is the ringing 
           in her ears. And then the Boss is in her face.  

                                 BOSS
                        Let’s go get Bill. 

           INT. JONELLE & PETEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME.

           Jonelle sits on the couch, watching TV. Petey paces, in the 
           middle of leaving a message on his phone.

                                 PETEY
                        This isn’t funny, George. Call me 
                        back. 

           Petey hangs up. 

                                 JONELLE
                        You should go.
                                 PETEY
                        It’s just, something isn’t right.

                                 JONELLE
                        I know.

                                 PETEY
                        I’m sorry.  

                                 JONELLE
                        Maybe we don’t get to be normal.

                                 PETEY
                        I’ll be right back.

                                 JONELLE
                        Okay.

                                 PETEY
                        I’ll be right back.

                                 JONELLE
                        Okay. 

           EXT. QUALITY TIMES MOTEL - NIGHT.

           Ramirez pulls up outside the motel and parks. She gets out 
           and disappears into the motel. 

           Seconds later, Sue’s car pulls up outside of the motel. Boss 
           gets out of the driver side. He opens the passenger door and 
           pulls Sue out.

                                 BOSS
                        Where?

           Sue points to the woods behind the motel. Boss puts his gun 
           in Sue’s back.

                                 BOSS (CONT’D)
                        Go.

           Sue starts to walk towards the woods, doing her affirmations 
           to keep from spiraling.

                                 SUE
                        You are strong. You are important. 
                        You are enough.

                                 BOSS
                        Shut-up.

           The two disappear into the woods.
           INT. QUALITY TIMES MOTEL - SAME TIME.

           A soap opera plays on the TV behind the empty desk. Ramirez 
           peaks her head behind the desk, looking for the clerk.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Hello!

           Sweet Elderly Motel Clerk (from earlier) shuffles in from the 
           back room. 

                                 SWEET ELDERLY MOTEL CLERK
                        Oh, hello dear. Would you like a 
                        room? 

           Ramirez flashes her badge and gets down to business. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Detective Ramirez. Do you recognize 
                        any of these people?

           Ramirez shows Sweet Elderly Motel Clerk pictures of Bill, 
           Leah and Sue. 

                                 SWEET ELDERLY MOTEL CLERK
                        Oh my.

           Sweet Elderly Motel Clerk puts on her eyeglasses and studies 
           the pictures. 

                                 SWEET ELDERLY MOTEL CLERK (CONT’D)
                        I’m not very good with faces. Not 
                        like my Charlie was. He could 
                        remember a face from--

                                 RAMIREZ
                        They would have been here three 
                        nights ago. 

                                 SWEET ELDERLY MOTEL CLERK
                        Oh, okay, let’s see... 

           Sweet Elderly Motel Clerk squints hard at the pictures.

                                 SWEET ELDERLY MOTEL CLERK (CONT’D)
                        If you say they were here, then I 
                        suppose I must have seen them.

           Ramirez sighs frustrated - another dead end. She turns to go 
           and notices a camera in the corner of the lobby ceiling. 

                                 RAMIREZ
                        I need to see your security 
                        footage!
           INT. PETEY’S CAR - NIGHT.

           Petey rushes to George’s Electronics. When he turns the 
           corner he sees--

           EXT. GEORGE’S ELECTRONICS - CONTINUOUS.

           Flashing lights - policemen, fire fighters, ambulances. The 
           fire has been put out, but the store is charred black. 

           EMT’s wheel two bodies covered in white sheets out of the 
           store and load them up into an ambulance.

           INT. PETEY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS.

           Petey pulls over, looking at the scene in horror. He grips 
           the steering wheel, trying hard not to throw up. 

                                 PETEY
                        Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. 

           Petey’s eyes widen as he’s hit with a terrible realization. 
           He frantically searches for his phone and makes a call. 

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        Please pick up. Pick up!

           INT. JONELLE & PETEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME. 

           Jonelle sits watching the news. Her phone vibrates from under 
           a pillow. She doesn’t notice. 

           INT. PETEY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS.

           Petey throws his phone down.

                                 PETEY
                        FUCK!

           Petey zooms away.

           EXT. JONELLE & PETEY’S HOUSE - LATER.

           Raj emerges from the shadows, his clothes stained with Kavi’s 
           blood. He walks right up to the front door and shoots the 
           door handle until it comes off. He enters the house. 

           INT. JONELLE & PETEY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS.

           Raj moves through the house, eerily calm, his gun down by his 
           side. Raj walks into--
           INT. JONELLE & PETEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

           The couch where Jonelle was sitting moments ago is now empty. 
           The TV is still blaring. A news segment on Bill is playing. 
           Raj watches it for a moment. Then he raises his gun and 
           shoots the TV. The room falls silent.

                                 RAJ
                        Bill’s dead.

           Raj turns and continues his search. 

           INT. JONELLE & PETEY’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS.

           Raj walks down the hall towards the kitchen.

           INT. JONELLE & PETEY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS.

           Raj turns into the kitchen. Suddenly, Jonelle jumps out from 
           behind a corner and throws hot oil in his face. Raj brings 
           his hands to his face, screaming in pain. Jonelle swings the 
           frying pan with all of her might and connects with the side 
           of Raj’s head. 

           Raj, blind from the oil and dizzy from the head whack, raises 
           his gun and shoots blindly in Jonelle’s direction. He misses, 
           but not by much. 

                                 JONELLE
                        I’m pregnant, you asshole!

           Jonelle charges at him and hits the gun out of his hand with 
           the frying pan. Raj stands in the middle of the kitchen, 
           bloody, blind and mad as hell. He lunges in the direction of 
           Jonelle’s voice. She hits him again with the frying pan, 
           hard. He goes down. Jonelle continues to beat him with the 
           frying pan. Blood flies up at her as she smashes his face in, 
           but she can’t stop herself. 

                                 JONELLE (CONT’D)
                        Why can’t you people just leave us 
                        alone! Petey doesn’t work for you 
                        anymore! We’re going to have a 
                        baby! And we’re going to get 
                        married! And we’re going to be 
                        happy! 

           By this point, Raj is super bloody and super dead. Jonelle 
           steps back and takes in what she’s done. 

                                 PETEY (O.S.)
                        Jonelle?

           Jonelle turns and sees Petey standing in the doorway. Beat.
                                 JONELLE
                        Bill’s dead. 

                                 PETEY
                        I know. 

           Petey crosses to Jonelle.

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to get out of town. 
                        We’re going to have a baby. We’re 
                        going to get married.

           Petey eases the frying pan out of her shaking hand.

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to be happy. 

           Jonelle nods her head. Yes. 

           INT. QUALITY TIMES MOTEL - LATER.

           Ramirez watches SECURITY FOOTAGE behind the clerk desk. It’s 
           not great quality, but we can see clear as day: Bill entering 
           the motel the night he disappeared and moments later, SUE 
           FOLLOWING HIM IN. 

           Ramirez pauses the video on Sue. She smiles - she was right!

           EXT. WOODS - SAME TIME.

           Sue stands in a hole as she digs. Boss stands above her 
           pointing his gun at her.

                                 SUE
                        I didn’t kill Bill.

                                 BOSS
                        I don’t care.

                                 SUE
                        You’ll let me go?

                                 BOSS
                        I won’t.

           Sue sees a peek of Bill through the dirt. She kicks dirt over 
           it to cover it before the Boss can see.

                                 BOSS (CONT’D)
                        Keep digging.

           Sue starts to climb out of the hole.
                                 SUE
                        I don’t think this is the right 
                        hole. I didn’t bury him that deep, 
                        we should’ve come across his body 
                        by now.  

           Sue makes it out of the hole. As she stands, she swings the 
           shovel at the Boss, surprising him with a whack to the side. 
           Sue takes off running into the night.

           EXT. QUALITY TIMES MOTEL - NIGHT.

           Ramirez exits the motel holding the security tape. She heads 
           to her car, but stops abruptly when she sees Sue’s car parked 
           outside the motel. She looks around. 

           The sound of a gunshot rattles from the woods. Ramirez 
           quickly takes out her weapon. 

           Another gunshot rings out from the woods. Ramirez runs 
           towards the woods, her gun raised, determined to finish this 
           case once and for all. 

           EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS.

           Boss pushes Sue back towards the hole she was digging. Sue 
           falls to the ground.

                                 BOSS
                        Next time it won’t be a warning 
                        shot.

           Boss kicks Sue back into the hole and throws the shovel in 
           after her. Sue gets up and resumes digging. Boss stands above 
           her, pointing his gun at her. 

                                 SUE
                        You could be famous. As the man who 
                        found Bill. We could be on the news 
                        together.

                                 BOSS
                        We will not be on the news 
                        together, because you will be dead.

           Bill’s naked body peeks out through the dirt. Boss spots the 
           gym bag in the hole.

                                 BOSS (CONT’D)
                        The bag.

           Sue hands up the bag and climbs out of the hole. Boss unzips 
           the bag and smiles down at the million. Sue’s eyes widen at 
           the sight of the money. 
                                 SUE
                        I didn’t know.

           Boss stands.

                                 BOSS
                        Get back in the hole.

                                 SUE
                        I can help you! I can tell your 
                        story!

                                 BOSS
                        No thanks.

           Boss points his gun at Sue.

                                 RAMIREZ (O.S.)
                        Drop your weapon!

           Boss turns around and sees Ramirez pointing a gun at him.

                                 RAMIREZ (CONT’D)
                        Police! Drop your--

           Boss turns his gun towards Ramirez. She shoots him and he 
           falls down into Bill’s shallow grave. Sue looks down into the 
           hole and then quickly backs away.

                                 SUE
                        You killed him! He’s dead!

           Ramirez hurries after Sue, who is still backing away holding 
           the shovel.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Don’t move! Drop the shovel!

                                 SUE
                        You saved me, Detective Ramirez.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Drop the shovel!

           Sue backs up.

                                 RAMIREZ (CONT’D)
                        I will shoot you!

                                 SUE
                        I’m going to tell them you saved 
                        me. At the next press conference. 
                        I’m going to tell them that you’re 
                        a hero. 
           Ramirez smiles and holds up the security footage.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        No more press conferences, Sue. 
                        You’re done. I got you. Now, drop--

           BAM! A bullet rips through Ramirez’s shoulder, spinning her 
           around. She sees a bloodied Boss standing behind her, 
           pointing his gun at her. She raises her gun. Both fire! Boss 
           goes down with a bullet to the head. Ramirez goes down with a 
           bullet to the gut.

           Sue carefully kicks Ramirez’s gun away from her. Ramirez 
           covers her gut with her hands, trying fruitlessly to stop the 
           bleeding. Sue kneels beside Ramirez, as she bleeds out.

                                 SUE
                        I couldn’t save you. A dead cop is 
                        more news worthy than a live one. 
                        But you get to be a part of 
                        something big! A missing husband, 
                        bad guys with guns, a dead cop, a 
                        bag full of money! It’ll be 
                        national news. Everyone’s going to 
                        know my story.

                                 RAMIREZ
                        Fuck your story, Sue. 

           Ramirez turns her head away from Sue, pissed that she’s dying 
           because of this crazy psycho. Ramirez dies.

           Sue stands and takes in the dead bodies around her. Bill. 
           Boss. Ramirez. Sue’s hand catches her eye. She raises it and 
           sees that it’s covered in Ramirez’s blood. Sue brings her 
           hand to her face and leaves a trail of blood down her cheek.

                        Weekend of horror--

           The voices of the news anchors continue as we see B-ROLL of 
           caution tape blocking off the woods, police cars, flashing 
           lights, body bags, and a bloody, dirty and distressed Sue 
           being helped out of the woods by officers. 

           The CHYRON on-screen reads: “BREAKING NEWS: Sue Bottoms, 
           kidnapped at gunpoint by husband’s killer.”  

           Written beneath that chyron, in smaller print we see: “Coming 
           up: Thirteen year old Tammi Rose found dead. No suspects.”

           The camera finds Sue in the madness of the crime scene. From 
           afar, she looks fragile and broken. But as the camera pushes 
           in on her face, we see... the slightest twinkle in her eye.
