           BLACK.

           Wind howling. 

           A methodical creaking sound - a rusted metal heart beat.  

           Creak. Creak. Creak. 

           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - DAY

           CLOSE ON a pair of blue eyes opening. 

           Creak. Creak. Creak.

           SEAN HARRISON - white, mid-30s, jeans and t-shirt - stirs 
           awake in his messy bed. He turns and is sad to see no one 
           next to him - just the indent of a body in the sheets.

                                 SEAN
                        Kim?

           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - HALLWAY/FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           Sean walks through the hall of his middle class suburban 
           home. At the other end, in the foyer and sitting against the 
           front door is...

           KIMBERLY HARRISON - mid-30s, African-American - her head in 
           her hands. Her SUITCASE PACKED at her side.

                                 SEAN
                        Kim?

           He arrives in front of her. She looks up, eyes wet with 
           tears. She stands and wraps her arms around him in a hug, 
           then breaks and looks into his eyes - devastated.  

           She places something in his hand, closing his fingers around 
           it. 

           Creak. Creak. Creak. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                         We fucked it up. 

           Sean looks down - opens his fist to reveal Kim’s WEDDING RING 
           in his palm. 

           Kim turns to the door and takes the knob in her hand. Slowly 
           she turns it. 

           The door cracks open and a bright, blinding light powers in. 
           Kim swings the door the rest of the way and the light engulfs 
           them both. 
           Creak. Creak. Creak. 

           Sean’s eyes grow wide with fear. He pursues her into the 
           light...

           EXT. WASTELAND - DAY

           Sean only makes it a few feet out his front door when he 
           freezes in terror. The usually green and friendly suburban 
           neighborhood replaced by a DESERT WASTELAND - miles of 
           nothing but dry, cracked earth. 

           Kim nowhere to be found. 

                                 SEAN
                        Kim?

           Creak. Creak. Creak. 

           We pull back to reveal a STREET SIGN - HUSHED WILLOW RD. Bent 
           and rusted. Swaying in the wind.

           SLAM!

           Sean spins to see the door of his house slammed shut. A brass 
           door knocker is inscribed with the sur name, HARRISON. 

           In the knocker’s silver, reflective glow, Sean notices TWO 
           SHADOWS creeping up behind him. Just as he turns to face 
           them...

           DING DONG. 

           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Sean’s eyes crack open. He slowly lifts his head off the back 
           of his faded recliner and looks around the dim, half-finished 
           basement. His heart racing. 

           DING DONG

           His wife’s voice from upstairs. 

                                 KIMBERLY (O.S.)
                        Sean...they’re here. 

           Footsteps stomp above. He looks down at the half-drank beer 
           in his hand - lifts it to his lips and finishes it. 

           He wipes sweat from his forehead - affected by the dream. 

                                 SEAN
                        Shit. 
           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Kim stops at the front door, fixes a few strands of her hair 
           in the hall mirror, and then opens it to reveal...

           JAHAN RAZI - Middle-Eastern American, mid-30s, skinny with 
           round eyes. a beige hijab covers her head but not her face. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Hi. You must be our guest. 

           Jahan says nothing. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I’m sorry. Do you speak 
                        English? 
                             (slowly)
                        Are you here for AirBnB?

                                 AMIR (O.C.)
                        Yes. 

           Kim looks past Jahan, down the driveway to see...

           AMIR RAZI - Middle-Eastern American, mid-30s, handsome. He 
           wears a simple T-shirt and a five-o’clock shadow. 

           At his feet are several bags, and a large BLACK TRUNK. He 
           abandons them and goes to the porch with Jahan. 

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, my sister’s deaf. Hi.
                             (holds out his hand)
                        Amir Razi. This is Jahan. 

           Kim shakes both their hands. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Nice to meet you. 
                             (looks at the luggage)
                        Let me get my husband to help you. 
                             (she turns - yells)
                        SEA-

           Sean appears, getting blasted by her voice. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, sorry. 

                                 SEAN
                             (joking)
                        That’s OK. I hate hearing out of 
                        those things anyway. 

           Kim turns red. Sean smiles at the guests - arm out.
                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Sean Harrison. 

           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Sean and Amir carry the black trunk by the side handles - it 
           looks very heavy. 

                                 SEAN
                        OK. Down for a second. 

           They lower it to the floor. Sean sucks in some air. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s a beast. 

                                 AMIR
                        Everything we own. 

                                 SEAN
                        Listen, sorry about the deaf joke 
                        in there. I had no idea-

                                 AMIR
                        Seriously. Not a big deal. Jahan 
                        has a good sense of humor about it. 

           Kim and Jahan turn the corner with the rest of the bags. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Break time already, boys?

                                 SEAN
                        Wanna switch?

           They notice Jahan has gravitated toward the stove - on it a 
           pot of something simmering on low. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, that’s my dad’s famous chili. 

                                 AMIR
                        It smells great. 

           Kim and Sean catch Amir also gazing at the pot. Sean looks at 
           his wife. She nods. 

                                 SEAN
                        You...two hungry? We have plenty. 

           Amir and Jahan look back at him with appreciative eyes. 
           EXT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - FRONT - NIGHT

           A modest yellow two-story house sits peacefully under the 
           overcast night sky - lights glowing in the windows. SEATTLE'S 
           FAMOUS SPACE NEEDLE majestic and tall in the distance. 

           A metal, gleaming street sign stands firm on the corner of 
           the lawn: HUSHED WILLOW RD. 

           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Amir and Jahan sit at the table, scraping their bowls of 
           chili for the last of the deliciousness. 

           Sean and Kim are only half-finished with theirs. 

           Amir plops his spoon into the bowl and sits back. 

                                 SEAN
                        You guys were hungry. 

                                 AMIR
                        Long trip. Feel like we haven’t 
                        eaten in decades. What was it 
                        called again?

           Sean looks up, a bit stunned.

                                 SEAN
                        Chili...are you serious?

                                 AMIR
                        I’ve never had it. 

                                 SEAN
                        But I mean...it’s chili. Who hasn’t 
                        had or heard of chili?

           Jahan’s hands jump into action as she speaks in SIGN 
           LANGUAGE. 

                                 AMIR
                             (translating)
                        We were brought up on a pretty 
                        simple diet. Greens, potatoes. When 
                        we were lucky there was meat. So 
                        chili is a treat for us.

                                 SEAN
                             (light)
                        Happy you liked it, but don’t get 
                        any ideas - we ain’t feeding you 
                        the rest of the week!

           Jahan smiles and nods. Kimberly lifts a small kettle. 
                                 KIMBERLY
                        More tea?

           Amir waves it off. 

                                 SEAN
                        Aren’t you going to miss San Diego? 
                        Hope you weren’t too attached to 
                        the sun. 

                                 AMIR
                        I know that won’t bother my sister. 
                        She’s a physicist, which means 
                        she’s basically a shut-in. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (impressed)
                        A physicist.

                                 SEAN
                        That’s pretty much my favorite kind 
                        of scientist. 

           Jahan smiles. Signs, “Thank you”.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Started looking for a place yet?

                                 AMIR
                        We have family here. A cousin who 
                        we’re staying with.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Oh, then...why are you doing 
                        AirBnB?

                                 AMIR
                        His house is currently tented. 

                                 SEAN
                        Bugs?

                                 AMIR
                        Apparently.

                                 SEAN
                        Well, we’re happy to have you. 
                        Shall we get you settled in?

           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           We watch through the window of the detached garage as Sean 
           and Amir exit the back kitchen door, and out in the backyard 
           lugging the trunk. Kim and Jahan follow behind with the bags. 

           The side door opens and we push back as Sean and Amir enter. 
                                 SEAN
                        Let’s drop it near the bed. 

           They take a few more steps and gently place the trunk at the 
           edge of the Queen size bed. The women drop their bags. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Your luxury garage. 

           The two-stall garage has been converted into a cute little 
           room: stained, wooden floors, a small bathroom across from 
           the bed, a kitchenette with counter, a thin wardrobe closet, 
           two chairs, and a wall clock. Nothing fancy, but quaint. 

                                 AMIR
                        Hey, this is way nicer than some 
                        places we’ve stayed. 

                                 SEAN
                        Oh, and those new curtain rods 
                        should be here tomorrow. Give you 
                        more privacy. 

           Kim digs in her pocket, hands Amir a KEY.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Key to the back gate.

                                 SEAN
                        The wifi-code on the mini-fridge.

           MEOW.

           All turn to discover a dirty, orange CAT sitting in the 
           doorway of the garage. It “meows” once more. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        And that is Skillet. 

           Jahan’s eyes light up as she bends down to pet the cat. The 
           animal HISSES and Jahan quickly pulls her hand back. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                             (shooing the cat)
                        Git!

           The cat turns and sprints off into the night. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. Skillet’s a neighborhood 
                        stray we leave food out for. He’s 
                        usually not such an asshole. 

           Jahan seems visibly sad from the encounter. Sean claps his 
           hands together. 
                                 SEAN
                        And that, uh...thats the tour.  

                                 AMIR
                        Thanks again. For the dinner and 
                        the company. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Absolutely. It was fun. 

           Jahan signs.  

                                 AMIR
                             (translating)
                        My sister thinks it’s a great step 
                        forward for humanity, when we let 
                        strangers sleep amongst us.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I hadn’t ever thought about it like 
                        that. Far more poetic than “this 
                        mortgage won’t pay itself.” 

           An awkward silence. 

                                 SEAN
                        Well, welcome to Seattle and have a 
                        good night. 

           EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Sean and Kim exit the garage, the door closing behind them to 
           reveal a cute, WELCOME GUESTS sign on hunter green painted 
           structure. 

           As they get closer to the house, Kim’s smile fades. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (quietly)
                        You told me the curtains were up. 

           Sean’s smile fades. 

                                 SEAN
                             (quietly)
                        Did I?

           She shakes her head, frustrated, and goes back inside. 

           Sean lingers, takes a deep breath, and follows her. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Sean locks up - catches Kim staring at the mess from dinner.  
                                 KIMBERLY
                        They seem nice. Great to have 
                        guests again. I was beginning to 
                        worry. 

           She grabs some dishes and plops them in the sink. Sean grabs 
           the glasses and kettle. 

                                 SEAN
                        And for eight days. Praise Allah. 

           Sean laughs. Kim gives him a “really, Sean” look. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        How’s that estimate coming?

           The mood shifts. He turns away from her, emptying the kettle 
           in the sink. 

                                 SEAN
                        Marty’s coming over tomorrow. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        You think it’s worth it?

                                 SEAN
                        For the right price. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        It’s just gonna delay things. 

                                 SEAN
                             (turning back; careful)
                        You thought any more about another 
                        session?

           Kim goes quiet, then... 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I don’t think it’ll solve anything.

           She finishes her wine. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        All right. Good night. 

           She pushes off the counter and walks past her husband - 
           offering him no kiss.

           Sean watches her head down the hall, turn into the master 
           bedroom, and close the door. With a sigh he pours more wine.
           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

           Kim sits up in bed staring down at the DIARY in her lap. Her 
           pen hovers above her last sentence: I was surrounded by good 
           people tonight, yet all I wanted was to be alone. The sooner 
           this is over the better things will be. 

           She sighs, closes the diary. She runs her finger over the 
           BUTTERFLY EMBLEM on the front cover, then places it in the 
           drawer of her night stand. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Sean flops down on the couch and untangles a wadded up 
           blanket - suggesting this is not his first night. When 
           comfortable, he flips on the TV - surfs. 

           He looks up at the ceiling, lonely and stuck...

           Suddenly, SOMETHING out in the yard - beyond the sliding 
           glass door of the living room - catches his eye. A SHADOW. 

           Sean squints. Whoever it is they remain motionless in the 
           middle of the yard - STARING AT HIM. Unnerving him until - 

           The FLAME of a lighter illuminates her face - a cigarette 
           dangling from Jahan’s lips. She lights it, takes a deep drag. 

           Sean relaxes. She’s just out for a smoke. What was he even 
           scared of in the first place?

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

           Sean turns the light on in the dirty and dark basement.

           MARTY KLINGER (40, bearded and rail thin) scans the ceiling - 
           a line of discoloration running across it. 

                                 MARTY
                        Honestly? 6 or 7K easy.

                                 SEAN
                        Jesus.

                                 MARTY
                        Ain’t a terrible friend price. 
                        Plus, this puppy won’t sell with 
                        that much water damage.  

                                 SEAN
                        I know, but still. Jesus. 

           Sean goes over to the basement fridge and pulls out two 
           beers. He offers one to Marty.
                                 MARTY
                        Too early.

                                 SEAN
                             (shocked)
                        Really?

                                 MARTY
                        No. Of course not.

           He takes the beer and the two sit down on a ratty couch next 
           to an old TV. - Sean’s never completed man cave.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Haven’t got drunk down here in a 
                        long ass time. Shit, haven’t seen 
                        you in...Chirst, I don’t know. 

                                 SEAN
                        Just been busy, man. Honestly. And 
                        then this Kim disaster. 

           Sean goes over to a DART BOARD on the wall and grabs all six 
           darts - hands three to Marty. 

                                 MARTY
                        Keepin’ me at arms-length ain’t 
                        gonna make her fall for you again, 
                        buddy. 

                                 SEAN
                        What’s that mean? 

                                 MARTY
                        Please. I know what she thinks of 
                        me. Not good enough to hang out, 
                        but good enough to fix your shitty 
                        house for a divorce. 

           Sean misses the dart board completely. 

                                 SEAN
                        That’s not how it is at all. 

           Marty stares at him in disbelief. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s not!

                                 MARTY
                        She’s leaving you, Sean. You don’t 
                        have to defend her anymore. 

                                 SEAN
                        It’s a mutual decision. 
                                 MARTY
                        Shit. Mutual as my doctor’s 
                        decision to stick his finger up my 
                        asshole. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Money’s tight. Tensions just...got 
                        too tense.  

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Can’t you find a job?

                                 SEAN
                        I’ve been working on making my 
                        portfolio “cooler” and “hipper”. 
                        Trying to attract the big dogs, but 
                        I’m getting pulverized by kids with 
                        half the skills asking for less. 

           Marty throws a bullseye, pulverizing Sean.

                                 MARTY
                        No. It’s not you. And it’s not the 
                        kids. It’s... fuckin...

           Marty mumbles to himself. Sean resets the dart game. 

                                 SEAN
                        What?

                                 MARTY
                        Same reason my Dad’s restaurant 
                        went under last year. Too many 
                        taxes. Too many families on welfare 
                        we all have to pay for cuz they all 
                        want free shit. 

                                 SEAN
                        Who’s the “they” in this fantasy 
                        world of yours?

                                 MARTY
                        You’re just baiting me to sound 
                        racist. 

                                 SEAN
                        Quacks like a duck...

                                 MARTY
                        I ain’t racist. I’m angry. And 
                        there’s plenty of good ones. Like 
                        Kim. 

           Sean shakes his head - hopeless. 
                                 SEAN
                        How’d you turn my failed marriage 
                        political?

                                 MARTY
                        I got skills. 

           Sean misses the dart board AGAIN.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Unlike you at darts. 

                                 SEAN
                        Well, it’s Kim’s board, so I guess 
                        I won’t get to practice. 

                                 MARTY
                        That was a sad little statement you 
                        just made. 
                             (beat)
                        You don’t think you two will work 
                        things out?

                                 SEAN
                             (changing the subject)
                        What I think is I want you to quote 
                        me a better price on that ceiling. 

                                 MARTY
                        I promise you, man, that’s murder 
                        cheap. 

           Marty sinks a bullseye. Sean scratches his head. 

                                 SEAN
                        I’ll talk to Kim. 

           He throws his last dart - hits a sad little ONE. 

           EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

           Sean walks Marty to his truck. 

                                 MARTY
                        Hey, you wanna get day drunk right 
                        now? I got squat rest of the day. 

                                 SEAN
                        Not sure it looks great, me 
                        partying while I should be looking 
                        for work. 

                                 MARTY
                             (not convinced)
                        OK, partner. 
           Marty catches sight of Amir and Jahan walking up the 
           sidewalk. He nudges Sean.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                             (quietly)
                        Oh, there goes the neighborhood. 

           Sean’s face sinks. Marty socks him in the shoulder, laughing. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        I knew you’d hate that. Goddamn 
                        snowflake. 

           BARK! BARK! A big PIT BULL in the neighbor’s yard peaks its 
           wet snout through the gate, barking at Amir and Jahan as they 
           pass by.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                             (sly wink)
                        Dogs know all. 

                                 SEAN
                        That dog is an equal bark-atunist. 

           Marty leans back with a grin. 

           Amir spots Sean and waves as he’s unlocking the backyard 
           gate. Sean waves back. Now Marty’s face sinks. 

                                 MARTY
                        An unexpected turn. 

                                 SEAN
                        Our new guests.

                                 MARTY
                        AirBnB. Good places for Middle-
                        Easterners to lay low. 
                        Smack dab in the middle of 
                        Liberalville. 

                                 SEAN
                        They’re from San Diego. 

                                 MARTY
                        Even worse. Sleeper cells bro.

                                 SEAN
                             (making light)
                        You’re lucky we’ve been friends 
                        since puberty. 

           Marty unhooks his tool belt and tosses it in the truck. 
                                 MARTY
                             (thinking)
                        You know, the Vice President is 
                        coming to town to endorse Mayor 
                        King for his Senate run. 

                                 SEAN
                        Of course he is. They both believe 
                        in gay conversion therapy.

                                 MARTY
                        I like Mayor King. Says what he 
                        thinks, which makes him a damn good 
                        target. 

                                 SEAN
                        I can never tell if you’re for real 
                        or just joking anymore. 

                                 MARTY
                        I’m little bit country and a little 
                        bit rock & roll, brother. 

           He pats Sean on the back. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Lemme know about that ceiling.

           Marty hops in his truck and drives off. 

           Sean shakes his head. What an asshole. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Sean sits on the couch with his laptop, searching for jobs on 
           Craigslist. The news is on the TV in the background.

                                 NEWS REPORTER
                        The three day visit will kick 
                        things off with a private lunch 
                        between Mayor King and the Vice 
                        President atop Seattle’s iconic 
                        Space Needle, where they will 
                        discuss the Mayor’s run for the 
                        Senate.

           Sean emails his resume to a shitty company looking for a 
           graphic designer, then sits back with a heavy sigh of defeat. 

           KNOCK. KNOCK.

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Sean opens the door to a UPS man with TWO CYLINDRICAL TUBED 
           PACKAGES. He takes them. 
                                 SEAN
                        Gracias. 

           He looks at the UPS man, noticing for the first time he is 
           Mexican, and suddenly feels weird about his choice of word. 

                                 UPS
                             (unaffected)
                        You’re welcome. 

           The UPS man hops off the porch - the neighbors pit bull 
           launches into a barrage of barks until he gets back in his 
           truck. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Sean plops the tubes on the table, and opens the first one. 
           He slides out the CURTAIN RODS he ordered. 

           He then opens the second one, BUT NOTHING SLIDES OUT. 

           He takes a peek inside the tube - a ROLLED UP piece of paper, 
           like a poster. He grips it with his fingers and pulls it out.

           He unfolds it on the table to reveal what looks to be a 
           BLUEPRINT for a multi-level structure - the text written in 
           FARSI. 

           Sean checks the address and name on the package. Right 
           address but... wrong name. It’s for AMIR RAZI. 

           EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - GARAGE - LATER

           Sean carries the package to the garage. 

           Without curtains on the window he can see Amir and Jahan on 
           their knees in full Muslim prayer gear - facing east.

           Sean freezes, the visual causing a moment of wonder. Then, he 
           creeps up, not wanting to disturb them - places the package 
           at the door. 

           When he stands, he is startled to find Jahan STARING AT HIM 
           from her kneeling position. 

           He awkwardly nods and heads back to the house. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sean eats dinner alone in the living room, watching TV. But 
           he’s not really watching. Something’s on his mind.
           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Meanwhile, Kim sits at the kitchen table by herself, picking 
           at a plate of pasta, and generously sipping wine. She’s 
           immersed in a tattered old novel - a dime-store thriller.  

           Suddenly, Sean enters with his dinner plate, walks past the 
           table, and over to the window that looks out at the garage. 

           Kim watches him. After a moment, he turns back and sits down 
           opposite of her, setting his plate in front of him. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Everything all right?

                                 SEAN
                        Mm-hm. 

           She nods then returns to her book. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        I saw them praying. On prayer mats. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        That’s what Muslim’s do. 

                                 SEAN
                        I know, of course, I know. It just 
                        caught me off guard because they 
                        don’t really seem...religious I 
                        guess. 

           Kim looks up weakly from her book. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        She wears a hijab, Sean. 

           He nods. She goes back to her book. He taps the table, 
           something still bothering him. 

                                 SEAN
                        I got a weird package today. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (not really interested)
                        Oh yeah?

                                 SEAN
                        It actually wasn’t for me. It was 
                        for our guests, but I opened it by 
                        accident because I thought it was 
                        curtain rods. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (looking up)
                        Did you hang those rods?
                                 SEAN
                        It’s not about the rods.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Then what? What are you trying to 
                        dramatically tell me, Sean?

                                 SEAN
                        Nothing. 

           He picks up his plate and exits back into the living room. 
           Kim rolls her eyes and returns to her book. 

           A moment passes. Sean enters again, sitting down. Kim closes 
           her book, annoyed. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Sean...

                                 SEAN
                        You’re gonna call me paranoid. 
                        Actually you’re gonna call me 
                        something worse. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Jesus. Out with it. 

                                 SEAN
                        They were blueprints. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        What were blueprints? 

                                 SEAN
                        The package for Amir. They were 
                        rolled up schematics for some 
                        structure, and all the plans were 
                        in Farsi. 

           Kim stares at him in disbelief. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Are you serious right now? So if 
                        someone sends a creepy white dude 
                        some lotion and a basket he’s 
                        Buffalo Bill?

           Sean blinks several times, process the analogy.  

                                 SEAN
                        I mean...probably. But that’s 
                        beside the point. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        What is the point?

           He thinks. 
                                 SEAN
                        I don’t know. That’s why I’m saying 
                        it out loud. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Well let’s look at the pieces 
                        you’re trying to fit together. 
                        Muslims. Blueprints. 
                             (her eyes grow wide)
                        Terrorist bastards! Maybe I should 
                        call up all my gang-banging friends  
                        to pop some caps in their asses.  

           Sean hears it out loud and is suddenly ashamed. 

                                 SEAN
                        Fuck. You’re right. I....shit. You 
                        know, Marty was over and I think he 
                        just got inside my head and-

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Oh, right. Racist Marty. What’d he 
                        say about the damage?

                                 SEAN
                        Don’t call him that, and 6 to 7 
                        thousand minimum. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Quacks like a duck. 

           Sean laughs. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 SEAN
                        I said that earlier. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Huh. 
                             (thinking)
                        I guess we don’t have a choice. 

                                 SEAN
                        Well, we sort of do. 

           Kim gives him a tired look. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Sean...

                                 SEAN
                             (frustration growing)
                        Yeah. No. We don’t have a choice. 
                                 KIMBERLY
                        There’s nothing left to-

                                 SEAN
                             (angry)
                        No, I know. Only thing left is fly 
                        the white flag. Fix the water 
                        damage and split up the assets. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I’m not in the mood for this tone 
                        of yours. 

                                 SEAN
                        Shit. That sucks, cause I’m not in 
                        the mood for this divorce of yours. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Oh, it’s my divorce.

                                 SEAN
                        It is, Kimberly. It’s your divorce!

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Quit being a jerk.

                                 SEAN
                        Quit being a bitch! 

           Her face twists in rage. Sean knows he chose the wrong word. 

           She stands, abandoning her food. Sean watches as she marches 
           to the basement door, slamming it behind her.

           He looks around, then hits the table with his fist. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        I’m sorry.

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Kim has all six darts in her hand. She tosses each one with a 
           steady wrist - an old pro. 

           Bullseye. Twenty. Twenty. Bullseye. Bullseye. Three. 

           Fuck. She tips her head to the ceiling and sighs. 

           EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER

           Skillet mosey’s over to the back door of the house and MEOWS. 
           Suddenly, a tiny bowl with left-over chicken is placed in 
           front of him. The hungry cat gets to work, scarfing down the 
           food. 

           Sean kneels down and pets him. He looks up at the garage. All 
           is dark. 

           After a moment he stands and leaves. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Sean sleeps on the couch. The TV on low in the background.

           BANG!

           A jarring sound wakes him. The pit bull next door begins to 
           bark. 

                                 SEAN
                        What the fuck?

           Sean checks his iphone: “3:32am.” 

           We hear the bedroom door open and footsteps come down the 
           hall. Kim enters, hair a mess, barely awake.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Fuck was that?

           Sean gets up and puts on his pants.

                                 SEAN
                        Sounded like something backfiring. 

           Another BANG! The garage window BLAZES BRIGHT with a BLUE 
           LIGHT - multiple flashes of orange and white sparks accompany 
           it, along with a low HUM. Pots and pans rattle in the kitchen 
           until...

           The garage goes dark. Everything calms. Silence...except for 
           the pit bull’s continued barking. 

           The husband and wife look at each other. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sean sits at the table drinking a beer while Kim stares at 
           the window, tapping her fingers on the counter. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        It was like a vibration. 

                                 SEAN
                        Yeah.
                                 KIMBERLY
                        Then...that weird light...

                                 SEAN
                        Yeah.  

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Maybe we should check on them? 
                        Maybe they’re hurt.

           They stare at each other for a long beat.

           CREAK! They turn and see Amir, dressed in dark clothes, leave 
           the garage and head out the back gate.

           They turn off the kitchen light and duck down. As Amir passes 
           he stops, looks into the kitchen window. Can he see them? 

           Finally, he quietly exits the premises. 

           Kim looks down at her knees against the floor - realizes...  

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck am I doing? This is 
                        absurd. I’m going to bed.

                                 SEAN
                        But...

                                 KIMBERLY
                        No, Sean. I’ve spent my life 
                        watching people make knee-jerk 
                        judgements about me because of my 
                        skin color and here I am doing the 
                        same God damn thing.

                                 SEAN
                        It has nothing to do with their 
                        skin color. It’s because their 
                        activity is suspicious?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        They blew a fuse. Let’s not make 
                        this anything bigger than it is.

                                 SEAN
                        The blueprints? The Vice 
                        President’s visit.

           She stares at him, shakes her head. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Tell Marty he’s got the green 
                        light. Let’s just get this over and 
                        done with.
                             (walking away)
                        And hang those Goddamn curtains. 
           She leaves him alone again. Sean holds his anger in, then 
           turns back to the window. 

           After a moment, he wipes a single tear from his eye. 

           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Sean opens a lid of cat food and dumps it in a bowl.

           EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Sean opens the door and places the bowl down, - collecting 
           the empty chicken bowl from last night. 

                                 SEAN
                        Skillet?

           Sean waits - but to his surprise, the cat doesn’t come for 
           his breakfast.

           EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - GARAGE - MORNING

           Sean, with his tool kit and curtain rods, knocks on the 
           garage door. 

           Jahan answers, in her hijab. She smiles brightly and offers a  
           “good morning” in sign language. 

                                 SEAN
                        Morning. Sorry to bother...oh, this 
                        is a little...no very embarrassing. 
                        I’ve forgotten your name.

           She shakes her head, assuring him it’s fine, then begins to 
           sign the letters of her name. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, that doesn’t help. Sorry.

           She nods, then shrugs. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        I, uh, came over to hang the 
                        curtain rods. Also because I heard 
                        the noise last night. Thought I 
                        should check your breaker. 

           Jahan, nods, then steps aside. Sean enters, embarrassed. 
           INT. GARAGE / AIRBNB - CONTINUOUS

           Candles are strewn about, but otherwise the place is 
           immaculate. A few fresh oranges on the mini-kitchen counter.  

           He gets to work on the curtain rods.  

           As he pieces them together, Jahan peels an orange and watches 
           him. It makes Sean uncomfortable. Her eyes never leaving him. 

           When he finishes, he pulls the curtains closed and smiles. 

                                 SEAN
                        Full privacy, my lady. Now, let me 
                        investigate your electrical 
                        problem. 

           Jahan points up to the light fixture in the ceiling. Sean 
           tries the switch. Nothing.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        No worries. I have replacements. 

           He moseys over toward the fuse box, his eyes still exploring. 
           A stack of notebooks on the bed next to a laptop computer.

           Sean starts HUMMING, “Fools Rush In”.

           He notices the small CLOCK hanging to the right of the 
           breaker is off. The clock is frozen at “3:32”. 

           Sean taps it and it starts running again. Pushing the big 
           hand forward, he resets the time - still humming. 

           Finally, Sean removes the lid on the box and checks the 
           breakers. They’re fine. Flipped back already. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Ah. Your brother must have flipped 
                        this back alread...
                             (catching himself)
                        Or you. You’re just as capable of-

           He turns to see Jahan standing behind him, STARING. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll replace your bulbs and be out 
                        of your hair. 

           Sean starts his hum back up and opens the small closet and 
           reaches up on the top shelf to grab two extra bulbs. 

           He slyly looks around - the blueprint tube on the bottom, 
           against the back of the closet. And something else...

           He stops humming when he eyes a plastic crate filled 
           with...PARTS? Very high-tech looking processors, boards. 
           Wires, coil, metal discs...scrap materials, but almost 
           unrecognizably high tech scrap. 

           Then...

           HUMMING. Coming from behind him. Coming from Jahan. 

           A chill runs down Sean’s back when he recognizes the tune. 
           “Fools Rush In”. He turns - Jahan’s back to him as she hums. 
           Then...

           She stops. Turns her face to him, showing him the chair she 
           has placed under the light fixture.  

           Sean nods, now very nervous, then steps up and removes the 
           fixture. Lowering it, he discovers it filled with SHATTERED 
           GLASS - both bulbs broken. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Sean sits on a chair facing the window that looks at the 
           garage. He sips on a beer, two empty bottles on the counter, 
           and has his laptop open.

           He types in the search bar: Items used for bomb making.

           He cruises the web, hoping to connect the items he saw, 
           when...

           The front door opens, and Kim enters - home from work. 

           Sean jumps into action, tossing out the bottles and trying to 
           act natural. 

           Kim enters the kitchen looking tired.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Hey. 

                                 SEAN
                        Hey.

           She opens the fridge and grabs a beer herself. She looks over 
           at Sean, then the chair.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        What’s happening here?
                             (then it dawns on her)
                        Oh Christ, no. 

                                 SEAN
                        Now wait, there’s new evidence. I 
                        went over there today and-

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Sean!
                                 SEAN
                        To hang the curtains. That’s it.  
                        The woman let me in-

                                 KIMBERLY
                        She has a name, Sean. 

                                 SEAN
                        What is it?

           Kim suddenly realizes she doesn't know either. A bit 
           embarrassed...

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Continue. 

                                 SEAN
                        Well, for starters I don’t think 
                        she’s deaf. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Come again.

                                 SEAN
                        I was humming an Elvis song. Then 
                        she started humming the exact same 
                        song. 

           Suddenly, Kim seems interested. She leans in. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Also the light bulbs shattered. And 
                        then...I found something in the 
                        closet. Something not normal. 

           Kim is now fully invested, on pins and needles.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        It was a-

           Knock, knock, knock. 

           Both are startled. They turn to see Amir through the back 
           door window smiling, and holding an over-stuffed grocery bag.

           Sean opens the door. 

                                 AMIR
                        That chili was good, but now it’s 
                        our turn to impress you.  

           Sean turns to Kim. She recovers for him. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I can’t and won’t argue with people 
                        wanting to feed me.  
           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Jahan is working her magic at the stove, while Amir cuts 
           vegetables by the sink. Sean and Kim sip beers and watch.

                                 SEAN
                        Fesen...

                                 AMIR
                        Fesenjan. Fesenjan. 

           Sean points to a bag of walnuts.

                                 SEAN
                        Walnuts? With lamb?

                                 AMIR
                        One of the few authentic Persian 
                        dishes we know. 

           CLICK, CLICK, CLICK - WHOOSH! CLICK, CLICK, CLICK - WHOOSH!

           Sean and Kim look at Jahan who turns the gas stove’s dial on, 
           listening to the flame catch and start - then turning it off 
           and repeating the process. 

           She seems mesmerized by how easy the flame arrives and 
           vanishes. Amir touches her hand. She stops, smiles bashfully. 

           Sean and Kim share a look. 

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        We had an electric back home. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Well, I need to get out of these 
                        work clothes.

           Amir looks over Kim in her ripped jeans and t-shirt. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        I manage a bar. Pretty loose dress 
                        code. 
                             (to Sean)
                        Hun, you wanna tell me about that 
                        basement estimate?

           He catches on. 

                                 SEAN
                        Yes. 
                             (to Amir)
                        We’ll be right back. 

                                 AMIR
                        And we’ll be cooking. 
           Sean follows Kim toward the bedroom. He turns around - 
           catches Amir watching him. Amir smiles, then turns back. 

           Sean shivers, then enters into...

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Once the door is closed, Kim pounces in a low whisper. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        OK?

                                 SEAN
                        Are you noticing they’re both a 
                        little off? 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Sean, the thing. The thing in the 
                        closet. You’ve poisoned my mind, so 
                        tell me what it was!

                                 SEAN
                        Oh, right. It was a crate filled 
                        with...stuff.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Stuff?

                                 SEAN
                        Wires, and coil, computer guts. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Don’t we have a similar crate in 
                        the basement?

                                 SEAN
                        This wasn’t firewires and extension 
                        cords. It was...I mean, it was some 
                        next level shit. I know computers, 
                        Kim, and the chips on these boards 
                        weren’t arranged for smoother 
                        playback on cat videos. I’m talking 
                        sci-fi movie technology. Secret 
                        government technology.  

           Kimberly blinks a few extra times, processing his words. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re over-blinking.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I am not. 
                                 SEAN
                        You are. And you know when you over-
                        blink it’s because you’re being 
                        careful about what you say next. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Well...Sean...I’m just trying to 
                        makes sense of what you think this 
                        all means. 

                                 SEAN
                        They’re building something. With 
                        technology that my nerd tech ass 
                        has never seen. Something that 
                        requires energy. 

           She thinks. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Something that can trip the circuit 
                        and shatter two bulbs. 

           She thinks some more. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Do you see a narrative forming 
                        here?

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (lost in thought)
                        Huh.

                                 SEAN
                        Do we...call someone?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        No. God, no. Ninety percent chance 
                        we’re being paranoid assholes. 
                             (thinks)
                        Eighty percent. 

                                 SEAN
                        Then what do you suggest?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I think...we go back out there and 
                        we eat dinner. 

                                 SEAN
                        And then reconvene later.

           She throws up her hand - palm flat. Sean smacks it sideways 
           with his, then they invert and smack again. They do this 
           three times, then fist bump to a finger explosion. 

           The secret hand shake ends, and a wave of sadness washes over 
           them - a moment of happiness ripped from the past. 
                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll...let you dress. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        K. Thanks. 

           He nods and lumbers out of the room. She sits down on the bed 
           - lets out a large sigh. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Two hot plates of delicious Persian food sit in front of Sean 
           and Kim. Amir and Jahan watch them take their first bite. 

           They chew, and then slowly, large smiles form on their faces.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Oh my God.

                                 SEAN
                        This is insanely delicious.

           Amir and Jahan smile proudly.

                                 AMIR
                        All the credit should go to Jahan. 
                        I merely cut vegetables and leaned 
                        against the counter for moral 
                        support.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Jahan, you’re a damn wizard of 
                        flavor. 

           Jahan signs, “thank you”.

                                 SEAN
                             (bold)
                        Jahan, are you completely deaf?

           She nods. Signs. 

                                 AMIR
                             (translating)
                        She reads lips. 

                                 SEAN
                             (not convinced)
                        Elvis Presley fan?

           Jahan stares at him - not answering. Kim jumps in nervously, 
           raising her wine glass in the air. 
                                 KIMBERLY
                        Well, I’d like to toast to our 
                        guests and this incredible taste 
                        sensation they laid before us. 

           Amir and Jahan raise their tea. Sean his wine. 

                                 AMIR
                        Dast-e shoma dard nakoneh.

                                 SEAN
                        You speak Farsi?

                                 AMIR
                        Just a little. It literally means 
                        "May your hand not hurt you.” A 
                        form of thanks. 

                                 SEAN
                        Huh. Cool.

           Everyone clinks glasses. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATER

           Kim guides Jahan down the hall, giving her a tour.

           She stops at a baby picture of Sean in a toy car hanging on 
           the wall.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        See how fat he used to be?

           Jahan laughs, then points to their wedding photo. Kim and 
           Sean are slightly younger but so much happier. 

           Jahan places her hand over her heart. Kim smiles awkwardly. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        Yes. Yes, it was a beautiful day.

           She turns and watches Sean laugh with Amir at the dinner 
           table down the hall. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Their laughter subsides. Amir gives Sean a guilty look. 

                                 AMIR (O.C.)
                        I have a secret, Sean.

                                 SEAN
                        You do?

           Amir takes a moment, readying himself.
                                 AMIR
                        I’m not proud of myself but... I 
                        peaked through your window. The 
                        basement window.

                                 SEAN
                        Why..?

                                 AMIR
                        I am a bit of a snoop. Old habit. 
                        Saw you have a dartboard. 

                                 SEAN
                        I do. Well, It’s Kim’s. I suck. 

                                 AMIR
                             (laughs)
                        Yeah. Me too. But I do enjoy it. 

           Amir gives him a knowing look. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           All four of them stand in front of the dartboard taking turns  
           - enjoying themselves. 

           Sean hits the black outer ring of the one. Amir laughs. 

                                 AMIR
                        You weren’t lying. You’re bad. 

           Amir steps up. Takes his turn. He lands right next to Sean’s 
           dart. He turns and smiles. 

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        And I wasn’t lying either. 

           They laugh. Sean and Amir slap hands. 

                                 SEAN
                        As long as we suck together. 

           Kim and Jahan look at each other. Roll their eyes. 

           Amir notices the water damage line on the ceiling. 

                                 AMIR
                        How long has this been an issue?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        God. Going on three years now?

                                 AMIR
                        I could help, if you like. 
                                 SEAN
                        How so?

                                 AMIR
                        I’m in the construction business. 

           This new information relaxes Kim. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        You’re a builder?

                                 AMIR
                        Architect. Moved here to start my 
                        own firm. 

           Kim gives Sean a “that makes sense” look. He nods.  

                                 SEAN
                        Your own boss. I hear that. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (a bit drunk)
                        Maybe you could hire Sean. He needs 
                        a gig. 

           Sean frowns. 

           Jahan steps up to take her turn. She lands on the 9. 

                                 SEAN
                             (to Amir)
                        Who were you working for down 
                        there?

                                 AMIR
                        Carrier Johnson and Culture. Great 
                        company but we just think this is 
                        the right move. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Wow. A physicist and an architect.

           Kim steps forward with her dart raised. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                             (a bit drunk)
                        Well I might just be the manager of 
                        a bar, but I can do this. 

           She lets the dart float from her hand and...BULLSEYE. 

           Amir and Jahan are impressed. 
           EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - PATIO - LATER

           Sean rolls a joint as Amir and Jahan sip their water. Kim 
           pours herself another tequila soda.

           Amir and Jahan stare out over the backyard - the green grass 
           and shrubs. The crickets in perfect harmony. The Space Needle 
           burning brightly in the evening sky.  

                                 AMIR
                        Even at night I can tell how green 
                        everything is. 

                                 SEAN
                        Ha. Yeah, well it rains here 
                        enough. 

           Jahan signs. 

                                 AMIR
                        What is the noise? The musical 
                        stinging. 

                                 SEAN
                        Musical stinging?

           They all quiet down and listen. Then...

                                 KIMBERLY
                        The crickets?

           Amir’s face brightens. 

                                 AMIR
                        The crickets. 

                                 SEAN
                        They...don’t have crickets in San 
                        Diego?

                                 AMIR
                        Maybe. Too noisy where we lived.

           Jahan signs.

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                             (translating)
                        How long have you lived here? In 
                        this house?

                                 SEAN
                        Oh, man...it’s been...five years. 

                                 AMIR
                        Fantastic location. Fantastic view. 

           Amir looks out at the Space Needle off in the distance. 
                                 KIMBERLY
                        Never gets old. 

                                 AMIR
                             (lost)
                        I imagine not. 

           An awkward moment passes.  

                                 SEAN
                        Maybe we should light this joint. 

           Amir looks to Jahan, who shakes her head. 

                                 AMIR
                        We should probably turn in. 

                                 SEAN
                             (disappointed)
                        Oh. OK. Another time then. 

                                 AMIR
                        Yes. Another time. 

           Amir and Jahan hop off the patio and head to their 
           garage/AirBnB.

           BARK! BARK! The pit bull next door follows them on the other 
           side of the fence in the neighbor’s yard. 

                                 SEAN
                             (to Amir and Jahan)
                        Sorry. We hate him too.

           We hear the neighbor’s back door open.

                                 NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
                        Shut up, Frank!

           The dog quiets down and the neighbor’s door closes. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (to Amir and Jahan)
                        Obedience school, am I right?

           Amir and Jahan nod and smile - head inside the garage. Sean 
           and Kim sit a moment longer in silence.  

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        So...I’m feeling a little stupid. 

                                 SEAN
                        Why?

           She looks at him as if he’s the dumbest man alive, then nods 
           her head toward the back door. 
           She stands and enters. Sean wants to smoke the joint, but 
           knows he has to go talk to her. 

           He pockets it, and follows, but stops short when he notices 
           Skillet’s bowl STILL FULL OF FOOD. Sean’s mind wanders...and 
           then he follows his wife inside.  

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Sean enters as Kim is fixing a new drink.

                                 SEAN
                        What just happened?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Nothing happened. Actually, that’s 
                        the problem. Nothing happened. 
                        Those are perfectly lovely people 
                        and you had me actually considering 
                        they weren’t.

                                 SEAN
                        Hold on, I was only reporting what 
                        I saw and-

                                 KIMBERLY
                        God, Sean, you always suck me into 
                        your lunatic ideas because you have 
                        a stupid energy that I like. 

                                 SEAN
                        I do?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        That’s a bad thing. It’s a bad 
                        thing because these ideas, these 
                        dreams and conspiracies don’t 
                        actually pan out. They’re a 
                        distraction. This bullshit excuse 
                        of building your portfolio to get 
                        bigger clients - it’s an excuse to 
                        keep you from actually working. 
                        Actually contributing. So here I 
                        am, once again, neck deep in your 
                        adventure, knowing that when it 
                        ends I’m going back to the real 
                        world, and you’re on to the next 
                        big distraction. 

           Sean is stunned. It hurts. 

                                 SEAN
                        Wow. I had no idea I was the 
                        world’s biggest fuck up.
                                 KIMBERLY
                        Oh come on, I didn’t say-

                                 SEAN
                        You said plenty. 
                             (pause)
                        So Amir and Jahan...just another 
                        one of my “dreams and 
                        conspiracies?”

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Yes! 
                             (lowering her voice)
                        Yes. He’s an architect. Blueprint 
                        mystery solved.

                                 SEAN
                        The crate of parts? That’s still 
                        suspicious, right?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        She’s a fucking physicist. Last I 
                        heard they still use equipment to 
                        do science. 

                                 SEAN
                        Come one, be honest, there’s a 
                        vibe. Like they’re always on guard. 
                        Always...watching. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (calm but frustrated)
                        That’s because they’re Muslim. I 
                        get it. You don’t. 

           Sean thinks. Then...

                                 SEAN
                        They didn’t know what crickets 
                        were. 

           Kim can’t take any more. She shakes her head, grabs her 
           drink, and marches into her room, closing the door. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Kim is in bed. Lights out and staring. 

           Restless, she flicks on the light, opens her night stand 
           drawer. Reaching down, her diary is GONE. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        What the fuck?
           EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - PATIO - MOMENTS LATER

           Sean’s joint blazes between his lips - his laptop on his lap. 
           He stares at the still full bowl of cat food. Then...he opens 
           a search browser. 

           He stares at the garage. All is quiet. Curtain closed.

           He types in the search bar: Amir Razi.

           Way too many results. Nothing useful. 

           He tries again. Types in: Amir and Jahan Razi.

           Still nothing useful.

           He sits...thinks...then...

           How many days to tent a house for bugs?

           The search pulls up an immediately interesting fact:

           Typically the treatment takes up to 24 hours, in some cases 

           Sean nods. He’s caught Amir in a lie. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Sean has dragged a chair to the window again, and plopped 
           himself down. An open beer at his side. 

                                 SEAN
                        I got allllll night, my friends. 

                                                          CUT TO: LATER

           Sean is fast asleep in the chair, drooling on his shirt. 

           BOOM!

           Sean’s eyes fling open, almost falling off his stool. He 
           looks through the window at the garage. All is quiet and 
           dark. Then...

           A SPARK OF LIGHT. The interior window illuminates. Through 
           the curtain is the silhouettes of Amir and Jahan. 

           EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           The door silently opens, and Sean slips out into the yard. 

           Another small BANG followed by a spark of light feed his 
           curiosity as he inches toward the garage.  
           He peers through the window, but can’t see through the 
           curtains. He presses his ear to the door. Hears voices. 

           Suddenly, the light returns to the window, only now in a 
           rhythmic throbbing. The ground RUMBLES. Sean grows terrified. 

           His hand shaking badly, he grips the knob and FLINGS OPEN THE 
           DOOR - gasps as a bright light hits him.  

           Silence...no, not silence. Wind and...

           Creak. Creak. Creak. 

           Through the doorway of the garage is the impossible. The 
           DESERT WASTELAND he dreamt about before. The miles of dry, 
           toxic earth. The rusted metal street sign.

           HUSHED WILLOW RD.

           Creak. Creak. CREAK.

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Sean’s head lifts from the counter - looking around and out 
           of breath. Out the window all is normal with the garage. 

           The front door slams off screen, scaring him. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           Sean watches as Kim’s SUV pulls out of the driveway and off 
           to work. 

           He leans against the front door, his heart still racing. 

           Finally, he pushes off and heads down the hall. 

           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Sean sits in the chair again, coffee by his side. His laptop  
           is open as he sits on a web page - F.B.I. REPORT SUSPICIOUS 
           ACTIVITY. 

           He stares at the words long and hard. Finally, he opens up a 
           text document and begins to create a list:

           Blueprints. Parts. Power surge. Leaving the day of V.P. 
           visit. 

           He thinks. Then adds...

           Missing cat.
           Sean sips his coffee and stares at the list. Is it enough? 
           Does he need more?

           Suddenly, the garage door opens. Sean ducks low and peeks 
           over the edge to watch Jahan exit without Amir. She goes out 
           through the gate. 

           Sean immediately starts a log, entering the time she left. 

           DING!

           Sean checks the new email. An answer to his Craig’s List 
           query. Dear Sean, We are very interested in speaking to you 
           about possible employ-

           Sean closes the window. No time for that.

           He opens up a new window and types in the firm name “Carrier 
           Johnson and Culture” and finds the phone number. 

           Sean dials. Waits. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST (PHONE)
                        Carrier Johnson and Culture. 

           EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - FRONT - LATER

           Night slowly falls around the Harrison residence. The Hushed 
           Willow Rd. sign sits in perfect stillness. The Space Needle’s 
           tip touching the clouds in the distance.

           Kim’s car pulls into the driveway. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           Kim enters the dark house. She flips on the foyer light. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Sean?

                                 SEAN (O.C.)
                        Kitchen. 

           She makes her way down the hall. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Why are you sitting in the dar-
           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           She turns the corner to see Sean camped out in the dark by 
           the window - a blanket thrown over him to hide his 
           silhouette. A handful of beer bottles grace the counter and 
           the glow of his laptop illuminates his face. 

                                 SEAN
                        He lied to us, Kim. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Oh, fuck me. 

           Sean stands and goes to her.

                                 SEAN
                        Listen. I called Carrier Johnson 
                        and Culture. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        What?

                                 SEAN
                        His old firm. Kim...they’ve never 
                        heard of Amir Razi. There’s no 
                        record of his employment. We’ve got 
                        him!

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (over it)
                        When’s Marty starting on the 
                        basement?

                                 SEAN
                        Tomorrow. Now look at this. I’ve 
                        logged their activity-

           Sean turns to retrieve his lap top then freezes in horror.

           Staring at him through the kitchen window is Amir. He heard 
           everything. 

           Sean backs up to Kim as Amir slowly opens the back door and 
           steps inside. 

                                 AMIR
                        It’s true. I never worked for them.  
                        Also...
                             (suddenly, a Middle-
                              Eastern accent)
                        We are not American. 

           Sean and Kim’s eyes grow wide. 
                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        We are refugees. 

                                                          CUT TO: LATER

           Sean and Kim sit across from Amir at the kitchen table - a 
           fresh cup of tea in front of him. 

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        Jahan and I grew up in a war torn 
                        hell.
                             (thinks)
                        I was fifteen when the bombs found 
                        my family.

           Kim is appalled. Her hand covers her mouth. 

                                 SEAN
                        I don’t understand. Why the lies?

           Amir shrugs.

                                 AMIR
                        Look around. Watch the news. Listen 
                        to your president and the people 
                        who support him. We are not welcome 
                        here. Best we blend in. The same 
                        amount of looks, but less of the 
                        abuse. 

           Sean feels embarrassed. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Amir...we are so, so-

                                 SEAN
                        Jahan isn’t deaf. 

           Amir shakes his head. 

                                 AMIR
                        Jahan was once a spy for a small 
                        resistance group. She was part of a 
                        team who saved many lives with 
                        their information, but was found 
                        out while still behind enemy lines. 

           Tears begin to build in Kim’s eyes. 

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        They executed the others, and 
                        removed Jahan’s tongue. A stern 
                        warning that they were in charge. 
                        That the scales were not to be 
                        tipped.  

           Silence.
                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        Crickets don’t sing in a world with 
                        no songs.

           More stunned silence. 

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        I am sorry to have deceived you. We 
                        only want to start over. 

           He stands, nods goodbye, then makes his way out the back 
           door. We hear the neighbor’s pit bull bark at Amir as he 
           walks toward the garage.

           Sean is speechless. He turns to Kim - her eyes red. 

                                 SEAN
                        How was I supposed to know? How was 
                        I-

           She stands. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I’m going out. 

                                 SEAN
                        Wait...you are? Where are you 
                        going?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Somewhere not here. Definitely a 
                        bar. 

                                 SEAN
                        You just came from a bar. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        A different bar. Where I’m a 
                        stranger. 

           She turns to leave.

                                 SEAN
                        Kim...How was I-

                                 KIMBERLY
                        You just were. 

           She heads right back the way she came. 

           Sean jumps as the door slams shut. His face shifts in anger.

           He stands and goes to his laptop on the counter - enters a 
           new log:

           6:46pm. Kim walks out. I hate everything.
           He stares at the log for a long time, then erases it - his 
           head falling into his hands. 

           INT. HIPSTER BAR - LATER

           CLOSE ON: A DART hitting the bullseye. 

           Kim throws darts, relieving her stress - a whiskey neat by 
           her side. 

           She hits a second bullseye, then a third. 

           Suddenly, a tall, handsome CLICHE slinks up next to her. 

                                 THE CLICHE 
                        Hell of a wrist you got. 

           She looks him over, smiles at the attention, but gives him 
           little to go off. 

                                 THE CLICHE (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I don’t want you to be 
                        alarmed, but I’m a time traveler in 
                        search of the year people actually 
                        met in person and not on some phone 
                        screen.  

           He gives her his best smile. She laughs. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Wow...that was special. 

           The Cliche retrieves her darts, grabbing an extra set of 
           three for himself. Hands them to her. 

                                 THE CLICHE
                        Sorry. They say open with a witty 
                        first line. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        They do, huh?

                                 THE CLICHE
                        I’m Dustin.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Kim. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        Very pretty. 

           He tosses the dart. Hits a twenty. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Dustin, I’m just looking to have a 
                        quiet drink and stab some cork. 
                                 DUSTIN
                        We can whisper. 

           She throws her dart. Eighteen. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I’m married. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        Oh yeah? I was once. 

           This interests Kim. He throws another twenty.  

                                 KIMBERLY
                        What happened there?

                                 DUSTIN
                        Oh, the usual. Married young. Bad 
                        communication. Stopped having sex. 

           This all rings a bell. She throws an outer-ring bullseye.

           She looks down at Dustin’s chest - hanging off a silver chain 
           is a SHARK TOOTH. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        You get that classy necklace before 
                        or after the divorce? Wait. I know 
                        the answer. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        You’re a real ball buster, Kim. 

           He throws his final dart - a six.

           Kim is about to dismiss him again when she sees something 
           that causes her to freeze up. 

           Across the bar, in a dark corner sipping tea - AMIR. He’s 
           flipping through a notebook, taking PHOTOGRAPHS OF EACH PAGE 
           with a phone - no, wait...it’s not a notebook... 

           She squints her eyes, then takes a step back in shock when 
           Amir lifts the notebook up to examine a page more closely. 

           A BUTTERFLY EMBLEM. IT’S HER DIARY!

           Amir glances in Kim’s direction. She leaps into action, 
           placing herself in front of Dustin, almost kissing him to 
           hide her face. 

                                 DUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Well, hello. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I just really respond to 
                        compliments. 
                                 DUSTIN
                        Oh yeah? What else do you respond 
                        to?

           Kim looks over his shoulder. Amir has placed the diary flat 
           on the table, and now doodles on a cocktail napkin. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Obedience. 

           Dustin leans in and whispers.

                                 DUSTIN
                        And what is it you want me to do?

           He gives her earlobe an overly wet kiss. Kim cringes but 
           holds it together. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Don’t be obvious, but do you see 
                        the gentleman writing on a napkin 
                        behind you?

           Dustin smiles, then casually turns like a spy on his first 
           day. He spots Amir, then turns back. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        The Arab?

           Kim bites her lip, but continues on.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Uh huh. I wanna play cloak and 
                        dagger. That...
                             (deep breath)
                        ...Arab has sensitive intel about 
                        our government. 
                             (leans in)
                        And nothing turns me on like 
                        sensitive intel. If you can snap a 
                        photo of its contents without being 
                        caught...
                             (right in ear)
                        I’ll give you one Hell of a 
                        promotion. 

           She nibbles on his ear just enough. Dustin is enamored. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        Man, I really like you. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Go get um, sharky. 

           Dustin salutes her, then turns to study his subject. 
           Kim backs up, positioning herself behind a wood beam so Amir 
           can’t see her. He holds up a cell phone, studying an image, 
           and then places it down and continues to write in the book. 

           Dustin walks toward the bathroom near Amir’s table, but can’t 
           find the right angle to get a good picture of the napkin. 

           He thinks...then....

           He sits one table over. Amir doesn’t bat an eye - too busy 
           with his work. 

           Kim watches as Dustin takes out his phone and angles it at a 
           bar mirror behind Amir. After a moment, Dustin stands and 
           heads back over with a shit-eating grin. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        You’re gonna howl tonight.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Let’s see what you got first. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        No, ma’am. I’ll text it to you. 

           Kim groans. 

                                 DUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Which means I’ll need your number. 

           Well played. Kim sighs. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        578-5998.

           Dustin enters it in, then hits send. 

           Kim’s phone vibrates. The photo has arrived. She opens it. 

                                 DUSTIN
                             (proud)
                        All I had to do was zoom in to the 
                        back of the bar mirror behind him. 
                        The whole thing was in the 
                        reflection. 

           Kim’s eyes widen. She feels sick. She looks up at Dustin. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Follow me out the door.

                                 DUSTIN
                             (excited)
                        And to Hell and back. 

           She takes his hand and uses his body to slink toward the 
           front door. Just as she exits she turns to look at Amir. 
           He is STARING RIGHT AT HER. 

           She presses herself closer to Dustin and exits. 

           EXT. HIPSTER BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Kim immediately releases Dustin.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        So...my place or yours? I guess 
                        yours cause...husband and all. 

           She stops in sudden realization. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        Shit. My purse.

                                 DUSTIN
                        I’ll grab it for you. 

           He bounds back inside. Kim pulls her purse that was tucked 
           under her arm the entire time, turns, and walks quickly away. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Kim enters the kitchen expecting to see Sean siting on his 
           stool staring out the window. No Sean. No stool. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She pokes her head into the bedroom. No Sean. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - BASEMENT

           The door opens and Kim walks down the steps to find Sean 
           sitting in his ratty chair drinking a beer and staring at the 
           water spot in the ceiling. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        What are you doing?

                                 SEAN
                        Not being a paranoid asshole. 

           Kim nods...steps to him. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        My diary went missing. I thought 
                        maybe you took it looking 
                        for...answers or something. 
                                 SEAN
                             (annoyed)
                        I didn’t take your diary. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I know.
                             (pause)
                        I just saw Amir at a bar. 

           Sean looks over, exhausted. 

                                 SEAN
                        OK. 

           Kim brings out her phone and pulls up the picture. She hands 
           it to him. Sean looks down at the screen for a long time. 

           It’s a mirror reflected image of the contents on Amir’s 
           table: Diary, cell phone, napkin.

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (pointing)
                        There’s my diary, but even more 
                        disturbing...

           Kim uses her fingers to zoom in on the napkin. It’s slightly 
           blurry, but enough details stand out to show it’s... 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        A hand drawn map. Look, there’s the 
                        Space Needle. And our neighborhood 
                        and...
                             (she zooms in tighter)
                        The X is our house, Sean. 

           There’s text, but it’s blurry and in Farsi. Kim points to one 
           last detail. Sean’s eyes grow wide. It’s a date. July 28th. 

           He stands. 

                                 SEAN
                        Holy shit. This is the date the 
                        Vice President has lunch with Mayor 
                        King in the Needle. He was drawing 
                        this?

           She nods. 

           Sean’s face drops. Then...a twinkle in his eye. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Holy shit. 
                                 SEAN
                        How’d you get this close without 
                        being seen?

           Kim stumbles for an answer.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I’m...stealth as fuck, you know 
                        that. 

           The sound of the gate outside rattles them. They listen as it 
           closes. Must be Amir. After a moment - silence. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        We should order pizza. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Wrapped in a blanket and in the dark, Sean and Kim sit on 
           separate chairs watching the garage - an almost empty pizza 
           box on the counter. 

           The curtains are closed on the garage window, but the 
           occasional shadow moves past from time to time. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        It’s almost three in the morning. 
                        Why are they still up. 

                                 SEAN
                        Takes time to build a bomb. 

           They sit in silence. Then...

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Does it scare you? The thought of 
                        starting all over again. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (struggling)
                        It’s terrifying. 

                                 SEAN
                             (not convinced)
                        But necessary.

           Kim looks at Sean and gives him a sad smile. They sit in 
           silence, staring out the window. 

                                                           CUT TO BLACK

           Then...a SPARK OF WHITE LIGHT. It consumes the dark. 

           Creak. Creak. Creak. 
           EXT. WASTELAND - DREAM

           The white fades out, revealing the familiar desert wasteland 
           with the crumbling skyline. 

           A high wind kicks up the dirt. Heavy breathing is heard. 

           Sean and Kim step into frame - holding hands and staring out 
           at the destruction in awe. 

           Suddenly, Sean’s legs give out on him and he tumbles to the 
           ground. Kim tries to help him up but he can’t seem to stand. 

           As he struggles, BLOOD begins to seep through his pants. It 
           pools around his legs and softens the ground. 

           Sean screams as he begins to sink in a dirt-red puddle of his 
           own quicksand. Kim grips him tight, but can’t pull him out...

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        Yo!

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Sean’s eyes crack open, his heart racing. His motion causes 
           Kim to wake suddenly as well, having been asleep on his 
           shoulder. 

           Marty laughs behind them.

                                 MARTY
                        What the fuck you guys doing?

           They turn to see Marty leaning into the kitchen, and quickly 
           gather themselves.

                                 SEAN
                        We fell asleep.

                                 MARTY
                        In the kitchen?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I gotta go run some errands before 
                        work. Hi Marty. 

           She leaves without even making eye contact with him.

                                 MARTY
                        Hey, Kim...

           Sean looks out the window at the garage. Everything looks the 
           same as it was the night before.
                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Kitchen sleeping, eh? I’ll have to 
                        try that with the wife. Closer to 
                        the beer and all. 
                             (whispers)
                        You guys doggy it over the sink?

           Marty makes a hip thrust motion.

                                 SEAN
                        No. We just.. No. 

           He starts grinding coffee beans.

           CREAK. The garage door opens. Sean stops grinding and, like a 
           dog scouting a squirrel, stares at Amir as he walks out. 

           Marty notices Sean’s crazed looked. 

                                 MARTY
                        You gonna stare a little harder or 
                        finally ask him out?

           This shakes Sean from his daze. 

                                 SEAN
                        Sorry. Bit cloudy today. 

           Amir looks up and spots him. Flashes an awkward smile and a 
           wave, then exits the gate. 

                                 MARTY
                        Get your shit together, boy. We got 
                        work to do. 

           INT. HARRISON CAR - AFTERNOON

           Kim, now dressed in vintage jeans and loose Zelda t-shirt, 
           listens to the radio as she drives to work.

                                 NEWS REPORTER
                        An increased police presence will 
                        be felt in the city this week in 
                        preparation for the Vice 
                        President’s visit - a three-day 
                        meeting that is expected to end 
                        with his endorsement to Mayor King 
                        in his run for senate. Any 
                        tourist’s hoping to visit our most 
                        iconic landmark will have to delay 
                        their plans a day or two, as the 
                        Space Needle will be closed for a 
                        private lunch between the two 
                        political heavyweights.   
           Kim spots the Space Needle in the distance through her 
           windshield.

           She grabs her phone and dials - puts on her best sick voice. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (raspy)
                        Hey Faith. Bad news...yeah, can you 
                        hear it? I don’t know. Some bug bit 
                        me. Yeah, soup and tea for me. 
                        Thank you. Hopefully I’ll see you 
                        tomorrow. Bye. 

           She hangs up, and turns the car in the direction of the Space 
           Needle.

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

           Marty pokes holes in the ceiling with a crowbar. The soft, 
           water soaked plaster chunks off easily, exposing the wood and 
           pipes underneath. 

           Sean watches from below, not paying much attention to his 
           rambling friend. 

                                 MARTY
                        I just think the TV version didn’t 
                        have to add that element to the 
                        story. George R. R. Martin didn’t 
                        put it in there for a reason, so 
                        why do it? But I do like that we 
                        get to see that Dragon mom’s 
                        titties from time to time. 

           Sean notices a set of FEET approach the small, ground-level 
           window above - JAHAN’s scuffed boots and frayed jeans. They 
           face the house, motionless.

           He’s now fully distracted as he keeps his eyes on her feet. 
           Is she listening? Spying?

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        You know, Gretchen hasn’t aged all 
                        that well, shit neither have I, but 
                        one thing I will give her is her 
                        titties. Those things are as round 
                        and buoyant as the day we met. 

           Sean’s heart pounds in his ears as he continues to stare at 
           the feet. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        I also wish dragons were real. I 
                        bet scientists could splice two 
                        animals together and make one, 
                        don’t you?
           A CIGARETTE DROPS to the grass. Jahan’s foot steps on it. 
           Then, she bends down to pick it up - the edge of her profiled 
           face peaking through her head scarf comes to view. Her eye 
           slowly turns and looks at Sean - staring at him coldly.  

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        What do you think? Like an 
                        alligator and an eagle? Sean?

           Jahan walks away, and Sean notices he can breath again. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Sean!

                                 SEAN
                        Huh? Yeah, man. Dragons are cool. 

                                 MARTY
                        Damn right they are. 
                             (to himself)
                        Damn right they are. 
                             (looking at the ceiling)
                        Bit of a mess up here. Gonna need 
                        to replace the support beams as 
                        well. Warn Kim to stay out of the 
                        hall until I’m finished. Or don’t.

           He gives Sean a mischievous grin. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Seriously though, use your back 
                        door. 

           EXT. SPACE NEEDLE - AFTERNOON

           Kim gets out of her car and heads toward the entrance of the 
           iconic, Seattle building - tourists and locals alike mill 
           about. 

           INT. SPACE NEEDLE - GROUND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Kim enters with her ticket and has a look around - analyzing 
           every nook and cranny as if she might find an answer to a 
           question she’s still unsure of. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

           Sean pulls out two beers from the fridge and hands one to 
           Marty. 

                                 MARTY
                        So, how them Muslims in your garage 
                        doing? You ever catch em praying on 
                        those rugs?
                                 SEAN
                        How’s that any different than 
                        kneeling on a pew?

           Sean sits at the table with Marty.

                                 MARTY
                             (shrugs)
                        My God’s cooler. 

                                 SEAN
                        They’re technically the same God. 

                                 MARTY
                        Bullshit. Mine’s a God of love.

                                 SEAN
                        Uh huh. You should read about all 
                        the loving shit your God did. 

                                 MARTY
                        I don’t actually care. I just like 
                        it when you get worked up. 

                                 SEAN
                        Ours is an antagonistic friendship. 

                                 MARTY
                        Cheers to that. 

           They clink and drink. Sean thinks. 

                                 SEAN
                        However...

           Marty looks up. Seems important. Sean is hesitant. 

           INT. SPACE NEEDLE - OBSERVATION DECK - AFTERNOON

           The elevator opens and Kim steps out with several others onto 
           the observation deck that allows her to look out over the 
           entire city. 

           It’s breathtaking, but she’s not interested in the view. She 
           wanders around, her eyes scanning everything. 

           She presses her face against the glass and spots her house. 

           Then, she turns and finds a SECURITY GUARD standing quietly 
           in the corner, watching over the scene. Kim approaches, 
           stopping in front of the serious looking woman in blue. 

           After a awkward beat.
                                 KIMBERLY
                        Bet you’re dreading the Vice 
                        President’s visit.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Who? Me?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Sure.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        No. I don’t work that day. The 
                        federal government brings in their 
                        own team. I’ll be home far away 
                        from this madness. 

           The Security Guard gives a friendly smile.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Cool. Cool.

           Another awkward beat of silence.

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        You know... I was actually thinking 
                        about bringing my family down here 
                        over the weekend, wave to the V.P. 
                        but...not to sound paranoid but we 
                        live in turbulent times. You think 
                        security will be good? 

           The Security Guard turns to Kim and looks her up and down.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        It’ll be pretty secure, Miss. Just 
                        like any typical day in downtown, 
                        only with federal agents. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        The feds. Those guys are good.

           The Security Guard gives Kim a look. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        And gals. Those guys and gals.
                             (beat)
                        And goodbye. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

           Marty feels around the edges of the bathroom mirror, getting 
           a grip. Sean stands behind him in the reflection. 

                                 MARTY
                        Those are premonitions. 
                                 SEAN
                        Huh?

                                 MARTY
                        Those dreams you’re having. End 
                        times and shit.

           He lifts up and removes the mirror from the screw on the 
           wall. Turns to Sean. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        God’s sending you a warning. 
                        Showing you the future that will be 
                        if you don’t do something about 
                        this.

           He scoots by Sean and out of the bathroom. Sean follows. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Marty takes the mirror to the cabinet by the back window, 
           holds it up, then makes a mark with his pencil on the 
           cabinet’s door. 

                                 SEAN
                        Or my mind’s overreacting causing 
                        nightmares because of my looming 
                        divorce. You know, the more logical 
                        explanation. 

                                 MARTY
                        God. Logic. Call it what you want, 
                        buddy. Point is, those Muslim’s are 
                        up to some heavy shit and you’ve 
                        been chosen to stop them. 

           Marty DRILLS a screw into the cabinet, then hangs the mirror 
           on it. When it’s secure, he opens and closes the door - the 
           garage outside seen at different angles through the mirror. 

           He turns with a grin. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                             (proud as fuck)
                        Now you can safely watch the garage  
                        during the day without being 
                        spotted. 

                                 SEAN
                        You think I should contact them? 
                        The F.B.I.?

                                 MARTY
                        No. 
                                 SEAN
                        Really?

                                 MARTY
                        Can’t trust em. 

                                 SEAN
                        The F.B.I.?

                                 MARTY
                        For all we know, they’re the ones 
                        let them in the country in the 
                        first place. No. What we need is a 
                        professional to get us some solid 
                        evidence. Then we take it directly 
                        to the people.  

                                 SEAN
                        What professional?

                                 MARTY
                        I know a guy. Private investigator 
                        friend of mine. Hired him to follow 
                        Gretchen when I thought she was 
                        sleeping with her boss?

                                 SEAN
                        Gretchen was having an affair?

                                 MARTY
                        Naw. Turns out she was throwing me 
                        a surprise party. Good dude, 
                        though. We became friends. 

                                 SEAN
                        I don’t know. I think maybe this is 
                        bigger than that. 

                                 MARTY
                        Listen, if my guy can uncover some 
                        serious proof...then it’s safer to 
                        approach the proper authorities, 
                        because then we have leverage. We 
                        tell them with what you have now 
                        and they can snuff us right out. 

                                 SEAN
                        I regret telling you. 

                                 MARTY
                        You won’t when we save thousands of 
                        lives. I’mma make a call. 

           He stands and takes out his phone. Sean takes a large sip of 
           his beer, unsure about everything. 
           EXT. SPACE NEEDLE - AFTERNOON

           Kim steps outside and has one last look around. 

           Then, she sees him - thirty yards away taking pictures of the 
           Needle. AMIR.

           Kim quickly ducks around the side of the building, then peeks 
           around the corner. 

           Amir scans the courtyard as if he’s confused - as if he’s 
           lost something. He snaps one last picture, then walks toward 
           the entrance. 

           Kim quickly snaps a photo of Amir with her phone, just as he 
           enters the Space Needle.

           Kim breathes a sigh of relief. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sean is back in his same spot, lights off, blanket wrapped 
           around him, watching the garage through the window. 

                                 KIMBERLY (O.C.)
                        Anything?

           Startled, Sean almost falls off his chair.

                                 SEAN
                        Oh, come on. I’m already on edge. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Sorry. 

           He closes the news window. 

                                 SEAN
                        You gotta come in through the back 
                        for a while. Hallway is dangerous 
                        until Marty finishes. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        OK. Anything?

                                 SEAN
                        No. Nothing interesting, Amir came 
                        back half an hour ago. 

           She nods, something to say. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        What’s that look?

           Kim takes out her phone and holds up a picture - the back of 
           Amir against The Space Needle. 
                                 KIMBERLY
                        I think we need to make a call. 

           INT. FBI - DEPUTY ASSITANT DIRECTOR’S OFFICE - LATER

           DEPUTY ASSISTANT DIRECTOR sits behind a tiny, uncluttered 
           desk in a mostly white room. He’s dressed well, in a black 
           suit and blue tie - a phone pressed to his ear while he draws 
           circles with a pencil on a pad of paper, and picks crumbs off 
           a half-eaten bagel - bored. 

                                 DEPUTY ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                        Ya-huh. Flashes of light. Ya-huh. 
                        Blue prints. What were they for? 
                        You don’t know. Ya-huh. You don’t 
                        say. Your diary. The terrorists 
                        took your diary. Ya-huh. Ya-huh. 
                        I’m gonna stop you right there. 
                             (looks at his computer)
                        Already ran your guest’s names. 
                        Amir and Jahan Razi aren’t on any 
                        watch lists and honestly, I’m not 
                        hearing much here. Now, we get a 
                        lot of calls about “suspicious” 
                        activity and there’s no way I can 
                        bump up your diary snoopers over 
                        the last gentleman's sighting of 
                        Hitler eating jalapeno poppers at 
                        T.G.I.Fridays. If you see something 
                        more substantial we encourage you 
                        to give us another ring. Thank you, 
                        and God bless America. 

           He hangs up the phone and takes a large bite out of his bagel 
           - completely unaffected. 

           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sean and Kim are cheek to cheek - sharing the phone. 

                                 SEAN
                        Did he just hang up on us? 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Yeah. And made us sound crazy. 

           He thinks. 

                                 SEAN
                        He did encourage us to get 
                        something more substantial. 

           They share a look. 
           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON the microwave beeping. 

           Sean opens it and pulls out popcorn. He dumps it in a bowl 
           and brings it to Kim. She sits in her usual spot, facing the 
           window. Sean sits next to her and the two obsessively watch 
           the garage in the distance under a blanket.

           Suddenly the garage door opens. They duck low - holding their 
           breath. 

           Jahan steps out and lights a cigarette. 

           Sean and Kim watch her smoke - chewing popcorn - riveted. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (whisper)
                        Hey, have you seen Skillet?

           Sean turns with a knowing look. 

                                 SEAN
                             (whisper)
                        Exactly. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Sean sits in his chair, eyes still trained on the garage. Kim 
           is passed out, sleeping on his shoulder. Sean looks at her 
           fondly. She’s beautiful. 

           Her eyes open. She looks up at him. A brief moment where they 
           might kiss...

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Fuck.

           Kim pulls away and gets up.

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        My neck.
                             (stretches)
                        What time is it?

           Sean checks his phone.

                                 SEAN
                        Two thirty.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I gotta sleep. Wake me up if you 
                        see or hear anything.

                                 SEAN
                        Okay. Good night.
           Kim yawns as she escapes down the hall. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

           Kim lies under the covers trying to sleep. She tosses and 
           turns, sweating. She stares at the window facing the garage. 
           She can’t see out of it from this angle but just the sight of 
           the window is tempting...it’s also freaky. 

           Kim closes her eyes, trying to block out the bad thoughts.

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sean slaps himself in the face to keep from falling asleep. 

                                 SEAN
                             (singing to himself)
                        Take on meeeee. Take on me.

           He slaps himself again.

                                 KIMBERLY (O.C.)
                        Sean.

           He leaps, startled. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, sorry. I don’t know how to 
                        do it without scaring you. 

           Sean catches his breath and sits back down.

                                 SEAN
                        It’s okay. 

           He can see a gleam of excited mischief in her eyes. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        What’s up?

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Kim has re-arranged the bed so that it faces the window - 
           making it easy to see out of.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        That way we can keep an eye on the 
                        situation while one of us sleeps. 
                        We take turns.

           Sean looks at his wife, surprised at the idea. There’s a 
           silent and awkward beat.
                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 SEAN
                        Nothing. It’s a good plan. 

           They hop into bed together. Kim keeps a safe distance as 
           there’s enough room on the king size bed. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take first shift. Wake you 
                        when I start to drift. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        OK.

           She remains sitting upright and wide-eyed. They watch the 
           window together - the thrill and the fear keeping them up.

           CLOSE ON Sean’s eyes. The window reflecting in his pupil. His 
           eyelids grow heavy. Heavier. Then...

           They close. 

           Creak. Creak. Creak. 

           When they reopen...

           EXT. WASTELAND - DREAM

           Sean is staring at a dirty, beige hijab on the ground. Every 
           once in awhile it shifts - something underneath.  

           Kim sits in the sand behind him - blood on her hands. 

           Sean moves toward the hijab. It moves. He freezes. Then 
           continues. 

           Slowly he reaches down and grips the fabric. He lifts. 

           A horrible growl stings his ears. Underneath the hijab is 
           Skillet the cat, buried in the sand up to his neck - blood on 
           his fur. Fangs out. 

                                                        CUT TO: MORNING

           Sean’s eyes crack open - he gasps. 

           Kim looks over at him, wide awake and on her shift. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Hey. You OK?

           He looks around, sweat on his brow. 
                                 SEAN
                        Yeah. What’d I miss?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Raccoon wandered by around 5:30ish.

           She notices Sean looks pale. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D (CONT’D)
                        You look spooked. 

                                 SEAN
                             (dazed)
                        Premonition. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Premonition?

                                 SEAN
                        Nightmare. 
                             (slowly)
                        I feel like...something is warning 
                        me. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Something?

           Before Sean can continue, his phone buzzes. He answers:

                                 SEAN
                        Hey, Marty. One sec.
                             (to Kim)
                        You going in to work?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        No. Laid the ground work yesterday 
                        for a nasty cold. 

           Sean nods. 

                                 SEAN
                        Bacon and eggs?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        The proper start to any stake out. 

           He leans in to kiss her unconsciously, then freezes. They 
           stare at each other for an awkward moment, then he retreats. 

                                 SEAN
                        Sorry. Muscle memory. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Uh huh. 

           He climbs out of bed and lumbers from the room. Kim raises 
           her hand to her mouth, a little overwhelmed with emotion. 
           From the next room she hears Sean answer his phone. 

                                 SEAN (O.C.)
                        Hey. Oh. OK. When? Hold on. 

           Sean returns to the bedroom, a guilty look on his face. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        We’re meeting Marty for breakfast. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (leery)
                        Why?

           She can see why from Sean’s face. He told him. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        Goddamn it, Sean. 

           Sean puts the phone to his ear. 

                                 SEAN
                        We’ll meet you there. 

           INT. DINER - AFTERNOON

           Kim and Sean enter the quiet diner and spot Marty in a booth 
           in the back, sitting next to a THIN BALD MAN twirling a 
           toothpick in his mouth. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Jesus, let the cliches begin. 

                                 SEAN
                        Let’s just hear him out. 

           They make their way to Marty’s booth.

                                 MARTY
                        Hey, I ordered everyone the sausage 
                        scramble. Best thing on the menu. 

           Sean and Kim slide into the booth. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Sean, Kim...this is private 
                        detective Jim Clemente. 

           Jim extends his hand - toothpick still in mouth. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        Big pleasure. Marty’s filled me in 
                        and this is a helluva lot more 
                        exciting than the cheaters and tax 
                        evaders I’m usually trailing. 
                                 KIMBERLY
                             (rudely)
                        Eat already, Jim?

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        Excuse me?
                             (realizing)
                        Oh, the toothpick.

           Sean nudges her. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE (CONT’D)
                        I’m an ex-smoker. Since I quit I 
                        find it helpful to have something 
                        in my mouth. Tidy up my oral 
                        fixation.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Sorry. I’m just a little punchy 
                        with all that’s going on. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        I’m a hard person to offend.
                             (claps his hands)
                        So, you tell anyone else?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        We called the FBI.  

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        Lemme guess...they blew you off. 

                                 SEAN
                        They told us to come back with 
                        something more substantial. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                             (sarcastic as fuck)
                        That’s our government. Working hard 
                        to keep its citizens safe. 

                                 MARTY
                        Fuck the feds. Jim’s got a real eye 
                        for detail. If he can’t nail these 
                        fuckers to the wall, no one can. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Great. The Sherlock Holmes of 
                        racism. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        I like this one. Reminds me of my 
                        daughter. Listen, I’m good at 
                        squeezing into tight spots, and 
                        getting my nose filthy with foul 
                        scents. What we need to be focused 
                        on is putting together a narrative. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JIM CLEMENTE (CONT'D)
                        One with enough pieces that the 
                        right people will take serious. I 
                        also wouldn’t mind a peek in that 
                        garage. 

                                 SEAN
                        That’s going to be a problem. They 
                        never leave it unattended. If one 
                        goes out, the other stays. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        That’s manageable, and we’ll go 
                        over some options for it. 

                                 MARTY
                        My idea is a BBQ. Have a few guests 
                        over, invite the Muslims-

                                 SEAN
                        Amir and Jahan Razi.

           Jim sparks up, writes that down. 

                                 MARTY
                             (defending his words)
                        Are they Muslim?

                                 SEAN
                        Well should I invite Laurie and 
                        Philip Weinberg, A.K.A. The Jews?

                                 MARTY
                        Your point’s not lost on me, Sean, 
                        but check it - you invite them out 
                        for food and drinks and Jim sneaks 
                        in and does his thing. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        I know cats that are jealous of my 
                        sneakin’ skills. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (rudely)
                        You “know” cats?

           Jim points at her, grinning. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        We’re gonna be good friends. 

                                 MARTY
                        We got two more days until the Veep 
                        arrives, so every minute counts.

           A waitress arrives and places four sausage scrambles in front 
           of them. Marty grabs his utensils. 
                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Hell yes. I’m about to fly my plane 
                        directly into this scramble.

           Sean and Kim stare at him. 

                                 SEAN
                        Do you hear yourself?

           He picks up a forkful and pretends its a plane puttering 
           toward his open mouth. He pushes the food inside, making a 
           small explosion sound. 

           The Harrison’s shake their heads. 

           EXT. GARAGE / AIRBNB - DAY

           CLOSE ON Sean’s hand knocking on the garage door. No answer. 
           He knocks again. Amir opens it a crack, seeming flustered. 

                                 AMIR
                        Sean, hello. 

                                 SEAN
                        Hey man. How’s it going?

           Amir shrugs - blocks Sean’s view of the inside.

                                 AMIR
                        It goes.

                                 SEAN
                        Right on. Right on. Hey, I wanted 
                        to fully apologize for the other 
                        day. I let fear conquer logic and-

                                 AMIR
                        Please, Sean. It’s fine. We were 
                        the ones who lied to you. 

                                 SEAN
                        OK. Sure. Yeah. Well, uh, 
                        Kim and I are going to have a 
                        little BBQ party tomorrow. Handful 
                        of friends. Nothing huge. Some good 
                        people so you and Jahan can just be 
                        yourselves. Refugees, not fake 
                        Americans. I mean...shit, 
                        everything I say comes out sounding 
                        terrible. 
                             (he breathes)
                        We’d love for you and Jahan to join 
                        us.

           Amir takes a long beat to think about the invite.
                                 AMIR
                        Tomorrow?

                                 SEAN
                        Yeah. Around 3. 

           Amir seems like he’s a tad bothered by it, but quickly 
           smiles. 

                                 AMIR
                        Yes. I am sure we will stop by. 

           Sean remains in the door frame, nodding.

                                 SEAN
                        We’ll be grilling some burgers and 
                        dogs. Classic American fare. 

           He remains. Amir starts to close the door on him. 

                                 AMIR
                        Must get back to prayer. 

                                 SEAN
                        Oh, yes! Sorry. See you tomorrow. 

           The door closes. Sean wipes the sweat off his palms and heads 
           into his house. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sean and Kim sit in their usual spot. Sean takes hits off his 
           pipe, Kim sucks down a bottle of water. 

           Amir and Jahan’s shadows pass by the window occasionally. 

           Silence. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        What if we’re wrong?

                                 SEAN
                        Then we never speak of this again. 
                        But...

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Yeah. I feel it too. Something’s 
                        up. 

                                 SEAN
                        Not just another one of my dreams 
                        and conspiracies?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Whatever it is, you’ve sucked me in 
                        again.
           She smiles.

                                 SEAN
                        I’m your drug dealer. And you need 
                        that fix. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Oh, do I?

                                 SEAN
                        I know you. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (getting serious)
                        It’s been nice...doing things 
                        together again. 

                                 SEAN
                        It has been. 

           They stare out the window.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Do you believe people can 
                        be...chosen?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        What? By like a deity?

                                 SEAN
                        I guess. By God. Or whatever. 

           Kim thinks a moment. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        No. I believe people think they 
                        are. Indoctrination or mental 
                        disorder. 

                                 SEAN
                        So if someone was having visions...

           Kim shrugs. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        They should probably see a doctor. 

           Sean nods. A small silence.

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        What time is it.

                                 SEAN
                        Nearly midnight.
                                 KIMBERLY
                        I think we take this show to the 
                        bed. You take first shift. 

                                 SEAN
                        Be right there. 

           She ruffles his hair and walks out. Something is reigniting 
           between them. Sean smiles, then stares out the window. 

           The garage’s window curtain parts slightly. Sean dips low. 
           Someone is looking back at him. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

           Kim lies on her side, away from Sean, trying to sleep but 
           eyes open. 

           Sean sits up, half watching the window, half playing on his 
           phone. 

           The sound of the garage door opening causes them both to perk 
           up. 

           Out the window they watch as Amir and Jahan exit the garage 
           and peak over the neighbor’s fence, quiet and shady. 

           Amir gives a soft whistle. 

           Suddenly, Frank the pit bull appears, barking his head off! 
           BARK! BARK!

           Jahan tosses something in the yard. The dog grabs it. 
           Swallows. A treat!

           Jahan continues to feed the mutt, keeping it quiet, while 
           Amir uses a flat piece of chipboard - leaning it on the other 
           side of the fence like a small SLIDE. 

           A treat is placed on the wood, and Frank lumbers up it to 
           devour the deliciousness. Another treat is placed near the 
           top. He follows. 

           Jahan backs up and begins to leave a TRAIL OF TREATS toward 
           the garage door. Frank hops over the fence and gobbles them 
           up. Jahan enters the garage - Frank follows. 

           Amir grabs the piece of wood, enters the garage, and closes 
           the door. 

                                 SEAN
                             (realizing)
                        Skillet...do you think they also 
                        have Skillet? 
                                 KIMBERLY
                        Sean..what are they doing with 
                        these animals?

           Silence. 

           Sean and Kim grip each other as fear grips them right back. 

           They wait...and wait...and...

           A FLASH OF BLUE LIGHT blasts through the garage window - 
           orange and white sparks accompany. A low rumble. 
           Then...darkness. 

           The Harrison’s hold each other tighter. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        Sean.

                                 SEAN
                        Yeah?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I’m scared. 

                                 SEAN
                        Don’t be. If they are terrorists 
                        they won’t want to blow their cover 
                        by hurting us. 

           She looks up at him. 

           He looks deep into her eyes. Sparks fly. He leans down and 
           gently kisses her on the lips. 

           Kim reaches up and takes his face in her hands - they melt 
           into each other as they fall back on the bed. Clothes quickly 
           shed as hands wander feverishly up and down each other. 

           Straddling him, Kim guides her husband inside her as their 
           breathing accelerates. This feels dangerous and new - yet old 
           and familiar. The best of both worlds. 

           Breaking the moment briefly, Kim thinks of something. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Wait, wait. Turn around.

           Sean is confused - then he looks out the window and gets it.

                                 SEAN
                        Oh yeah. Good idea. 
           Sean grips onto Kim and spins around so she can continue to 
           ride on top while keeping an eye on the garage - their secret 
           mission making the sex that much hotter. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           CREAK. CREAK. CREAK. 

           EXT. WASTELAND - DREAM

           Amir lies dead on the cracked earth of the wasteland - eyes 
           open and glassy.  

           Kim stands next to Sean (who sits on the ground), both 
           staring at Amir’s body. 

           Amir abruptly rises at the waist and sits up, staring at 
           them. 

                                 AMIR
                        It’s not a bomb. 

           He smiles - blood pours out of his mouth. 

           From behind Sean and Kim...SINGING IN FARSI. 

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                             (singing; Farsi)
                        Wise men say
                        Only fools rush in...

           Kim and Sean turn to find Jahan, standing a few yards away 
           and singing. 

                                 JAHAN
                             (singing; Farsi)
                        But I can’t help
                        Burning in Hell with you

           Suddenly, Kim and Sean’s hand ERUPT INTO FLAMES. They hold 
           them up, screaming as the fire eats its way down their wrists  
           and covering their bodies. 

           Jahan smiles, showing us the STUB she had for a tongue - 
           impossible to sing with. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           KIM’S EYES FLING OPEN. She slowly sits up, clutching her 
           chest from the dream. 

           Sean looks over at her from his sitting position on watch. 
                                 SEAN
                        Morning.

           She looks over at him, still coming around. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        We have to stop them. 

           Sean leans over and plants a warm kiss on her lips. 

                                 SEAN
                        We will. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Kim mixes a large potato salad while Sean stares out the 
           window (through the affixed mirror) sipping a beer. 

           KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK.

           The front door. Sean and Kim share a look.

           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Sean opens to the door to reveal his neighbor, GRETCHEN - a 
           middle-aged divorcee with a little extra weight and red eyes 
           from crying. 

                                 SEAN 
                        Hey, Gretchen. Everything okay?

                                 GRETCHEN 
                        Have you seen Frank?

           Sean does his best to act natural. 

                                 SEAN
                        No. He’s missing? 

                                 GRETCHEN
                        He can’t get out of the yard. The 
                        fence is too tall. 

                                 SEAN
                        I’m sorry. I’ll keep my eyes 
                        peeled. 

           Gretchen stares - distraught. Her best friend gone. 

                                 GRETCHEN 
                        He’s a good dog. I know his barking 
                        annoys you but...he’s a good dog. 
                                 SEAN
                        I’ll keep my eyes peeled. I 
                        promise. 

           The sad, little woman nods, turns and walks off the porch. 
           Sean exhales and closes the door. 

           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Kim leans against the counter frowning when he returns. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I feel bad. 

                                 SEAN
                        Hey, for all we now Frank’s having 
                        a great time in there.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        You don’t believe that. 

                                 SEAN
                        No. I don’t. 

           He moves close to her, taking her hands in his to comfort 
           her.

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        But we’ll know soon. If Clemente is 
                        as good as he likes to brag he is, 
                        we should have enough evidence 
                        after the BBQ. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Is it just me, or does Clemente 
                        have a severely punchable face? 

                                 SEAN
                        He reminds me of a B-movie 
                        detective. 

           Kim laughs. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        That is exactly what he is. 

           They share a smile - then a small kiss. 

           Kim gets back to her potato salad. Sean watches her a moment, 
           feeling good, then turns his attention back to the garage. 

           EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER

           A dozen or so white people (one black couple) mingle in the 
           backyard. 
           Sean, Kim, Marty, and Jim Clemente hover together in their 
           own corner, waiting for the guests of honor to come out of 
           the garage.

                                 MARTY
                        Just go knock on the door.

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        Bad idea. Let them emerge on their 
                        own. Less suspicious. 

                                 MARTY
                        What if they never emerge?

           Suddenly, the garage door opens, and Amir and Jahan exit and 
           look around at the BBQ in full swing. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Look alive boys. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        See you on the other side. 

           Jim breaks away from them and wanders into the crowd. 

           Sean waves at Amir and Jahan. They smile back, head to them.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Marty, how ‘bout you pretend to be 
                        mute. 

                                 MARTY
                        You’d like that. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Very much. 

           The couple arrive. 

                                 SEAN
                        Glad you guys could make it. 

                                 AMIR
                        Seemed a crime to stay shut in on a 
                        beautiful day. 

                                 SEAN
                        This is Marty. He turned that 
                        garage into the palace you’re 
                        currently staying in. 

           Marty extends his paw - overly friendly.

                                 MARTY
                        Sean’s been blabbing away about the 
                        real nice couple renting the place.  
                        Honored to finally meet you. 
           Sean is a bit nervous with Marty’s exuberance. 

                                 AMIR
                        A pleasure, Marty. 

           A SQUIRREL bounds across the yard. Jahan’s eyes grow bright 
           as she follows it in awe - like she’s never seen one before.

                                 MARTY
                        Got a four-year-old makes that face 
                        every time he sees a squirrel. Glad 
                        to see the wonder of God’s creation 
                        remains with adulthood. 

           Jahan touches Amir, happy to have seen the critter. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                             (to Amir)
                        Hey, listen, you ever played 
                        cornhole?

           Amir looks strangely at him?

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        It ain’t nothing dirty. Come on, 
                        you can be on my team. 

           He leads Amir away from the garage to a strategically set up 
           game of cornhole - two wood pieces, holes, and beanbags. 

           Sean looks at Jahan.

                                 SEAN
                        Jahan, want to be my partner? 

           She shakes her head politely. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (to Jahan)
                        Maybe you’d help me in the kitchen 
                        with the punch?

           Jahan nods and follows Kim into the house. 

           Sean finds Jim in the crowd and gives him a nod. Jim nods 
           back, then slinks over to the garage. 

           He tries the door. LOCKED. Pulls out a small set of lock 
           picks and quickly gets inside. 

           Sean’s so nervous he suddenly realizes he hasn’t taken a 
           breath in a bit. He inhales, then wanders over to the 
           cornhole game in progress. 

           Marty is teaching Amir the basics. A young, hip white couple 
           are their opponents. 
                                 MARTY
                        Then we just add up the score of 
                        each round until someone hits 21. 
                        Simple. 

                                 AMIR
                        Yes. Simple. 

           Sean looks back at the garage - nervous. 

           INT. GARAGE / AIRBNB - CONTINUOUS

           Jim Clemente looks around the tidy little space, takes a 
           large sip from his drink, then quietly starts snooping. 

           Jim opens the drawers. Empty. Empty. Empty. Notebook. Jim 
           takes out his phone and flips a few pages - all in Farsi. He 
           fires off some photographs - comes across a crude sketch. A 
           small BOX WITH A DOME covering it. He takes a picture. 

           Jim notices the laptop on the bed and opens it. It’s off. He 
           powers it up. While he waits...

           He notices the CLOCK on the wall frozen at “4:14.” Wandering 
           over, he taps it and it begins to work again. He checks his 
           watch, then pushes the big hand forward - resetting the time.

           He checks out the closet. Feeling around the top shelf his 
           hands fall on something near the back. He pulls out...

           A handheld device put together by salvaged parts - gun-like 
           in appearance but wider near the tip. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        You’re not a garage door opener.

           He takes a picture. Puts it back. Looks down.

           A cardboard tube. 

           He opens the top and slides out the blueprints. His eyes 
           bounces around every detail - eyeing the text in Farsi. 

           He snaps a picture - rolls it back up, places it in the 
           closet. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The blinds of the kitchen window are CLOSED. Kim stands over 
           Jahan as she pours ingredients into a large punch bowl. She 
           seems to be enjoying the process. 
                                 KIMBERLY
                        Looking good. Now dump about a 
                        quarter of the bottle of vodka.

           Jahan looks at Kim, then points to the bottle. Kim nods. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        That’ll get our guests good and 
                        loopy. 

           Jahan begins to pour. Kim notices something on the back of 
           her hijab. Two, small RED SPLOTCHES. 

           Jahan feels her presence and turns. Kim grows nervous. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        Uh, you have...a stain on the back 
                        of your...

           Jahan pulls the loose fabric of her hijab to her eyes and 
           sees the spots. She grows a little embarrassed. 

           She mimics eating something small for Kim. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        Strawberry?

           Jahan points at her. Correct. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got something that will take 
                        that right out. 

           She turns and gets under the sink, finding a bottle of stain 
           remover. When she stands and turns back, she gasps. 

           Jahan has removed her hijab. The left side of her head is 
           sparse with hair, instead giving dominance to knotted, BURNT 
           FLESH. Her ear is pressed in, melted. 

           Jahan lowers her face, apologizing for her appearance. Kim 
           jumps into damage control. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        No, Jahan, I am so sorry I reacted 
                        that way. I wasn’t...I didn’t 
                        expect...

           Nothing she says will do. Instead she takes the hijab, smiles 
           and sets in on the counter - her back to Jahan. 

           Jahan returns to her job making the punch. Kim looks over at 
           her - notices something else. Something strange on the back 
           of Jahan’s head. 
           A TATTOO. An UPSIDE BARCODE - the extending lines reaching 
           up, like tall buildings. A series of numbers resting on the 
           short lines: 072817  503

           Kim quickly turns back to her task, afraid to get caught 
           staring. 

           EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Amir tosses a bean bag and SINKS IT IN THE HOLE. Marty claps 
           his hands and laughs. 

                                 MARTY
                        Man-o-man, I chose the right 
                        partner. 

           Sean nods, then looks back at the garage. 

           INT. GARAGE / AIRBNB - CONTINUOUS

           The toilet flushes. 

           Jim steps out of the bathroom, he eyes a plate of fruit on 
           the small kitchenette counter. Oranges, grapes, and 
           strawberries. A large FOLDER next to it. 

           He opens it. Slides out photos and documents of the Vice 
           President of the United States, and Mayor King. A folder full 
           of research. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        Making this real easy, assholes. 

           Jim snaps a picture. 

           Then...he spots the large, black TRUNK shoved in a corner. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE (CONT’D)
                        That’s certainly big enough for a 
                        dog and a cat.

           He listens to the party outside. He goes toward the window to 
           check on how clear the coast is. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Kim is about to spray the spots on the hijab when she pauses, 
           staring at what could potentially be more evidence. Instead 
           of spraying, she wets a paper towel and dabs at it, 
           transferring some of the red to it. 

           Jahan waits patiently. She looks out the kitchen window at 
           the garage...then notices a set of WHITE FINGERS as they part 
           the curtains - someone in her space peering out. 
           Kim pockets the paper towel, then turns to Jahan only to 
           discover the back door swinging shut. Jahan is gone. 

           EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Amir sinks the winning shot. Marty cheers! The other team 
           smiles and shakes hands. 

           Sean notices Jahan walking quickly toward the garage, Kim 
           exits the house in a panic, holding her hijab. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Wait, your scarf...hat...Hijab! 
                        Jahan, Jahan! 

                                 SEAN
                             (to himself)
                        Shit. 

           He looks over at Marty, helpless. 

           Jahan gets closer to the garage. Kim’s pleas not working. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                             (quietly)
                        Fuck, Marty. 

           Marty looks down at the bean bag in his hand - makes a 
           decision. He rears back and tosses it hard, SMACKING Jahan in 
           the back of the head. 

           She stumbles forward, then turns with a confused look, her 
           burnt face shocking everyone. 

           Amir grabs Marty in anger. 

                                 AMIR
                        Why did you hit her?

                                 MARTY
                        Dude, I am so sorry. I...uh...

           Sean watches as Jim slips out of the garage. Locks it, and 
           blends back into the BBQ. He relaxes. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        I’m an idiot. Saw a bee on her and 
                        the first thing I think to do is 
                        hit her with a bean bag. Good news 
                        is the bee is gone. 

           Amir stares at him, annoyed and gripping him tight. 

           Finally, he lets go of Marty and goes to Jahan, putting his 
           arm around her and leading her into the garage. 
           Everyone awkwardly attempts to shuffle back into party mode. 

           Jim approaches. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        Well, that got the blood pumpin’. 

                                 SEAN
                        Anything?

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        Lots of things. Found a notebook 
                        with some possible bomb sketches. A 
                        dossier on the Veep and the mayor. 
                        Some high-end technology stuff. 
                        Star Trek looking device - my guess 
                        a tracker or remote detonator of 
                        sorts but I don’t know. Tech I’ve 
                        never seen.  

           He shows them the picture on his phone. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Oh my God...

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        Shit, and you know those blueprints 
                        you found written in Farsi?

           Jim shows them his phone that has Google translator loaded - 
           Farsi to English: GROUND ZERO. 

                                 SEAN
                        Je-sus.

           Kim pulls the spotted fabric from her pocket, hands it to 
           Jim. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Possible blood on the hijab. 

           He takes it. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                             (overly-excited)
                        Fantastic.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        What about Skillet? And the dog?

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        Fart in the wind, except...
                             (building drama)
                        There is that trunk. That big, 
                        black trunk. 
                                 KIMBERLY
                        You think they chopped them up!?

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        I think there’s a trunk. 

           He gives her a sly smile. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE (CONT’D)
                        We have a lot of pieces here 
                        people, and not a lot of time. 

                                 SEAN
                        So we what? Contact the FBI again? 
                        Call the police?

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        Local Po? You want the bad guys to 
                        win? No, everyone keep being cool. 
                        I have a guy. Once I’ve verified 
                        what we got here it’ll all be over. 

                                 SEAN
                        So we’re supposed to trust you?

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                             (smiles)
                        You’re supposed to trust me. Enjoy 
                        your BBQ. 

           Jim wanders off - thinking he’s a hero. Sean looks at the 
           punch.

                                 SEAN
                        How strong is that?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Raise the dead strong. 

                                 SEAN
                        Good. 

           He ladles a large cupful. 

           EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT

           Police begin the procedure of blocking off streets. Prepping 
           for the arrival of the Vice President of the United States.

           EXT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Sean and Kim load a few SUITCASES into the back of their SUV, 
           continuously looking over at the back gate. 
                                 KIMBERLY
                        Why hasn’t Jim called yet?

           Sean lifts another suitcase into the popped open back. 

                                 SEAN
                        He will. 

           Sean closes the back of the SUV. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Sean...last night I dreamed we 
                        failed. 

           He turns to her with wide eyes. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        Everything was just a wasteland.

                                 SEAN
                        Kim...I have the same dreams. Marty 
                        called it a premonition. Something-

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Warning us. 

                                 SEAN
                        ...choosing us. 

                                 AMIR (O.C.)
                        Evening.

           Sean and Kim jump a little, then laugh it off when they turn 
           and see Amir staring at them in front of the back gate. 

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        Apologies. 

           Sean heads toward him. 

                                 SEAN
                        No worries. I was on my way to talk 
                        to you actually.  

           He stops in front of Amir, trying to play it cool. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        First off, I’m so sorry about 
                        today. With the bees and the-

           Amir holds up his hand. 

                                 AMIR
                        It is nothing. Jahan was just a 
                        little spooked. And a little 
                        embarrassed. Her appearance and-
                                 SEAN
                        Yes...sorry.

           Kim arrives at Sean’s side. An awkward pause falls over them. 

                                 AMIR
                        Are you going somewhere?

                                 SEAN
                        Yes. Uh, Kim’s sister-

                                 KIMBERLY
                        She’s sick. Nothing sudden. She’s 
                        been sick awhile, but she’s-

                                 SEAN
                        She lives a few hours south of here-

                                 KIMBERLY
                        We’re going to stay with my dad for 
                        a few days. Visit her in the 
                        hospital. 

                                 AMIR
                        I am so sorry. Very sorry. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Thank you. 

                                 SEAN
                        I realize you and Jahan leave 
                        tomorrow. Just wanted to say it’s 
                        been a real pleasure and if you 
                        would...

           He digs into his pocket and pulls out a single, silver KEY. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Just put door and gate keys on our 
                        kitchen table and lock the bottom 
                        lock from the inside on your way 
                        out. 

           Amir stares at the key in Sean’s hand. Finally, he takes it. 

                                 AMIR
                        Of course. 
                             (to Kim)
                        I will pray for your sister. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Thank you. 

           Another awkward pause. Sean claps his hands together. 
                                 SEAN
                        OK. We should head out. The best of 
                        luck to you both. Maybe we grab a 
                        beer...or a tea some day soon.

                                 AMIR
                        Maybe we do. 

           The men shake hands. Kim stumbles a bit, then gives Amir a 
           hug. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Take care. 

           The Harrison’s turn and head for their SUV. Amir watches at 
           the gate. 

           INT. HARRISON CAR - CONTINUOUS

           They close the doors. 

                                 SEAN
                             (through his teeth)
                        He’s still watching us. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                             (through her teeth)
                        So drive away, dear. 

           EXT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Sean starts the car, pulls out of the driveway, and vanishes 
           up the street. 

           Amir remains a beat longer than is comfortable. He looks down 
           at the key. Finally, he returns to the garage. 

           INT. HARRISON CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Both Sean and Kim breathe out hard and heavy. 

                                 SEAN
                        Were we obvious?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        No. No. We were fine. We were 
                        great. 

                                 SEAN
                        Didn’t feel great. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        No, it didn’t...but here we are. 
                                 SEAN
                        Yeah. OK. 

           They drive in silence. 

           Sean makes a turn, then starts to look around. Suddenly...

           His headlights pour over Marty who leans against the back of 
           his pick-up truck. 

           Sean pulls the SUV in behind him and cuts the engine. 

           EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Sean and Kim exit, Marty waiting patiently. 

                                 MARTY
                        Were you obvious?

           Sean and Kim look at each other. 

                                 SEAN
                        No. We were great. 

                                 MARTY
                        All right. Hop in.

           He goes to the driver’s side and slides in the truck. Kim 
           steps up into the trucks flatbed, then helps Sean up. When 
           they are settled, Marty puts the truck in drive and they 
           creep off down the road - leaving the SUV behind. 

           EXT. BACK OF PICK-UP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Sean and Kim sit in the back, the warm Seattle night kissing 
           their faces, blowing their hair as they rumble down the dark 
           streets. 

           After a moment of silence...

                                 KIMBERLY
                        What happens after? 

                                 SEAN
                        What do you mean?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        With us. Sean, before this mess we 
                        were done. The thought of giving us 
                        another shot didn’t seem like an 
                        option. 

                                 SEAN
                        Things have changed.
                                 KIMBERLY
                        Have they? Or is this just a danger 
                        high? Something we’ll come down 
                        from when it’s over. 

                                 SEAN
                        I love you. 

           She looks at him, unsure how to respond. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Kim, I love you. 

           Before she is able to respond, the truck slows, then stops. 
           Marty gives a low whistle from inside. 

           His door opens and he exits, helping Kim out of the back 
           first, then Sean. 

           All three take a moment to stare out at the field they are in 
           front of, and beyond that...

           Sean and Kim’s BACKYARD. 

           Marty hands the couple each a set of hefty, yellow goggles. 

                                 MARTY
                        Night vision, kids. 

           He straps his own to his head and adjusts a few knobs. 

                                 SEAN
                        You have three sets of night vision 
                        goggles?

                                 MARTY
                        I got seven. 

           Marty marches forward quietly, creeping low through the 
           field. He arrives at a tree stump, gets low then waves Sean 
           and Kim over. 

           Giving each other another look, they quickly join Marty. All 
           three get low and stare at the back of the house - the garage 
           in plain sight. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        This was a good plan, Kim. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        This was your plan, Marty. 

                                 MARTY
                        Just trying to be inclusive. 

           They all watch. Wait. Breathe. 
                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Stay sharp. If they leave to plant 
                        that bomb we gotta follow em, so we 
                        know where to point the 
                        authorities.  

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Every little bit, I guess.

                                 MARTY
                        That’s right. Easy to arrest a 
                        couple martyrs, difficult to get 
                        them to tell you where the boom 
                        boom is. Settle in. 

           They all go quiet, staring at the garage. 

                                                          CUT TO: LATER

           Everyone remains in the same position, however it’s clear 
           they are growing restless. 

                                 SEAN
                             (to Marty)
                        Seriously, any word from Clemente?

                                 MARTY
                        Oh, yeah. Gotta a thumbs up emoji.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        What’s that mean?

                                 MARTY
                        I assume shit’s in motion. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        You assu-

                                 MARTY
                        Look alive!

           The garage door opens and all fall silent, pressing their 
           bodies to the ground. 

           Amir immerges, followed by Jahan. They step out in the lawn 
           and have a look around - each holding a GUN-SIZED PIECE OF 
           TECH that they wave about. 

                                 SEAN
                        What are those things?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Shhh.

           They watch as their Airbnb guests slowly approach the back 
           door of the house that leads to the kitchen. 
           Amir uses Sean’s key. The door opens. They vanish inside. 

                                 MARTY
                        Now’s our chance.

           He stands. Sean and Kim scramble to their feet. 

                                 SEAN
                        Our chance for what?

                                 MARTY
                             (mocking)
                        Sorry about Seattle, America. We 
                        decided to wait for the authorities 
                        instead of take action.   

           Marty doesn’t wait for a reaction. He begins to creep through 
           the field toward the backyard. 

           Kim looks at Sean. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        They’re in our house Sean. Why?

           She follows Marty. Sean remains a moment. Takes a deep 
           breath, then catches up to them. 

           They arrive at the property line - voices low. 

                                 MARTY
                        I’mma check out the garage. You two 
                        creep on the windows. Keep an eye 
                        on them. They make their way back 
                        you text me. 

           Before they can argue, he swiftly makes his way to the garage 
           - looks around, then quietly ducks inside. 

                                 SEAN
                        Well... 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Well.

           Kim makes her way toward the house. Sean right behind her. 

           EXT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - PATIO - CONTINUOUS

           They duck low under the patio window, then carefully peek 
           inside. Dark. Quiet. 

           They move along the back toward the sliding glass door, then 
           press themselves against the house when a small BEAM OF LIGHT 
           flashes out the glass. 

           When it is gone they peer around the corner. 
           Inside they see two shadows searching the room. The tech in 
           their hands acts as a flashlight, but it’s so much more. 
           Several blinking lights throb in the dark - a steady pace. 

           Sean tugs at Kim - whispers in her ear.

                                 SEAN
                        Those must be the tracker devices 
                        Clemente showed us.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        So what are they tracking?

           Amir and Jahan make their way out of the room and down the 
           hall. 

           Sean motions for Kim to go around front. 

           EXT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - FRONT - MOMENTS LATER

           They slink around the house and head for the front porch. 

           Through the window they watch Amir and Jahan wave their tech 
           around, illuminating the photographs on the wall. 

           They arrive at the basement door, open it, and descend. 

                                 SEAN
                        The hell are they looking for?

           Kim motions for him to follow her this time, and they creep 
           over to the small window at ground level that peeks into the 
           basement. 

           They watch as the shadows wave their tech around - the lights 
           remaining in a steady pulse. 

           Sean’s phone vibrates. A text from MARTY:

           You fuckers need to see this. 

           Sean shows the text to Kim. She nods. They rise slowly and 
           head toward the garage. 

           EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Sean and Kim enter the gate. All is quiet. Marty exits the 
           garage. 

                                 SEAN
                        They’re in the basement. 

                                 MARTY
                        Then you better see this before 
                        they ain’t.  
           INT. GARAGE / AIRBNB - CONTINUOUS

           Without saying a word, Marty closes the door, then moves to 
           the computer on the bed. 

           Sean and Kim notice the trunk has been pried open. They 
           freeze - gasp in horror. 

           Black and sleek. The size of a large cooler, but the shape of 
           a tear drop. Multi-colored lights throb quietly over its 
           surface, while a small, spinning blue light circles the 
           mechanics inside. A DEVICE of deadly proportions. 

                                 SEAN
                             (in shock)
                        Jesus. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Marty, this thing is active. 

                                 MARTY
                        Yeah, right?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Shouldn’t we get the Hell out of 
                        here?

                                 MARTY
                        We will.

           Marty taps a THUMB DRIVE plugged into the computer’s port. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        But first...found this gold brick. 
                        These cock-suckers gotta plan-

                                 SEAN
                        Yeah, no shit. So let’s call the 
                        cops before this thing goes off. 

                                 MARTY
                        You didn’t let me finish, Sean. 
                        These cock-suckers got a 
                        plan...looks like you’re being set 
                        up. 

           Marty spins the laptop around to show Sean and Kim the 
           screen. 

           Numerous FOLDERS labeled with names. One in particular stands 
           out. The one labeled: THE HARRISONS.

           The husband and wife share a nervous look. 

           Marty double clicks the folder and it opens up to photos and 
           documents. Marty begins to scroll through a series of candid 
           pictures both Sean and Kim were unaware were being taken.  
           - Sean and Kim arguing through the kitchen window.

           - Sean drinking in the basement.

           - Kim leaving for work in the morning.

           - The two of them asleep on each other in the kitchen. 

           - Kim throwing darts at the bar.

           - Kim snooping around the Space Needle.

           - Kim talking to the security guard at the Needle.

                                 SEAN
                        They’ve been watching us?

                                 MARTY
                        Goes way deeper, my friend. 

           Marty pulls up a document with Sean and Kim’s INTERNET 
           BROWSER HISTORY. A few HIGHLIGHTED searches including Sean’s, 
           ITEMS USED FOR BOMB MAKING. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        The Muslim's got everything. Phone 
                        records, credit card statements. 
                        These assholes have your high 
                        school report cards. 

           Marty reaches into a folder and pulls out a folded piece of 
           paper - hands it to Sean. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Found this with the bomb. 

           Sean takes it - unfolds it. It’s a small POSTER. 

           In REDS and YELLOWS, the poster shows rows of white men 
           standing in formation - all holding SPACE NEEDLES as if they 
           were GUNS. The text is bold - a call to arms: STAND WITH US, 
           BEFORE WE FALL AGAIN.

                                 SEAN
                        This is a propaganda poster for a 
                        war that doesn’t exist.  

                                 MARTY
                        That’s cause they’re about to start 
                        it. A goddamn race war, buddy, and 
                        they’re pinning it on us. 

           Everyone goes silent. 

           Suddenly, the back door of the house opens - the hinges 
           alerting our heros.
           All duck and peek out the garage window. They watch Amir and 
           Jahan step out. They wander out to the middle of the 
           backyard, continuing to wave their tech. 

           They stop short and stare out at the Space Needle. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        We got to get out of here. 

                                 SEAN
                        They’re right there.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        They’re going to be right here any 
                        second. 

           He agrees. 

           Kim quietly turns the door knob and slinks outside. 

           EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Kim, followed by Sean, followed by Marty, sneak out as Amir 
           and Jahan stare at the Needle - their backs to them. 

           One steady foot in front of the other they make their way to 
           the kitchen’s back door. 

           Kim turns the knob and cracks it open silently. All is going 
           well until...

           Marty’s foot kicks the cat’s food bowl, spilling the pellets 
           everywhere. 

           The sound echoes down the lawn. Amir and Jahan turn on a dime 
           - stare right at them. 

                                 SEAN
                        Run...run now!

           Amir and Jahan head directly at them in a full on sprint. 

           Sean, Kim, and Marty rush inside. 

           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Through the kitchen and into...

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - HALL/FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Down the hall, they race and into the foyer. 
           Kim fumbles with the locks on the door while Sean rushes her. 
           Finally she gets it, flings it open to reveal...

           Jahan standing in their way - the strange tech in her hand 
           like a gun.  

           Everyone turns, only to find Amir turning the corner - 
           stopping a few feet from them, also pointing his tech.  

           Silence falls over the old house. 

           Marty gives them a slow clap - ready to tango. 

                                 MARTY
                        Kudos you towel-head mother 
                        fuckers. Kudos. How long this plan 
                        take you? Ten years? And ol’ Marty 
                        unraveled it in just a few days.

           Amir steps cautiously forward, the hallway floor groans under 
           all the weight. 

                                 AMIR
                             (American accent)
                        We won’t let this happen. 

                                 MARTY
                        Your accent’s for shit. 

                                 AMIR
                        Because I’m also American. 

           Jahan steps into the house. Kim pushes against Sean. 

           NOTE: Amir has no accent from this point on. 

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        What you think you’re about to 
                        do...it’s not noble. It’s not 
                        right.

                                 SEAN
                        Funny how we think the same thing 
                        about you. 

           Marty steps up to Amir. 

                                 MARTY
                        Not too mention, three of us and 
                        two of you. And as a card carrying 
                        member of the NRA, I’m fairly 
                        certain those glorified flashlights 
                        don’t fire bullets.  
                                 AMIR
                             (desperate)
                        The future can be more than just 
                        war. 

           Marty grabs Amir by the collar and slams him against the 
           wall.

                                 MARTY
                        No, sir. We don’t negotiate with 
                        terrorists. 

           The floor CREAKS. Jahan moves closer, concerned for her 
           brother. 

                                 SEAN
                        What are you doing, Marty?

                                 MARTY
                        You two git. I might linger back 
                        and have some-

           Suddenly, the floor below them CAVES IN. 

           Sean and Kim are swallowed up into the basement. 

           Jahan tries to step back but fumbles forward. Amir breaks 
           loose of Marty and leaps toward the opening, grabbing hold of 
           both her wrists. 

                                 AMIR
                        I got you.

           He attempts to pull her back up to his side when Marty grabs 
           the back of Amir, holding him tight, then presses his boot 
           down on Amir’s arm, cutting his flesh on the lip of the hole. 

           Amir screams, his grip loosens, and he watches as his sister 
           PLUMMETS - her face staring up at him. 

           CRUNCH!

           She lands hard and solid on a broken wooden frame - pushing 
           through her back and out her chest. 

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        Jahan!

           Marty pushes him back, and slams his fist into Amir’s face. 

           Amir looks up - blood dripping from his nose. 

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                             (dark)
                        You fucking hick. 
                                 MARTY
                        You come onto our soil. Kill 
                        innocent lives because we don’t 
                        agree with your insanity.

                                 AMIR
                             (tears of anger)
                        We were born here.   

           Marty laughs. 

                                 MARTY
                        Yeah, well now you’re gonna die 
                        here.  

           He lunges at Amir, who rolls quickly out of the way, and back 
           onto his feet. 

           Marty reaches for him, but Amir scrambles into...

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Amir spots the fireplace poker and makes his way toward it. 
           Just as his fingers wrap around the metal shaft, Marty shows 
           up behind him, slamming him hard into the stone fireplace.

           Tossing Amir to the floor, Marty rips the poker from his 
           hands and leans into Amir’s neck with it - choking him. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Jahan is still, her eyes to the sky, blood on her chest. 

           Kim slides out from under a pile of wood and tile. She coughs 
           up a lung-full of dust, then looks around. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Sean?

                                 SEAN (O.C.)
                        I’m OK. I hope. 

           She sees a pile of wood shift near Jahan’s body, then an arm 
           toss some planks out of the way. 

           Sean sits up, checking himself over. Kim climbs up to him. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Anything broke?

                                 SEAN
                        Uh...no. Twisted maybe. Bruised 
                        definitely. 
                                 KIMBERLY
                        We don’t have much time. 

                                 SEAN
                        Call the cops. Call someone. 

           Kim takes out her phone but the screen is SCRAMBLED. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Shit.

           She shows it to Sean. He takes out his to the exact same 
           results. 

                                 SEAN
                        They don’t want us calling out. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        What do we do?

           THUD!

           Both look above them. 

                                 SEAN
                        Marty. 

           Kim helps Sean to his feet. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        OK. Let’s go get him. 

           He nods and they makes their way toward the stairs.

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Marty continues to choke Amir - his face turning purple. 

                                 MARTY
                        Blow up your own kind if ya want. 
                        But not mine!

           Amir is able to get both his feet under Marty’s chest. With a 
           swift and hard motion, he KICKS THEM BACK. 

           Marty stumbles fast off Amir and SLAMS into the sliding glass 
           door, SHATTERING IT, and rolling out into the darkness of the 
           yard. 

           Amir gasps for air as he pulls himself up. 
           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           He stumbles into the foyer and peers down at his sister. She 
           looks right back up at him - dead. 

           No time to wipe his tears - the basement door opens.

           Amir rushes off into the kitchen just as Sean and Kim exit.

                                 SEAN
                        Marty?

           They turn the corner into...

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The shattered glass door causes them both to freeze. 

                                 SEAN
                        Marty?

           Something shifts in the black of the night - just beyond the 
           shattered glass. 

           Then, Marty lumbers in, rubbing his neck. 

                                 MARTY
                        Fucker kicked me through the door. 

           Kim checks the cut on Marty’s neck.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, we friends now, Kimmy?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Seriously, are you OK?

                                 MARTY
                        Been through worse. Come one. We 
                        gotta end this. 

                                 SEAN
                        Let’s just go. Now.

           Marty turns, dead serious. 

                                 MARTY
                        He’s got a bomb in there, Sean. His 
                        sister is dead, and he’s trapped. 
                        He ain’t gonna wait for the cops. 
                        You wanna die running or fighting?

           Marty heads out of the room. 

           Sean looks to Kim. They stare for a moment, and then...
           She holds out her palm. He looks down at it, then slaps it. 
           They do their secret handshake one last time, each movement 
           sends stabbing pains through out their bruised bodies. 

           INT. HARRISON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Sean and Kim enter the kitchen. Marty is there, still as 
           stone. He holds out his finger, motioning for them to freeze.

           He points to something terrifying - reflecting in the MIRROR 
           on the cabinet door - a DARK SHADOW, waiting for them just 
           outside. Pressed against the house. 

           Marty gives them the “wait here” sign, then advances on the 
           window. The Shadow shifts. Marty quietly slides a large KNIFE 
           from the butcher’s block...holds...then LUNGES, swinging his 
           arm out the window and...

           ...curving it toward the wall of the house. The knife PLUNGES 
           into the Shadow’s chest. The Shadow SCREAMS.

                                 MARTY
                        Ha!

           Marty races out the kitchen door. 

           EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Marty bursts onto the yard, Sean and Kim right behind him. 

           Rushing up to the shadow to finish the job, Marty is mere 
           inches away when...

           BANG! 

           Marty stumbles back - a bullet hole in his stomach. He looks 
           up at The Shadow that shot him, shocked. 

           The Shadow shifts, its head finding the moonlight to 
           reveal...

           Jim Clemente. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        Oh fuck. Marty? 

           Marty falls to his knees. Sean goes to him, helping him 
           stand. Kim kneels down to Clemente. 

                                 SEAN
                        Marty-
                                 MARTY
                             (strained)
                        All good. Shit, Clemente...I’m so 
                        sorry man. 

           Marty stumbles. Sean catches him, lowering his large friend 
           to the ground to sit. 

                                 SEAN
                        There ya go. 

           Kim wraps her fingers around the knife handle sticking out of 
           Clemente’s chest. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                             (so much pain)
                        No...no leave it in. You’re not 
                        supposed to remove knives. I’ll 
                        bleed out. 

                                 MARTY
                        Christ, I am...I am so sorry. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        It’s fine...I mean it’s not 
                        but...help me up.

           Kim grabs his arm and helps him to his feet. He raises his 
           revolver, stabbed but still ready to fight. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE (CONT’D)
                        The shit in that notebook...the 
                        thing they built...it’s big. It’s 
                        strong. Nuclear strong. Sent 
                        everything I had to my buddy in the 
                        bureau. 

                                 SEAN
                        We gotta call the police.

                                 JIM CLEMENTE
                        Already on their way. 

           Suddenly, a light BLAZES TO LIFE through the garage window. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE (CONT’D)
                        But I don’t think we have the 
                        luxury of time. 

           Jim reaches down and pulls a smaller SECOND REVOLVER from his 
           ankle, hands it to Kim.

                                 JIM CLEMENTE (CONT’D)
                        You two are gonna be my shadow. 
                        When we get to the garage we’ll -
           He tries to take a step forward, but the pain cripples him. 
           He drops to his knees.  

                                 JIM CLEMENTE (CONT’D)
                        Shit. Marty. Marty, you son of a 
                        bitch...

           He looks up, notices Sean’s blank expression as he stares 
           down at the man in his arms. 

           Marty lies still, his eyes open. 

           Kim approaches, kneels down behind Sean, rubbing his back. 

                                 JIM CLEMENTE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Marty... I’m sss...

           Clemente falls face first to the ground. Dead.

           A metallic BANG from the garage. The light throbs through the 
           curtains. Sean’s eyes filled with anger. 

                                 SEAN
                        Up to us. 

           He pulls himself up, then reaches down and takes Clemente’s 
           gun out of his hand.

                                 KIMBERLY
                        OK.

           They stare at each other - close. Almost kissing when...

           A loud rumble shakes the garage, breaking their moment. 

           They turn and race toward the garage. They try the door. 
           Locked. 

           The hum from inside grows louder. 

           Sean slams his body against the wood. 

           CRACK!

           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The door busts off its hinges, and Sean tumbles into the room 
           bathed in a blue light. Kim steps in behind him, gun raised. 

           The lights on the device throb at an accelerated speed - the 
           spinning blue light whirring faster and faster. A COUNTER NOW 
           READS: “2:51”.

           Amir is nowhere to be found. 
                                 SEAN
                        Where’d he-

           Before he can finish, Amir bursts out from behind the door 
           and wraps his arms around Sean, struggling for the gun. 

           The two men stumble about while Kim aims her gun at Amir. 
           There’s too much movement. If she fires she could hit Sean. 

           Sean uses all his strength to point the gun at Amir, but his 
           enemy is strong, and to his dismay, Sean finds the barrel 
           creeping toward himself. 

           BLAM! BLAM!

           Amir squeezes Sean’s finger on the trigger twice, putting a 
           bullet in both Sean’s right and the left leg - incapacitating 
           him fully. 

           Releasing his grip on the gun, Sean falls back, unable to 
           stand. He hits the ground as Amir steps back and immediately 
           trains the gun on Sean’s head. 

           Kim gets a solid aim on Amir. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        STOP!

           He freezes. All three become statues in a stand-off as the 
           device continues to hum - the timer reading “2:20”. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        Turn off the bomb!

           Amir looks over at Kim with grave, furious eyes.  

                                 AMIR
                        Fuck you and your war! And fuck 
                        every powerful coward around this 
                        world who retaliates out of fear! 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Turn it off, Amir.

                                 AMIR
                        Whatever hateful ideology you hope 
                        to fulfill...this will go beyond 
                        what you imagined. There’s going to 
                        be nuclear bombs crisscrossing the 
                        sky all over again if you don’t 
                        stand down.

           Kim’s hands begin to shake. Amir’s finger tightens on the 
           trigger slightly. Sean lies on the ground, breathing heavily. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Turn off the bomb, no-
           Amir swings his arms toward her, ready to shoot. Kim reacts 
           faster. 

           BLAM!

           The bullet tags Amir in the chest. He stumbles back, then 
           stops - looks at her. Then...HE LUNGES!

           Before she can react, Amir grabs her wrist and pushes the gun 
           away from him. Her finger squeezes and...

           BLAM!

           A bullet TAGS THE DEVICE - creating a small HOLE where sparks 
           begin to fly. 

           Amir presses down on Kim, his weight taking her to the 
           ground. His hand slips around her neck - cutting off her air. 

           Kim looks over at Sean on the floor, then loosens her grip on 
           the gun. 

           Sean puts out his hand and it falls directly into his palm. 

           Kim’s eyes roll back and...

           BLAM!

           A bullet hits Amir in the back. He screams. 

           Kim rears back her legs and kicks him off with all she has. 
           Amir flops backward, bumping up against the bed. 

           Kim pushes herself up and rushes to her husband, dropping to 
           her knees. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        Sean-

                                 SEAN
                        We have to stop it.

           Amir coughs. Kim marches up to the wounded man as he spits up 
           blood. She grabs him by the collar and places her gun against 
           his head. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Turn it off. 

           Amir remains calm, his eyes made of ice. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t make me kill you-

                                 AMIR
                        You already killed all of us.
           TIMER: 1:52... 1:51...

           Amir peels his hand from his chest and stares his blood - a 
           sadness rolling over him.  

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        We couldn’t stop it. We couldn't 
                        stop you. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        We’re not the fucking terrorists 
                        here. YOU ARE!

                                 SEAN
                        We’re the ones trying to stop you 
                        from blowing up the city!

           Amir’s grows confused. 

                                 AMIR
                        I do not understand...you think...

           Amir’s eyes grow wide with sudden realization. 

           The device hums louder - the lights quickening their pulse.

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                             (defeated)
                        We looked everywhere. This is 
                        ground zero. This is where the bomb 
                        explodes. This is where World War 3 
                        begins. It has to be here. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Last chance, Amir. I mean it.

           He looks up at her, into her eyes - angry. 

                                 AMIR
                        We wasted all our time thinking you 
                        were part of it...but you weren’t. 
                        You were just two more ignorant 
                        assholes getting in the way of 
                        progress.  

           Kim stares him down, then...

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Fuck you. I’ll do it. 

           She goes to the device - feels around the edges of the panel, 
           but can’t figure it out. No wires or buttons. 

           The lights go from blue to red. 

                                 KIMBERLY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t get it open! I can’t...
           TIMER: 30... 29...

           She stands, looking around. Helpless. 

           Then, she rushes back to Sean and hooks him under the arms - 
           attempting to drag him out. 

                                 SEAN
                        What are you doing?

                                 KIMBERLY
                        We have to run.

                                 SEAN
                        I can’t. Kim, stop.

           She continues to pull him, but he’s too heavy. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        Kim! You have to leave me. 

           She stops, then swings around, kneeling low and looking into 
           his eyes. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Sean...

                                 SEAN
                             (sincerely)
                        I’ll only hold you back. Run. 

           She stares at him, tears filling her eyes. 

           TIME: 10.. 09....

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                             (tears dripping)
                        Please...run...

           She remains, looking into his eyes. She places her forehead 
           against his. 

           The device vibrates heavily. The clock on the wall STOPS - 
           5:03 a.m.

           Amir slide to his stomach and begins to pull himself toward 
           them, leaving a bloody trail behind. 

                                 AMIR
                        It’s not a bomb!

           The light bulb overhead BURSTS.

           Kim places her hands on Sean’s cheeks and slowly pulls him to 
           her. 
                                 KIMBERLY
                        I love you. 

           Their lips touch. They kiss deeply. 

           TIME: 3... 2...1...

           ZIP!

           A BLUE ORB shoots from the high-tech device and covers Sean 
           and Kim. One moment they are in the garage kissing, and the 
           next...

           They vanish in the blink of an eye. 

           Amir stares at the spot they once where - perplexed and dying 
           quickly. 

           He drags himself to the device and places his hand gently on 
           top of it - an old friend.

                                 AMIR
                             (weakly)
                        It’s not a bomb.

           A quiet moment, and then...

           SPARKS FLY from the BULLET HOLE in the device. Amir’s eyes 
           grow wide as he watches the machine malfunction and begin to 
           rumble. A horrific realization falls over him. 

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        But it’s just as powerful. 

           EXT. DOWNTOWN SEATTLE - EARLY MORNING

           The birds are starting to chirp. Early morning commuters just 
           getting on the road. 

           Then, off in the distance - somewhere in the suburban part of 
           the city...a TINY EXPLOSION OF LIGHT.

           The light is followed by bright RIPPLE of energy. That energy 
           quickly rolls over the land, heading fast and furiously 
           toward the downtown area...

           The Space Needle directly in its path as a white light BLINDS 
           US, leading us to...

           SILENCE. Then...

           CHYRON: 53 YEARS LATER
           INT. WASTELAND - 2072

           The very same wasteland in Sean and Kim’s dreams. Cracked 
           earth. Crumbling buildings. Howling winds.

           No signs of life, except...

           A familiar ORANGE CAT - SKILLET. He wanders about, sniffing 
           the air.

           We follow skillet for a bit as it stops every once in awhile 
           to investigate a toppled mailbox or an old, deflated car 
           tire. 

           Finally, the cat leads us to the only other life form in this 
           wasteland - FRANK THE PIT BULL. 

           Skillet freezes - arches his back and hisses. Frank tips his 
           head, then growls. And then...the chase begins! 

           The pit bull chases the cat through the dead lands, leading 
           us to a familiar sound...

           Creak. Creak. Creak. 

           Skillet leaps up onto the bent and charred Hushed Willow Rd. 
           Sign. Frank stops below and barks. 

           ZAP! 

           A BLUE ORB materializes near the sign. Both Skillet and Frank 
           watch as the orb unfolds itself, revealing Sean and Kim - 
           still locked in their kiss as the orb around them dissolves. 

           The hot, post-apocalyptic wind hits their bodies and they 
           break from the kiss, startled to still be alive, but confused 
           as to where they are. 

           Creak. Creak. Creak. 

           They stare at their old street sign swaying in the wind. 

           MEOW.

           Skillet the cat suddenly brushes up against Sean’s leg, 
           looking for attention. 

           He looks down at the orange creature standing on the cracked, 
           scorched earth. 

                                 SEAN
                        Skillet...?

           BARK! BARK! They look and find Frank the pit bull barking at 
           them. A sudden realization hits Sean and Kim.
                                 KIMBERLY
                        Oh my God...

           QUICK POP:

           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Sean and Kim sit up in bed as they watch Jahan lead Frank the 
           pit bull into the garage with treats. 

           Amir closes the door and...

           ZAP! The strange light goes off. 

           INT. WASTELAND - 2072 - BACK TO SCENE

           Sean and Kim notice the torn PROPAGANDA POSTER that hangs on 
           the metal pole of the street sign.

           QUICK POPS:

           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - GARAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Sean, Kim and, Marty look at the propaganda poster - rows of 
           white men standing in formation - all holding SPACE NEEDLES 
           as if they were GUNS: STAND WITH US, BEFORE WE FALL AGAIN.

                                 SEAN
                        This is a propaganda poster for a 
                        war that doesn’t exist.  

           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Amir places his spoon in the empty chili bowl.

                                 SEAN
                        You guys were hungry. 

                                 AMIR
                        Long trip. Feel like we haven’t 
                        eaten in decades.

           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Sean and Kim sit listening to Amir at the kitchen table.

                                 AMIR
                        Crickets don’t sing in a world with 
                        no songs.
           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - GARAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Amir lies on the ground, bleeding out, staring at the 
           Harrisons. 

                                 AMIR
                        This is where World War 3 begins. 

           INT. WASTELAND - 2072 - BACK TO SCENE

           Sean and Kim remain silent a moment more, in shock at the 
           decayed, scorched world around them.  

                                 SEAN
                             (at-a-loss)
                        They were real...the premonitions, 
                        they were...memories. 

                                 KIMBERLY
                        Sean...

           Sean turns and follows her gaze. Tears well in his eyes - the 
           site too much for him. 

                                 SEAN
                        Amir...was right. We got in the 
                        way. We...fucked it up.

           Tall buildings now skeletons of their former selves - many 
           crumbled and toppled over. Most notable amongst them is the 
           one we haven’t yet seen. A fallen, iconic giant. Rusted and 
           in pieces. 

           The Seattle Space Needle. 

           Kim links her fingers with Sean’s, as they stare at the 
           horror - at their future - together. 

                                                           CUT TO BLACK

           SILENCE.

           CHYRON: 53 YEARS AGO.

           Then we hear the sound of Amir’s voice over black.

                                 AMIR (V.O.)
                        My sister thinks it’s a big step 
                        forward for humanity when we let 
                        strangers sleep amongst us.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. HARRISON RESIDENCE - GARAGE - NIGHT

           Amir and Jahan, alive and well, stand across from Sean and 
           Kim, having just finished dinner (this is the same scene as 
           the opening - but from Amir/Jahan’s POV).

                                 KIMBERLY
                        I hadn’t ever thought about it like 
                        that. Far more poetic than “this 
                        mortgage won’t pay itself.” 

           Amir watches as Sean looks over at Kim, who looks away from 
           him - avoiding his eyes. 

           Jahan gives a Amir a look. He nods. 

                                 SEAN
                        Well, welcome to Seattle and have a 
                        good night. 

           Amir waves goodbye to Sean and Kim as they leave, then closes 
           the door. 

           They both peek through the window and watch them amble up to 
           their house. 

                                 AMIR
                        What do you think?

           Jahan shakes her head, unsure.

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        I know. Too boring. Too plain. But 
                        maybe that’s what makes the perfect 
                        terrorist. Average normal nobodies.  
                        And yet... this is ground zero. 
                        This very spot.

           Jahan nods, makes the motion with her fingers on her eyes 
           that they will WATCH THEM CLOSELY. 

           Amir moves to the window and gazes out at the standing Space 
           Needle in the distance. He takes out the triangular metal 
           from under his shirt. 

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        Strange to think in six days this 
                        will all be gone.  

           Jahan shakes her head. 

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        You’re right. Not this time. We 
                        know it’s here. We’ll find it.   
           Jahan opens the trunk to reveal the TIME MACHINE - quiet and 
           dark. She opens a panel on the side and presses a few buttons 
           - checking the system. 

           Two lights come on clean - one FLASHES. Jahan signs at her 
           brother. He looks over her shoulder. 

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        She’s overheating again.
                             (Thinks)
                        OK, let’s shut it down for now. 
                        She’s too powerful and I don’t want 
                        to risk of her malfunctioning 
                        before we can fix the ventilation. 

           Amir goes to the window and stares out. He spots Skillet the 
           cat stalking a squirrel in the yard. 

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        I’ll find us a test subject or two. 
                        Make sure it’s working properly and 
                        we can get back.  

           The cat pounces and the squirrel escapes. Amir smiles. 

           Amir turns away from the window. Jahan pats her brother 
           gently. He looks down at her.

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        We’ll stop this. We’ll find the 
                        bomb and stop this. And then go 
                        home to something beautiful.

           She makes a gesture with her hands from her heart.

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        I love you too.

           She smiles, pulls out a pack of cigarettes and heads for the 
           door. 

                                 AMIR (CONT’D)
                        You should remove your shoes. 
                        There’s actual grass out there. I 
                        hear it feels wonderful on your 
                        bare feet. 

           EXT. HARRISON HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Jahan wanders out in the night, enjoying the feeling of 
           actual grass under her feet. 

           She finds a spot in the middle of the yard and looks up at 
           the stars. She stays that way for a long moment, then slides 
           out a cigarette and LIGHTS IT. 
           She then refocuses her gaze on the house. She stares at Sean 
           through the sliding glass door. He seems to be staring right 
           back at her - menacing...knowing?

           She takes a long drag and continues to watch him. She watches 
           his every move. Her prime suspect.
