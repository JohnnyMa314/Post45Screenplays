                         BASED ON THE INCREDIBLE TRUE STORY

           SOARING THROUGH THE CLOUDS 

           Over majestic, evergreen mountains. Up on the horizon, a 
           cold, eerie light glows across a thick, grey line gutting the 
           forest valley...

           EXT. BORDER OF EAST GERMANY - NIGHT

           A mile wide stretch of bulldozed earth ringed by barbed wire, 
           Doberman pinchers, machine guns on trip-wires, and keen-eyed 
           BORDER GUARDS in WATCH TOWERS.

           This is the DEATH ZONE-- an extension of the Berlin Wall. The 
           deadly border divides the natural world into two sides.

           FOOTSTEPS navigate around “STOP! BORDER - NO CROSSING” signs.

           SUPER: April, 1976

           MICHAEL GARTENSCHLAGER, 32, wild hair, determined eyes, hides 
           behind trees, studying the Death Zone through binoculars. 
           Waiting for his moment.

           Guards change posts. This is it. Now or never.

           Michael carries a ladder to the fence. Stops. An almost 
           invisible TRIP-WIRE shimmers. It’s attached to a mounted           
           SM-70 antipersonnel land mine.

           Michael lays out tools. His shaking hands carefully, gingerly 
           dismantle the SM-70. And we realize-- he’s done this before.

           Michael places the ladder against the fence. Climbs. 

           A SPOTLIGHT hits him. Blinding. Alarms. Dogs barking.

                                 BORDER GUARD
                        Halt!

           Michael ascends the ladder. Bullets fly past. Bang! He 
           reaches the top. Bang. Michael’s SHADOW, cast in the 
           spotlight, tumbles to the ground.  

           Michael stares up at the night sky, full of stars. 

           A gentle wind blows.

           EXT. VILLAGE OF POSSNECK - DAY

           Just beyond the Death Zone, over the dense Thuringian Forest 
           we find a small, East German village. A decrepit, dystopian 
           fairy tale patched up with communist-era concrete. 

           SUPER: June, 1978
           “You Are Now Entering Possneck.” Population 9,034.

           OFFICERS STURM and DRANG, two VOLKSPOLIZEI, East German Cops, 
           black boots, rifles, march down the cobblestones.

           EXT. THE PEOPLE’S OWNED POLYMER FACTORY - DAY

           Overlooking the town, the factory belches smoke into the sky.

           INT. THE PEOPLE’S OWNED POLYMER FACTORY - DAY

           A blanket of noxious fog hovers around a sagging banner: 
           “Serving our customers and our Republic.” Hulking machines 
           generating plastic. 

           A GREASE-COVERED HAND 

           Reaches out from the guts of a large machine, selects a 
           wrench from a toolbox, pulls it back. Under the machine--

           PETER STRELZYK, 36, intelligent eyes, lean, hungry face, 
           cigarette clenched in his teeth. He angrily wrenches a bolt-- 
           tighter, tighter. 

                                 PETER
                        Finished. 

           Peter slides out of the machine and stands before curious, 
           apprehensive middle-aged SUPERVISORS and MANAGERS.

                                 MANAGER
                        What is this? 

                                 PETER
                        Progress. Before, two workers had 
                        to push levers to trigger the 
                        hydraulic mechanism, but now-- 

           Peter flips a switch. The press churns, operating on its own. 

                                 PETER
                        It can function independently. 

           Peter looks across the factory with grey-faced workers 
           operating dinosaur-like machines. 

                                 PETER
                        In six months, I could have the 
                        whole factory fully automated. 

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        You were just supposed to fix it. 
                                 PETER
                        I did. Well, improved it-- 

                                 MANAGER
                        What about the workers you just put 
                        out of a job? 

                                 PETER
                        They’ll be free to do better jobs. 

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Jobs like mine? Jobs like yours? 

                                 PETER
                        I think you’re missing the point-- 

                                 MANAGER
                        No, you are. The workers like what 
                        they do. They’re happy. 

                                 PETER
                        They’re ill. From the fumes. We 
                        need proper ventilation in here. 

           Peter points to the hovering cloud of fog in the factory.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        I bet you have an invention for 
                        that, too. 

                                 PETER
                             (reaching for his 
                              sketchbook)
                        As a matter of fact-- 

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Peter, I have personally overseen 
                        the air quality of this factory and 
                        it is in top condition. 

                                 MANAGER
                        Top. 

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        If you wish to improve the air, I 
                        suggest you stop smoking so many 
                        cigarettes. 

           They stare at him, challenging him to speak out of line. More 
           is at stake than just his job. Peter snubs out his cigarette. 

                                 PETER
                        Yes, comrade. 
                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Good. Now dismantle this 
                        monstrosity. 

           Peter contemptuously watches his bosses walk off. 

           CLOSE ON - A bootleg audio cassette: The Damned. It’s slid 
           into a tape player. “New Rose” erupts. LOUD, HARD, PUNK.

           EXT. POSSNECK PARK - DAY - REVEAL

           LUKAS, 18, black jacket, buzz cut hair, bops to the music. 

           His three FRIENDS laugh and jump around, passing a flask, 
           looking through a paper bag full of BOOTLEG MIXTAPES: Sex 
           Pistols, The Who, The Jam, The Stooges, David Bowie.

                                 LUKAS
                        Have you ever heard anything like 
                        this?! No! No, you have not! 

           His friends laugh as Lukas thrashes like a wild rooster.

           HIGH BLACK BOOTS stomping toward them. OFFICERS STURM and 
           DRANG approach. Lukas hides the paper bag full of bootlegs.

                                 OFFICER DRANG
                        Turn this off. 

                                 LUKAS
                        Sorry, can’t hear you. 

           Drang angrily hits stop on the player. 

                                 OFFICER STURM
                        Identification. All of you. 

           The teenagers groan and hand over their ID’s. 

                                 OFFICER DRANG
                        It is against the law to smuggle in 
                        Western goods. 

                                 LUKAS
                        It’s just music. 

                                 OFFICER STURM
                        Illegal music. 

           Drang rips the tape out. It catches, unfurls. 

                                 LUKAS
                        Hey, don’t-- 
           Lukas grabs for the tape. Drang, taking it as a threat, 
           snatches Lukas’s wrist, twists, pins Lukas to the table. 

                                 OFFICER DRANG
                        On your knees!

           His friends get on their knees. The cops inspect their 
           identification. Officer Drang scowls down at Lukas.

                                 OFFICER DRANG
                        “Private” Lukas Keller? You’re in 
                        the Army? 

                                 LUKAS
                        Construction Unit. 

                                 OFFICER STURM
                             (chuckles to Drang)
                        Coward’s unit. 

                                 OFFICER DRANG
                        Why aren’t with your Construction 
                        Unit? 

                                 LUKAS
                        I got time off and wanted come home 
                        to visit because everyone here is 
                        so lovely. 

                                 OFFICER DRANG
                        I should arrest you for possession 
                        of illegal goods. But instead, I’m 
                        going to call your Commanding 
                        Officer. His name?

                                 LUKAS
                        Can’t remember. 

                                 OFFICER DRANG
                        We’ll find it. I’m going to suggest 
                        you be transferred to an army base 
                        where this behavior is not 
                        tolerated. 
                             (leans close to Lukas)
                        Have you ever been to Siberia? I 
                        was stationed there. And I assure 
                        you, it is hell on Earth. 

           Sturm drops the tape, smashes it under his heel.

                                 OFFICER STURM
                        Enjoy your time at home. 

           They exit. Lukas gives their backs a trembling middle finger. 
           INT. POSSNECK TAVERN - DAY

           Golden beer flows. The local pub is packed with workers 
           drinking at the end of a long day. 

           GUNTER WETZEL, 24, a bricklayer with a young, cherubic face, 
           and a shaggy mustache takes a beer from Peter. 

                                 GUNTER
                        To your health. 

                                 PETER
                        We’re longer dead than alive. 

           They take their first frothy sips. 

                                 PETER
                        How are you, Gunter? 

                                 GUNTER
                        Good. Family’s good. You? 

                                 PETER
                        Good. Kids, Doris. We’re good. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Good. 

           Peter leans close, conspiratorially.

                                 PETER
                        So. How are we really? 

           Gunter drains his beer. Wipes his mustache.

                                 GUNTER
                        Lousy. Petra made this new coffee 
                        this morning, Kaffee Mix-- it’s 
                        unholy. They cut the coffee with 
                        roast peas and rye and, and, and 
                        beets. Beets. It’s disgusting. 

                                 PETER
                        The State can no longer afford to 
                        import real coffee. So they sell us 
                        the lie.

                                 GUNTER
                        Well, the truth is it tastes like 
                        it was made in a goat’s ass. 

                                 PETER
                        Just like the news.
                                 GUNTER
                        Careful. That’s a five year joke. 
                        Three in prison for the one telling 
                        it-- 

                                 PETER
                        -- two for those who laugh at it. 

           They clink beers. 

                                 PETER
                        I went to buy socks the other day. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Let me guess...

                                 PETER
                        No socks. And yet our leader tells 
                        me clothing production in East 
                        Germany is at an all time high. 
                        Crops are growing. Workers are 
                        happy. 

           Peter looks at the men in the bar. Tired, gaunt pale faces.

                                 PETER
                        Anyone here look happy? 

                                 GUNTER
                        They look dead. Oh, wait. That’s a 
                        mirror. 

                                 PETER
                        And now the State passed a new law. 
                        “Crimes Against the German 
                        Democratic Republic.” We can get 
                        eight years in prison for any anti-
                        Socialist remarks. Our government 
                        is so insecure that it can’t take 
                        the tiniest bit of criticism! 

                                 GUNTER
                        Least the beer’s good. Probably why 
                        I drink so much of it. 

                                 PETER
                        Couldn’t possibly be because we’d 
                        rather be drunk than face living in 
                        hell another day. 

           Gunter sees an OLD MAN watching them, eavesdropping. 
                                 GUNTER
                        Well. Life isn’t a place for riding 
                        ponies. 
                             (trying to diffuse the 
                              conversation)
                        How’d your invention go at work? 

                                 PETER
                        They value progress as much as they 
                        value good coffee. You know who 
                        drinks good coffee, Gunter? 
                             (points out of the window)
                        The West. 

           Peter looks West. Into the blue sky.

                                 PETER
                        Only eighteen miles away. But it 
                        might as well be another planet... 
                        A free planet. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Well. Hey. Whataya gonna do? 

                                 PETER
                        Escape. 

           Gunter shifts, very uneasy. 

                                 GUNTER
                        That never goes well. So what else 
                        is new? 

                                 PETER
                        How would you do it? 

                                 GUNTER
                        I’m not-- this isn’t-- 

                                 PETER
                        We’re just talking, Gunter. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Well, talk softer. 

                                 PETER
                        Tunnels worked twenty years ago. 
                        But the guards are expecting 
                        tunnels. We need something 
                        unexpected. Something creative. 
                             (beat)
                        You’re creative. 

           Gunter picks at the label on his beer bottle. Shrugs.
                                 GUNTER
                        Submarine? 

                                 PETER
                        We’d need something big enough for 
                        everyone. And I don’t see how we 
                        could build a deep sea submersible 
                        capable of carrying eight people 
                        fifty miles across the ocean 
                        without someone noticing. 

                                 GUNTER
                        I thought we were just talking. 

                                 PETER
                        We are. ‘Nother round? 

           IN A BOOTH IN THE BACK - Peter whispers with Gunter.

                                 PETER
                        This isn’t just a wall we’re 
                        talking about. This is the Death 
                        Zone. 

           Peter sketches a map of the Death Zone.

                                 PETER
                        A mile of barbed wire, SM-70 
                        antipersonnel mines, double rows of 
                        wire-mesh, trip-wires attached to 
                        machine guns mounted at leg, mid-
                        section, and head level. Not to 
                        mention the dogs. 

                                 GUNTER
                        I hate those dogs. And I like dogs. 

                                 PETER
                        Beyond that a concrete trench. And 
                        beyond that another half mile strip 
                        patrolled by watch towers and 
                        guards with orders to shoot on 
                        command.

                                 GUNTER
                        You’ve... done your homework. 

                                 PETER
                        And then, another wall, a crossing 
                        checkpoint, and three miles from 
                        that acoustical sensing trip wires 
                        and more land mines. 
                                 GUNTER
                        They’ve made it impossible. 

           Peter nods, studying his sketch.

                                 PETER
                        “The antifascist protection 
                        rampart.” They told us the wall was 
                        to keep our enemies out. It’s to 
                        keep us in. 

           Peter looks out of the window.

                                 PETER
                        They’ve made us the enemy. 

           EXT. POSSNECK HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           A Russian flag and East German flag fly over the school.

           FRANK STRELZYK, 15, skinny, pale is at SOCCER TRY-OUTS. 

           But all Frank is interested in is a beautiful, freckled girl 
           named SONJA, 15, standing on the sidelines. An angelic 
           redhead--

           WHAM! KURT, 16, muscles, cobalt eyes, charges past Frank, 
           knocking him to the ground. 

           Frank is nearly trampled by a stampede of cleats. 

           Covered in mud, Frank hobbles to his feet. Sonja cringes. 
           Frank hangs his head, ashamed.

           EXT. POSSNECK MAIN STREET - SUNSET

           Peter is exiting the tavern. LUKAS rushes up. 

                                 LUKAS
                        Hey, Mr. Strelzyk! 

                                 PETER
                        Lukas. How’s the Army? 

                                 LUKAS
                        Oh, y’know. Shit. 

           Peter laughs. 

                                 LUKAS
                        Hey, I sort of lost the keys to the 
                        bulldozer I’m working on. My dad’s 
                        always saying you’re such a 
                        mechanical genius--
                                 PETER
                        You’re not going to go joyriding, 
                        are you? 

                                 LUKAS
                        No. No, sir. 

           They walk past a billboard with a smiling man in overalls 
           wearing a toolbelt: “CONFIDENT IN OUR STRENGTH.”

                                 PETER
                        What’s the make? 

                                 LUKAS
                        Liebherr. 71. 

                                 PETER
                        Russian. Always breaking. I’ve 
                        fixed a lot of those. 
                             (sketching a drawing)
                        The control panel is under the 
                        right side. You’ll find a bunch of 
                        wires... tie the two yellow ones 
                        together. Should start.

           He rips the sketch out of his notebook. Lukas pockets it.

                                 LUKAS
                        Thank you, Mr. Strelzyk. Oh, hey-- 

           Lukas hands Peter a BOOTLEG MIXTAPE.

                                 LUKAS
                        Give this to Frank. It’s music.
                        Real music. 

           Peter smiles as Lukas runs off, startling an old lady.

                                 LUKAS
                        Rock and roll, Mr. Strelzyk! 

           EXT. STRELZYK HOUSE - NIGHT

           A drab, two story house on a suburban street.

           INT. STRELZYK HOUSE - NIGHT

           DORIS STRELZYK, 32, smart, her free spirit hidden under a 
           reserved facade, eats Spam and potatoes for dinner with Peter 
           their two boys, FRANK, 15, quiet and withdrawn. ANDREAS, 9, 
           too young to be so intense, wearing a Young Pioneers Uniform 
           with a yellow bandana. 
                                 ANDREAS
                        And I got this badge for shooting. 

           Andreas proudly points to a rifle badge on his scarf. 

                                 DORIS
                        Shooting? You’re nine! 

                                 ANDREAS
                        Scout Leader said we have to 
                        prepare for when the Westies 
                        attack. 

                                 DORIS
                        West Germany isn’t going to attack 
                        us, Andreas. 

                                 ANDREAS
                        Scout Leader says they hate us. 

                                 DORIS
                        We have friends in the West. Good 
                        friends. The things they’re 
                        teaching you kids.

                                 PETER
                        Andreas. When I was your age, my 
                        Scout Leader told me that the 
                        Americans had dropped potato bugs 
                        from airplanes to eat all of our 
                        crops. The Yankee Beetle. 

           INSERT - A field of crops-- crawling with potato beetles. 
           Young Peter and his friends pick potato beetles from the 
           crops and put them in glass jars.

                                 PETER 
                        They sent the children into the 
                        fields to collect all the beetles. 
                        I obeyed and I spent my whole 
                        summer collecting jars of beetles. 

           INSERT - 50 jars of writhing beetles in Young Peter’s room.

                                 PETER
                        But do you know what? The Americans 
                        never dropped those bugs on us. The 
                        State was lying so the children 
                        would work for free. And they 
                        wanted to instill fear of the 
                        outside world in us from a very 
                        young age. That way we would never 
                        want to leave. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        Take off that badge. 

           Andreas sadly takes off his rifle badge. 

                                 DORIS
                             (trying to lighten the 
                              mood)
                        How were try-outs, Frank? 

           Frank stares at his plate. Shrugs.

                                 FRANK
                        Good. 

           Good. Peter knows that blanket response too well. They eat 
           the rest of their meal in silence.

           EXT. WETZEL HOUSE - NIGHT

           Gunter is on his roof, aiming his TV antennae to the West...

           INT. WETZEL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           PETRA WETZEL, 24, girl next door beauty, headstrong, is 
           kneeling by the TV with their boys: SAM, 2, and ANDREW, 4.

                                 GUNTER (O.S.)
                             (over walkie)
                        Anything yet? 

           Petra watches their 13 inch TV which is filled with static.

                                 PETRA
                             (into walkie)
                        Nothing-- wait! There! 

           ON TV - Rippling images of a city skyline... the brassy 
           opening soundtrack of “DALLAS” comes into view. It looks like 
           a magical portal into another world-- dubbed in German. Petra 
           is transfixed with the flashy gowns. The opulence.

                                 PETRA 
                             (in awe)
                        ... their hair... 

           EXT. WETZEL HOUSE - NIGHT

           Gunter secures the antenna, starts to climb down. A chill 
           wind blows behind him and he feels someone watching him. 

           HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET - A silhouette in a window. Gunter 
           swallows, watching the shadow watch him. He waves.
                                 GUNTER
                        Evening, Helga. 

           It’s their neighbor, HELGA, 50. Eating a fork full of 
           chocolate cake, eyes fixed on Gunter. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Fixing a shingle. 

           Helga gives a judgemental nod. Gunter’s smile vanishes as 
           soon as he descends the ladder.

           INT. STRELZYK LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           After dinner, the Strelzyk family watches their small TV. 

                                 REPORTER 
                             (on TV)
                        Border disputes on Damansky Island 
                        have tensions between China and the 
                        Soviet Union rising. Said the 
                        Russian Minister of Defense, 
                        “Military action is imminent.” 

           Frank looks up with concern.

                                 FRANK
                        Dad. When I have to join the army 
                        and Russia goes to war with China-- 
                        I’d have to fight the Chinese, 
                        wouldn’t I? 

           Peter nods. 

                                 PETER
                        What do you think about that? 

           Frank shrugs. Peter snubs out his cigarette.

                                 PETER
                        Do you want to fight in a war in 
                        outer Mongolia over some line on a 
                        Russian map? 

                                 FRANK
                        No...

                                 PETER
                        But you’d have to. Because we’re 
                        Russia’s “Brothers In Arms.” Russia 
                        says sit, we sit. Jump, we jump.
                                 ANDREAS
                        But... they helped us get rid of 
                        the Nazis. 

                                 PETER
                        What else did they tell you? 

                                 ANDREAS
                        The West. They were Nazis. Not us. 

                                 PETER
                        Everyone wants to blame the other 
                        side for the war. But there was no 
                        us and them back then. Truth is, 
                        one of the biggest concentration 
                        camps was just an hour away from 
                        here. Did they teach you that? 

           Andreas shakes his head.

                                 PETER
                        The war is a disgrace both sides 
                        will never escape. Nor should it. 
                        Terrible things were done before we 
                        were born. 

                                 DORIS
                        Awful things. 

                                 PETER
                        Why? Because men blindly followed 
                        orders. They listened without 
                        questioning. 

           Peter leans close.

                                 PETER
                        Don’t let your minds become a 
                        prison. Dream free dreams. As big 
                        as you can, as far as you can. No 
                        matter what they tell you. Because 
                        in the end, all you have is this-- 
                             (taps his chest)
                        And the longer you wait to listen 
                        to it, the less likely you are to 
                        hear it at all.

           The boys absorb this. Andreas walks over to Frank. Hugs him. 

                                 ANDREAS
                        I don’t want you going to war, 
                        Frank. 
                                 PETER
                        Neither of you are going. We’ll be 
                        long gone by then. 

           Doris accidentally knocks over her tea.

                                 DORIS
                        Andreas? Change the channel. Frank, 
                        clean that up. Peter? Can you help 
                        me in the kitchen? 

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Doris whispers to Peter.

                                 DORIS
                        It’s okay for you and I to talk 
                        about leaving-- hell, I stood in 
                        line for two hours just to buy Spam 
                        and potatoes. But they’re just 
                        children, Peter.

                                 PETER
                        Frank’s almost a man--

                                 DORIS
                        Well, you’re scaring him. And me.

           Peter realizes he’s wringing a dish towel in his hands.

                                 DORIS
                        You’re filled with so much anger 
                        and fire. Don’t let it burn you up.

                                 PETER
                        So what do I do? Give up? 

                                 DORIS
                        Never. 

                                 PETER
                        It’d be easier, wouldn’t it?

           She gently comes to him. 

                                 DORIS
                        Just be their father. Let them in. 

           She kisses him, soothing his anger-- if just for a moment.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Peter walks up to Frank. Hands him the bootleg mixtape.
                                 PETER
                        This is from Lukas.

           Frank’s eyes light up. 

                                 PETER
                        Play it only in your room. 

           Excited, Frank runs upstairs.

                                 PETER 
                        And don’t tell anyone about it!  

           INT. FRANK’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Frank puts in the tape. Pulls on large, chunky headphones. 
           “Anarchy in the UK” erupts. Imagine, if you can, the first 
           time your mind was blown away by a song. This is not music. 
           This is a revolution. The punk anthem plays over--

           INT. KELLER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Lukas Keller zips up his leather jacket in front of the 
           mirror. Turns to his father and mother-- JOSEF and MAGDA 
           KELLER. Both the picture of domestic normalcy.

                                 LUKAS
                        I’m going out. 

           He kisses his mother on both cheeks.  

                                 MAGDA
                        Don’t be too long. 

           Lukas shakes his father’s hand. 

                                 LUKAS
                        Goodbye, father. Goodbye, mother.

           EXT. MOUNTAINS OF POSSNECK - DAY

           Lukas rides his bike toward a cold, rising light.

           EXT. DEATH ZONE - NIGHT

           Wind shrieks through the razor wire. A songbird is caught in 
           the mesh fencing.

           NEARBY CONSTRUCTION SITE - Lukas parks his bicycle beside a 
           BULLDOZER. Climbs in. He follows Peter’s sketch. 

                                 LUKAS
                        Tie the yellows together and... 
           The bulldozer rumbles to life. 

           EXT. DEATH ZONE BORDER - NIGHT

           A guard dog perks up. BARKS.

           IN A WATCH TOWER - OFFICER HORST, 31, Head Border Guard, trim 
           hair, piercing eyes, peers through his binoculars.

                                 HORST 
                        Lights. 

           Spotlights sweep the forest. Illuminating the bulldozer 
           rumbling directly toward the fence.

           BULLDOZER - Lukas squints, driving FORWARD.

           Horst speaks into an announcement system. His voice echoes.

                                 HORST
                        Halt. Identify yourself. 

           Lukas shifts the bulldozer’s giant metal shovel up, blocking 
           himself from the guard’s view. 

                                 HORST
                        Fire! 

           Border Guards fire Kalashinkovs. Lukas is protected by the 
           bulldozer’s giant shovel as hot shrapnel shatters around him.

           The bulldozer tears through the barbed wire, ripping down a 
           search light-- HAIL OF SPARKS. Guards jump away as the 
           bulldozer rolls into a concrete trench, crashes wheels up. 

                                 LUKAS
                        Shit!

           Lukas runs. Bullets chasing. A land-mine behind him explodes. 
           DIRT FOUNTAINS. Lukas is thrown forward. Miraculously, he’s 
           still alive. He RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.

           HORST. Raising his rifle. LUKAS. Almost at the last fence.

           IN HORST’S CROSS HAIRS - Lukas climbs the fence-- bang. 

           Horst sniffs, slings his rifle, climbs down his tower to the 
           up-ended bulldozer. He snaps the yellow wires and walks over 
           to Lukas who is gasping on the ground.

                                 HORST
                        You’re barely even a man. 

           Horst pats down Lukas’s leather jacket. 
                                 HORST
                        Who taught you to do that, hm? Your 
                        father? Your friend? 

           Horst finds Peter’s hot-wire sketch. Narrows his eyes. 

                                 HORST
                        Who gave this to you? Speak.

           Lukas glares. Blood pooling beneath him.

                                 HORST
                        I will find out. Where you are 
                        from. Who your family is. They will 
                        all be punished for this. 
                             (pockets the sketch)
                        But if you tell me who helped you, 
                        I will drive you to the hospital 
                        and maybe you’ll live long enough 
                        to see mommy and daddy before you 
                        die. 

           Tears spill down Lukas’s face. Horst sees blood is touching 
           his boot. Disgusted, he wipes his boot with a handkerchief.

                                 HORST
                        I’ll wait. 

           Horst stands back, checks his watch, almost bored. 

           EXT. DEATH ZONE BORDER - DAY

           The blue sky and drifting clouds are reflected in Lukas’s 
           open eye which is staring up. Horst watches the body from his 
           tower. Sips hot coffee. Guards move to drag Lukas’s body off.

                                 HORST
                        Leave him.

                                 GUARD
                        He’s dead, sir. 

                                 HORST
                        Leave him. And get me some tea. 
                        This coffee is disgusting. 

           EXT. BERLIN - DAY

           The flag of East Germany flies alongside the RUSSIAN FLAG 
           over the great, grey city of Berlin. 

           EXT. BERLIN STATE SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

           The headquarters of the Secret Police.
           INT. STATE SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

           A framed picture of ERIC HONECKER, East German Leader, on the 
           wall. Horst stands at attention before five STASI OFFICERS. 

                                 OFFICER VERLAG
                        You had no problem shooting an 
                        unarmed man? 

                                 HORST
                        Apart from murder there is no worse 
                        crime than fleeing the Republic.  
                             (sensing their hesitation)
                        I was under the impression our 
                        leader commends those who use 
                        firearms against these criminals--

                                 OFFICER VERLAG
                        Yes, but the boy’s body was left in 
                        the open for three days? 

                                 HORST
                        An example needed to be made. 

                                 OFFICER VERLAG
                        A rather disgusting example.

                                 VOICE
                        He’s right. 

           CAPTAIN EDMUND ZENTAL, 55, a brilliant, relentless force of 
           nature in an ordinary brown suit and tie. He is studying 
           Peter’s blood-soaked sketch on how to hot-wire the bulldozer.

                                 ZENTAL
                        People need to see the consequences 
                        of fleeing. Well done, comrade. 

           Horst puffs up at Zental’s compliment. 

                                 HORST
                        Thank you, Captain. If I can be of 
                        further assistance, please let me 
                        know. 

                                 ZENTAL
                        Dismissed.

           Horst walks out, feeling quite good about himself.

                                 OFFICER VERLAG
                        I’ll run a story in the papers: 
                        failed escape attempt--
                                 ZENTAL
                        That only makes the people 
                        sympathize with these people more. 
                        Gives them ideas. No. Not a word of 
                        this.

           Zental holds Peter’s drawing up to the light, studies it...

           EXT. KELLER HOUSE - DAY

           Heavy rain. MAGDA KELLER peers out from her front window. 
           CAPTAIN ZENTAL is knocking on her door.

                                 ZENTAL
                        Magda Keller? 

                                 JOSEF
                        Who is it, Magda? 

           Zental shows them his badge. Icy dread creeps in...

           ON THE STREET - Peter and Gunter are driving past. Seeing 
           Zental place Josef and Magda in the back of the sedan beside 
           two SHADOWY FIGURES, Peter slows.

                                 GUNTER
                        What’s going on..? 

           Peter sees the sedan’s clunky RADIO ANTENNAE. 

                                 PETER
                        Stasi. You can tell by the radio 
                        antennae. Russian make. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Jesus, Pete. Don’t stop. 

           Zental senses Peter and Gunter watching-- he locks eyes with 
           Peter as memorizing his face. Peter drives off. Can’t shake 
           the feeling this has something to do with him.

           INT. MINISTRY OF STATE SECURITY - DAY

           Eerie silence as Josef and Magda are led down separate halls.

           INT. MINISTRY OF STATE SECURITY - BASEMENT

           Lukas’s body lies upon a metal table. Magda drops to her 
           knees. Zental hands her a Kleenex, oddly comforting her.

           INTERROGATION ROOM A - Magda is at a loss, utterly gutted.
                                 ZENTAL
                        Your son is a traitor. Was a 
                        traitor. 

           INSERT - A tape recorder slowly records the conversation.

                                 ZENTAL
                        He knew the consequences-- perhaps 
                        he was suicidal, hm?

                                 MAGDA
                        YOU MONSTER! YOU KILLED MY SON! 

           A guard holds Magda by the shoulder, forcing her to stay 
           seated. Zental coldly regards her.

           INTERROGATION ROOM B - Josef trembles on a wooden stool. 

                                 ZENTAL
                        I’m a father as well. Two boys. We 
                        go hunting, hiking. I love them. 
                        This is why I need your help to 
                        prevent this pain from ever 
                        happening to another parent again. 

           Zental slides Peter’s sketch across the table.

                                 ZENTAL
                        Did you draw this for your son?

           Josef stares at the drawing, his son’s dried blood. 

                                 JOSEF
                        No.

                                 ZENTAL
                        If you didn’t, who did?

           As Josef’s mind reels, PULL BACK through a two way mirror--

           INT. RECORDING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

           A hive-like room where Stasi Agents are recording 
           interrogations happening in different rooms where--

           -A 12 year old girl clutches a doll while Stasi Agents 
           cajoles her to talk about her parents.

           -A man kneels, wrists chained to the floor, as water is being 
           steadily poured over his head.

           We catch a glimpse of the entire spying operation...
           POSTAL SURVEILLANCE ROOM - A waterfall of envelopes. Hundreds 
           of buckets of personal mail dumped on a table. Secretaries 
           steam open love letters, bills.

           Xerox copies are made of suspicious letters and then placed 
           into green file folders...

           DIVISION OF GARBAGE ANALYSIS - Agents wearing doctor’s masks 
           and gloves dump garbage onto a table and inspect it for any 
           suspicious materials.

           CLERICAL ROOM - Typewriters banging. A Secretary types up a 
           new file: MAGDA KELLER, JOSEF KELLER. The file is stamped and 
           passed to a clerk who takes it to--

           FILE ROOM - A hauntingly vast room of file cabinets. The 
           Keller file is placed in a file cabinet. As the cabinet is 
           slammed shut-- 

           INT. POSSNECK CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           Lukas’s casket is closed. 

           The church is packed. The Strelzyks and the Wetzels sit 
           together. A framed picture of Lukas in his Army uniform. 

           CLICK! Peter sees an ODD MAN hiding behind floral 
           arrangements, taking pictures of the mourners. Peter subtly 
           turns his face away from the Odd Man’s long camera lens.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Dirt on the grave. Doris and Peter console Magda and Josef. 

                                 DORIS
                        If you need anything, anything at 
                        all... 

           Magda nods absently. CLICK! The ODD MAN stands behind a tree, 
           taking pictures. Josef grabs Peter in a tight hug, whispers.

                                 JOSEF
                        Was it you, Peter? Did you draw 
                        that for Lukas?

           Peter is immobile. As the world crumbles from under his feet--

           STILL CAMERA POV - Peter is in the cross hairs. CLICK!

           INT. FRANK AND ANDREAS’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Doris kisses Andreas and Frank goodnight. 
                                 FRANK
                        Mom. I’m not a kid. 

                                 DORIS
                        You’re never too old to get a kiss 
                        from your mother. 

           She turns out the light. Looks back at them.

                                 DORIS
                        Goodnight, my boys. I love you. 

           INT. STRELZYK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Peter smokes, knee bobbing. Tears in her eyes, Doris searches 
           for something in drawers and cabinets. 

                                 DORIS
                        What was the name of that woman we 
                        met from the organization in the 
                        West? 

                                 PETER
                        Doris-- 

                                 DORIS
                        They can’t just shoot an innocent 
                        young man and get away with it. We 
                        need to file a complaint, tell 
                        people-- do something-- no! I don’t 
                        want a hug. I want to spit in their 
                        faces and say you killed a 
                        beautiful young man with his whole 
                        life in front of him! 
                             (beat)
                        The State didn’t even let them 
                        publish an obituary in the 
                        newspaper, Peter. Do you know how 
                        offensive that is?

           She angrily wipes her eyes.

                                 DORIS
                        They can deny his death-- but not 
                        his soul. Not his spirit.

           She finds a business card. Grabs the phone. Peter stops her.

                                 DORIS
                        Peter. Move. 

                                 PETER
                        Doris. They could be listening. 
                                 DORIS
                        Why would they--

                                 PETER
                        Lukas came to me that night. Said 
                        he needed to start a bulldozer 
                        without a key. 
                             (emotional)
                        It’s my fault. 

           Doris puts the phone back in its cradle.

                                 DORIS
                        Oh, God, Peter. Did you know?

                                 PETER
                        No! I would’ve never told him!
                             (however:)
                        I made a sketch for him. How to hot-
                        wire the engine... they must have 
                        found it because Josef asked me if 
                        I drew it. 

                                 DORIS
                        Jesus. What did you say?

                                 PETER
                        Nothing. I could barely speak.

           Doris’s knees give out. She sits beside her husband.

                                 DORIS
                        Would Josef turn you in if he knew?

                                 PETER
                        Josef and I have been friends for 
                        twenty years. 
                             (sadly, the way things 
                              are)
                        Of course he would. 

           Doris’s heart is pounding.

                                 DORIS
                        You could get ten years in prison--

                                 PETER
                        I know--

                                 DORIS
                        A prison you could die in. They’d 
                        deport me and the kids to the 
                        Soviet Union just to make an 
                        example of us. 
                                 PETER
                        Doris. Listen to me--

                                 DORIS
                        They’ve done it before. We’ll be 
                        exiled. Frank would be sent to the 
                        front lines. He’d be killed. 

           Peter grabs her hands. 

                                 PETER
                        Doris. I promise you, I swear on my 
                        life, that is not going to happen.

                                 DORIS
                        How?! How can you tell me it won’t 
                        happen?! 

           He locks eyes with her. With all his soul, he means this:

                                 PETER
                        Because I’m going to get us out of 
                        here.

           Knock-knock-knock. Doris and Peter tense.

                                 VOICE FROM BEHIND THE DOOR
                        Open up! 

           Peter peers out of the window-- GUNTER. Swaying, drunk.

                                 GUNTER
                        Well, this has been the most goddam 
                        depressing day of my life. Beer? 

           Gunter holds up a half-empty bottle of VODKA.

           EXT. STRELZYK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Peter and Gunter are both drunk, sitting on the front steps.

                                 GUNTER
                        Lukas was nice a kid. Listened to 
                        bad music, but he was a good kid. 

                                 PETER
                        Do you remember what we talked 
                        about at the tavern, Gunter? 
                             (pause)
                        It’s time.

           Gunter takes a big gulp of vodka. 
                                 GUNTER
                        I dunno, Pete...

                                 PETER
                        What if Lukas was your son? What 
                        would you do?

           That hits Gunter hard.

                                 GUNTER
                        What the hell. I’m drunk and I’m 
                        angry. 

           Gunter shakes Peter’s hand. Gunter holds it. 

                                 GUNTER
                        But Peter-- it’s not just you and 
                        me. It’s Doris, Frank, Andreas. 
                        Petra, the boys. 
                             (beat)
                        How are we going to get eight 
                        people across the Death Zone? 

           EXT. SPREE RIVER - NIGHT

           The Spree River is a natural divider between East and West. 
           It violently churns in the moonlight as the Strelzyks and 
           Wetzels stand on the muddy bank. 

           Peter holds two suitcases wrapped in plastic.

                                 PETER
                        It’s just a short swim to the West.

           They wade into the raging river. 

                                 GUNTER
                        It’s freezing!

           An icy wave overwhelms Doris, dragging her down.

                                 ANDREAS
                        MOMMY!!! 

           POLICE BOATS WITH SEARCHLIGHTS speed across the river, 
           illuminating everyone’s terrified faces as they bob 
           helplessly in the water. Gun shots kick up the water. 
           Screams. Blood in the thrashing waves.

                                 PETER
                        DORIS! 
           INT. PETER & DORIS’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Peter snaps out of his terrible dream. Looks at Doris in bed 
           beside him. He holds her tight, kisses her.

           INT. GUNTER’S BASEMENT - NIGHT

           A hobby workshop of tools, toys, remote controlled planes, 
           and half-built gadgets. Peter and Gunter study a large map of 
           Germany. Smoke hangs in the air.

                                 PETER
                        Escape by water is out. 

                                 GUNTER
                        So is land. These surface routes 
                        are impenetrable... Checkpoints 
                        every half mile. 

                                 PETER
                        What about air..? 

           Peter looks at Gunter’s remote control airplane, transfixed.

                                 PETER
                        In ‘63 I was in the airforce. 
                        Wanted to be a pilot. Fly the 
                        world. State didn’t need pilots. 
                        State needed mechanics. So...

           Gunter picks up a Western newspaper, idly flips through it.

                                 GUNTER
                        You want to build an airplane? 
                        Sounds complicated. 

           Peter sets down the airplane. Rubs his face.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah. It was a stupid idea. 
                             (re: newspaper)
                        How’d you get that?

                                 GUNTER
                        Petra’s sister lives in the West. 
                        If she’s allowed to visit she 
                        smuggles in little things. Real 
                        coffee. Real news. 

           Gunter stops. He stares at the newspaper.

                                 GUNTER
                        Peter... Peter.
           Gunter holds up the newspaper-- there is an article about the 
           Albuquerque, New Mexico Hot Air Balloon Festival with a 
           vibrant, color photograph of hot air balloons in the sky.

                                 GUNTER
                        A hot air balloon... 

                                 PETER
                        It’s quiet. Can hold eight people.
                        Guards would never expect something 
                        like this to go sailing over their 
                        heads. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Slight problem: there are no hot 
                        air balloons in the Eastern Bloc. 

                                 PETER
                        We’ll build one. 

           Peter grabs his keys, rushes out. Gunter follows.

                                 GUNTER
                        Pete, I’ve never even seen a hot 
                        hair balloon in real life let alone 
                        built one!

                                 PETER
                        Hot air rises. Heats the balloon. 
                        Balloon lifts-- the thing--

                                 GUNTER
                        You don’t even know what it’s 
                        called! 

                                 PETER
                        Who cares what it’s called! It’s 
                        easier than building an airplane. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Everything is easier than building 
                        an airplane! 

           EXT. WETZEL HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Peter starts his orange Moskvitch. Gunter piles in. 

                                 PETER
                        We’ll got to the library and find 
                        everything we can on wind 
                        circulation, aerodynamics--
                                 GUNTER
                        They’ve banned so many books we’ll 
                        be lucky to find a dictionary. 

           INT. POSSNECK LIBRARY - DAY

           Dusty, quiet. The LIBRARIAN’S eyes watch Gunter select 
           “Around The World In 80 Days.” The gold-leafed cover shows a 
           magnificent picture of a hot air balloon. Peter finds a dusty 
           Encyclopedia entry about a hot air balloon. 

                                 PETER
                        “In 1783 Joseph-Michael and Jacques- 
                        Ètienne Montgolfier demonstrated 
                        their invention, the hot-air 
                        balloon, before a crowd of 
                        dignitaries in Annonay, France. It 
                        rose six thousand feet, stayed 
                        aloft for 10 minutes, and traveled 
                        more than a mile...” 
                             (beat)
                        That was two hundred years ago. If 
                        they can do it so can we. 

                                 GUNTER
                        It also says the first passengers 
                        were a duck, a rooster and a goat. 

                                 PETER
                        We’ll start tonight. 

           EXT. POSSNECK LIBRARY - DAY

           Peter and Gunter exit with only two books. Peter can see 
           Gunter’s hesitation, his worry...

                                 PETER
                        This is our chance, Gunter. Other 
                        than fear, give me one good reason.

                        Michael Gartenschlager.

           The name stops Peter.

                                 GUNTER
                        He led six defectors across the 
                        border, dismantled a live SM-70 
                        from its mount, gave it to the West 
                        for inspection and became a hero. 
                        He crossed the border two more 
                        times until they ambushed him and 
                        shot him.

                        He was a pro, Peter. If he couldn’t 
                        make it, what chance do we have? 

           EXT. PETER’S GARAGE - NIGHT

           With a simmering anxiety, Peter smokes beside a tree. He 
           stamps out his cigarette and we see hundreds of cigarette 
           butts ringing the tree. Headlights. Gunter arrives.

                                 PETER
                        I thought you weren’t coming. 

                                 GUNTER
                        I wasn’t. Then I found this. 

           Gunter hands him a translucent sheet of plastic wrapped junk.

           INT. PETER’S GARAGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Peter unfolds the plastic junk to see it’s a balloon attached 
           to a spring-box. Peter smiles, remembering...

                                 PETER
                        Freedom balloons. 

           INSERT - Hundreds of balloons float through the sky.  An 
           incredible, dream-like vision, a sky full of balloons.

                                 GUNTER
                        After the wall was built, the West 
                        released them... they had timers on 
                        them that dropped pamphlets in the 
                        air... 

           INSERT - The balloon packages click open-- an enchanted Young 
           Gunter stands in the rain of colorful pamphlets. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Of course it was just Western 
                        propaganda, but what amazed me was 
                        the timer release thing. And that 
                        someone cared enough to send 
                        them... 

                                 PETER
                        You kept it all these years?

                                 GUNTER
                        Lucky for you I found it in my 
                        attic last night. 

           Peter smiles. He pins the colorful newspaper picture of the 
           hot air balloons in New Mexico on a blank corkboard. 
                                 PETER
                             (writing in his notebook)
                        Four adults-- Frank, three little 
                        ones, the gondola-- gas containers, 
                        the burner, the bag-- will weigh... 
                        one thousand six hundred and forty 
                        nine pounds. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Almost a ton. 

                                 PETER
                        We’re going to need a lot of lift. 

           Gunter cracks open a dusty book on thermodynamics.

                                 GUNTER
                        So. We‘ll need a balloon with a 
                        volume of-- 

           Gunter punches numbers into his bulky calculator.

                                 GUNTER
                        -- seventy thousand, six hundred 
                        and twenty nine cubic feet. Which 
                        means we’ll need-- 

                                 PETER
                        Eight thousand six hundred and 
                        eleven square feet of material. 

                                 GUNTER
                        That’s bigger than a house!

           Gunter is filled with worry.

                                 GUNTER
                        This is a small town, Pete. People 
                        talk. We go into stores, asking for 
                        two thousand of anything and 
                        they’re going to start asking 
                        questions. 

                                 PETER
                        We’ll shop in different towns. 
                        Little here, little there. Piece by 
                        piece. 

                                 GUNTER
                        And then what? We sew it together? 

                                 PETER
                        You have a sewing machine, right? 
                                 GUNTER
                        This isn’t like hemming pants! I 
                        don’t know-- this is already 
                        sounding-- it’s not something we 
                        can just hide. 

           They realize what this means. 

                           PETER
           We’re going to have to talk 
           to the wives. 
                                                         GUNTER
                                              We’re going to have to talk 
                                              to the wives. 

           INT. STRELZYK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Curtains closed. Doors locked. Cherry Schnapps is poured. 
           Petra and Doris sit on the couch. Peter and Gunter show them 
           their blueprint designs for the hot air balloon.

                                 DORIS
                        A balloon? Are you serious? 

                                 PETER
                        We’ve calculated everything. Gunter 
                        will sew it. I’ll construct the 
                        burner--

                                 GUNTER
                        I’ll be our Navigator. 

                                 PETRA
                        Just because you were a truck 
                        driver doesn’t make you a 
                        navigator. 

                                 GUNTER
                        I’m learning wind patterns. Heat 
                        patterns. All the patterns. 

                                 PETRA
                        So how exactly do you navigate a 
                        balloon, Gunter? 

                                 GUNTER
                        Well, balloons fly by climbing into 
                        air currents, those currents then 
                        carry the balloon-- 

                                 PETRA
                        I understand the way a balloon 
                        works. I’m asking what happens if 
                        the wind changes while we’re up 
                        there? We end up living in Poland? 
                                 GUNTER
                        We only sail if the weather’s 
                        right. Otherwise if it’s too cold 
                        the balloon could freeze and we’d 
                        all drop from the sky and...

                                 PETRA
                        And die. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Depends on how high up we are. 

           Peter looks at Gunter. Stop talking.

                                 GUNTER
                        More Schnapps, honey? 

                                 DORIS
                        How high up does it go? 

                                 PETER
                        It can reach altitudes of two 
                        miles. 

           Doris pales. Two miles?

                                 PETER
                        It’s like standing on top of a very 
                        tall mountain. 

                                 DORIS
                        And how long will we be flying on 
                        top of this very tall mountain? 

                                 PETER
                        Navigator? 

                                 GUNTER
                        Estimated flight time: twenty 
                        minutes. Weather permitting. 

                                 DORIS
                        You want me to take our children 
                        two miles off the ground in 
                        something you’re going to build in 
                        the garage? 

           Peter nods. Petra crosses her arms.

                                 PETRA
                        When I was a kid the police threw a 
                        man in jail for a year just for 
                        putting a sign in his window that 
                        said “Shut Down the System.

                             (beat)
                        Think of what they would do if they 
                        found out about this. 

                                 PETER
                        That’s why this stays with us four. 
                        If no one else knows, they can’t 
                        get in trouble. We won’t even tell 
                        the children. Total secrecy.

                                 PETRA
                        And what-- the West will just 
                        welcome us with open arms? 

                                 PETER
                        Doris and I have looked into this. 
                        They’ll give us asylum like they 
                        give all refugees from the East. 

           She shakes her head. 

                                 PETRA
                        Now we’re refugees... 

                                 GUNTER
                        This is what we’ve dreamt about, 
                        Petra! If we do this we could 
                        travel anywhere we want, never eat 
                        Spam again, never live in fear 
                        again. A better life for the boys.  

                                 PETRA
                        But we’re comfortable here.

           Petra looks at Doris.

                                 PETRA
                        You’re being awful quiet.

           Doris stares at the ground.

                                 DORIS
                        I just want our children to grow up 
                        freethinkers, free men. 
                             (beat)
                        But if we stay here-- I worry 
                        they’ll lose that spark. That magic 
                        children have. How will I look at 
                        myself, knowing I did nothing to 
                        help them? What will I say? 
                             (beat)
                        I was scared? I was comfortable? 
                                 PETRA
                        But this? 

                                 DORIS
                        This is the most insane thing I’ve 
                        ever heard. 
                             (points at Peter)
                        And he doesn’t come up with insane 
                        things. Peter’s practical and smart 
                        and quite frankly a little boring. 
                        So for him to say this is the best 
                        plan of escape... it is.

           She stands, studying the blueprints, the numbers. Nods.

                                 DORIS
                        I want to see all of your 
                        calculations. 

                                 PETER
                        They’re sound--

                                 DORIS
                        My math is better than yours. I 
                        work at the bank. 

                                 PETER
                        Okay--

                                 DORIS
                        And while you’re building it, Petra 
                        and I will inspect everything.

                                 PETER
                        Okay--

                                 DORIS
                        If there is one thing I see that I 
                        don’t like-- we call the whole 
                        thing off. 
                             (beat)
                        We’re going to be your quality 
                        control. 

                                 PETER
                        Okay.

           The living room door suddenly opens. Everyone jolts. Peter 
           covers the blueprints. It’s Frank. 

                                 PETER
                        Frank, out! 
                                 DORIS
                        Just a second, sweetie. 

           Frank backs out of the room. They close the door. Everyone 
           takes a relieved breath. Peter looks to Doris and Petra. 

                                 GUNTER
                        So. Do we have your blessing?

           All eyes on Petra. Head in her hands.

                                 PETRA
                        I see one thread, one bolt I do not 
                        like-- it’s over. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Yes. A hundred percent. 

                                 PETRA
                        I can’t believe I’m saying this...
                             (reluctantly raises her 
                              glass)
                        To the balloon. 

                                 ALL
                        To the balloon. 

           EXT. TOWN OF GERA - DAY

           Peter and Gunter drive into the city of Gera.

           INT. GERA DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

           Peter and Gunter find large industrial rolls of cotton. 

                                 CLERK
                        How much do you need? 

                                 GUNTER
                        Five hundred feet. 

                                 PETER
                             (quickly)
                        For camping. We need to line the 
                        old tents. 

                                 GUNTER
                             (a little too excited)
                        We’re Scout Leaders! 

           EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY

           They sift through piles of junk. Hoses, metal pipes...
                                 PETER
                        We need a petcock. 

                                 GUNTER
                        A what? 

                                 PETER
                        It’s a valve. 

           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

           “CAUTION: EXPLOSIVE” on the side of a large propane tank. 
           Peter and Gunter buy four large cylinders of propane.

           Officers Sturm and Drang drive by, watching Peter place the 
           propane tanks in his car. Gunter waves at the police. 

                                 PETER
                        You’re overcompensating. 

                                 GUNTER
                        I’m friendly. Try it some time. 

           Gunter continues waving. Sturm and Drang drive off.

           EXT. WETZEL HOUSE - NIGHT

           Petra tries to block Peter and Gunter from lugging the 
           equipment and junk inside her house. 

                                 PETRA
                             (whispers)
                        Why can’t you build it in your own 
                        garage? 

                                 PETER
                        The ex-mayor and my factory 
                        supervisor live on my block. 

                                 PETRA
                        That’s not my problem-- 

                                 GUNTER
                        Petra, we agreed. 

                                 PETER
                        Someone’s watching us.

           ACROSS THE STREET - HELGA watches from her front window. 

                                 GUNTER
                             (through his smile)
                        That’s Helga. She’s still pissed we 
                        lost the war. Hi, Helga! 
                                 PETRA
                        Hi, Helga!
                             (whispers)
                        Inside. Now.

           INT. WETZEL HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT

           Gunter’s little boys, Sam and Andrew, run under the huge, 
           billowing yellow cloth, their eyes big and full of wonder, 
           giggling as Petra stretches it through the hall. 

           Gunter screws a DOORBELL on the attic doorway.

                                 GUNTER
                        In case anyone comes in. You ring 
                        it and alert me. 

                                 PETRA
                        It’s going to look pretty weird 
                        having a doorbell for our attic. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Not as weird as I’ll look in 
                        prison. 

           Petra pales.

                                 GUNTER
                        Bad joke. 

           INT. WETZEL ATTIC - NIGHT

           Gunter sits behind a 40 year old foot pedal-sewing machine, 
           sewing the cloth together. Wind beats against the attic 
           window. Petra looks out. She can see Helga’s house.

                                 PETRA
                        Helga can see in here. 

           Gunter nails a blanket across the window. Not anymore. Gunter 
           sits down to sew the endless reams of cloth... 

           INT. WETZEL’S BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Peter connects the propane tanks into one main pipe. The 
           fiery sparks cast a strobing glow across the basement.

           Peter connects a stove pipe to the release valve. Cautiously 
           turns on the propane tanks. Hoses hiss. 

           He flicks his lighter at the stove pipe. No flame. Peter 
           checks the connections. Flicks his lighter again-- BOOM!
           A FIREBALL throws Peter across the basement, smashing into 
           shelves.

           INT. WETZEL HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The explosion shakes the house. 

           INT. HELGA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The house across the street-- Helga sits up in bed. 

                                 HELGA
                        Hans, did you hear that? 

                                 HELGA’S HUSBAND
                             (groans)
                        Go back to bed. 

           INT. WETZEL HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Ears ringing, Peter sits at the kitchen table, eyebrows 
           singed. He blinks, dazed. Gunter hands him a beer. 

                                 GUNTER
                        What happened? 

                                 PETER
                             (loudly)
                        Faulty petcock. 

                                 GUNTER
                        I have the same problem sometimes. 

           Gunter snickers. Peter laughs. All of their tension and worry 
           coming out in nervous laughter. Petra glares, aghast.

                                 PETRA
                        I want him out of here! 

           The two friends double over laughing.

           EXT. WETZEL HOUSE - NIGHT

           Peter and Gunter carry the tarp-covered burner to the car.

                                 GUNTER
                        Are you sure? The ex-mayor and your 
                        supervisor live on your street-- 

                                 PETER
                        I’m more afraid of your wife than I 
                        am of them. 
                                 GUNTER
                        Makes two of us. 

           They load the equipment into a BOX TRAILER on wheels. Lock it 
           with a padlock. They hitch the trailer to Peter’s car.

                                 GUNTER
                        Please be careful. 

                                 PETER
                        Please keep sewing. 

           Peter points to the sky. It’s turning grey. 

                                 PETER
                        We have to beat the weather! 

           EXT. STRELZYK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Peter parks in his driveway. Gets out. Eyes darting from 
           house to house as he walks to the wooden trailer.

                                 SUPERVISOR (O.S.)
                        Evening, comrade. 

           Peter’s stomach drops. His SUPERVISOR is walking on the 
           sidewalk. Peter crosses his arms, digging his fingernails 
           into his bicep.

                                 SUPERVISOR
                             (re: the trailer)
                        What have you got there? 

                                 PETER
                        For camping. 

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Ah. Finally getting some fresh air? 

           Peter forces a laugh.

                                 PETER
                        Yes, sir. 

           Supervisor walks of. Peter uncrosses his arms. Feels blood on 
           his fingers. Where he was digging his fingernails into his 
           arm, five half-moons are carved into his skin. 

           INT. STRELZYK HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Peter vomits into the toilet. 

                                 DORIS
                        Peter-- 
                                 PETER
                        I’m fine.

           He kneads his fist into his stomach, trying to get rid of the 
           searing pain in his gut. Doris could say something about the 
           stress, the danger, his lack of sleep-- instead she just 
           hands him a bottle of ulcer medicine. 

                                 PETER
                        Thank you.

           INT. STRELZYK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Peter tapes a “DO NOT ENTER” sign on the door to the garage. 
           He sees Frank watching him. Peter closes the door. 

           INT. PETER’S GARAGE - NIGHT

           Peter re-builds the burner. Checks the connections. Turns on 
           the propane tanks. Hesitantly, he lights his lighter--

           A tiny flame appears at the top of the burner rig. Peter 
           adjusts the valve and the flame grows higher.

                                 PETER
                        YES!

           INT. STRELZYK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

           Frank hears the muffled, happy shouts from the garage.

                                 FRANK
                        What’s dad building in there? 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh. You know your father. 

           Frank shakes his head at his mother’s deflection.

                                 FRANK
                        No. I don’t. 

           Doris doesn’t know how to respond to that. 

           INT. POSSNECK HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Stealing glances at Sonja, Frank is engrossed in his writing 
           as MR. WERMER lectures the class. 

                                 MR. WERMER
                        What are you writing, Strelzyk? 

                                 FRANK
                        Hm? Nothing--
           Frank tries to hide his notebook. Wermer snatches it. 

                                 MR. WERMER
                             (reads it aloud)
                        “Your hair is like fire that warms 
                        my heart...” 

           The class laughs. Sonja’s arched eyebrows rise.

                                 MR. WERMER
                        “Your eyes make me see world’s 
                        beyond my own.” 

           Mortified, Frank lowers his head onto his desk.

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           The PRINCIPAL sets down Frank’s poem.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        What do you mean by “Your eyes make 
                        me see world’s beyond my own?” 

           Frank shrugs. The Principal’s eye bore into Frank.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        What do you want to do with your 
                        life, Frank?

                                 FRANK
                        I dunno. Be a writer...? 

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Judging from this that’s not going 
                        to happen.
                             (snaps his fingers)
                        Farming. 

                                 FRANK
                        Farming? 

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Farming. 

                                 FRANK
                        But--

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        I’m going to recommend you be 
                        transferred to the vocational 
                        school for agriculture. 
                             (beat)
                        We all need to do our part. 
           EXT. POSSNECK - DAY

           Frank angrily drives home on his scooter. 

           INT. STRELZYK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Frank storms in, pushing open the door to the garage.

                                 FRANK
                        Dad, I need to talk to you-- 

           Gunter and Peter are lifting the burner into the metal frame. 

                                 PETER
                        Don’t you see the sign?!

                                 FRANK
                        What-- is that? 

                                 PETER
                        An agricultural seeding fan!!! Out! 

           Peter slams the door. Frank charges through the house.

                                 DORIS
                        What’s wrong? 

           Frank shoves past Doris into his bedroom. Slams the door. 

           Frank blasts his music, thrashing his arms through the air.

           IN THE HALL - Doris stands alone, listening to her son’s 
           muffled, angry cries. 

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

           Peter and Gunter walk through the woods to a large grassy 
           field. There is a 20 foot tall HUNTING BLIND and ladder 
           nearby. They climb it and overlook the Death Zone far below.

                                 PETER
                        It’s the perfect launch site... 

           IN THE CLEARING - Peter is wearing a homemade FLAMETHROWER 
           strapped to his back. Gunter stands far away, clutching a 
           fire extinguisher.

                                 GUNTER
                        You sure about this? 

                                 PETER
                        We need a way to get more heat into 
                        the balloon otherwise it’ll never 
                        lift. Trust me. 
           Peter slaps a WELDER’S HELMET down over his face.

           He sparks the end of the flamethrower--

           Whoosh! A jet of fire arcs from the nozzle across the 
           clearing, lighting up the night like a dragon’s flame.

           Peter shuts off the flamethrower. Lifts the helmet, smiles.

           Gunter and Peter laugh like two kids. Happy to escape the 
           confines of their drab lives for a moment. 

           A crackling sound. Smoke. A tree is on fire.

                                 GUNTER
                        Shit!

           Gunter rushes to extinguish the flaming tree.

           INT. STRELZYK BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Peter sneaks inside, slips into bed. Doris rolls over on her 
           pillow, eyes open. She’s been waiting up for him. 

                                 DORIS
                        When’s the last time you spoke with 
                        Frank?

           Peter can’t remember... 

                                 PETER
                        I’ll talk to him.

                                 DORIS
                        Do more than that. Otherwise-- what 
                        is all this for? If we save our 
                        family but lose our sons..?

           Peter curses himself. Doris kisses him.

                                 DORIS
                        I’m glad you’re home. I don’t sleep 
                        when you’re not home.

           She falls asleep. Peter is wide awake.

           INT. THE PEOPLE’S OWNED POLYMER FACTORY - DAY

           Eyelids drooping, Peter yawns, drinking Kaffe Mix coffee. His 
           stomach wrenches. He puts down his coffee, picks up ulcer 
           medicine. Downs it. 

           Sees out of the window: birds flying. Soaring free.  
           INT. GUNTER’S BASEMENT - DAY

           Gunter lights a torch under his home-built, one foot model of 
           a hot air balloon. 

                                 GUNTER
                        We shoot the flamethrower into the 
                        balloon-- inflate the bag, light 
                        the burner and... lift off. 

           The little balloon model floats in the air in a magical, 
           wondrous moment-- until it catches fire and drops to the 
           ground in a fiery mess, filling the basement with smoke.

                                 PETER
                        We need a better way to get the 
                        heat into the balloon. 

           Coughing, Gunter opens a window. He turns on a fan. Peter and 
           Gunter stare at the turning fan... an idea forms...

           INT. GUNTER’S GARAGE - DAY

           Gunter puts the finishing touches on a homemade sheet steel 
           fan with blades 4 feet long powered by a motorcycle engine.

           The high-powered fan blasts papers around the room.

                                 PETER
                        Brilliant, Gunter.

                                 GUNTER
                        Hope so. That’s my damn motorcycle 
                        engine.

           INT. PETER’S GARAGE - NIGHT

           The rig is finished. Doris and Petra inspect the stitching 
           and the iron frame. Steel posts in each of the four corners 
           are tied with nylon clothesline. Doris points at the wicker 
           basket in the picture.

                                 DORIS
                        Peter, this is a gondola. 
                             (re: the iron frame)
                        This is a piece of metal with 
                        clothesline tied around it. 

                                 PETER
                        We had to make some modifications 
                        for the weight. 

                                 DORIS
                        You saying I need to go on a diet? 
                                 PETER
                        No. You’re perfect. 

           Peter leads Doris to stand on the iron frame.

                                 PETER
                        You’ll stand here. Frank and 
                        Andreas will be here. Gunter and I 
                        will be by the burner... 

           The four adults stand on the rig. 

           Doris stands at the very edge, holding onto the post. She 
           looks down over the frame, imagining what it will be like... 

           She hears rushing air, wind blows her hair aside. 

           Doris feels light, aloft, frightened. Vertigo coming on-- 

           The rig rocks forward, tipping Doris slightly off balance.

           Doris screams, grabs the ropes. Clinging to them.

                                 PETER
                        You okay?

                                 DORIS
                        Yes. Fine. 

           Doris nods quickly. Pretends to be checking the metal posts.

                                 DORIS
                        Very secure. 

           Doris forces a smile. She is utterly terrified.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           1:30 AM. Night of the big test flight. 

           Frank peers out of his door as Peter and Doris creep past.

           EXT. WETZEL HOUSE - NIGHT

           Headlights off, Peter parks out front. Looks at his watch. 
           Petra and Gunter sneak out. 

           EXT. POSSNECK - NIGHT

           They drive through the quiet village. 

                                 PETER
                        See any police? 
                                 GUNTER
                        Nothing yet. 

           EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT

           Headlights beam through the low, swirling fog.

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

           UP IN THE HUNTING BLIND - Peter looks at the road below...

           IN THE CAR - Petra pours Schnapps into tiny glasses.

                                 PETRA
                        To keep us warm. 

                                 DORIS
                        And sane. 

           They clink and drink.

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        Clear.

           They all work together like an amateur, awkward pit crew.  
           Peter pulls on the clunky, homemade flamethrower. 

                                 PETRA
                        Is that thing safe?

                                 PETER
                        Of course. 

           Everyone takes a big step away from Peter.

           Gunter turns on the fan, the engine grinds loudly.

                                 PETER
                        Muffle that thing!

           Gunter throws blankets over the engine. They hold the balloon 
           open. Peter aims the flame thrower into the open end.

           SNAP! Something in the woods... they tense. A family of red 
           deer are watching from the trees, eyes aglow in firelight. 

           However-- the balloon is not inflating. Peter sweats in the 
           jet of fire. Determined to make this work. But the balloon 
           withers sadly. 

           Doris touches the flattening cloth. Feels it...
                                 DORIS
                        The fabric. The air’s going right 
                        through it. It’s too thin. Too 
                        porous. We need better cloth. 

           Petra feels the cloth, too. 

                                 PETRA
                        Yes. Definitely need thicker cloth. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Why didn’t you say something 
                        before?!

                                 PETRA
                        I didn’t know! Don’t blame me-- 
                        none of us here are experts--

                                 PETER
                             (through clenched teeth)
                        What kind of cloth do you suggest? 

           Doris narrows her eyes.

                                 DORIS
                        Taffeta? 

                                 PETRA
                        Oh, yes. Definitely taffeta. 

                                 GUNTER
                        What the hell is taffeta? 

                                 DORIS
                        It’s good cloth. Thick. 

                                 GUNTER
                             (sighs)
                        I have to sew a whole new balloon? 

                                 PETRA
                        More Schnapps, honey? 

           INT. PETER’S BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Gunter and Peter feed the balloon into the furnace. They 
           watch the balloon curl into the flames. 

                                 GUNTER
                        All our hard work. For nothing.

           Peter’s eyes glow in the flames. Not giving up.
                                 PETER
                        Let’s go get some taffeta.

           INT. STRELZYK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dinner. Peter’s mind is a million miles away.

                                 ANDREAS
                        Dad? Can we? 

                                 PETER
                        Can we what? 

                                 ANDREAS
                        Go camping this weekend? 

                                 PETER
                        No. I have to work. 

           Suspicious, Frank looks at his father.

                                 FRANK
                        On the weekend?

                                 PETER
                        Gunter and I are fixing up an old 
                        house. 

                                 FRANK
                        At one in the morning?

                                 PETER
                        What is this? 

                                 FRANK
                        You tell me. 

           Frank locks eyes with his father. Not backing down.

                                 PETER
                        I’m your father. I don’t have to 
                        tell you anything. Eat.

                                 FRANK
                        Why are you lying to us? 

                                 PETER
                        I’m not lying.

                                 FRANK
                        You’re worse than the Stasi.

           Frank storms off.
                                 PETER
                        You are not excused! Frank!

           Peter slams his fist into the table, startling everyone. 
           Andreas begins to cry. Doris scoops him up. 

           HALLWAY - Peter stalks after Frank--

                                 FRANK
                        This isn’t a family! It’s a 
                        dictatorship. 

           Frank slams his bedroom door in Peter’s face. There is a 
           mocking “DO NOT ENTER” sign taped to it. Sound of MUSIC 
           blasting from inside. Peter bangs on the door. 

                                 PETER
                        Turn that music off! 

           The music only gets LOUDER.

                                 PETER
                        Frank, I will break down this door 
                        in three, two-- 

           The music stops. Silence. Doris bobs Andreas in her arms. 

                                 DORIS
                             (soothing Andreas)
                        It’s okay, honey. 
                             (to Peter)
                        Calm down. 

                                 PETER
                        He has no respect for authority.

           Doris looks at Peter-- she’s not going to help him this time.

                                 DORIS
                        I wonder where he gets it from.

           She walks off, soothing Andreas. Peter is alone in the 
           hallway. He winces. Ulcer tearing into his gut. Peter 
           wrenches his fist into his gut, feeling like he and his 
           family are being ripped apart. 

           EXT. BERLIN - DAY

           THE BERLIN WALL - The fifteen foot high, brick and concrete 
           wall eclipses the late sun with endless miles of barbed wire, 
           watch towers, and an oppressive feeling of dread. 

           Peter and Gunter drive past, staring up at the monolithic, 
           impenetrable wall that barricades the city.
           EXT. BERLIN DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

           Gunter puts on a white sailing CAPTAIN’S HAT as he and Peter 
           enter the revolving doors of a large department store. 

           INT. BERLIN DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

           A lanky SALESMAN greets Gunter and Peter.

                                 GUNTER
                        We need a thousand feet of taffeta 
                        to make sails for our sailing club. 

           Gunter points to his sailor’s hat. See? Sailors.

                                 SALESMAN
                        I’ve never sold that much material.

                                 GUNTER
                        We would like to be your first.

           The Salesman studies them.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Wait right here.

           Salesman walks off, watching them.

                                 GUNTER
                             (whispers)
                        We should go. 

                                 PETER
                             (whispers)
                        We need this material--

                                 GUNTER
                        That salesman had Stasi eyes, Pete. 
                        This is Berlin, they’re everywhere. 
                        Jesus, I knew I shouldn’t have worn 
                        the hat.

           Peter sees a SALESWOMAN watching them. Now, more SALESPEOPLE 
           are watching them. A cold feeling slinks down Peter’s spine. 

                                 PETER
                        Let’s get out of here. 

           Peter and Gunter head toward the revolving door.

                                 SALESMAN
                        Sir? Sir! 
           Salesman stalks them. Snaps his fingers, points. A group of 
           SALESPEOPLE follow Gunter and Peter. They’re trapped.

                                 SALESMAN
                             (to his co-workers)
                        You see? I told you! These are the 
                        sailors-- 
                             (whispers to Peter and 
                              Gunter)
                        Because of the large size of your 
                        purchase, I will be awarded 
                        Salesman of the Month! I cannot 
                        thank you enough. 

           Gunter and Peter look at each other, stunned.

                                 GUNTER
                        You’re... welcome. 

           EXT. BERLIN DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

           The Salesman happily carries the enormous rolls of taffeta 
           into Peter’s orange Moskvitch car. 

                                 SALESMAN
                        Please come again!

           Peter drives off. Gunter realizes something.

                                 GUNTER
                        Did you pay cash?

                                 PETER
                        No, I wrote a check--

           Soon as he says it, he realizes his grave mistake.

                                 GUNTER
                        I’m sure it’ll be fine.

           But they both know it’s not going to be fine.

           INT. GUNTER’S ATTIC - NIGHT

           Gunter customizes the old sewing machine with a small 
           electric motor. It chugs to life, spinning wildly.

           BZZT! BZZT! The attic doorbell rings. Gunter freezes.

           DOWNSTAIRS - Petra is nervously pressing the doorbell as 
           Helga knocks on the front door. Petra slowly opens the front 
           door. Gunter rushes down from the attic. Helga enters with 
           her dog.
                                 HELGA
                        Ah, Gunter, I caught you! We hardly 
                        see you anymore. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Been busy. 

                                 HELGA
                        Not too busy for Helga’s famous 
                        Black Forest chocolate cake, hm? 

           Helga holds up a chocolate cake. The little boys cheer. Petra 
           and Gunter exchange worrisome looks. 

           KITCHEN - Helga devours her cake, feeds some to her dog.

                                 HELGA
                        Here there is no joblessness, 
                        evictions are forbidden, there’s 
                        very little crime-- 

           Petra makes eyes to Gunter: does she ever shut up?

                                 HELGA
                        And yet I see our neighbors 
                        pointing their TV antennae to the 
                        West to get Western television. Who 
                        needs to see that? Not me.

                                 PETRA
                        Not me.

           Helga’s dog wiggles out of its collar. Scrambles off.

                                 HELGA
                        Duchess! 

           The dog scrambles up the stairs, scratching the ATTIC DOOR. 

                                 HELGA
                        What do you smell up there, girl? 

                                 PETRA
                        That’s where I keep my crock pots. 

                                 GUNTER
                        That’s what you smell, isn’t it? 

           Gunter reaches for the dog. It snaps at him.

                                 HELGA
                        Duchess! Don’t be rude. 
                                 GUNTER
                        Well, thanks for coming. The boys 
                        have to be up early--

           They usher Helga out. Close the door. Hearts pounding.

                                 PETRA
                        This has to stop. 

           Gunter nods. He’s had enough.

                                 GUNTER
                        It will.

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

           The balloon, a patchwork of multi-colored material, inflates 
           as the blower and flamethrower fill it with air. It rises 
           majestically, glowing brightly. 

                                 PETER
                        It works... it works!  

           Peter and Gunter happily jump into the gondola. Peter turns 
           on the propane burner rig. The little flame ignites. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Up, up, and away! 

           The platform barely lifts five inches off the ground. It 
           hovers, then the gondola bumps down onto the grass. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Why aren’t we flying?

                                 PETER
                        Flame’s too small.

           The gas sizzles out. The fire dies. 

                                 GUNTER
                        And now the gas ran out. 

                                 PETER
                        We’ll fix that-- 

                                 GUNTER
                        What if it runs out mid-flight? 

                                 PETER
                        It won’t. It can’t. 

           The balloon deflates around them like a giant wet blanket. 
                                 PETER
                             (scribbling furiously)
                        If we add two more propane tanks we 
                        might be able to increase our 
                        lifting power-- 

                                 GUNTER
                        This is impossible.

                                 PETER
                        Two more tanks only adds five 
                        pounds--

                                 GUNTER
                        The burner flame’s too small to 
                        lift the whole thing, let alone 
                        eight people. 

                                 PETER
                        If we switch out the posts for 
                        aluminium that could reduce the 
                        weight--

                                 GUNTER
                        Who are we kidding, Peter? This 
                        thing’s never going to work. 

                                 PETER
                        It’s trial and error-- 

                                 GUNTER
                        It’s been nothing but error for six 
                        months! I haven’t slept more than 
                        three hours a night since we 
                        started. I don’t see my kids 
                        because I’m sewing a giant, useless 
                        bag until my fingers bleed. Petra’s 
                        pissed all the time. She’s 
                        convinced we’re being watched which 
                        means she won’t sleep with me which 
                        means I haven’t had sex since July 
                        which means I’m pissed all the 
                        time, too. And when I do sleep, I 
                        have nightmares about falling out 
                        of the sky in a fiery wreck-- and 
                        now, after six months of your 
                        bullshit I can jump higher than 
                        this goddam thing can fly! 

           And then, as if Gunter hasn’t said a word:

                                 PETER
                        We need to increase the gas 
                        pressure coming out of the tanks-- 
                                 GUNTER
                        Peter. 

                                 PETER
                        --the flame will get higher and 
                        we’ll have lift off. 

                                 GUNTER
                        It’s over. 

                                 PETER
                        Look. We’re tired. We’ll get some 
                        rest. Things will look different in 
                        the morning. 

                                 GUNTER
                        You’re not listening. I’m done. 

                                 PETER
                        Do you like being a prisoner in 
                        your own country, Gunter? Do you?

                                 GUNTER
                        Is that what this is about? Defying 
                        your country? 

                                 PETER
                        I’m not defying it, I’m trying to 
                        save it! We can’t give up. Not now. 
                        We’re so close--

                                 GUNTER
                        We’re not close, you’re just 
                        obsessed-- 

                                 PETER
                             (breaking)
                        Yes! I am! This is our lives-- my 
                        family’s life! Our lives! Nothing 
                        is more important than this. 
                        Nothing! 

           Gunter looks at Peter. Something’s off here.

                                 GUNTER
                        Are you in some kind of trouble?

           Peter itches his neck. Lights a cigarette. Gunter eyes him.

                                 GUNTER
                        We could stay. We don’t have to 
                        leave. But you act like every 
                        minute’s your last. Is there 
                        something you’re not telling me?
                                 PETER
                        You don’t want to know.

                                 GUNTER
                        Yes. Yes I do. Right now.

                                 PETER
                        I don’t want to implicate you.

           Gunter steps back, stunned.

                                 GUNTER
                        Don’t want to implicate me... what 
                        do you call this, asshole?! You put 
                        me in harm’s way! You risked my 
                        family’s life just to save your own 
                        ass?!

                                 PETER
                        I’m doing this for all of us! And 
                        if you’re too much of a coward to 
                        stand up and take a chance for once 
                        in your life then you can stay here 
                        and rot but get the hell out of my 
                        way!

           Gunter looks at Peter with venom.

                                 GUNTER
                        Stay away from me. And stay away 
                        from my family.

           They pack up in silence.

           EXT. WETZEL HOUSE - NIGHT

           Peter drops Gunter off at his house. A chasm between them.

                                 GUNTER
                        What are you going to do with it? 

                                 PETER
                        Throw it in the fire. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Another one in the fire. 

                                 PETER
                        It’s probably a good idea we don’t 
                        speak for a while. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Never’s good for me. 
           Gunter walks to his house. Peter watches him go. Drives off.

           EXT. VILLAGE OF POSSNECK - NIGHT

           Snow falls. Thick white blankets of snow cover the forest. 

           SUPER: December, 1978

           Alone in the woods, axe over his shoulder, Peter trudges 
           through knee-high powder. He chops down an evergreen with 
           angry swings, wood splitting, cracking, falling--

           INT. STRELZYK HOUSE - DAY

           Peter sets up the tree in the living room. The family 
           decorates it for Christmas. 

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

           Snow falls. Gunter lays bricks. Radio playing in the BG:

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)
                        The Soviet Union sent thirty 
                        thousand troops into Afghanistan to 
                        quell the United States backed 
                        Mujahideen Rebellion--

           EXT. POSSNECK - NIGHT

           New Years Eve in the GDR. As the village counts down to 
           Midnight... Gunter and Peter celebrate in their own homes 
           with distant, defeated expressions. 

           INT. PETER’S BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Peter drags the balloon down to the furnace. Opens the 
           furnace door into the roaring, beckoning fire. But he can’t 
           bring himself to throw it inside even though he knows he 
           should. As Peter slams the furnace door shut--

           EXT. THE PEOPLE’S OWNED POLYMER FACTORY - DAY

           Rain falls. Peter sees his CO-WORKER reading a newspaper: 
           FLEEING TRAITOR DIES ON BERLIN WALL. 

                                 CO-WORKER
                        They didn’t print her picture 
                        because she was pretty. They 
                        thought people would get upset. 

           The hint of sadness in his Co-Worker’s tone surprises Peter. 
           Co-Worker runs off, using the paper as an umbrella.
           Peter sees a ghostly figure with dead-eyes waiting for him. 
           JOSEF KELLER. 

                                 JOSEF
                        Hello, Peter. 

           INT. JOSEF’S CAR - DAY

           Rain pounds the car roof. They sit inside Josef’s parked car. 
           Both men are soaked from the rain. Windows foggy.

                                 JOSEF
                        I couldn’t stay here. Too many 
                        memories. 

                                 PETER
                        How’s Magda? 

                                 JOSEF
                        We divorced last month. 

                                 PETER
                        Jesus. Josef, I’m so sorry... 

                                 JOSEF
                        I want to leave, Peter. Escape. You 
                        were always talking. So many ideas-- 

           Peter sees that Josef keeps looking at the car’s AC vent.

                                 JOSEF
                        I thought, you of all people could 
                        get me out... 

                                 PETER
                             (shivers)
                        Mind if I turn on the heat? 

           Peter reaches for the heater controls-- Josef stops him. 

                                 JOSEF
                        It’s broken. 
                             (a slight smile)
                        Least it’s not as cold as the time 
                        we took the boys skiing. Remember?

                                 PETER
                        That cabin was freezing.

           Peter sees the radio antenna on Josef’s the car. Bulky,  
           familiar. A runny feeling slides down Peter’s stomach. 
                                 JOSEF
                        Peter... I know it was you who 
                        helped Lukas. Why won’t you admit 
                        it?

           An undercurrent of accusation and contempt in Josef’s voice. 
           Peter looks at his friend, emotional.

                                 PETER
                        Josef... I am so sorry... 

           Josef’s eyes flick to a BREAD VAN parked nearby. A bread van? 
           In the factory parking lot? Peter sees several large antennae 
           jutting from the top of the bread van.

                                 PETER
                        I can’t help you. 

           Peter gets out of the car. Into the falling rain.

                                 JOSEF
                        Peter--

                                 PETER
                        I’m sorry, Josef! 

           Peter runs into the rain. 

           INT. STRELZYK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Peter is coughing, shaking. Doris hands him tea.

                                 DORIS
                             (half-hopeful)
                        Maybe you’re being paranoid? 

                                 PETER
                        His car antennae. Same kind the 
                        Stasi use. Must have rigged it to 
                        record our conversation. 
                             (beat)
                        They got to him. And now--

           Peter coughs as he tries to light a cigarette. Doris takes 
           the cigarette away, puts a thermometer in his mouth.

                                 PETER
                        -- they’re after us. 
                             (regretfully)
                        I turned my back on my own 
                        friend... 

                                 DORIS
                        You had no choice--
                                 PETER
                        Is this what they want? To divide 
                        us? Tear us apart? 

                                 DORIS
                        Yes. That way we can’t unite and 
                        kick the living shit out of them.

           She feels his head. Checks the thermometer.

                                 DORIS
                        You have a fever. Let’s get you 
                        some rest. I’ll call work-- 

                                 PETER
                        No! I have to save my sick days. 

           He violently coughs. He looks up at his wife. Eyes pleading.

                                 PETER
                        We have to finish it, Doris. But I 
                        can’t do this without you. You’re 
                        my heart. My soul. I need you.

                                 DORIS
                        I’m here, Peter. Always. 

           He kisses her hands.

                                 DORIS
                        But you’re going to need more help 
                        than just me. 

           She brushes the hair from his eyes.

                                 DORIS
                        We need someone we can trust. 

           INT. FRANK’S ROOM - DAY

           Peter knocks on Frank’s door. Frank opens the door.

                                 PETER
                        Frank. We need to talk.

           INT. PETER’S GARAGE - DAY

           Peter leads Frank to the garage door.

                                 PETER
                        What I’m about to show you, you 
                        can’t tell anyone. No one can know. 
                        Not even your brother. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        This is life or death for all of 
                        us. Do I have your word? 

           Suddenly scared, Frank nods. Peter unlocks the door. 

           INT. PETER’S GARAGE - DAY

           Frank looks at the burner rig. He takes in the pictures, the 
           blueprints for the balloon. The fan. Propane tanks.

                                 FRANK
                        You want to fly a hot air 
                        balloon... over the Death Zone? 
                             (pause)
                        That’s your secret?

                                 PETER
                        Yes.

           Frank’s jaw hangs open. 

                                 PETER
                        I figured you and I fixed up that 
                        scooter of yours last summer-- 
                        maybe we can fix this.

                                 FRANK
                        You want my help?

                                 PETER
                        If I’d asked you sooner, we’d be 
                        living in the West by now. 
                             (pause)
                        We need to leave as soon as 
                        possible. 

                                 FRANK
                        Are we in trouble?

           Peter nods. Frank swallows. Fear in his eyes.

                                 PETER
                        I know it’s scary-- but you’re 
                        smart. You don’t think I see you, 
                        Frank, but I do. I see how strong 
                        you are. Stronger than you think. 

           This means more to Frank than he realized. He so wants his 
           father’s approval.

                                 PETER
                        Will you help me, Frank? 

           A smile spreads across Frank’s face. A lump in his throat. 
                                 FRANK
                        I’d love to, dad. 

           EXT. VILLAGE OF POSSNECK - DAY

           Ice melts under the spring sun. 

           SUPER: April, 1979. 

           EXT. STRELZYK HOUSE - DAY

           Doris watches from the window as Peter and Frank carry 
           propane tanks outside. She is pleased father and son are 
           working together but conflicted as to the danger they’re 
           embarking on.

                                 PETER
                        Empty that tank in the trash. 

           Frank fumbles the propane, opening the spigot. Gas shoots out 
           in a powerful blast, knocking over the trash can.

                                 FRANK
                        Sorry! It’s coming out a little 
                        fast.

           Frank tries to turn off the spigot but the propane is 
           shooting out like a GEYSER. Peter stares. Wheels turning.

                                 PETER
                        That’s how we increase the gas 
                        pressure... Frank, you’re a genius! 

                                 FRANK
                        I am? What’d I do?

           INT. PETER’S GARAGE - DAY

           Fiery sparks. Peter and Frank weld a rig that holds the 
           propane tanks UPSIDE DOWN. 

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Frank and Peter drag the burner rig into the clearing. The 
           propane tanks are now UPSIDE DOWN on the burner rig. 

                                 PETER
                        Stand back. 

           Peter lights the burner. The fire shoots FORTY FEET HIGH. 

                                 PETER & FRANK
                        Yes!!! 
           Their faces glow in the jet of firelight. 

           EXT. FOREST MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY

           Under a bold blue sky, Andreas runs with a kite.

           Frank holds the string. The kite launches. Doris and the 
           family watch the kite rise, cheering for it to fly.

           IN THE TREES - Peter takes Doris through the pines...

                                 DORIS
                        Where are we going?

           He leads Doris to a mountain cliff. 2,000 feet drop.

                                 DORIS
                        No-- no-- Peter!

                                 PETER
                        We’re far from the edge. You can do 
                        this. 

           Peter holds Doris, steadying her. 

                                 PETER
                        This is what it’s going to be like.

                                 DORIS
                        I don’t like this--

                                 PETER
                        You’re doing it. Look. 

           Doris opens her eyes. She is standing at the edge of the 
           mountaintop overlooking the vast valley below. Wind blows her 
           hair back. She is amazed at the empowering, thrilling feeling 
           inside of her. Doris screams in exhilaration and freedom.

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

           Sitting in the HUNTING BLIND, Peter studies the distant Death 
           Zone with binoculars. Frank is writing in his notebook. 

                                 PETER
                        What are you writing? 

                                 FRANK
                        Nothing. 

                                 PETER
                        Doesn’t look like nothing. 
                                 FRANK
                        It’s about some girl. But she’s 
                        never gonna read it.

                                 PETER
                        Why not?

                                 FRANK
                        ‘Cause my principal’s putting me in 
                        the agricultural program.

                                 PETER
                        You didn’t tell me this.

                                 FRANK
                        You’ve been busy. And, let’s be 
                        honest, I don’t really have a 
                        chance of being a real writer.

                                 PETER
                        Listen to me, Frank. The only 
                        person in this life who can tell 
                        you what to do is you. Not me, not 
                        your mother, not the State. This 
                        world is full of people who will 
                        tell you no, it’s not possible.  
                        But you can make your own destiny. 
                        So when they say look down, you 
                        look up. 

           Peter and Frank look up into endless the stars.

                                 PETER
                        Anything is possible.

           Frank smiles thankfully. Peter picks up the binoculars, 
           watches the spot-lights sweep the valley near the Death Zone. 

                                 PETER
                        Guards change posts at three 
                        fifteen. Write that down.

           Frank writes that down.

           EXT. VILLAGE OF POSSNECK - DAY

           A strange wind blows. Atop City Hall, the brass dragon 
           weather vane slowly spins.

           SUPER: July 3, 1979

           INT. FIRST BANK OF POSSNECK - DAY

           The bank is so packed and busy, it’s nerve-wracking.
                                 RADIO DJ (O.S.)
                        -- twenty mile an hour winds will 
                        be blowing from the North-- 

           At her desk, among the noise, Doris adds up numbers on a 
           calculator, copies them in an enormous bank book. 

           A small transistor radio plays quietly on her desk. 

                                 RADIO DJ
                        -- heading into the West... 

           Her breath seizes. Utterly terrified. She has dreaded and 
           hoped for this news. 

           INT. POSSNECK HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           In class, Frank stares out of the window. He can see the 
           weather vane swing in the breeze, aiming to the West. 

           His eyes widen. It’s happening. 

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Frank nervously walks up to Sonja. 

                                 FRANK
                        I-- wrote this for you.

           Frank quickly hands Sonja a poem, turns, briskly walks away.

           INT. STRELZYK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Peter smiles. All excitement and energy.

                                 PETER
                        Start packing! One bag only. We 
                        need to keep the weight down. 

           INT. FRANK AND ANDREAS’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Doris helps Andreas pack a small bag.

                                 ANDREAS
                        Where are we going? 

                                 DORIS
                        It’s a surprise. Bring only what 
                        you absolutely want. 

           Andreas grabs his SWISS ARMY KNIFE then... his teddy bear. 
           INT. PETER’S CLOSET - NIGHT

           Peter quickly removes a stack of cash from a shoebox that 
           Doris has been withdrawing from the bank. He zips the cash in 
           his jacket. 

           INT. PETER & DORIS’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Alone, Doris opens a jewelry box. Her nervous fingers trace 
           over family heirlooms... she packs them in a small bag. 

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           VALIUM. Doris takes two. She breaks a pill in half.

                                 DORIS
                        Andreas-- honey? 

           Peter sees Doris give Andreas half a Valium.

                                 DORIS
                        I don’t want him getting fidgety in 
                        the air and-- God forbid. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Peter peeks through the curtains, watching the lights in the 
           neighbor’s houses turn off... all is calm, quiet.

           INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           Frank helps Peter fold the balloon into the trailer. 

                                 PETER
                        Where’s your mother? We have to go. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Doris opens a photograph album of the family. She lingers on 
           pictures of the boys, Peter, and herself from years past 
           playing outside of the house. Peter enters.

                                 DORIS
                        I remember when we first walked 
                        into this house. The wiring was all 
                        wrong, lights wouldn’t turn on-- we 
                        fixed it.
                             (beat)
                        Frank took his first steps here... 
                        Andreas spoke his first words 
                        there... birthday parties. Dinners 
                        with you. So many memories. 
                                 PETER
                        We’ll make new ones. Enough to fill 
                        a thousand houses.

           He holds her hands. 

                                 PETER
                        There’s no one else I’d rather make 
                        them with.

           She nods, wipes her eyes. They walk out of the bedroom. One 
           last look at their house... Doris shuts off the lights. 

           EXT. STRELZYK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Peter attaches the trailer to the hitch as the family quietly 
           loads into the car, careful not to wake the neighbors.

           EXT. VILLAGE OF POSSNECK - NIGHT

           Doris and Frank glance back in their rearview mirror as 
           Possneck recedes from view. Peter’s eyes are locked on the 
           road ahead. Andreas snores in the backseat.

           EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

           Headlights throw eerie shadows through the trees. 

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

           They unravel the balloon.... Peter hammers iron pegs into the 
           grass, roping down the gondola. 

                                 FRANK
                        Can I do the flamethrower? 

                                 PETER
                        You can start the fan. 

           IN THE HUNTING BLIND - Doris keeps watch with binoculars.

                                 DORIS
                        Clear! 

           They inflate the balloon. It rises like a giant waking from a 
           nap. Doris’s eyes widen as the great, homemade balloon 
           blossoms with a fiery glow. 

                                 DORIS
                        I never expected it to be this 
                        beautiful... 

           Peter smiles at her in the fiery light. 
                                 DORIS
                        Andreas. Wake up. We’re going on 
                        our trip. 

           Andreas wakes in the backseat. He rubs his eyes and sees the 
           hovering hot air balloon.

                                 ANDREAS
                        In that? 

           Frank holds out his hand to his younger brother. 

                                 FRANK
                        Just hold my hand.

           Andreas takes his older brother’s hand. Frank lifts him into 
           the gondola, sitting him beside Doris.

                                 DORIS
                        Hang onto me, baby. Whatever you 
                        do, don’t look down. 

                                 ANDREAS
                        I won’t.

                                 PETER
                        Judging from the winds, we should 
                        be-- twenty-three minutes in the 
                        air. 

           Peter sets his watch. Looks across their scared faces.

                                 PETER
                        Twenty-three minutes. Just a few 
                        moments of courage and we’ll be 
                        free for the rest of our lives. 
                             (pause)
                        We can do this. We’re a family.     
                        Cut the lines! 

           Frank leans out of the gondola frame and severs the ropes.

                                 PETER
                        Hold onto each other.

           The balloon lifts off the ground with surprising speed. Frank 
           leans out, watching the ground drop away.

                                 DORIS
                        Frank, get away from there!

                                 PETER
                        Sit down, Frank. 
           Tree branches rush past as the balloon rises higher.

           THE NIGHT SKY 

           The balloon launches over the trees. Peter stands at the 
           burner, checking the gas, checking his homemade altimeter. 

           Doris has her eyes closed, clutching the boys.

                                 PETER
                        You’re doing great, Doris. 

                                 DORIS
                        Just tell me when we land.

           The balloon soars higher along the starry horizon. Above the 
           ruins of a Medieval castle. Hair blowing aside, Peter looks 
           at Frank and Andreas-- their faces filled with pure awe. They 
           float through the air, dreamlike. Full of wonder.

                                 ANDREAS
                        Mommy, look...

           Doris cracks open an eye-- taking in the majestic sight of 
           city lights passing below... it’s breath-taking.

                                 FRANK
                        How high up are we, dad? 

           Peter checks his homemade altimeter. 

                                 PETER
                        Six thousand feet. 

                                 FRANK
                             (whispers)
                        Is that too high? 

           Yes. But Peter doesn’t say anything.

                                 ANDREAS
                        Are we there yet?

           Peter looks out-- stars VANISH. The air grows cold. Damp.

           They are at the edge of an enormous, grey cloud. Something 
           ominous about it. The mammoth fog swallows them.

           IN THE CLOUDS - Haunting, misty fog. Tendrils of ethereal 
           vapor swirl like ghosts. 

           Tink. Tink. Streams of water tinkle against the gondola. 
                                 ANDREAS
                             (excited)
                        We’re in the rain!

           Peter looks up-- rivulets of water stream down the edge of 
           the balloon. WET PATCHES BLOSSOM ON THE CLOTH. 

                                 DORIS
                        What’s wrong? 

                                 PETER
                        The condensation. It’s weighing us 
                        down.

           Peter fires up the burner, but the balloon DESCENDS.

                                 DORIS
                        Is everything okay? 

           Peter doesn’t answer. He opens up the valve, BLASTING THE 
           BALLOON with fire. The gas SPUTTERS. Dies. The beautiful 
           flame that was giving them light and warmth VANISHES.

           The balloon plunges. Wind shrieks. The gondola shakes. 

           Doris clutches Andreas and Frank. Holding in her screams. 

           PETER’S POV - A silver fence glitters below.

           The DEATH ZONE. The balloon is about to land on it.

                                 PETER
                        Hold on! 

           He pulls a strap, opening a FLAP on top of the balloon. They 
           plunge faster, veering backward. 

           EXT. SOUTH FOREST - NIGHT

           TREE TOPS KNIFE UP. Snapping branches. The balloon tips. 

           The altimeter, knife, wrench, and compass slide off the 
           gondola. Peter grabs for them but they spiral down--

           WHAM! The gondola crashes into the ground, the corner plows 
           through the earth, kicking up waves of dirt-- 

           The balloon is DRAGGING them toward the razor wire.

                                 PETER
                        We need to jump! 
           Peter throws their suitcases. Frank leaps off the gondola, 
           rolling onto the ground. The balloon begins to rise. The 
           gondola is now lifting BACK INTO THE AIR. 

           Doris hesitates-- LEAPS. Cradling Andreas, Peter jumps. 

           They collapse into a heap of pine and earth.

           Twisting and flailing in a tangle, the balloon floats off, 
           vanishing into the night.

                                 ANDREAS
                        Our balloon..! 

                                 DORIS
                        Did we make it? Are we in the West? 

           Peter looks through the binoculars.

                                 PETER
                        I can’t tell which side we landed 
                        on... 

           Frank finds something on the ground. A piece of trash.

                                 FRANK
                        We’re still in the East. 

           He holds up a crushed box of Kaffe Mix.

                                 PETER
                        No, no, no--

           Everyone stares in horror and defeat. 

                                 PETER
                        We need to go. Now.

                                 FRANK
                        But we’re so close... 

           Peter fetches their luggage.

                                 PETER
                        Pretty soon they’re going to find 
                        that balloon and then they’re going 
                        to find us-- we need to leave here, 
                        find the nearest road and follow it 
                        back to the car--  

           Peter walks off-- Doris grabs him.

                                 DORIS
                        Peter-- ! 
           Peter stops. His foot is inches away from a TRIP-WIRE. 

           Peter’s breath trembles. He looks across the forest to a 
           mounted SM-70 mine. Peter slowly steps away from the 
           shimmering wire. Doris looks across the dark forest.

                                 DORIS
                        It’s so dark-- we can’t see all the 
                        wires...

                                 PETER
                             (thinking)
                        Okay. Okay.  We’ll stay here. Hide. 
                        Wait for daylight. 

                                 ANDREAS
                        You just said we have to leave!

           Andreas starts to cry. Peter scoops him up. 

                                 PETER
                        It’ll be like camping, see?

           Doris finds a small hollow in the base of a tree. She sits 
           Andreas there, holding him. 

                                 ANDREAS
                        This is nothing like camping. 

                                 FRANK
                        Sure it is, Andreas. We don’t need 
                        a sleeping bag. We can just lie 
                        here and look up at the stars and 
                        be real quiet...

           Frank nestles beside his little brother. The family huddles 
           together, holding each other, looking up at the stars. 
           Shivering like frightened animals, too afraid to speak.

           EXT. SOUTH FOREST - MORNING

           Early morning light rises through the trees. Peter hasn’t 
           slept, eyes wide, scanning the forest. He sees Frank is also 
           awake. Sunlight shines across a nearby trip-wire.

                                 PETER
                        Keep your eyes open. Walk very, 
                        very slowly. 

                                 DORIS
                        We’ll play follow the leader. 

           Carefully they walk over the trip-wire... 
                                 ANDREAS
                        I see one! Over there!

                                 PETER
                        Good, Andreas. Very good. 

           EXT. BACK ROAD - SUNRISE

           The family walks along the foggy road, carrying their 
           luggage, looking like lost tourists.

           A large red deer with a crown of antlers emerges from the 
           woods. It stops, looks at the family. They look back at it. A 
           mystical moment. The deer trots off.

           EXT. DEATH ZONE - DAY

           Rifles out, guards are running--

                                 GUARD
                        Over here! 

           COMMANDER HORST pulls up in a military jeep. He joins the 
           guards as they stare up at-- hanging limply in the trees, the 
           ragged balloon. 

                                 GUARD
                             (wonderstruck)
                        It’s a balloon... 

           Horst shoots the guard a hard look. Guards cut down the 
           balloon. It crashes to the ground.

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           Dobermans lead a pack of guards through the woods. A dog 
           lunges into the clearing, snarling at the ground. Peter’s 
           homemade altimeter is sticking out of the mud nearby his 
           wrench, compass, and knife.

                                 HORST
                        Keep searching. Whatever lunatic 
                        flew this thing is either dead or 
                        hiding. 

           EXT. BORDER TOWN- DAY

           A GERMAN BEER HALL band plays a bouncy OOMPA-PA-PA tune. East 
           Germans happily drink steins of frothy beer. 

           Peter, Doris, Frank, and Andreas walk through the bustling 
           town of Lobenstein, feeling strange and alien. The band is 
           hammering away, adding to the surrealness of their situation. 
                                 PETER
                        Just act naturally. 

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah, right. 

           They make their way through the revelry. Stomp. Stomp. Stomp. 
           20 GDR SOLDIERS march through the town. Peter pulls his 
           family into an alley... tanks, jeeps roll past. 

           People cheer for the soldiers. Soldiers wave to the crowds.

                                 DORIS
                        It’s a parade. 

           EXT. ROUTE 90 - DAY

           Exhausted. Feet dragging. Peter picks up Andreas. 

           INT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY

           Peering through the trees, Peter finds his car. The fan, the 
           flamethrower. Exactly where they left it. In the daylight, 
           the objects look useless and small. 

                                 PETER
                        Clear.

           The others rush in. They throw everything in the car.

           EXT. VILLAGE OF POSSNECK - DAY

           They drive past the “Welcome to Possneck” sign.

           EXT. STRELZYK HOUSE - DAY

           Peter cautiously opens the front door, worried the police 
           will be waiting for them. They enter the house they thought 
           they left for good. Doris shuts the curtains. Frank and 
           Andreas flop onto their beds and fall asleep. 

           INT. PETER’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Peter lights up the furnace. The fire RAGES. He shoves the 
           blueprints, sketches, and the newspaper photograph of the 
           colorful balloons into the fire. 

           Peter watches the whole thing burn. Doris enters.

           Peter rips open his shirt. He tears at the money strapped to 
           his chest. She puts her hand on his shoulder.

                                 PETER
                        I... I’m so sorry.
           He grabs her hand, clutching it. He’s in tears. 

                                 PETER
                        I failed... I failed you...

           She holds him as he breaks, unable to hold it in any longer.

           INT. MINISTRY OF STATE SECURITY - FIRING RANGE - DAY

           BANG! BANG! Zental shoots a target clean through its paper 
           heart. An officer yells for him. Zental holsters his handgun.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Zental and twenty utterly confounded Stasi Agents are staring 
           down at Peter’s tools which are neatly laid out on a table. 

                                 ZENTAL
                        A balloon..? 

           Zental turns around and we see more officers are inspecting 
           the entire sewn balloon, the burner rig...

                                 HORST
                        I found it, sir. 

           HORST is standing at attention.

                                 ZENTAL
                        This is the second escape attempt 
                        in your district, Horst. 

                                 HORST
                        With respect, sir, my men are doing 
                        everything to find these traitors-- 

                                 ZENTAL
                        Well, it’s not enough! Your 
                        district is a breeding ground for 
                        rebellion.

                                 HORST
                        If I had more guards-- 

                                 ZENTAL
                        You can’t do the job with what 
                        you’ve got, why should we give you 
                        more? 

           Horst swallows, visibly shaken. The other Stasi like seeing 
           Horst get torn to shreds. 
                                 OFFICER KAASE
                        Captain Zental. There are no hot 
                        air balloon companies in East 
                        Germany or Poland--

                                 ZENTAL
                        See these welding points? This 
                        stitching. The craftsmanship... 
                        someone knew what they were doing. 
                        A builder, an engineer, someone in 
                        construction, that’s who we’re 
                        looking for. 

           Zental feels the clothing.

                                 ZENTAL
                        Is this cotton? 

                                 OFFICER VERLAG
                        One of the secretaries identified 
                        it as taffeta. 

                                 ZENTAL
                        Where would one get this much 
                        taffeta? 

                                 OFFICER VERLAG
                        Department store?

                                 ZENTAL
                        Search them.

                                 OFFICER VERLAG
                        Which ones?

                                 ZENTAL
                        All of them.

                                 OFFICER VERLAG
                        That will take some time--

                                 ZENTAL
                        So take it. Surely someone made a 
                        large purchase they’d remember.
                             (re: Horst)
                        And get this man more guards. 

                                 HORST
                        Thank you, Captain-- 

                                 ZENTAL
                        Do not disappoint me. 
           Horst knows this is a threat. A photographer comes forward 
           takes a picture of the table of tools. As the camera FLASHES-- 

           EXT. NEWS STAND - DAY

           The cover of the newspaper. A picture of the tools with the 
           headline: HELP US FIND THE TRAITORS. 

           Gunter, walking past, stops. 

                                 GUNTER
                             (reading)
                        “...homemade... hot air balloon..?” 

           Gunter’s gone white.

           INT. THE PEOPLE’S OWNED POLYMER FACTORY - DAY

           As Peter works, it feels like everyone is watching him. His 
           Supervisor. His Managers. Do they know? Do they suspect him? 
           FLICK, FLICK. His shaking hands try to light his cigarette.

           INT. FIRST BANK OF POSSNECK - DAY

           Doris can’t concentrate either. She glances around the 
           office, feeling the eyes of her co-workers. 

                                 RADIO DJ (O.S.)
                        Officials are looking for any 
                        information about the traitors-- 

           A cluster of CO-WORKERS gather around the radio.

                                 CASHIER
                        They tried to escape in a hot air 
                        balloon. Can you believe it? 

           Doris forces a laugh. It’s louder than it should be.

                                 CO-WORKER
                        It’s incredible. Like a fairy tale. 

           Doris hides a slight smile at the people’s inspiration.

                                 CASHIER
                        The Stasi will catch them. 

                                 CO-WORKER
                        They always do. 

           Doris’s smile fades.
           INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           Frank miserably sits back at his desk.

                                 MR. WERMER 
                        This week Skylab, the failure of 
                        the American Space Program that 
                        cost the American tax payers two 
                        billion dollars will come crashing 
                        down to Earth in a fiery wreck--

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Frank walks dejected down the hallway. Sonja stops him.

                                 SONJA
                        You. 

           Frank tenses. Does she know? She holds up Frank’s poem. 

                                 SONJA
                        Write me another one! 

           She kisses Frank on the cheek, runs off. As Frank brightens--

           INT. STRELZYK LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Clock ticking. Peter looks out of the curtain. 

                                 DORIS
                        Please stop. You’re making me 
                        nervous. 

           Peter paces. Lights a cigarette.

                                 DORIS
                        Don’t smoke inside. And please stop 
                        pacing. 

                                 PETER
                        So what do you want me to do? 

                                 DORIS
                        I want you to stop shouting. 

           Peter rubs his face. At the end of himself. Shattered.

                                 PETER
                        I’m sorry I put you all through 
                        this... I made a promise I couldn’t 
                        keep.

           The fire is utterly gone from his voice.
                                 PETER
                        And we almost died because of me 
                        and my stupid dream. I was just 
                        lying to myself...

           They have never seen Peter like this and it scares them.

                                 PETER
                        Now they will find us. And they 
                        will take us all away. And that 
                        will be the end of our family.

           Ashamed, Peter walks into the garage. Hiding his tears.

           INT. PETER’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Frank follows Peter inside.

                                 FRANK
                        Dad... 

                                 PETER
                        Not now, Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        Sounds like there’s only one thing 
                        we can do. Build another. 

                                 PETER
                        No, son. 

                                 FRANK
                        We have to-- 

                                 PETER
                        You almost died. We almost died. 

                                 FRANK
                        We flew. In something we built.

           Frank’s eyes are filled with fire.

                                 FRANK
                        You can’t give up now. That’s what 
                        you always say, isn’t it? No matter 
                        what, don’t give up-- keep hope? 
                        Was all that lies?

           Peter doesn’t have an answer. Frank storms out. Peter looks 
           at the empty corkboard. Frank comes back in with his clunky 
           TAPE PLAYER.
                                 FRANK
                        I’ve listened to you. Now you 
                        listen to me. 
                             (beat)
                        This is the tape Lukas gave me.

           Frank presses play. The bootleg mixtape spins.                    

           “Heroes” by David Bowie plays. 

                                 FRANK
                        Do you hear that? Standing by the 
                        Wall. This guy’s singing about us. 

           The song fills the garage. Frank speaks the lyrics:

                                 FRANK
                        We can beat them. Forever and ever. 
                        We can be heroes. Just for one day.

           Peter stares, breathless. Doris and Andreas appear.

                                 DORIS
                        Listen to your son, Peter.

                                 PETER
                        You-- you want to try again?

           She takes a breath. Nods.

                                 PETER
                        But you were terrified! 

                                 DORIS
                        More than anything in the world.

           She stands tall. Proud.

                                 DORIS
                        But I did it.

                                 ANDREAS
                        I did it, too. 

           Peter looks at the faces of his family. Their belief in him 
           and the mission wells up inside of him, re-lighting his fire.

           EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

           Gunter is miserably laying bricks. 

                                 PETER 
                        We need to talk. 
           Gunter startles. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Damn right we need to talk-- what’s 
                        my wrench doing on the front page 
                        of the newspaper?! 

           CONSTRUCTION WORKERS walk past. 

                                 GUNTER
                        So you see the bricks here will be 
                        about ten feet high-- 

           The construction workers to pass.

                                 PETER
                             (whispers)
                        We flew, Gunter.

           That stops Gunter. He has so many questions... doesn’t dare 
           ask them here.  

                                 PETER
                        Come by the house for dinner 
                        tonight. Doris would love to see 
                        you.

           INT. STRELZYK HOUSE - NIGHT

           With great urgency, the Wetzels and the Strelzyks meet again.

                                 GUNTER
                             (reading the paper aloud)
                        The People’s Police ask for your 
                        help finding the traitors?! 

                                 PETRA
                        It’s everywhere! All over the news! 
                        Even on TV. Because of you, my 
                        family might go to prison!

                                 DORIS
                        We’re not going to solve anything 
                        by getting emotional! 
                             (beat)
                        We’re German for God’s sake. Let’s 
                        act like it. 

                                 PETER
                        I am sorry we are in this situation 
                        but we are in this situation. And 
                        if we’re going to escape, we have 
                        to work together. 
                                 GUNTER
                        No. The damn thing doesn’t even 
                        work--

                                 PETER
                        It does. We turned the propane 
                        tanks upside down. The flame was 
                        forty feet high! 

           Gunter thinks about this. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Of course. Why didn’t I think of 
                        that? 

                                 PETER
                        Frank thought of it! 

                                 GUNTER
                        Frank! Ha! Good lad! 

                                 PETER
                        We were six thousand feet in the 
                        air! A mile and a half off the 
                        ground! 

                                 DORIS
                        You should have seen it.

                                 GUNTER
                        Wow.

           Petra glares. Gunter straightens, pretends not to care.

                                 PETRA
                        If it works then why are you still 
                        here?

                                 PETER
                        We were seconds away from crossing 
                        the border. But there was a cloud-- 

                                 GUNTER
                        I warned you about the clouds. 

                                 PETER
                        We needed our Navigator.

                                 DORIS
                        Now they’re coming for us. And if 
                        they get to us, they’ll get to you-- 

                                 PETRA
                        Is that a threat? 
                                 DORIS
                        It’s a fact. 

                                 PETER
                        We have to build another balloon. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Another?  

                                 PETER
                        And we need to build it fast. Two 
                        weeks at the most. But that only 
                        happens if we do this together. 

           Peter looks at Gunter.

                                 PETER
                        I was wrong to drag you into this 
                        in the first place. I’m sorry.

           Gunter is caught off guard by Peter’s confession.

                                 GUNTER
                        You didn’t drag me into anything. I 
                        wanted to leave. Just needed 
                        someone crazier than me to talk me 
                        into it. And for the record, the 
                        balloon was my idea. 

                                 PETER
                        That’s why you’re the Navigator.  

           Gunter smiles.

           INT. PETER’S GARAGE - NIGHT

           The bootleg mixtape blasts “Judy Is a Punk” as Peter, Gunter, 
           and Frank weld a new gondola frame together. 

           INT. RUDOLSTADT DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

           Doris purchases a roll of yellow taffeta. Smiles to clerk.

                                 DORIS
                        I’m making a ball gown.

                        I’m making curtains. 
           INT. OBERLAN STORE - DAY

           Gunter purchases a roll of polka dot taffeta.

                                 GUNTER
                        I just really like polka dots. 

           INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

           Rolls and rolls of colorful fabrics. Doris and Petra cut up 
           the piecemeal fabrics as Gunter sews the materials together. 
           Peter enters, dumps another bolt of cloth on the floor.

           EXT. BERLIN DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

           Zental, Verlag, and Kaase enter the store.

           INT. BERLIN DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

           Standing before his EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH photograph, the 
           lanky salesman smiles at Zental.

                                 SALESMAN
                        I remember! Two men needed the 
                        material for their sailboats. 

                                 ZENTAL
                        You said you brought the material 
                        to their car. Do you remember what 
                        kind of car they were driving? 

                                 SALESMAN
                        I remember it was orange because I 
                        hate the color orange. It wasn’t a 
                        Trabant. It was a Moskvitch!

                                 ZENTAL
                             (to his officers)
                        Get the sales records and find that 
                        car.

           EXT. USED CAR LOT - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Peter parks. Speaks with the SALESMAN about the Moskvitch. 

           Peter trades in his orange Moskvitch car. He drives off in a 
           smaller, clunky BLUE WARTBURG CAR.
           INT. HELGA’S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

           Forking cake into her mouth, Helga watches Doris and Petra 
           enter the Wetzel’s house with reams of fabric. 

           Helga looks to a newspaper article about the hot air balloon. 

                                 HELGA
                        Hans! Hans! The neighbors. They’re 
                        the balloon people! 

           Her HUSBAND groans in bed, cuddled up next to their tiny dog.

                                 HELGA’S HUSBAND
                        Go back to sleep, Helga. 

                                 HELGA
                        They’re always carrying fabric into 
                        the house but I haven’t seen the 
                        boys wearing new clothes--

                                 HELGA’S HUSBAND
                        The only balloon I see is the size 
                        of your ass from all that cake. 

           Helga stands there, insulted-- she picks up her husband’s 
           shirt from the dresser and rips it.

                                 HELGA’S HUSBAND
                        My shirt! 

           Helga marches out with the shirt. Her dog leaps out of bed 
           and follows her to--

           INT. WETZEL HOUSE - NIGHT

           Petra and Doris freeze in the middle of cutting fabric as 
           Helga knocks on the front door. BZZT! BZZT! Petra rings the 
           attic doorbell. Gunter stops sewing. Petra answers the door.

                                 HELGA
                        I hate to bother you at this late 
                        hour but--

           Helga holds up the ripped shirt.

                                 HELGA
                        Hans ripped his good shirt. Could I 
                        borrow that sewing machine of 
                        yours? 

                                 PETRA
                        It’s almost midnight--
                                 HELGA
                        He needs it for work and his other 
                        shirts are in the laundry. 

           Helga shoves the door-- Petra stops it.

                                 PETRA
                        No. 

                                 HELGA
                        But-- we’re neighbors. 

                                 PETRA
                        That doesn’t mean you just barge in 
                        here whenever you want.

                                 HELGA
                        You’re acting very strange. 

           Petra slams the door. Locks it. 

                                 PETRA
                        Goodnight, Helga! 

           INT. HELGA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Helga huffs. Marches back to her house. Dog following.

                                 HELGA
                        Police? This is Helga Grum. I want 
                        to report mysterious activity. 

           EXT. VILLAGE OF POSSNECK - DAY

           Sonja sits on the back of Frank’s scooter. Wind in Frank’s 
           face, he is beaming at having Sonja with him.

           EXT. LAKE - DAY

           The sky is mirrored on the lake’s surface. Sonja lounges in 
           the sun. Franks nervously holds a handwritten short story.

                                 FRANK
                        Sonja... this is a short story I 
                        wrote. Would you read it? 

           She smiles, takes it. Frank beams.

                                 SONJA
                        Now I have something to ask you.
                             (beat)
                        Will you join the Free German 
                        Youths? 
                                 FRANK
                             (laughs)
                        Those guys? They’re like the 
                        Communist successor to the Hitler 
                        Youth-- 

                                 SONJA
                        Frank Strelzyk, they are not! They 
                        uphold good, East German values. 
                        Security. Solidarity. Protection. 

                                 FRANK
                        I... didn’t know you were so 
                        involved... 

                                 SONJA
                        It’s fun! East Germany’s 30 year 
                        celebration is coming up. 

           Sonja slowly begins kissing Frank’s neck... 

                                 SONJA
                        We can go to the festival of 
                        Political Songs together... 

           She nibbles Frank’s ear, whispering hotly:

                                 SONJA
                        Hand out pamphlets... 

           Her hand snakes into his pants--

           INT. CIVIC CENTER - NIGHT

           Frank recites a pledge under a “Free German Youths & 
           Acceptance to the Community of Socialist Workers” banner.

                                 FRANK
                        I pledge myself to the progress of 
                        the State, the Party, and the 
                        working class. 

           In the audience, Sonja beams at Frank. Peter and Doris look 
           very concerned. This could ruin everything.

           INT. WETZEL HOUSE - DAY

           BANG! BANG! Petra peeks out of the window, utterly terrified  
           as OFFICERS STURM and DRANG bang on the front door.

                                 OFFICER DRANG 
                        Police. We need to search your 
                        house. 
                                 PETRA
                        What for? 

                                 OFFICER STURM
                        Open the door.

           Drang and Sturm shove inside. Petra’s heart pounds. The cops 
           search her living room, the bedrooms. They throw back the 
           rug, slide the couch away. 

           Little SAM starts crying. Petra scoops him up. 

           Drang spots the doorbell screwed on the attic doorway. He 
           smiles as if he’s found a clue. 

                                 PETRA
                        Sometimes when I sew, it’s hard to 
                        hear the children...

           Drang and Sturm climb up to the attic. 

           INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

           Drang and Sturm crash inside... the attic is empty except for 
           the sewing machine. The balloon is gone. 

           EXT. WETZEL HOUSE - DAY

           As Drang and Sturm drive off, Petra sees across the street, 
           Helga watching. Petra scowls. Helga closes her curtain.

           INT. PETER’S GARAGE - NIGHT

           The balloon has been tucked inside Peter’s garage. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Good thing we moved it here. 

           Petra glares at Gunter. The two families are going through a 
           practice run. Petra and Doris inspect every inch. Peter chews 
           his finger, watching them go over the rig.

                                 PETER
                        Well..? 

           Petra and Doris look at Peter.

                                 DORIS
                        You passed. 

           Peter and Gunter shake hands, proud of their work. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Built in record time. 
                                 PETRA
                        Now what? 

                                 PETER
                        Now we pray for wind. 

           EXT. SKIES OVER POSSNECK - DAY

           Not a breeze in the sky. 

           EXT. POSSNECK MARKET - DAY

           A long line of SHOPPERS waits to enter the market. Doris 
           waits at the end of the line, staring up at the sky...

           A shadow crosses her face. A red banner is raised above main 
           street. “Celebrate 30 Years of the GDR.” 

           EXT. CHURCH - DAY

           As Gunter walks up the steps, he sees banners and posters are 
           being raised. “30 years of Eternal Friendship With the Soviet 
           Union, the Life Force of the GDR.”  

           Posters of GDR leader, Erich Honecker, are put up, looming 
           watching. The celebration is like a dark spectre closing in.

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           Gunter lights a candle. He kneels down to pray. The candle 
           flames flicker...

           EXT. VILLAGE OF POSSNECK - DAY

           A breeze whispers through the trees... the weather vane 
           spins. “30 YEARS GDR” flags flap like wind socks.

           EXT. THE PEOPLE’S OWNED POLYMER FACTORY - DAY

           Peter’s hair is blown aside in the wind. His eyes sparkle.

                                 WEATHER REPORT (O.S.)
                        A cold front from the South brings 
                        warm winds blowing West...

           INT. STRELZYK HOUSE - SUNSET

           Listening to the radio, Peter smiles at his family.

                                 WEATHER REPORT 
                        -- expect a balmy summer breeze all 
                        through the weekend... 
                                 PETER
                        We go tomorrow night. 

           INT. PETER’S GARAGE - NIGHT

           Peter checks the burner, the tanks. Frank stands, unsure.

                                 FRANK
                        What if... I didn’t go? 

                                 PETER
                        What?

                                 FRANK
                        It’s just-- things are going really 
                        well with Sonja. 

                                 PETER
                        Okay. Stay. 

           Frank pauses. That was too easy.

                                 FRANK
                        Okay?

                                 PETER
                        You’re almost a man, Frank. You 
                        know the consequences. Stay.

           Frank, thankful, is now more confused about what to do...

                                 FRANK
                        It’s just-- I finally fit in here. 

                                 PETER
                        I understand.

                                 FRANK
                        Where will I go to school in the 
                        West? 

                                 PETER
                        Where ever you want. 

                                 FRANK
                        What if... what if they don’t like 
                        me over there? 

           Peter looks at his son, beaming with pride in him.

                                 PETER
                        They’ll like you. 
                                 FRANK
                        You’re just saying that...

                                 PETER
                        I would never lie to you. You have 
                        a good heart and you’re a good 
                        person. And a good writer.

                                 FRANK
                             (mortified)
                        You-- read my stuff?

                                 PETER 
                        Yeah. I don’t pretend to know 
                        anything about poetry or stories-- 
                        but it was... beautiful. Is that 
                        the right word? You tell me. 
                             (pause)
                        Mom liked it, too.

                                 FRANK
                        Mom read it?

           Frank doesn’t know to be embarrassed or elated.

                                 PETER
                        Starting over won’t be easy, Frank. 
                        It’ll take a long time to tear down 
                        the wall we’ve built in here. 
                             (taps his temple)
                        But you’re free to make up your own 
                        mind. This isn’t a dictatorship. 
                        It’s a family. 

           INT. FREE GERMAN YOUTH CENTER - THAT NIGHT

           A lame East German disco song plays. Frank dances with Sonja 
           among Free German Youth TEENAGERS.

                                 SONJA
                        We’ll drive to Berlin, march in the 
                        parade and then after... the hotel. 

                                 FRANK
                        Sonja, did you read my short story? 
                        The one I gave you?

                                 SONJA
                        Oh, that? No. 

           Her dismissive tone hurts worse than he thought it would.
                                 FRANK
                        But it was important to me. I want 
                        to be a writer... 

           Sonja laughs. Frank stops dancing.

                                 FRANK
                        What do you want to be, Sonja? 

                                 SONJA
                        Stop acting weird. 

           Sonja walks over to the punch. Frank follows her.

                                 FRANK
                        Don’t you want to-- I don’t know, 
                        make your own destiny? Listen to 
                        real music? 

                                 SONJA
                        Life is more than just good music 
                        and stories. 

                                 FRANK
                        Not to me. 

           She downs her punch. Wipes her mouth. 

                                 SONJA
                        I did read your story, Frank. 
                             (beat)
                        I hated it. 

           Frank looks utterly crushed. 

                                 SONJA
                        What were you thinking, saying 
                        those things? I burned it. 

                                 FRANK
                        You what-- ? That was my only copy! 
                        Why would you do that? 

                                 SONJA
                        Because I didn’t want to have to 
                        report you. 

           Stunned, Frank steps back. Looks at her as if seeing her for 
           the first time.

                                 SONJA
                        Now stop being silly and come dance 
                        with me. 
           She holds out her hand. Heart breaking, Frank looks at her. 
           He closes his eyes. Takes a breath. And walks away. 

                                 SONJA
                        Frank? Where are you going? FRANK! 

           Frank walks out of the door.

           EXT. STRELZYK HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Peter opens the front door, welcoming his son home. Shaking, 
           Frank embraces his dad. Peter holds his son for a long while.

           EXT. DEATH ZONE - NIGHT

           The gates open, welcoming a MILITARY CONVOY inside. 20 GUARDS 
           step out. Young, fresh-faced GUARDS. Horst walks before them.

                                 HORST
                        By law citizens have no right to 
                        cross this border. The proper 
                        method for stopping them is the 
                        following. First, identify. “Stop. 
                        Identify.” Then if they do not 
                        answer, a warning shot. 

           Horst fires at a deer in the distance. It sprints away.

                                 HORST
                        If they do not comply, fire again. 
                        This time, not a warning. 

           Horst trains his scope on the running deer. Fires. The deer 
           twists, skids to the ground. The new guards are blank-faced.

                                 HORST
                        Should you disobey these orders, 
                        should a fugitive get past you, 
                        disciplinary measures will be taken 
                        against you and you will face time 
                        in prison. Welcome to the Wall.

           EXT. WETZEL HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

           A warm, humid night. 

           SUPER: September 15, 1979.

           Carrying suitcases, Gunter and Petra quickly exit their house 
           with their two little ones, Sam and Andrew. 

                                 SAM
                        Daddy, it’s late. 
                                 GUNTER
                        Shhh-shhh. 

           As they drive off, a light flicks on in HELGA’S HOUSE.

                                 HELGA
                        Police? This is Helga Grum. 

           INT. POSSNECK POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           A tired OFFICER hangs up the phone.

                                 OFFICER 
                        Helga Grum’s going on about her 
                        neighbors again. 

           Drang leans over, curious. He nods to Sturm.

                                 DRANG
                        We’ll check it out. 

           INT. STRELZYK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Doris zips up Andreas’s jacket. Wraps a scarf around him.

                                 ANDREAS
                        We’re going in the sky again?

                                 DORIS
                        Yes, my dear.

                                 ANDREAS
                        I... I’m not scared.

                                 DORIS
                        Such a big boy. Your father and I 
                        made you something...

           They pin a homemade BADGE WITH A BALLOON on it to his jacket.

                                 DORIS
                        For bravery in the face of danger.

           Andreas beams. Peter gives Doris a lingering kiss. 

                                 PETER
                        For bravery in the face of danger.

                                 DORIS
                        I love you. 

                                 PETER
                        I love you, too.
           INT. MINISTRY OF STATE SECURITY - BERLIN - NIGHT

           Zental, surrounded by the balloon wreckage sifts through 
           piles of useless evidence. Enraged at finding nothing, he 
           kicks over the table. Verlag rushes in--

                                 OFFICER VERLAG
                        They wrote a check!

           Zental looks up-- Verlag waves a copy of a personal check.

                                 OFFICER VERLAG
                        The salesman found it in their 
                        records.

                                 OFFICER KAASE
                        They couldn’t be that stupid.

                                 ZENTAL
                        Desperate people make mistakes.
                             (reading the check)
                        Don’t they... Peter Strelzyk?

           INT. STRELZYK GARAGE - NIGHT

           Peter and Gunter attach the trailer to the back of the small 
           blue Wartburg. 

                                 GUNTER
                             (whispers)
                        I’m worried we built it too fast. 

                                 PETER
                             (whispers)
                        We built it well. 

                                 GUNTER
                             (whispers)
                        In a week in a half, Peter. We 
                        might have missed something-- 

           Petra is dragging her luggage into the car.

                                 PETER
                        No luggage. Too heavy. Trust me. 

           Petra grumbles, opens up her luggage takes out CHAMPAGNE. 

                                 PETRA
                        It’s silly, but.. I read somewhere 
                        it’s good luck to have a bottle of 
                        champagne on a balloon flight. 

           Everyone smiles at this...
                                 PETER
                             (looking at his watch)
                        It’s time. 

           They try to squeeze into the car but the two families won’t 
           fit in the tiny crappy East German Wartburg. Peter frowns.

                                 DORIS
                        We don’t fit. 

                                 GUNTER
                        I could drive my car. 

                                 PETER
                        Police see two cars full of people  
                        driving at this hour they’ll get 
                        suspicious. 

           Frank speaks up.

                                 FRANK
                        I could... drive someone on the 
                        back of my scooter? 

                                 DORIS
                        What if the police stop him? 

                                 GUNTER
                        I’ll ride on the back. Say we had 
                        car trouble... 

           Doris takes a breath. She doesn’t like it. 

                                 PETER
                        Frank, you know the way there. 

                                 FRANK
                        Yes, sir. 

           Peter looks at his friends, his family. 

                                 PETER
                        You all know what to do. No matter 
                        what happens-- I’m proud to be with 
                        you tonight. Don’t give up. No 
                        matter what. 
                             (beat)
                        We can be heroes. Just for one day.

           Frank smiles at this.

           EXT. ROUTE 33 - NIGHT

           Zental speeds in his sedan. Verlag reads a file and map.
                                 OFFICER VERLAG
                        He lives at fifteen Waldstrasse, 
                        Possneck. Two hours away. 

           Zental floors the gas.

           EXT. VILLAGE OF POSSNECK - NIGHT

           Peter drives the Wartburg with the trailer attached. It looks 
           like the car is empty until we see--

           INT. WARTBURG CAR - DRIVING

           Doris, Petra, and the three little children are all lying 
           down, keeping out of sight. Andreas sees little Sam and 
           Andrew are scared, on edge.

                                 ANDREAS
                        It’s going to be okay. 

           Smoking a cigarette, Peter glances in the rearview, keeping 
           an eye on Frank and Gunter puttering far behind-- 

           A CAR STREAKS PAST. PETER SLAMS THE BREAKS. 

           Doris, Petra, Andreas, Sam, and Andrew jolt forward. 

           It’s the police. Sturm and Drang. Glaring at Peter from their 
           car. It takes everything in Peter to remain cool, calm.

           Doris, Petra and the boys press themselves into the floor and 
           pull blankets over their heads. Andreas clamps his hand over 
           Sam’s mouth. 

                                 ANDREAS
                        You must be quiet. 

           Little Sam and Andrew nod, terrified.

           FAR BEHIND THEM - On the scooter, Frank squeezes the brakes, 
           seeing the red and blue lights. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Damn. Go left here. 

                                 FRANK
                        But-- 

                                 GUNTER
                        Turn. Quick! 

           Frank, conflicted, turns left across a bridge over a 
           thundering river.
           WITH PETER - IN THE WARTBURG 

           Peter takes a long drag, waves at Sturm and Drang.

                                 PETER
                        Evening officers. 

                                 DORIS
                             (whispers)
                        Don’t overcompensate. 

                                 PETER
                             (whispers)
                        I’m being friendly. 

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

           Frank’s scooter flies through the trees, winding-- Gunter 
           hanging on tight. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Careful, careful! 

           The scooter skids across the edge of the launch site.

                                 FRANK
                        Where are they? 

                                 GUNTER
                        They’ll be here. 

           IN THE POLICE CAR - Drang and Sturm nod to Peter.

                                 OFFICER DRANG
                        Be careful where you are driving!

                                 PETER
                        Will do, officer.

           The police speed off toward the Wetzel’s house. Peter throws 
           the car in drive and heads off into the forest.

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

           The Wartburg car roars into the clearing, trailer clinking.

           Blankets are drawn back. Gasps from the children. 

           Andreas pats little Sam and Andrew. 

                                 ANDREAS
                        You did good. But it’s going to get 
                        worse. I will protect you.
                                 PETER
                        Quickly now. Frank, keep watch. 

           Frank climbs the HUNTING BLIND-- rise with him to see 
           everyone unroll the giant balloon... its size and scope and 
           color is incredible. 

           Gunter hammers four rope lines down into the ground as--

           Peter lights the blow torch--

           Doris starts the fan, bellowing heat into the mouth of the 
           bag that Petra and Gunter and the boys are holding open. 

           Upside down propane tanks are opened.

           THE CENTRAL BURNER is lit.

           The little boys stare up at the rising balloon.

           Their faces light up like it was Christmas morning.

           Doris sees Petra is shaking.

                                 DORIS
                        It’s going to be okay. 

                                 PETRA
                        If one more person tells me it’s 
                        going to be okay I might scream. 

           Petra grabs Doris. A big, desperate hug.

                                 PETRA
                        Thank you. I wouldn’t do this 
                        without you.

                                 DORIS
                        Thank me when we get there.

           EXT. WETZEL HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sturm and Drang knock on Gunter’s front door. Helga stands 
           beside them, her hair in curlers.

                                 HELGA
                        The whole family just left. 

                                 OFFICER STURM
                        Where did they go? 

                                 HELGA
                        That way. Probably to meet his 
                        friend. 
                                 OFFICER STURM
                        What friend? 

                                 HELGA
                        The one who smokes. 

           Sturm and Drang pause-- remembering, Peter in the car-- 
           smoking. They suddenly get a bad feeling. 

           They quickly move into the patrol car and speed off. 

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

           The balloon is full and bright, glowing like a rainbow moon. 
           The adults help their children into the gondola. 

                                 PETRA
                        Boys, you hold here and here and 
                        you never ever, ever let go. 

                                 SAM
                        Mommy, you’re squishing me. 

                                 PETRA
                        Good. We need to be squished. 

           Peter stands in the center with Gunter, keeping watch on the 
           rippling, inflated bag.

                                 PETER
                        Frank, cut the lines. 

           Frank is about to climb down from the HUNTING BLIND when--

           Headlights of the police car appear on the road. Frank’s eyes 
           widen in horror. 

                                 FRANK
                        POLICE!!! 

           Frank jumps down-- frantically cuts three lines-- the balloon 
           rises quickly-- pulling the last, tethered rope line TAUGHT-- 
           setting the balloon at an awkward angle. 

           Frank accidentally drops the knife and has to tug at the last 
           rope to pull it free-- TENSION PULLING THE LINE TAUGHT.

           The rope frees, WHIPPING through the air. The iron peg on the 
           end SLICES into Frank’s face, CUTTING OPEN HIS CHEEK. Frank 
           stumbles back into Andreas, smashing his nose-- BLOOD GUSHES 
           from Andreas’s nose.

                                 ANDREAS
                        Aaaaaah!!!! 
           THE BALLOON RISES. IT’S POWERFUL but CLUMSY. Not the 
           uplifting, wonder-filled they were hoping for. 

                                 GUNTER
                        Don’t shake the gondola! 

           Peter grabs Frank, steadying him.

           Doris wipes Andreas’s nose, holding him.

           200 FEET HIGH - The BURNER WOBBLES-- the 40 foot flame licks 
           the side of the bag. WHOOMPH. FIRE SHOOTS up the balloon. 

                                 DORIS
                        Oh. My. God. 

                                 PETRA
                        We’re on fire!

                                 PETER
                        Stay calm--

                                 PETRA
                        I want to get out!

                                 GUNTER
                        No! We’re too high!  

           As the balloon flies up, the FIRE BURNS A HOLE in the top 
           side of the balloon. Everyone SCREAMS.

                                 PETER
                        If we keep rising, the altitude-- 
                        the lack of oxygen-- it’ll keep the 
                        fire from spreading-- just hold on. 

           Gunter bows his head, praying like never before. Everyone 
           huddles together, choosing to look up at the small flickering 
           flame instead of looking down...

                                 PETER
                        Navigator. Gunter! What’s our 
                        altitude?

                                 GUNTER
                             (checks altimeter)
                        A thousand feet and rising. 

           Peter clenches his jaw-- there’s no going back now.

           EXT. VILLAGE OF POSSNECK - NIGHT

           Zental’s sedan screams past the “Welcome to Possneck” sign.
           EXT. STRELZYK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Zental knocks. Waits as long as he can bear it then he kicks 
           in the door. He and Verlag turn the house upside down.

           EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT

           Sturm and Drang spot the blue Wartburg car. They shine their 
           flashlights around the launch zone. It’s a weird mystery 
           until Sturm sees, up, in the sky--

           Hovering two miles in the distance, the glorious, floating 
           balloon, BLAZING FIRE trailing its side. 

           SKY NEAR THE DEATH ZONE

           Shivering, Frank holds his hand to his face, blood pouring 
           through his fingers.

                                 PETER
                        Frank?! 

                                 FRANK
                        I got cut-- I’m-- I’m okay-- 

           Doris and Peter want to help him, but they can’t rock the 
           gondola. Frank pulls his hand away from his face, presses his 
           sleeve into his bloody cut. Sniffs. 

           Andreas nose has stopped bleeding, but Doris’s hands are 
           covered in dry blood.

           POLICE PATROL CAR - DRIVING

           Sturm and Drang speed down the forest road. The balloon’s 
           reflection in the windshield.

                                 OFFICER DRANG
                             (screaming into his CB)
                        Yes! You heard me! A balloon! LOOK 
                        IN THE SKY!!! IN THE SKY!!! 

           Sturm, staring up--

           A FAMILY OF DEER are crossing the road. Sturm screams, pulls 
           the wheel-- avoids the herd of deer, SMASHING into a tree. 

           The deer simply stare at the crashed car then leap back into 
           the forest.

           BALLOON - FLYING

           2,000 FEET IN THE SKY. Everyone watches the fire on the side 
           of the balloon. It fades away.
                                 PETRA
                        It’s out... 

           But now-- a charred hole is in the top of the balloon-- wind 
           WHISTLING through it-- the burned lines vibrate.

                                 PETRA
                        What if one of those ropes breaks?

                                 PETER
                        They’ll hold. 
                             (beat)
                        German built.

                                 GUNTER
                             (whispers)
                        The gas-- it’s escaping.

                                 PETER
                        We’ll make it.

                                 GUNTER
                        But--

                                 PETER
                        We’ll make it.

           Everyone steals a look down at the shrinking villages passing 
           below. Moonlit tree tops sweeping below. Rooftops drifting 
           past. Highways, street lights, pass below them. 

           INT. STRELZYK HOUSE - NIGHT

           In the garage, Zental finds a can of burned blueprints, 
           sketches. One scrap isn’t fully burned... Zental studies it-- 
           realizes, this is the same hand that drew the hot-wire sketch 
           for Lukas Keller. 

                                 ZENTAL
                        It’s him! Call the towers!

           EXT. DEATH ZONE - NIGHT

           A WATCH TOWER. Vaulting in the night sky. Horst smiles, proud 
           of himself for having so many guards under his command... 

           A phone RINGS. At this hour? Horst sees a guard answer it 
           then look to the sky...

           Horst frowns. Sees another guard, peering up.

           Stunned, a guard points to the sky... 

           Horst looks up-- 
           The 20 Guards crane their necks to the sky... and for a 
           stunned moment, you can hear a pin drop.

           There, a speck of light... flickering like a shooting star.

           Horst quickly picks up his binoculars. 

           HORST’S POV - The balloon. Aglow, sailing. 

                                 HORST
                        LIGHTS!!! 

           Guards frantically point the spotlights up, swinging the 
           lines of light into the vast darkness--

           THE BALLOON - FLYING

           7,500 FEET ABOVE GROUND. 

                                 DORIS
                        Listen... 

                                 GUNTER
                        Sirens. 

           Spotlights dance up from below. Anxiety and fear rise.

                                 FRANK
                        Can they see us? 

                                 PETRA
                        We’re a ball of light in the sky, 
                        of course they can! 

                                 PETER
                        Quiet! If we can hear them, they 
                        can hear us... 

           Peter, mind reeling. Think, think. 

           EXT. DEATH ZONE - NIGHT

           Guards running. Dogs barking madly. RIFLES AIMED UP. 

           Horst raises his rifle. 

           HORST’S POV - THROUGH THE CROSS-HAIRS - The BALLOON.

           Horst’s finger tightens on the trigger.

           THE BALLOON - FLYING

           Peter reaches up and SHUTS OFF THE GAS VALVE. 
           The 40 foot flame vanishes. PLUNGING THEM INTO DARKNESS. 

           Peter Strelzyk, the man who values control and precision-- 
           closes his eyes and surrenders to the wind. 

           EXT. DEATH ZONE - WATCH TOWER - NIGHT

           HORST’S POV - The glowing balloon-- FADES INTO DARKNESS. 

           As if by magic, the balloon blends into the night. 

           GONE. 

           Horst blinks. Peers through the scope. Where is it?

           Spotlights fish the darkness.

           THE BALLOON - FLYING

           The families are silently hovering across the sky. Peter 
           looks at Doris. Emotion in their eyes. Gunter and Petra 
           clutch each other, their children. Praying silently.

           Doris gently rocks Andreas, singing him a LULLABY...

           Everything grows silent except for Doris’s soulful, simple 
           lullaby...

           EXT. VILLAGE OF POSSNECK - NIGHT

           Doris’s lullaby echoes over...

           SONJA’S HOUSE - SONJA opens the window. Peers out, hair blown 
           back. Gazing into the West where spotlights sweep the stars.

           SUPERVISOR’S HOUSE - The old man curiously looks out... 

           HELGA’S HOUSE - Helga’s dog BARKS. Helga wanders to the 
           window. Listening to the distant sirens. Her jaw drops.

           THE STRELZYK HOUSE - Zental and Verlag rush from the house. 
           Hearing the distant sirens, they look to the sky...

           EXT. DEATH ZONE - NIGHT

           A young GUARD catches the balloon in his cross-hairs. He can 
           see it... but then... ever so slightly, the young guard 
           lowers his rifle and just watches in wonder as the balloon 
           passes overhead... 
           SKIES OVER GERMANY 

           The balloon’s silhouette arcs across a field of stars. The 
           two families cling to each other. Flying triumphant.

           EXT. DEATH ZONE 

           Horst jumps into a jeep. Yells to the DRIVER. 

                                 HORST
                        GO, GO, GO! 

           The jeep speeds down the Death Zone, Horst looking up--

                                 HORST
                        There!!! FOLLOW IT! 

           The gates barely have time to open as the jeep flies out.

           EXT. FOREST VALLEY - NIGHT

           The jeep speeds South-West. Watching the sky above him-- 
           Horst removes his sidearm-- BANG! BANG! Horst fires wildly.

           BALLOON - NIGHT

           Shots fly past. Everyone ducks, screams. 

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           Horst screams into the sky-- suddenly jerked forward as the 
           jeep slams to a stop. Horst shrieks at the driver.

                                 HORST
                        DON’T STOP! 

           The Driver points up ahead... illuminated in the headlights: 

           “DANGER - LAND MINES”

           Trip-wires for LAND MINES shimmer all around them.

           Horst swallows. They have driven into the outer perimeter of 
           the Death Zone and are caught in their own web. 

           Horst looks into the sky, fires, shooting up at shadows until 
           the clip is empty and Horst is out of breath.

           EXT. STRELZYK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Zental looks into the sky. Infuriated. Amazed.
           BALLOON - FLYING

           Cold wind bites their faces.

                                 FRANK
                        Dad. Did we make it? 

           Peter looks down-- sees nothing but darkness.

           INT. NEARBY HOUSE - NIGHT

           A FARMER sits up in bed. Looks out of his window-- his jaw 
           drops. An enormous colorful orb glide past his window. 
           Spellbound, the man rubs sleep from his eyes. 

                                 FARMER
                        Aliens...

           THE BALLOON - FLYING

                                 GUNTER
                        We’re dropping. We need to light 
                        the gas again. 

           Peter flicks his lighter over the valve. It doesn’t light.

                                 GUNTER
                        What’s wrong? 

                                 PETER
                        No more gas. 

           SNAP! The burned line at the top of the balloon BREAKS. The 
           gondola tips, spilling everyone at a forty-five degree angle. 

           Screams as they tumble into each other, grabbing ropes. 
           Nightmarish chaos. 

                                 ANDREAS
                        DADDY-- !

           Peter grabs Andreas before the boy goes over the edge. 
           Andreas drops his teddy bear. The teddy bear plummets.

           The charred hole in the top of the balloon RIPS.

           FALLING. SHAKING. Tree branches crack, blur past. 

                                 PETER
                        HANG ON!!! 

           BANG! The gondola smashes into the Earth with shuddering 
           force. They bounce violently. Gunter is thrown forward, his 
           leg makes a sickening CRACK. 
           Everyone looks at the other... they’re alive. They check the 
           children, each other-- they’re shaken, full of horror-- but 
           the worst is over. 

                                 PETER
                        Andreas, look at me. We’re okay. We 
                        landed. It’s over.

                                 ANDREAS
                             (shivering)
                        W-W-We’re here?

           Peter looks around. They’re in the woods. A road just beyond.

                                 PETER
                        Everyone stay here. Don’t come out 
                        until Gunter and I say. 

           Frank swallows. They’re not safe yet.

                                 DORIS
                        Peter-- be careful.

           EXT. FOREST - WALKING - NIGHT

           An owl hoots. Away from the balloon, the two men hobble 
           through the trees. Gunter stops, grabbing his leg.

                                 GUNTER
                        I... I think it’s broken. 

                                 PETER
                        Do you want to stop? 

           Gunter shakes his head no. He picks up a stick, uses it like 
           a crutch. Peter helps support him as they wander through the 
           misty woods, lost.

                                 GUNTER
                        Peter. Where the hell are we? 

           Peter checks a map. Shakes his head. An old barn appears...

           EXT. BARN - NIGHT

           Gunter and Peter peer around the old barn.

           HEADLIGHTS. Peter and Gunter duck down, hiding. A flashlight 
           beams nearby. Peter squints-- sees, it’s a police car.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        You there. Come out. 

           Peter and Gunter look at each other. 
                                 GUNTER
                        What do we do?

           Peter shakes his head. This is it. Looks at the police car.

                                 PETER
                        Is that-- an Audi?

                                 GUNTER
                        That’s a Western car.

           Peter bravely steps forward. Calls out.

                                 PETER
                        Are we in the West? 

           The Police exchange looks. 

                                 WESTERN POLICE OFFICER
                        Where else would you be? 

           Peter and Gunter’s eyes light up. 

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           Peter. Running through the trees. Shouting.

                                 PETER
                        WE’RE HERE!!! WE’RE HERE!!!

           He lights a signal flare. It burns RED AND BRIGHT.

           Tears well up in Doris’s eyes. Peter embraces his family. 

                                 GUNTER
                        PETRA! SAM! HUNTER! WE MADE IT!

           The Western Police Officers help Gunter make his way back to 
           the balloon which is miraculously still intact. 

           The police stop and stare, spellbound like children.

                                 WESTERN POLICE OFFICER
                        Would you look at that... 

           EXT. TOWN OF NAILA - NIGHT 

           News of the balloon’s arrival stirs the small village awake. 
           One by one lights come on in houses as two police cars with 
           the Strelzyks and Wetzels inside drive through the town. 
           Huddled together, the families stare out.
           INT. MAYOR’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A phone wakes the MAYOR OF NAILA. He groans awake. Answers.

                                 MAYOR OF NAILA
                        A what..?
                             (looks out his window)
                        Here?  

           INT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           Phones ringing. NEIGHBORS are being awoken by the news. 

           No one can believe it.

           EXT. NAILA POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           The police cars park out front. 

                                 PETER
                        The police station? But-- 

                                 WESTERN POLICE OFFICER
                        We just need you to answer a few 
                        questions at the station. 

           Andreas, still terrified, whispers:

                                 ANDREAS
                        Are we in trouble?

           Peter doesn’t know how to answer. He holds his son tight.

           INT. NAILA POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           CAPTAIN HAMMAN, a chubby, large man, grabs Peter’s hand, 
           shaking it. 

                                 CAPTAIN HAMMAN
                        Welcome! Welcome!

           The families are surprised as police officers rush up to 
           them, shaking their hands, bringing them tea and blankets. 

           BANG! The doors to the police station swing open--

           The Mayor of Naila and 20 PEOPLE, still in their robes, 
           pajamas, come gushing in. They are carrying food, cookies, 
           soups, breads, flowers, and sausage for the flyers.

           The families are surrounded with smiles, hugs, 
           congratulations. People anxious to meet them. It’s a 
           haphazard feast of welcome.
                                 DORIS
                             (overwhelmed)
                        Who... are all these people? 

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        We’re your new neighbors. 

           The elderly woman says this with such empathy and love that 
           it brings tears to Doris’s eyes. Doris puts a shaking hand to 
           her mouth. All the tension and fear melting away.

                                 ANDREAS
                        Mommy, don’t be sad. 

           Doris, sobbing, hugs Andreas.

                                 DORIS
                        I’m not sad, honey. 

           A PRETTY YOUNG GIRL cleans the cut on Frank’s face.

                                 PRETTY GIRL
                        You’re very brave. 

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah. Guess so.

           Peter smiles at Frank. 

           A PARAMEDIC bandages Gunter’s leg.

                                 GUNTER
                        I thought we were dead. Are we? 
                        Petra, do you still have the 
                        champagne-- ?

           Petra removes the bottle. She pops it. It fountains. Cheers.

           Andreas looks up at his father.

                                 ANDREAS
                        Does this mean we’re free?

           Overwhelmed, Peter nods. His little boy smiles. 

           SUPER: The Strelzyks and Wetzels relocated to the town of 
           Naila, West Germany. 

           Their daring escape was reported around the world and they 
           were celebrated as heroes. 
           EXT. VILLAGE OF POSSNECK -  DAY

           People point their TV antennae to the West just to watch the 
           news. SONJA is stunned to see Frank being interviewed on TV. 

           SUPER: News of their daring flight overshadowed the East 
           German 30th Anniversary Celebration, humiliating the 
           Republic. 

           INT. MINISTRY OF STATE SECURITY - DAY

           ZENTAL angrily types up a file: PETER STRELZYK. 

           SUPER: Years after, the Stasi continued to spy on both 
           families, jailing friends and family they thought helped with 
           their escape.

           ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE - 1989. The Berlin Wall is torn down.

           INT. WESTERN SUPER MARKET - DAY

           Rows of food in colorful packaging under bright lights. The 
           Strelzyks and Wetzels walk down the dreamlike isles in AWE.

           SUPER: After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Strelzyks moved 
           back to their hometown of Possneck. 

           EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY

           Nothing but wilderness where the fences and watch towers once 
           stood. A rusty, overgrown “STOP! BORDER - NO CROSSING” sign 
           is the only evidence of the Death Zone’s existence. 

           SUPER: In 1993, the leader of East Germany, Erich Honecker, 
           was indicted for "collective manslaughter" and put on trial 
           for issuing shoot-to-kill orders to those trying to escape 
           East Germany which resulted in the deaths of over 1,100 
           civilians.

           Honecker was set free due to health reasons. 

           He died one year later, living in exile in Chile.

           EXT. NIGHT SKY

           The glowing, homemade balloon of rainbow colors flies over 
           the evergreen trees. A symbol of imagination, dreams, hope, 
           and freedom.

           SUPER: Today the balloon is on display in the Berlin Wall 
           Museum. At the time it was made, it held the record as the 
           largest hot air balloon ever built in Europe.
