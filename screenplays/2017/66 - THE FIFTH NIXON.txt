           OVER BLACK: OVAL OFFICE -- February 16, 1971 7:56 am 

                                 PRESIDENT NIXON (O.S.)
                        How does the recording work?

                                 BUTTERFIELD (O.S.)
                        ...the Secret Service is sorting it 
                        out... The locator is activated. It 
                        tells us where you are. It’s 
                        automatically working. 

                                 PRESIDENT NIXON (O.S.)
                        What happens when a record is made -
                        - a tape?

                                 BUTTERFIELD (O.S.)
                        A tape is made, yes, sir... There 
                        are only four people that know. 
                        Halderman, Ziegler, you, and me. 
                        Secret Service are only used for 
                        changing the spools. They cannot 
                        monitor it.

                                 PRESIDENT NIXON (O.S.)
                        Good. You see, the whole purpose of 
                        this is to have the whole thing on 
                        file... for future purposes... 

           FADE IN

           INT. WHITE HOUSE BASEMENT - NIGHT

           STEVIE WONDER’S “SUPERSTITION” opening drum beat begins to 
           play as we go...

           CLOSE ON A PAIR OF HANDS fixing the bent rabbit ear antennas 
           of a small TV. The hands turn the TV on:

           A QUICK SERIES OF CHANGING TELEVISED NEWSCASTS as if someone 
           is trying to find something different on the TV. (This quick 
           cut version of events serves as SparkNotes for the audience -- 
           using actual footage, we get a history of the greatest 
           watershed moment in American history -- Watergate.) 

            - WATERGATE BURGLARS being arrested on June 17, 1972 plays.

                                 DAN RATHER
                        ...On June 17, five burglars were 
                        caught breaking into the Democratic 
                        National Committee Office at The 
                        Watergate Hotel.
           - WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN being interviewed

                                 WOODWARD
                        ...There is a link between the 
                        Watergate break-in and a possible 
                        cover up of the crime by the White 
                        House...

           - WATERGATE HEARING COMMITTEE

                                 JOHN DEAN
                        ...Watergate is a cancer on the 
                        presidency. 

           - WATERGATE HEARING COMMITTEE

                                 JOHN BUTTERFIELD
                        ...Nixon bugged his own office... 
                        There are recordings of all his 
                        conversations. 

                                 WHITE HOUSE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR
                        We demand copies of all recordings 
                        made by and in the White House, 
                        that connects to Watergate. What 
                        the White House knew and when...

           Another turn of the knob to...

                                 WALTER CRONKITE (PRELAP)
                        After a lengthy battle, President 
                        Nixon will now be ordered to 
                        provide transcriptions of all White 
                        House tape recordings that fall 
                        under the subpoena --

           Stevie Wonder’s voice FADES UP as --

           THE HAND turns the KNOB of the TV off.  

           SUPERIMPOSE: WASHINGTON, D.C. - NOVEMBER 22, 1973

           CLOSE ON: The BACK OF A MAN (presumably the one that just 
           shut off the TV) as he opens up a vault and carefully 
           replaces a TAPE in a CENTRAL MIXER RECORDER. There are rows 
           of used tapes, marked by date, on masking tape. 

           He presses record. 

           The GREEN LIGHT blinks on. He adjusts the volume and we hear 
           A MAN in mid-conversation...
                                 PRESIDENT NIXON (O.S.)
                        ...Anything that has any 
                        consequences of seriousness...

           After a few words are strung together, we immediately 
           recognize that, yes, we know the voice -- it’s PRESIDENT 
           NIXON. (Nixon’s taping system, which we just read about in 
           1971, now has been in full force for three years.)

                                 PRESIDENT NIXON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m not going to try to cover up...

           As THE MAN heads to the elevator, we get a better glimpse:  
           blue blazer, gun holster, buzz haircut -- Secret Service. He 
           presses the button, speaks into his shirt cuff. 

                                 SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                        Switched reel. Heading back up. 

           Camera follows the Agent down the --

           HALLWAY

           Teeming with STAFFERS, AIDES, AND OFFICE WORKERS, President 
           Nixon’s voice grows louder. 

                                 PRESIDENT NIXON (O.S.)
                        I have listened to every tape. 
                        Every goddamn one. 

           Before we know it, we’ve made it to the -- 

           WEST WING OF THE WHITE HOUSE 

                                 PRESIDENT NIXON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        ...These tapes fall squarely under 
                        executive privilege. They have no 
                        right to them. No right.  

                                 HAIG (O.S.)
                        I am sure you -- 

                                 PRESIDENT NIXON (O.S.)
                        What happened was a goddamn 
                        mistake. That’s all... 

           The Secret Service Agent enters the inner quarters of the 
           Presidential Office and stops at a GREAT WHITE DOOR. The 
           camera floats through the door. We’re in the --

           OVAL OFFICE 
           The camera tracks to the sound of the President’s voice, 
           honing in on the President’s desk -- straight to the tiny 
           blinking small BUGGING DEVICE that is embedded under the 
           President’s telephone. 

           Facing PRESIDENT NIXON is CHIEF OF STAFF, ALEXANDER HAIG, 48, 
           in full military uniform. Although we can’t see Nixon’s face 
           (and we won’t for the entire movie -- only actual footage and 
           his voice on the actual tapes), we can feel his agitation. 

                                 HAIG
                        As long as it’s not your mistake. 

           Beat. No answer from the President. 

                                 HAIG (CONT’D)
                        Mr. President, the Justice 
                        Department’s subpoenaed the tapes. 
                        There are 18 1/2 minutes missing. 

                                 PRESIDENT NIXON
                        I know. I know. 

                                 HAIG
                        Someone has to be held accountable. 

           Silence. A long beat. 

                                 NIXON
                        Has she been notified?

                                 HAIG
                        It’s happening now. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ROSE WOOD’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON a 40-SOMETHING ATTRACTIVE REDHEAD, with clever eyes, 
           looking out the window of her modest apartment onto the 
           street traffic below. She’s in a silk robe, her hair up in 
           rollers. Smoking. 

           Behind her, a line of FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS of Rose and the 
           Nixons throughout the years and elephant figurines from 
           around world dot the shelves. One of the perks of being the 
           secretary to the President of the United States.   

           Meet ROSE MARY WOODS, our heroine. Although she might not 
           look it, she’s a force to be reckoned with. 

           She watches down below, takes a long drag as she sees -- 
           A BLACK SEDAN pulling up to her apartment entrance. TWO DARK 
           SUITED ATTORNEYS (we’ll meet them in a minute) exit the 
           vehicle and head into the building.

           Her eyes flicker with recognition. She stubs out her 
           cigarette. Feels for her hair rollers. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A PLATE OF COOKIES AND TEA 

           Now dressed, Rose Woods pours tea for her guests (using her 
           best china). 

           TWO WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS sit across from her. FRED BUZHARDT, 
           50, a Southern West Point grad, and LEN GARMENT, 49, 
           Brooklynite. Her hand nervously shakes as she sets the tea 
           kettle down. 

           No one speaks.

           Finally, BUZHARDT clears his throat.

                                 BUZHARDT
                        Sorry for the late intrusion. But 
                        the President wanted you told 
                        immediately.

                                 ROSE
                        I thought what was erased... I 
                        thought it wasn’t covered by the 
                        subpoena. 

                                 BUZHARDT
                        We were misinformed.

           Silence. No one moves. 

           A beat. 

                                 BUZHARDT (CONT’D)
                        You’ll need to get your own 
                        attorney.  

                                 ROSE
                        Why?  

                                 GARMENT
                        Essentially the White House has a 
                        conflict of interest in 
                        representing you.

           Buzhardt gives him a look to shut up. But it’s too late. The 
           words hang in the air. 
                                 ROSE
                        Conflict of interest... Represent 
                        me against what? 

                                 BUZHARDT
                        At this time, it’s best for you to 
                        speak to an attorney. 

                                 ROSE
                        I did what I was told. Transcribe 
                        the tapes. I came to you and told 
                        when --

                                 BUZHARDT
                        As I said. It’s best for you to 
                        have your own attorney. 

                                 ROSE
                        Then I will get one. 
                            (beat)
                        We live in Washington, D.C. - you 
                        can’t walk two feet without hitting 
                        a lawyer. 

                                 GARMENT
                        Not the kind you need. 

           Buzhardt clears his throat.

                                 BUZHARDT
                        Okay. We’ll leave you to it.

           The lawyers get up and leave. 

           Rose is left alone. She stares at the cookies before her. 
           They look pathetic now. Always the good girl, always the 
           hostess. Hold on Rose. Her world crumbling.

           SUPERIMPOSE: ONE MONTH EARLIER

           EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE WHITE HOUSE - OCTOBER 1, 1973

           Under the image of this majestic building, we continue to 
           hear newscasters opine about Nixon and the subpoenaed tapes. 
           Everyone has an opinion. We hear the voices of newscasters, 
           the ubiquitous discussion around Washington and the world... 
           Did Nixon do it? Did he act alone? What’s on the tapes? Will 
           they lead to clues of the break-in? When will he turn over 
           the tapes? 

           We HOLD on this image for a moment before we --

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. WEST WING CORRIDOR - DAY

           Rose Woods rushes down the corridor holding THE BOX of 
           SUBPOENAED TAPE RECORDINGS. (If they look like the tapes we 
           saw in the basement, they should.)

           She walks at a clipped pace. This is Rose at her best. Beyond 
           a career secretary. Complete devotion to the President is an 
           understatement. Just enough salt to be able to play in the 
           boy’s club. Exactly who you would want to be the private 
           secretary to the most powerful leader of the free world. 

           LYNN HEFNER, 20s, Rose’s secretary, pen and paper in hand. 
           Her clothes and hair, serious and conservative, are modeled 
           on Rose’s. Lynn tries to keep pace...

                                 LYNN
                        The Press Office is asking for a 
                        comment on the Vice President’s 
                        rumored resignation.

                                 ROSE
                        The President has no comment. 

                                 LYNN
                        I’ll let publicity know that the 
                        President will not be making any 
                        public appearances for the day.

                                 ROSE
                            (thinking)
                        Wait... The White House is still 
                        hosting the Aiton Elementary fourth-
                        grade class for Halloween pumpkin 
                        carving today, right?

                                 LYNN
                        Right.

                                 ROSE
                        We should make sure that there’s an 
                        impromptu visit from the President. 
                            (beat)
                        Get Steve to schedule in the time. 
                        Some nice photos of the Boss 
                        carving pumpkins with public school 
                        kids. Cute ones.

                                 LYNN
                        Got it. 
                                 ROSE
                        How’s the prayer breakfast? I want 
                        to get the list in front of the 
                        Boss by the end of the day.

                                 LYNN
                        Should be done by noon.

                                 ROSE
                            (half to herself)
                        There’s a new addition. Someone the 
                        Boss asked for... I have it written 
                        down... 

           They pass STEVE BULL, 34, Special Assistant to Nixon. He 
           points to the TAPES. 

                                 STEVE
                        I spoke to the General, asked about 
                        the June 20th tape. He says 
                        transcribe only the time when 
                        Ehrlichman’s in the room. 

                                 ROSE
                        I’ll double-check before I start 
                        in.

           Steve heads the opposite way, Rose turns back to Lynn.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        What’s next?

                                 LYNN
                        You wanted me to remind you about 
                        the dinner with --

                                 ROSE
                        Dinner for the President of the 
                        Republic of the Ivory Coast. Send a 
                        memo of that dinner list to the 
                        Social Office.
                            (beat)
                        Is Sally from Social back from 
                        maternity leave tomorrow?

                                 LYNN
                        I believe so.

                                 ROSE
                        Let’s get her something from the 
                        White House. Also make sure that 
                        Steve has scheduled in a doctor’s 
                        appointment for the Boss. I 
                        promised Mrs. Nixon... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        What’s that name I’m forgetting for 
                        the breakfast list...

           She stops. We see dark shadows under her tired eyes. 

                                 LYNN
                        How late were you here last night?

                                 ROSE
                        It went long. 

                                 LYNN
                        To think that a Special Prosecutor 
                        can override executive privilege --

                                 ROSE
                        The President will obey the law. 

           Lynn nods. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        In the meantime... these tapes are 
                        going to be the death of me. 

           They pass through --

           INT. LYNN’S OFFICE - DAY

           PHONES RING in the background -- accompanying the constant 
           percussive SOUND OF TYPEWRITERS. Lynn shares her space with 
           TWO OTHER SECRETARIES.

           Lynn follows Rose into --

           ROSE’S OFFICE

           Rose stops. Smiles. She’s remembered.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Senator Garret. That’s the name I 
                        forgot. Well, no wonder. He’s a 
                        liberal-leaning Democrat. Add him 
                        to the prayer breakfast. 

           Lynn writes down the name. She waits at the door. Rose holds 
           her box of tapes. When Lynn leaves --

           Rose goes straight to her WALL SAFE and puts all the tapes 
           inside. Except for one. 

           CLOSE ON: the tape marked JUNE 20, 1972. 

           She sits at her desk, tape in hand, checks her notes. 
           Everything in Rose’s office has its place, immaculate. 
           Even the elephant figurines are in line, with their trunks 
           all facing east.  

                                 ROSE (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        General Haig. I’m starting the June 
                        20th tape... The subpoena says 
                        Ehrlichman and Haldeman with 
                        President Nixon but the morning 
                        meeting is with Ehrlichman alone. 
                        Okay... Got it. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER: 

           Rose, wearing oversized headphones, transcribes.

           Every few seconds, she stops and replays the machine by her 
           side. It’s an arduous process. Stop. Start. Play. Rewind. 

           Steve Bull, special assistant to Nixon, peeks in. 

                                 STEVE
                        How are you doing with the tapes?

                                 ROSE
                        I’m waiting for the new Uher to 
                        come. This machine has no pedal and 
                        it’s slowing me down. 
                            (beat)
                        Is the Boss anxious? 

           Steve doesn’t need to reply. Of course he is. 

                                 STEVE
                        The General wants me to remind you 
                        to just do the subpoenaed session, 
                        with Nixon and Ehrlichman alone. 
                            (beat)
                        Let me know if you need anything.  

           Rose takes a deep breath and heads back into transcribing. 
           She’s tired. Stares back at the tape machine. The phone 
           continues to RING.

                                                                CUT TO:

           ROSE stands at her desk, sorts THE MAIL, as she cradles the 
           phone with her chin.  

                                 ROSE
                        That’s correct. I think ten tables 
                        are fine. I’ll come over... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        No, it has to be specific, per the 
                        Boss’s instructions. 

           A SECRET SERVICE AGENT enters.

                                 SECRET SERVICE AGENT WONG
                        I’ve come bearing gifts. Behold the 
                        UHER 5000 with foot pedal. 

           Rose’s face lights up.

                                 ROSE
                        Just in time. 

           She presses the CALL BUTTON to the other room.

                                 ROSE (INTO INTERCOM) (CONT’D)
                        I’m going back to transcribing 
                        hell, hopefully made easier with 
                        the new Uher. Will you ladies cover 
                        the phones? 

                                                                CUT TO:

           ROSE’S TYPEWRITER 

           Clicking away. The words "JUNE 20, 1972. EOB PRESIDENT NIXON, 
           HALDEMAN" are visible.

           The camera pans down to ROSE’S FOOT ON A PEDAL. We see the 
           new UHER 5000. While it looks like a standard tape recorder 
           machine from the 1970s, it’s as much a part of this story as 
           anyone else -- remember this machine. 

           Rose struggles to get the hang of the new contraption. She 
           tries to work the pedal, which starts and stops the tape 
           recorder, so she can have her hands free to type. Awkward at 
           first, but then we watch as Rose picks up speed.

           Nixon’s booming voice emanates from her headphones. 

                                 NIXON (ON THE TAPES)
                        There’s no question there’s a 
                        double standard here...

           She’s listening carefully.

           The phone RINGS. She ignores it. 

           The RINGING persists. 

           Lynn pops her head in -- motions to the phone and mouths, 
           “Your sister”. 
           Rose nods, slips off her earring, and reaches over to answer 
           the phone like she’s done a million time before. (Remember 
           this reach.) Immediately her professional face falls.

                                 ROSE (INTO PHONE)
                        Anne. I don’t have time to argue. 
                        Can you tell me what I did wrong 
                        later?

           She sees the phone light up, indicating a call from inside 
           the residence.

                                 ROSE (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        I have to go.

           She picks up the other line. Professional face back on.

                                 ROSE (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Good morning, Mrs. Nixon. No, of 
                        course you’re not disturbing me...
                            (laughs)
                        Of course. I’ll check up on the 
                        Boss’s doctor’s appointment. I’ll 
                        come to the residence after work 
                        and we’ll strategize... Well, 
                        without HRH, I hope things are back 
                        to normal...
                            (laughs)
                        See you soon.

           She hangs up and returns to the transcription. Earphones back 
           on. All systems go. 

           She presses down on the pedal. Rewinds a bit. Listens. White 
           noise. Huh. She presses down on the pedal a second time. 
           Still nothing. She rewinds again, this time by hand. Silence. 
           She looks down at HER FOOT ON THE PEDAL and releases it. 
           Wait, was it on the pedal? She can’t be sure...

           She looks around. Takes off her headphones. Now just presses 
           play. White noise fills the room. She gets up to close the 
           office door. Stands over the tape machine. 

           Rewinds the tape back to the beginning. She hears voices. 
           Okay, good. Then the white noise. White noise. And then, 
           clicking. She presses stop. Shit. 

           Takes out the tape, puts it back in and tries again. Deep 
           breaths. Rose tries as many versions as possible of trying to 
           will this tape to work.

           Nothing works. 
           She waits a moment. Tries to return to the exact moment in 
           time that it happened. Sits back in the chair as she was 
           before she answered the phone. She puts on her headphones. 
           Closes her eyes and silently prays. Presses play to --

           White noise. Weird techno clicking. Again. 

           The gravity of what has happened sets in. 

           Panic washes over her face. She looks back down at the PEDAL. 
           Reaches for the phone and with a calm voice...

                                 ROSE (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Agent Wong. Are you at your desk?

           Rose smooths her skirt as she quickly heads to the --

           OFFICE OF SECRET SERVICE

           The on-site hub of the White House. AGENT WONG, 50s, stands 
           and smiles when Rose enters.

                                 AGENT WONG
                        How’s the new recorder working out? 
                        Does the pedal make a difference?

                                 ROSE
                        About the pedal...

                                 AGENT WONG
                        It’s not working? 

                                 ROSE 
                        You push the pedal down and it 
                        controls the tape.

                                 AGENT WONG
                        That’s right.

                                 ROSE
                        Can the pedal erase?  

                                 AGENT WONG
                        I don’t believe so... I’ll call 
                        down and send someone --

                                 ROSE
                        No. No. That’s okay. 

                                 AGENT WONG
                        Rose, is there something --
                                 ROSE
                        It’s fine. I’ll handle it. Forget I 
                        said anything. 

                                 AGENT WONG
                        Are you sure? I’m happy to bring 
                        you a new --

                                 ROSE
                        No, no. Thank you. 

           INT. ROSE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Rose plays the TAPE one more time. Only clicking. White 
           noise. Can this really be happening?

           Rose sits at her desk. Immobile. In her hand is THE JUNE 20TH 
           TAPE. 

           She watches NIXON’S GREEN GUEST LIGHT turn off. She doesn’t 
           move. Her hands are shaking. 

           Lynn comes by her door. Sees Rose sitting very still. 

                                 LYNN
                        Everything okay, Rose?

           Rose looks up. 

                                 LYNN (CONT’D)
                        You’re white as a sheet.

                                 ROSE
                        Good.

           She sits unmoving. Takes a breath after Lynn leaves. 

           Rose heads from her office to --

           STEVE BULL’S OFFICE 

           He sits at his desk, on the phone scheduling. Looks up and 
           waves Rose in to see the President. She heads straight to --

           THE OVAL OFFICE GREAT WHITE DOOR
           She takes a deep breath and KNOCKS. The President gives her a 
           warm greeting. Rose smiles, but her face remains tight. 

                                 PRESIDENT NIXON (O.S.)
                        Rose. Come in. Come in! 

           CLOSE ON ROSE’S WORRIED FACE

                                 ROSE
                        Mr. President, may I have a moment? 

           INT. CHIEF OF STAFF’S OFFICE - DAY

           ALEXANDER HAIG, 48, hangs in the background as Buzhardt and 
           Garment surround Rose. 

                                 BUZHARDT
                        Tell us exactly what you told the 
                        President. Again. 

                                 ROSE
                        I was transcribing the morning 
                        tape.

                                 BUZHARDT
                        The June 20th tape.

                                 ROSE
                        Yes. The morning. I believe I 
                        stopped at the point where they 
                        mention Ely, Nevada to answer the 
                        phone.

                                 BUZHARDT
                        And after the phone call? 

                                 ROSE
                        It was blank, not quite blank... 
                        more like white noise then 
                        clicking... I just don’t understand 
                        how I could have erased it.

           Silence. No one speaks. Haig holds THE SUBPOENA in his hand. 
           He speaks for the first time. 

                                 HAIG
                        How long?

                                 ROSE
                        I’m sorry?

                                 HAIG
                        How long’s the gap that you erased? 
                                 ROSE
                        Four minutes. Maybe four and a 
                        half. Tops. No more. But I’m not 
                        even sure I erased it. It was a 
                        short phone call.

           A long beat. Haig’s face is unreadable. 

                                 HAIG
                        Four minutes. Are you sure?

                                 ROSE
                        Yes.

                                 HAIG
                        Could it have been  longer?

                                 ROSE
                        No. 

           She has THE TAPE in her lap. 

           He turns to the other lawyers as if Rose isn’t even there. 
           Hands the Subpoena to Buzhardt, who scours it. 

                                 HAIG
                        What do we think?

                                 BUZHARDT
                        It’s past the morning portion. 

                                 HAIG
                        So, what happened isn’t even 
                        covered by the subpoena? 

                                 BUZHARDT
                        Correct. She got up to Ely... 
                        Ehrlichman left. The subpoena 
                        specifically talks about the three 
                        of them.  

                                 HAIG
                        A few minutes from a non-subpoenaed 
                        tape hardly seems worth a second 
                        thought.

           Silence.

                                 HAIG (CONT’D)
                        I’ll speak with the President. 

           Haig leaves. Buzhardt follows suit. Once everyone is gone 
           except Garment --
                                 ROSE
                        Len, I really don’t know how this 
                        could have happened.

                                 GARMENT
                        Don't worry about it.  

                                 ROSE
                            (half whispers)
                        It’s June 20th. Right after the 
                        Watergate break-in.

                                 GARMENT
                        Doesn’t matter. 

                                 ROSE
                        Maybe I should ask the Boss --

                                 GARMENT
                        Best leave the President out of all 
                        of this. 

           He pats her on the shoulder. She nods. Holding it together.

           INT. ROSE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Rose puts the tape back into the safe. Locks it. 

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Rose washes her face, fixes her hair. Puts on fresh lipstick.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - SUN ROOM - DAY

           PAT NIXON, 60s, smokes elegantly. She has a book on her lap 
           that she’s not reading. She looks up to see Rose enter. 

                                 PAT
                        Did you read The Post? The things 
                        they say about Dick. Unbelievable. 
                        And Henry gets all the credit on 
                        negotiating with China. 

           Rose sits beside her. 

                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you look purdy. Date tonight 
                        with anyone special?

                                 ROSE
                        Dinner with Bob. 
                                 PAT
                        Handsome Bob. Maybe Bob will make 
                        you an honest woman. Tell him I can 
                        help with the ring.  

                                 ROSE
                        Of course. 

                                 PAT
                        You know what we should do? Make 
                        Bob jealous. Let’s find you 
                        someone. A handsome bachelor. 
                        That’ll get Bob moving.   

                                 ROSE
                        Just make sure this bachelor has 
                        lots of hair. 

                                 PAT
                        I’ll make a list. Eligible 
                        Washingtonians with full heads of 
                        hair. Probably will give us at 
                        least five people to work with. 

                                 ROSE
                        Not a Democrat please. 

                                 PAT
                        Now we’re down to two.

           They both laugh. Enjoying their routine.

           ON CUE, a WHITE HOUSE WAITSTAFF enters to serve them tea. 
           Once he leaves --

                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        So. When were you going to tell me?  

                                 ROSE
                        Tell you...? 

                                 PAT
                        About today. I know what happened. 

           Rose freezes. 

                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        I know what’s going on.

                                 ROSE
                        You do? 
                                 PAT
                        There are no secrets in the White 
                        House. 

           Beat.

                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        Dick had it out with Spiro.

           Pat’s proud of her discovery. Rose plays along. 

                                 ROSE
                        Oh, right. 

                                 PAT
                        I knew it was something when I 
                        called this afternoon and Dick 
                        rushed me off the phone to go on a 
                        car ride with General Haig. In the 
                        middle of the afternoon, for 
                        Christ’s sake. Not on his schedule. 

                                 ROSE
                        The boss went off with General Haig 
                        this afternoon?  

                                 PAT
                        Whisked away by the General. Like 
                        two high school students on the way 
                        to the prom. 

                                 ROSE
                        What did Steve say?

           Pat looks at her carefully. 

                                 PAT
                        You’d know better than I. 

           Pat looks at her. Years of friendship between them. 

                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        Did something else happen? 

                                 ROSE
                        No. God. Spiro. What an ass. 

                                 PAT
                        That’s what I thought. Never a dull 
                        moment. 

           Rose nods. Her eyes widen to herself.  
           INT. MEDITERRANEAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Rose picks at her food. Across from her is BOB KNIGHT, 50s, 
           professional lobbyist, matinee idol looks and the perfect 
           escort: the right schools, the right dress, the right 
           pedigree. He lights a cigarette. 

                                 BOB
                        ... I told the donors about the 
                        Khrushchev visit when my dinner 
                        waistcoat clasp broke. 

           Rose nods. Barely listening.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        He couldn’t believe  one of the 
                        waitstaff returned with a yellow 
                        wooden golf tee. Which I used. 
                        Worked like a charm...

           Rose nods, with a faraway look. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Are you going to tell me what’s 
                        going on in that big head of yours? 

                                 ROSE
                        Nothing.

                                 BOB
                        And yet, you’re not enthralled by 
                        my charming anecdotes.

                                 ROSE
                        The golf tee as makeshift clasp is 
                        a great story. Sure to get some 
                        checkbooks opened.

           Bob drops it, but watches her carefully. Rose opens up. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        The President is worried about the 
                        tapes.

                                 BOB
                        He worries too much. They’ll never 
                        make him hand them over. 

                                 ROSE
                        Maybe... 

           A HANDSOME WAITER walks by. Bob stops to watch him. The 
           waiter leans over to light Bob’s cigarette. 
           The two men lock eyes. The waiter rushes off. Bob raises an 
           eyebrow to Rose, who watched the exchange. She smiles in 
           acknowledgement. 

                                 BOB
                        Let’s go out.   

                                 ROSE
                        It’s been a long day...

                                 BOB
                        Someplace fun. Where we can dance 
                        and look at handsome men. Turkish 
                        Embassy?
                            (beat)
                        Come on, it’s never as bad as you 
                        think...

           She nods, trying to shake off the day. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON: ROSE’S WALL SAFE

           Rose takes out another MARKED TAPE “AUGUST 15”. 

           CLOSE ON: The TAPE MARKED JUNE 20TH sits inside. Defiantly 
           staring back at her. She quickly shuts the safe door. Pull 
           out to reveal --

           INT. ROSE’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Rose is there alone. We notice the quiet. No typewriters or 
           office noise. 

           Rose transcribes. Very carefully, her eyes focused, making 
           sure there are no problems. Periodically her eyes 
           inadvertently flicker over to the safe. A reminder of her 
           mistake.  

           SUPERIMPOSE: OCTOBER 20, 1973

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - STEVE BULL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Rose waits outside Nixon’s office. There is commotion all 
           around with WEST WING STAFFERS rushing about; clearly 
           something big has happened. Rose remains calm. So does Steve, 
           who has his head buried in his work. Neither speaks. Only 
           when he is sure that no one can hear  --
                                 STEVE
                        Did the Attorney General really 
                        refuse to fire the Special 
                        Prosecutor? 

                                 ROSE
                            (quickly)
                        Yes.

                                 STEVE
                        Haig is on a warpath. He --

           He stops speaking as Haig, Garment, and Buzhardt clip past 
           them. As they enter the President’s office, they barely give 
           Rose a glance. The door shuts, leaving only Steve and Rose. 

                                 ROSE
                        Whatever happens. We stand by the 
                        Boss. 

           After a moment...

                                 NIXON (V.O.)
                        Rose?

           Rose heads into the Oval Office. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE ON Rose, pen and paper in hand, ready to take 
           dictation. Flanked by Garment, Buzhardt, and Haig. All three 
           face Nixon (we see the back of Nixon’s head). 

                                 BUZHARDT
                        The Attorney General and his deputy 
                        have refused to fire Cox.

                                 NIXON
                        Goddammit. Goddammit. 

                                 GARMENT
                        They’re resigning. 

                                 NIXON
                        Jesus Christ. Why are they doing 
                        this to me? 

                                 BUZHARDT
                        The question is, who can replace 
                        the Attorney General? 

                                 HAIG
                        The tapes cannot get out.  
           Rose looks up. No one notices.

                                 HAIG (CONT’D)
                        We need to insulate ourselves and 
                        find someone who can fire Cox and 
                        contain the situation. 

           Rose keeps her head down. We hear a CRASH as Nixon hurls a 
           glass across the room. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Rose sits, typing up notes. Steve Bull comes over. 

                                 STEVE
                        The General told me to make the 
                        President’s response to their 
                        resignations... short and sweet... 
                        But considering the current mood...

           Rose takes it and reads.

                                 ROSE
                            (reads)
                        “With regret, the President has 
                        discharged Attorney General 
                        Archibald Cox due to his refusal to 
                        adhere with the President’s 
                        instruction that he was not to see 
                        or compel notes, tapes, or 
                        memoranda of private conversations 
                        of the President.”

           Beat.

                                 STEVE
                        Well?

                                 ROSE
                        Change “adhere” to “comply”.

           Steve nods, is about to go. Rose is still thinking, revising. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        And lose the “with regret”. Keep it 
                        short. No need to be sweet.

           Pull back to reveal --

           Nixon’s daughter, JULIE NIXON, 25, sitting on the couch, 
           flipping through channels. Rose goes over and sits beside 
           her.

                                 JULIE NIXON
                        Daddy was so loyal to Mr. Cox... 
                        For him to resign makes him look...

           Julie wells up. Rose comforts her. 
                                 ROSE
                        Your father is the greatest 
                        president we have ever known. We 
                        just need to remain strong.  

           She takes the remote and turns off the TV. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Where’s your mother? 

           Long beat. 

                                 JULIE NIXON
                        Doing what she does when she’s 
                        upset. 

           Rose nods. Understands.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - NIXON BEDROOM - DAY

           Pat tosses out piles of dresses onto the bed. She’s half 
           zipped in a yellow dress, cigarette dangling from her lips. 
           When she sees Rose enter, she ushers her in.

                                 PAT
                        Good, you’re here. Zip me up?
                            (re: her dress)
                        Remember this one?

           Rose zips her up. 

                                 ROSE
                        From the ‘69 campaign.

           Pat considers herself in the mirror. Quickly shimmies out of 
           the dress. Picks up a pink gown.

                                 PAT
                        How about this number?

                                 ROSE
                        State dinner at the Del.  

                                 PAT
                        Right again!

           Pat disappears into the walk-in closet.

                                 PAT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        So, how bad is it? 

                                 ROSE
                        The resignations or the tapes?
           She fingers a brocade dress that lies beside her.

                                 PAT (O.S.)
                        What’s on them?

           Silence.

           Pat comes back out, wearing a black dress. She looks at Rose.

                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Rose. What’s on the tapes?

                                 ROSE
                        Nothing. Personal conversations. 

                                 PAT
                        Where he might not be seen in his

                        Yes.

           Beat.

                                 PAT
                        And that’s it?

                                 ROSE
                        That’s it. 

                                 PAT
                        And you will tell me when I need to 
                        worry.

                                 ROSE
                        Yes. 

           Pat goes over to the table. Lights another cigarette. 

                                 PAT
                        I thought when Haldeman left, 
                        things would get better.

                                 ROSE
                        We’re still cleaning up his mess.

           Pat fixes them both drinks. Rose takes hers and takes a sip. 
           It’s strong. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to have to testify. 

                                 PAT
                        To what?
                                 ROSE
                        Chain of custody.

                                 PAT
                        So, you tell them what you did. How 
                        you got the tapes, how you kept 
                        them, transcribed them.

           Rose sits in the silence. Takes a long drink. 

                                 ROSE
                        I’ve never testified before...

           Pat takes a scarf and wraps it around her head like a 
           fabulous film star. 

                                 PAT
                        Think Marlene Dietrich in Witness 
                        for the Prosecution. All you need 
                        is a wide brim hat and dark lovely 
                        red lipstick.

           Rose laughs. Pat tosses her the scarf. 

                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        They can’t touch you if you don’t 
                        let them.

                        ...All they want to know is who had

                        to your safe, and if the President 
                        had the combination.  

                                 ROSE
                        No one had access.

                                 BUZHARDT
                        Exactly.

           Rose waits for a WAITER to finish refilling the glasses of

                                 ROSE
                        What about the tape?

                                 BUZHARDT
                        Which tape?

                                 ROSE
                        The tape. The June 20th tape that 
                        was erased. The tape that had four 
                        minutes --

                                 BUZHARDT
                        It’s not part of the subpoena. They 
                        don’t ask. You don’t tell.

                        Okay. 

                                 BUZHARDT
                        Let’s go over it again.

           Rose testifies on the stand. Mr. Buzhardt is standing in

           The PROSECUTION TEAM -- TWO BEARDED MEN and a WOMAN, all 
           under 35, idealistic, and eager: RICHARD BEN-VENISTE, CARL 
           FELDBAUM, AND JILL VOLNER -- takes copious notes. 

           Presiding is JUDGE SIRICA, 69, listening intently.

                        And where were the tapes kept when

                        How many copies?

                                 ROSE
                        One. 

                                 BUZHARDT
                        What about the typewriter ribbon? 

                                 ROSE
                        The typewriter ribbon was burned. 

                                 BUZHARDT
                        And when did you finish?

                                 ROSE
                        October 24. 

                                 BUZHARDT
                        Where are those tapes now?

                                 ROSE
                        In a safe in my office. 

                                 BUZHARDT
                        And you are satisfied with the 
                        transcription and quality of the 
                        tapes? 

           Rose pauses. Gives Buzhardt a hard stare. 

                                 JUDGE SIRICA
                        Excuse me, can anyone hear Miss 
                        Woods? Can you repeat that for the 
                        record?

           Rose leans into the mic.

                                 ROSE
                            (louder)
                        Yes. 

                                 BUZHARDT
                        I have no further questions.

           MRS. VOLNER, 30, the only woman at the prosecution table, 
           approaches. She wears a miniskirt. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Where do you keep this safe?
                                 ROSE
                        In my office. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Combination lock?

                                 ROSE
                        Yes. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Where does the President retain 
                        documents of a top-secret nature?

                                 ROSE
                        He doesn’t. If you’re talking about 
                        national security then he would 
                        send those back to Mr. Kissinger’s 
                        people. Anything private he would 
                        keep in the residence. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Does the President have a 
                        combination to your safe?

                                 ROSE
                        No. 

                                 VOLNER
                        And you were in charge of putting 
                        the tapes into the recorder and 
                        transcribing them.

                                 ROSE
                        Yes. 

           Volner goes back to the prosecution table and brings over a 
           UHER RECORDING MACHINE, the same kind that Rose used. Rose’s 
           eyes quickly dart over to Buzhardt. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Were there any precautions made to 
                        make sure you didn’t accidentally 
                        hit the erase button?

           She glances over to Buzhardt, but he just sits there. 

                                 ROSE
                        Can you repeat the question?

                                 VOLNER
                            (annoyed)
                        What precautions did you make to 
                        not erase the tapes?
           Rose takes another quarter glance over to Buzhardt. Still 
           nothing. 

                                 VOLNER (CONT’D)
                        Ms. Woods?

                                 ROSE
                        Everyone said to be careful. So, I 
                        was careful. I don’t want to sound 
                        as if I’m bragging, but I am not so 
                        stupid. 
                            (to Buzhardt)
                        If I were told that if you push a 
                        button it will erase on a small 
                        machine, then I would use every 
                        precaution not to do that. 

                                 VOLNER
                        What precautions did you take?

                                 ROSE
                        I used my head. It’s the only one I 
                        had to use.

           Judge Sirica smiles. So does the stenographer. There is 
           LAUGHTER in the gallery. She’s winning her audience over. 
           Rose smiles.  

                                 VOLNER
                        And who was on the first tape, 
                        dated June 20th -- 

                                 ROSE
                        It was the President and Mr. 
                        Ehrlichman and Mr. Haldeman --

           Buzhardt jumps up. 

                                 BUZHARDT
                        Objection. This is about chain of 
                        custody, not the substance of the 
                        tape recordings. 

                                 JUDGE SIRICA
                        Sustained. Let’s move on, Ms. 
                        Volner. 

           INT. SEDAN - MOVING - DAY

           Rose sits in the back, next to Garment and Buzhardt.  
           Buzhardt taps her on the hand. 
                                 BUZHARDT
                        You were a hit! The judge and the 
                        press loved you!

            She pulls her hand away. She can barely contain herself. 

                                 ROSE
                        Why didn’t you object or say 
                        something about the erasures? 

                                 BUZHARDT
                        They were only talking about the 
                        subpoenaed portions of the tapes. 

                                 ROSE
                        But you could have asked me. I 
                        would have explained what happened. 
                            (beat)
                        It feels like lying.  

                                 GARMENT
                        An omission is not a lie. You did 
                        not lie.

                                 ROSE
                        And you wonder why people hate 
                        lawyers. 

           No one speaks. Rose turns to the window.

           SUPERIMPOSE: NOVEMBER 15, 1973

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - SOCIAL SECRETARY’S OFFICE - DAY

           LUCY WINCHESTER, 36, Social Secretary, stands over a large 
           table. Rose’s by her side, distracted.  

           Lucy rearranges WHITE HOUSE SEATING PLACARDS, in groups of 
           eight, in different orders.

           The ultimate example of political maneuvering: seating a 
           White House Dinner. 

                                 LUCY
                        I’m thinking white tie. Foreign 
                        leaders will love wearing 
                        medallions across their tummies. 

           She steps back and admires her handwork.

                                 LUCY (CONT’D)
                        What do you think? Rose? 
           Rose snaps back to attention and looks at it carefully.

                                 ROSE
                        You put Henry next to the Southern 
                        debutante?

                                 LUCY
                        She’s a junior from Vassar.

                                 ROSE
                        Henry’s been here, hasn’t he.
                            (off Lucy’s look)
                        Where did you have him before?

                                 LUCY
                        Next to the Russian Ambassador’s 
                        wife. He said he didn’t want to be 
                        next to an old crone with no teeth. 

           Rose switches the cards.

                                 ROSE
                        Blame me. Tell him the next time 
                        there’s a beautiful spy, I will 
                        make sure she’s at his table. For 
                        now, he must play nice with the 
                        crone. 

           I/E. GENERAL HAIG’S OFFICE - DAY

           Haig is at his desk. Buzhardt comes to the door. Haig looks 
           up, impatient.

                                 BUZHARDT
                        I’ve heard from the Special 
                        Prosecutor’s Office.

                                 HAIG
                            (impatient)
                        And?

                                 BUZHARDT
                        We’re going to have to hand over 
                        the entire June 20th tape. 

           Haig motions for him to come in. He shuts the door, leaving 
           us outside. 
           INT. WEST WING CORRIDOR - DAY

           Rose walks through her office and into --

           STEVE BULL’S OFFICE

           Haig speaks quietly with Steve. When they see her enter, they 
           stop talking. 

                                 HAIG
                        Get back to me when you find it.

           Haig smiles affably to Rose.

                                 HAIG (CONT’D)
                        Ms. Woods. You’re looking well.

                                 ROSE
                        General Haig.  

                                 HAIG
                        You finish up the transcribing?

                                 ROSE
                        Yes. All complete.

                                 HAIG
                        Good. Good. 

           Haig leaves.  

           Rose watches curiously. 

                                 STEVE
                        Henry’s scheduled with the 
                        President regarding the meeting 
                        with Arab foreign ministers.  

                                 ROSE
                        I’ll keep my eye out, or follow the 
                        scent of the young female interns. 

           She looks back in the direction of Haig.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        What was that?

           Steve shrugs, the PHONE RINGS, he answers. Rose doesn’t 
           press.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET - DAY
           LAWRENCE HIGBY, 26, Haldeman’s former assistant, works at his 
           desk. He looks up to find HAIG standing over him. Lawrence 
           reflexively sits up straight. 

                                 HAIG
                        Mr. Higby. I need a favor. 

           INT. EOB OFFICE - HALDEMAN OFFICE - NIGHT

           Lawrence Higby nervously enters. Haig and Buzhardt are 
           waiting for him, standing by the safe. 

           Higby spins the dial of the combination lock. CLICK. It pops 
           open. He hands a FOLDER over to Haig. Haig quickly opens the 
           folder, looking for something... He sees something...

                                 HAIG (CONT’D)
                            (to Lawrence)
                        You can go, Mr. Higby. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

           Rose catches Haig in the hallway.

                                 ROSE
                        May I have a moment?

                                 HAIG
                        Always for the great Ms. Woods.

                                 ROSE
                        Do you need any help with the 
                        tapes?

                                 HAIG
                        Tapes?

                                 ROSE
                        The transcribed tapes. They’re 
                        still in my safe.

                                 HAIG
                        Right. We will return them to the 
                        Secret Service before the hearing. 

                                 ROSE
                            (presses on)
                        Anything else you need from me?

                                 HAIG
                        Nothing more than you already do. 

           He smiles and walks away at a clipped pace.
           INT. STEVE BULL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Rose enters. Steve is filing papers 

                                 ROSE
                        The Boss at the EOB? 

                                 STEVE
                        Yep. Then dinner at Trader Vics 
                        with Mrs. Nixon. 

           Rose nods.

                                 ROSE
                        So, tell me.
                            (off Steve’s blank look)
                        What is going on with the General? 

                                 STEVE
                        You know I don’t know half of the 
                        things that come out of the 
                        General’s mouth.

           She doesn’t buy it. And he knows it. 

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        He wanted to contact Lawrence. 

                                 ROSE
                        Haldeman’s old assistant?   

                                 STEVE
                        They wanted to get into Haldeman’s 
                        safe. No one had the combination. 
                        Lawrence had to call Haldeman up 
                        and ask for the combo.

                                 ROSE
                        What does the General want with 
                        HRH’s files? 

           He shakes his head. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Steve...

                        June 20th. 
           INT. GEORGETOWN BAR - NIGHT

           Rose scans the bar. Pink Floyd’s ubiquitous MONEY blares as  
           YOUNG WASHINGTON: STAFFERS, LOBBYISTS, enjoy the last drop of 
           Happy Hour. It’s still early: ties are loosened but people 
           are still on their best behavior.  

           She sees LAWRENCE HIGBY sitting at a table with FRIENDS. They 
           lock eyes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           ROSE AND LAWRENCE AT THE BAR

                                 ROSE
                        Why did General Haig want to get 
                        into Haldeman’s safe so badly?

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Honestly, when Haig came to my desk 
                        I thought he was going to complain 
                        about Saudi budgets and oil 
                        supplies. 

                                 ROSE
                        What did he want?

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Haldeman’s notes. 

                                 ROSE
                        For June 20th?

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Yes. 

                                 ROSE
                        I thought that was not covered by 
                        the subpoena.

           Beat.

                                 LAWRENCE
                        This is bad, isn’t it?

           Rose doesn’t answer. 

           INT. MARYLAND PARK - DAY

           SUBURBAN MOMS let their CHILDREN play on the SWINGS, TEETER-
           TOTTERS, and MONKEY BARS. 
           Rose sits on a bench alongside her sister, ANNE, 30s, former 
           prom queen, not a hair out of place. 

           They watch ANNE’S CHILDREN, 5 and 7, play in the SANDBOX. 

                                 ANNE
                        It sounds like they don’t have your 
                        best interest in mind. 

                                 ROSE
                        No. President Nixon always has 
                        taken care of me. I just have to 
                        figure out what’s --

                                 ANNE
                        My advice? Find a new job. 

           Anne’s 5-YEAR-OLD runs over, shoe laces untied. Rose leans 
           over and ties them. 

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Did you even know that he was 
                        taping all those conversations?

                                 ROSE
                        Of course not. I’ve told you a 
                        million times that I had no idea 
                        and the President would never --

                                 ANNE
                        All Hank’s friends still talk about 
                        how pretty you are.  

                                 ROSE
                        I work for the President of the 
                        United States. Anyone else would be 
                        proud that their sister had come so 
                        far. 

           Anne pulls out a compact and fixes her lipstick. 

                                 ANNE
                        There’s more to life than a career. 
                        Even if it is working for the 
                        President. 

                                 ROSE
                        They’re my family. 

           Anne turns to her. Hurt and annoyed. 

                                 ANNE
                        No, I’m your family. They’re your 
                        employers. 
           Silence.

                                 ANNE (CONT’D)
                        Your priorities, Rose. That has 
                        always been your problem. 

           INT. BUZHARDT'S OFFICE - DAY

           Haig KNOCKS on the closed door. Opens it.

           Inside we see our two lawyers: Buzhardt and Garment in an 
           intense conversation.

                                 HAIG
                        Where’re we at? 

           Buzhardt and Garment look down at the table. An Uher between 
           them.

                                 BUZHARDT
                        We might have a problem. 

                                 GARMENT
                        We can’t duplicate the erasure.

           Haig’s face remains impassive, but his mind is racing. 

                                 HAIG
                        Then figure out how you can. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Post-dinner, Rose sits at the table with Pat, JULIE NIXON and 
           HER HUSBAND DAVID EISENHOWER, and TRICIA NIXON, 27. President 
           Nixon’s half-eaten plate is still at the table. 

                                 PAT
                        What should we watch tonight? 

                                 JULIE
                        Not Around the World in Eighty Days 
                        please.

                                 PAT
                        I vote The Good, the Bad and the 
                        Ugly. 
                            (beat)
                        Otherwise known as a day with The 
                        Washington Post.

           They all laugh. 
                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        Rose, you be the deciding vote. 
                        What movie should we see?

                                 JULIE
                        Please. Rose, be on my side. Bang 
                        the Drum Slowly. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Around the World, please. When Dad 
                        comes back I’ll get him on our 
                        side, Rose. 

           Rose smiles. She loves this family.  

                                 ROSE
                        I choose Eastwood. Definitely 
                        Eastwood.

           Pat gives Rose a kind look. 

           INT. APARTMENT - FOGGY BOTTOM - DAY

           Mid-bridal shower. A GROUP OF WOMEN surround the BRIDE-TO-BE 
           as she opens presents. One kitchen appliance after another.

           Rose sits demurely, but her mind’s somewhere else. Buzhardt’s 
           Secretary, KIMBERLY ANNE COOPER, 35, hands a drink to Rose. 

                                 KIMBERLY ANNE
                        You look like you could use it. 

           Rose takes the drink. The bride opens another box -- this one 
           is small and thin.  THE WHITE HOUSE RECEPTIONIST, 20s, from 
           Texas, claps her hands in excitement. 

                                 WHITE HOUSE RECEPTIONIST
                        Just for a little fun.

           The bride pulls out silky bright PINK LINGERIE. Some of the 
           women squeal. Kimberly Anne finishes her drink.

                                 KIMBERLY ANNE
                        Who needs more ice?

           Rose watches KIMBERLY ANNE head to the --

           KITCHEN 

           Kimberly Anne uses an ICE PICK to chip away at an ice block 
           in the sink. 

           Rose enters.
                                 ROSE
                        Need help?

           Kimberly Anne hands Rose the pick and puts some ice into 
           glasses. Then lights a cigarette.

                                 KIMBERLY ANNE
                        How long until our bride quits and 
                        moves into a Georgetown brownstone?

                                 ROSE
                        A year. Then a move to the suburbs 
                        when she gets pregnant.

                                 KIMBERLY ANNE
                        These bridal showers, how many have 
                        we had this year?

                                 ROSE
                        Three.

           Kimberly Anne looks at her carefully.

                                 KIMBERLY ANNE
                        You don’t want to be the last woman 
                        standing. 

           She offers Rose a cigarette. Rose lights it, takes a long 
           drag. Rose waits for her moment.

                                 ROSE
                        Has Buzhardt told you anything more 
                        about the tapes? 

                                 KIMBERLY ANNE
                        Just that he was in a tizzy about 
                        the new Uher shipment.

                                 ROSE
                            (plays along)
                        Right. The new Uher shipment. 

                                 KIMBERLY ANNE
                        I couldn’t believe the rush order. 
                        10 Uher 5000 and 10 Sony model 
                        tapes. Can you imagine? 

                                 ROSE
                            (carefully)
                        You wonder why they ordered all 
                        those Uhers...
                                 KIMBERLY ANNE
                        Who knows, and who am I to 
                        question. Buzhardt is a good boss 
                        and seems to know what he’s doing. 
                        Aren’t you the one that says the 
                        President and his men always know 
                        best?

                                 ROSE
                        The President does. 

                                 KIMBERLY ANNE
                        Exactly.
                            (beat)
                        Anyway, on to more interesting 
                        things... You’re coming out for 
                        drinks next week? I made Lynn put 
                        it in the books a month ago.

                                 ROSE
                        Of course.

                                 KIMBERLY ANNE
                        I have someone for you to meet. 
                        Bert’s friend. You’ll like him.

           Rose puts on a smile, gives a little nod. The White House 
           receptionist, now a little drunk, peaks her head in. 

                                 WHITE HOUSE RECEPTIONIST
                        You ladies coming with the ice?

           Rose follows the women back to the party; her party face on 
           but her worried eyes grow dark.

           He passes out a NEW UHER 5000 to each SEATED MAN in the

                        Everyone take a tape from the pile

                        Your goal here, in all seriousness, 
                        is to recreate what happened to the 
                        June 20th tape. Try and manipulate 
                        the tapes.

                        The question to be answered is, can 
                        we duplicate the erasure. 

           Each man does as he’s told, puts on the headphones, sets the 
           PEDAL of the UHERS at their feet. As they start to press 
           play, we hear Mick Jagger’s SEDUCTIVE VOICE --

                                  ROLLING STONES (PRELAP)
                        Please allow me to introduce 
                        myself...

           INT. ROSE’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           CLOSE on TWO SUITED MEN searching Rose’s office. We don’t see 
           their faces, but in a series of quick cuts we see they are 
           quickly, methodically, searching the office, careful to keep 
           everything in place. (If this feels like the break-in scene 
           of the Plumbers in ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN, it should.) 

                                 ROLLING STONES (O.S.)
                        I’m a man of wealth and taste. I’ve 
                        been around for a long, long year..

           What they are looking for we don’t know. ONE SUITED MAN, 
           wearing LEATHER GLOVES works the wall safe. Carefully 
           listening, like a safe cracker. CLICK. The safe opens. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           OUTSIDE HALLWAY - we see that there is OLIVER WRIGHT, 23, 
           part of the night cleaning crew, who has heard the ruckus in 
           Rose’s room, he stops. Realizes that being witness is not a 
           smart idea, he quietly heads in the opposite direction. 

                                 ROLLING STONES (CONT’D)
                        Stole many a man’s hope and 
                        faith...
           INT. ROSE’S OFFICE - MORNING

           She sits down, pulls the cover off her typewriter. As she 
           does, Rose notices one of her ELEPHANT FIGURINES on the table 
           is a little off-center. Strange. She quickly turns his trunk 
           to face east. 

           Now she takes a closer look at her desk and office. Her 
           spidey sense is tingling. Something is imperceptibly off. She 
           heads to the safe. Opens it and sees the tapes. 

           Checks the JUNE 20th TAPE. It still sits with the rest of the 
           other seven tapes. 

           Buzhardt peeks his head into her office.

                                 BUZHARDT
                        Ready for the handoff? 

           Rose nods, but is clearly unsettled. 

           INT. ROSE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Buzhardt and a SECRET SERVICE AGENT are given the tapes by 
           Rose, as she takes them out of the safe. Buzhardt speaks into 
           a mini dictaphone.

                                 BUZHARDT
                        The official handover for chain of 
                        custody, 10:30 am, turning over the 
                        subpoenaed tapes back to the Secret 
                        Service from Ms. Woods’ safe.  

           The Agent leaves with the BOX OF TAPES. Buzhardt smiles at 
           Rose, but she’s worried. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE SUN ROOM  - DAY

           Rose tracks down USHER REGINALD WRIGHT, 50s, African 
           American, as he cleans the room. When he sees her, he 
           straightens up. 

                                 USHER REGINALD
                        Ms. Woods. I didn’t see you there, 
                        will you be wanting this room? 

                                 ROSE
                        I need to speak with you.

                                 USHER REGINALD
                        How can I help you?
           Rose waits. 

                                 ROSE
                        I have been... I need to know who 
                        was in the West Wing last night. 
                        After hours. The cleaning crew? 

           He looks at her. She looks as AN AIDE PASSES.

           A beat. 

                                 USHER REGINALD
                        When was this?

                                 ROSE
                        Last night. Who was on duty? 

           Another beat. We can see in Usher Reginald’s eyes that he 
           knows something. 

                                 USHER REGINALD
                        I’m sorry. I can’t help you. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

           GLADYS WRIGHT, ASSISTANT PASTRY CHEF, 40s, African American, 
           works on the finishing touches of petit fours. 

                                 GLADYS
                        Rose -- if you’re checking on the 
                        menu, I have it noted that the 
                        Romanian president has an upset 
                        stomach. 

                                 ROSE
                        I need to speak to Reginald. 

           Gladys looks up. 

                                 GLADYS
                        Reggie? I guess he would be in the 
                        residence. Did you check the sun 
                        room?

           Rose nods. 

                                 ROSE
                        Actually I found him. 

                                 GLADYS
                        Wonderful. 
                                 ROSE
                        Was Reginald was on duty last 
                        night?

           Gladys gets back to work on the petit fours. 

                                 GLADYS
                        What did he tell you?

                                 ROSE
                        He didn’t. 

           Gladys smiles.

                                 GLADYS
                        Then I guess that’s your answer.  
                            (beat)
                        Anything else I can help you with? 

                                 ROSE
                        No. Everything looks lovely. As 
                        always. 

           She leaves. Gladys stops icing, stares after her. 

           INT. GARMENT’S OFFICE - DAY

           Rose enters. Garment is knee-deep in paperwork. He looks up 
           and smiles. There’s an easy camaraderie between them.

                                 GARMENT
                        How’re things?

                                 ROSE
                        Good.

           She looks at the door.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Okay to shut it?

           He nods, and she does.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Do I have to worry about anything, 
                        Len?

                                 GARMENT
                        No. Why?

                                 ROSE
                        I’m not an idiot. I know something 
                        is going on. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        I know there are secret meetings.
                            (whispers)
                        I could swear someone might have 
                        been in my office last night. Is 
                        this about the erasure, because I 
                        know -- 

                                 GARMENT
                        There’s nothing. 

                                 ROSE
                        I just need to know. I need you to 
                        tell me if I need to worry.

           A beat.

                                 GARMENT
                        You don’t need to worry.

           Garment looks like he wants to say more. But doesn’t. 

           I/E. WRIGHT HOUSE - MARYLAND - NIGHT

           Rose parks her car in front of a WELL-MANICURED ROW OF 
           HOUSES. It’s a quiet street, a two-bus transfer commute away 
           from the White House. A whole different world. 

           Rose gets out of the car. Looks around. Some NEIGHBORS 
           sitting on the porch look at her, more like stare.

           Rose heads to the house with the RED DOOR. KNOCKS. 

           Gladys answers. When she sees it’s Rose, she crosses her 
           arms.

                                 ROSE
                        I need to speak with Reginald.

                                 GLADYS
                        I thought that he was pretty clear. 

                                 ROSE
                        I know. And I know that you are 
                        worried and thinking --

                                 GLADYS
                        You don’t know what we’re thinking.

           Beat. 

                                 ROSE
                        Please... A moment of your time.
           Gladys’ face softens.

           INT. WRIGHT HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON THREE PIES cooling on the counter.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 

           Rose sitting across from Usher Reginald and Gladys.

           Usher Reginald holds his hands tightly. 

                                 USHER REGINALD
                        I don’t know what you want me to 
                        say, Ms. Woods. I don’t know. 

                                 ROSE
                        I understand you don’t want to get 
                        involved.

                                 USHER REGINALD
                        These are good jobs we have. Number 
                        one rule at the White House, look 
                        the other way.

                                 ROSE
                        I understand.

                                 GLADYS
                        Do you? 

           Silence. 

                                 USHER REGINALD
                        What was taken? Something valuable?

                                 GLADYS
                        Reggie, no. 

                                 USHER REGINALD
                        Are the police involved?  

                                 ROSE
                        No. Nothing like that. I don’t 
                        think so. Actually, I’m not sure. 
                        But no one’s going to get in 
                        trouble. 

                                 GLADYS
                        And you think someone from the 
                        support staff took it?

           Then it dawns on her the cause for their nervousness.
                                 ROSE
                        No. Oh, no. Nothing like that. 

           Silence.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        No one at the White House is 
                        asking. Just me. 

           Usher Reginald and Gladys look at each other. This might be 
           even worse.

                                 USHER REGINALD
                        Why do you want to know if one of 
                        the under-butlers or ushers were 
                        there?

                                 ROSE
                        Someone broke into my office.  

                                 USHER REGINALD
                        You say nothing will happen, but 
                        when something does come out...  

                                 GLADYS
                            (pointedly)
                        They don’t fire the white 
                        secretary.

                                 ROSE
                        Someone broke into my office. Or 
                        some people. Looking for something 
                        and I have no idea what for. I 
                        don’t know what or why. 

           They don’t respond. Rose gets upset. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        I have always done what I’ve been 
                        told. I have served the President 
                        from when he was a Senator from 
                        California to Vice President to 
                        President. Twenty-three years.
                            (beat)
                        I’ve devoted my life to playing by 
                        the rules. But I don’t know the 
                        game now. I don’t know the rules. 
                            (beat)
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry to bother you. 
                        I’ll let myself out. 

           Gladys and Reginald exchange looks as she leaves. 
           INT. ROSE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Rose works at her desk.

           Usher Reginald enters in with A BOUQUET OF AUTUMN FLOWERS in 
           a vase.

           Rose looks up.

                                 ROSE
                        Is this for the residence? Is Mrs. 
                        Nixon expecting the bouquet? 

                                 USHER REGINALD
                        I don’t believe so. 

           Rose looks at him quizzically. He stands there awkwardly. A 
           few people pass by the door.

                                 USHER REGINALD (CONT’D)
                        Beautiful day today.

                                 ROSE
                        Yes.

                                 USHER REGINALD
                        I’m meeting my nephew tonight at 
                        the Broadway Diner. Celebrating him 
                        making Dean’s List.

                                 ROSE
                        That’s wonderful.

                                 USHER REGINALD
                        We’ll be there at 7 o'clock. 

           Beat. He looks at her.

                                 USHER REGINALD (CONT’D)
                        7 o'clock. You would like that 
                        diner. Even Gladys says it makes 
                        good desserts.

           He looks at her. Rose nods, understands.

                                 ROSE
                        The Broadway Diner. I will check it 
                        out. 

           He nods and leaves as Lynn walks in.

           INT. BOARDWALK DINER - NIGHT
           Rose sits in a booth, nursing a CUP OF COFFEE. Across from 
           her: Usher Reginald and his NEPHEW, OLIVER WRIGHT, the young 
           usher we saw witness the break-in. Now we realize who Usher 
           Reginald and Gladys were protecting. 

                                 USHER REGINALD
                        He can’t lose his job. 
                            (proudly)
                        My nephew’s gonna go to medical 
                        school.

                                 OLIVER
                        I’m taking the MCATs this spring.

                                 ROSE
                        No one will know. I promise. 

           Reginald gives a nod to Oliver. 

                                 OLIVER
                        They were in your office. 

                                 ROSE
                        Who? 

           Oliver shakes his head.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        It will never come back to you.

           Oliver turns to Reginald, who nods. 

                                 OLIVER
                        The lawyers. Mr. Buzhardt and Mr. 
                        Garment. 

           This lands on Rose. Hard. 

           INT. ROSE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Bob makes martinis for himself and Rose, as Rose fiddles with 
           her ELEPHANT FIGURINES on her ETAGERE. 

           In the background, the television blares the news of the 
           Mideast crisis. 

                                 BOB
                        What were they looking for?

                                 ROSE
                        God if I know.  
                                 BOB
                        Go to the President. Tell him.

           Rose points the TV.

                                 ROSE
                        He has more important things to 
                        worry about.

                                 BOB
                        Is that it?

                                 ROSE
                        What do you mean?

                                 BOB
                        I mean, is there a part of you 
                        that’s more afraid that the 
                        President already knows?

           Rose refuses to answer. 

           INT. JUDGE SIRICA’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Judge Sirica shows Buzhardt and Garment to their seats. 

                                 JUDGE SIRICA
                        I read your memorandum. I have to 
                        say, I’m surprised.

                                 BUZHARDT
                        As were we. But the fact is, there 
                        are only three people with access 
                        to the erasure. 

                                 GARMENT
                        And we’re confident that Rose Mary 
                        Woods can provide the court with a 
                        much-needed explanation. 

                                 JUDGE SIRICA
                        Schedule her to come back in and 
                        we’ll notify the prosecution. Are 
                        you all in agreement that she’s 
                        responsible?  

                                 BUZHARDT
                        We are. 

           Garment looks down, feeling guilty.
           INT. ROSE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: WHITE HOUSE LOG SHEET for OCTOBER 1, 1973. PULL OUT 
           TO REVEAL --

           Rose scouring the list.

           Hair in rollers and in her stocking feet. She drinks bottled 
           beer and eats from a PLATE OF COOKIES, frustrated. Looks out 
           the window. 

           She accidentally spills her beer on her blouse and knocks the 
           plate of cookies off the table. There’s a KNOCK on the door.

           Rose puts on a ROBE to answer the door.

           We’re back to our very first Rose and the lawyers scene. But 
           now from Rose’s perspective. She opens the door and we see 
           Garment and Buzhardt at the door. 

                                 ROSE
                        One second.

           She closes the door and eyes her WORK PRODUCT on the table, 
           then the COOKIES on the floor. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           PLATE OF COOKIES

                                 BUZHARDT
                        As I said, it’s best for you to 
                        have your own attorney 

                                 ROSE
                        Then I will get one.
                            (beat)
                        We live in Washington, D.C. You 
                        can’t walk two feet without hitting 
                        a lawyer. 

                                 GARMENT
                        Not the kind you need. 

           Buzhardt clears his throat. Even he knows how ridiculous it 
           sounds.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - SUN ROOM

           Rose sits with a tea cup in her lap, trying to put on a brave 
           face. Pat is across from her, concerned.
                                 PAT
                        What did they say, exactly?

                                 ROSE
                        Mrs. Nixon. I don’t think you 
                        should get involved. 

                                 PAT
                        If you’re involved, I’m involved. 

                                 ROSE
                        I’m sure one of these names will be 
                        fine enough to represent me --

                                 PAT
                        Over my dead body. We need someone 
                        we can trust that answers to no 
                        one. 

           Pat gets up and leaves the room.

           In a moment Pat returns, holding a BUSINESS CARD.

                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        Someone more... independent. 

           Rose takes the business card.

                                 ROSE
                            (reads card)
                        Jerome Rine. 

                                 PAT
                        Now, just to warn you. He’s... 
                        ethnic... But he’s a good lawyer. 
                        Most important, he’s not part of 
                        the Washington machine.

                                 ROSE
                        Thank you, Mrs. Nixon.

                                 PAT
                        Rose. You’ve been supporting the 
                        president for 23 years. You baby-
                        sat the girls, they call you Aunt 
                        Rose... 
                            (beat)
                        Can you at least call me Pat in the 
                        residence?

                                 ROSE
                        Thank you, Pat. 
                                 PAT
                        See? Was that so hard?  

           INT. POSIN’S DELI - DAY

           Rose holds her purse tightly as she surveys the old fashioned 
           Jewish deli: complete with red pleather booths and laminated 
           menus. A meat case across the back, and a CROTCHETY DELI GUY 
           shouting orders. 

           Loud, noisy, with the air hazy with smoke. Rose is not in her 
           element. 

           She sees JERRY RINE, 50s, doughy-looking, messily eating a 
           corned beef sandwich.

           Beside Jerry, HIS DAUGHTER, SARAH, 20s. He takes the pickle 
           on his plate and points it at her. They are in the middle of 
           a debate. Sarah swats it away.

           Rose heads over to them. 

                                 ROSE
                        Jerome Rine? 

                                 JERRY
                        You must be Rose. Call me Jerry. 

           He motions for her to take a seat. 

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Join us. We’re debating the Fourth 
                        Amendment. My daughter is starting 
                        to sound like Pinochet.  

                                 SARAH
                        Forgive my father. He thinks 
                        everyone who doesn’t agree with him 
                        is a fascist.

           Jerry pulls out some of the hanging meat from his sandwich, 
           it slips through his chubby fingers. Rose can’t mask her 
           revulsion.  

                                 JERRY
                        So. Pat called me. You’re in quite 
                        a pickle. No pun intended.

                                 ROSE
                        I honestly think it’s a big 
                        misunderstanding. 

           Beat.
                                 JERRY
                        No thanks to your boss, I’m sure. 
                        Our friend Dick’s getting in some 
                        hot water.

                                 ROSE
                            (defensive)
                        I disagree. I think the President 
                        is doing a wonderful job leading 
                        the country and --

           Jerry waves the WASHINGTON POST PAPER at her, speaking 
           loudly.  

                                 JERRY
                        Not what the court of public 
                        opinion says. 

           Rose stands up. She’s had enough.

                                 ROSE
                        Mr. Rine. I’m sorry. I think this 
                        is a mistake. I will not have 
                        anyone speak ill of the President --

                                 JERRY
                        18 1/2 minutes. 

                                 ROSE
                        I’m sorry?

                                 JERRY
                        I spoke with the Judge’s Clerk this 
                        morning. The White House Lawyers 
                        have informed the Judge of an 18 
                        1/2 minute gap in the June 20th 
                        tape that you allegedly erased. 

           Silence. Rose is dumbfounded. All she can do is shake her 
           head and then --

                                 ROSE
                        You’re mistaken. I told them I may 
                        have erased four minutes, but even 
                        that... I told them that I wasn’t 
                        sure. They have the tapes now. They 
                        can check. 

                                 JERRY
                        Ms. Woods. The White House has a 
                        problem. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JERRY (CONT'D)
                        There are 18 1/2 minutes of 
                        conversation that are unaccounted 
                        between the President and his Chief 
                        of Staff, Halderman,  -- their 
                        first conversation after Watergate.

           He lets those words hang for a moment, Rose doesn’t respond.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        They are going to hold someone 
                        responsible, and that someone seems 
                        to be you. 

           She stands frozen. Processing. 18 1/2 minutes? 

                                 ROSE
                        No. This is a mistake. It wasn’t 18 
                        1/2 minutes. 

                                 JERRY
                        Mrs. Nixon was right. You need a 
                        good lawyer. 

           Rose just stands there. Jerry gets up.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s start again. 
                            (wipes his hand, offers it)
                        I’m Jerry Rine. I graduated from 
                        Harvard Law School the same year 
                        Dick graduated from Duke. I’ve been 
                        a trial lawyer for the past 20 
                        years, and have never lost a jury 
                        case. I believe in the law and 
                        government. And, I’m a registered 
                        Democrat.
                            (beat)
                        But I will fight for you. So 
                        please...

           He motions for her to sit. Rose warily does. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE CAFETERIA - DAY

           Rose and Lynn go through the cafeteria line. Lynn flaunts her 
           ENGAGEMENT RING. 

                                 LYNN
                        Can I repeat how he proposed one 
                        more time? I promise the third 
                        time’s a charm.  
                                 ROSE
                            (patient)
                        Of course. 
                            (re:ring)
                        It’s lovely. 

           They take their trays and look for a space to sit. The 
           SECRETARIES that we saw before at the party now sit at a 
           table looking like some version of adult mean girls. Kimberly 
           Ann flicks her eyes quickly over in Rose’s direction. All the 
           others follow suit. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        I bet she got an earful from 
                        Buzhardt for telling me about those 
                        Uhers. She must have the most awful 
                        things to say...

                                 LYNN
                        Let them talk. 

           Kimberly Anne turns and gives Rose a cold look.

                                 ROSE
                        I get it. She is loyal to her boss 
                        and doesn’t want to lose her job. 
                        She has to tow the party line. 

                                 LYNN
                        That’s no reason to abandon your 
                        friends. I would never abandon you.

                                 ROSE
                        Maybe you should. In this building 
                        I’m as good as kryptonite. 

           Lynn motions to an empty table.

                                 LYNN
                        Come on, Kryptonite. My ring and I 
                        are very hungry.

           INT. STEVE BULL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Rose finds Steve looking through a magazine during his lunch 
           break. He looks up to see Rose and knows why she’s there.

                                 ROSE
                        Right after I told the General 
                        about the gap, he and the President 
                        went on a car ride.
                                 STEVE
                        Yes.

           Silence. She waits.

                                 ROSE
                        You must have heard through the 
                        grapevine that they told me to get 
                        a lawyer.

                                 STEVE
                        I heard something like that.

                                 ROSE
                        It’s about the tapes. 
                            (beat)
                        I need to know if the President 
                        knows. 

                                 STEVE
                        What did you tell me the first day 
                        I was hired? 

                                 ROSE
                        To protect the President above all 
                        else. Nothing else matters. 

                                 STEVE
                        There’s your answer. 

           INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

           HALF THE BAR PATRONS (men in suits) watch the evening news 
           while the other half watch the MLB playoff game. 

           Rose faces the TV with the news. All about the Watergate 
           hearings. She tries to avert her eyes, but the news coverage 
           is hypnotic. 

           Jerry’s mid-conversation, making lists of trial strategy on 
           napkins. Sarah’s beside Rose. 

                                 JERRY
                        So, I spoke to the Special 
                        Prosecutor’s Office. And you’re 
                        scheduled to testify next week. 
                        Subpoena should be coming today or 
                        tomorrow. 

           Rose drags her gaze from the screen. 

                                 ROSE
                        I need a copy of the tape. 
           E/I. BOB’S GEORGETOWN BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           Rose KNOCKS on the door. It’s late. Bob opens the door. 
           Surprised. Maybe he just woke up? She holds up the COPY OF 
           THE JUNE 20th TAPE. 

                                 ROSE
                        I know why I need a lawyer. 

           INT. BOB’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Bob makes Rose a drink. 

           They play the tape and listen to the CLICKING and WHITE 
           NOISE. He turns it off. 

                                 BOB
                        Well you can’t dance to it.

           Rose stares at the tape. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        18 1/2 minutes of that?

                                 ROSE
                        Yes.

                                 BOB
                        And they want you to say that you 
                        did it?

                                 ROSE
                        Yep.

                                 BOB
                        All of it?

                                 ROSE
                        Yes. 

                                 BOB
                        What did your lawyer say?

           A MAN, 40s, descends the stairs. Handsome, tousled hair, he 
           sees Rose and stops. Rose realizes that she has interrupted 
           something. 

                                 ROSE
                        I’ll come back. 

                                 BOB
                        Don’t be silly. Rose, this is my 
                        friend, John. He’s leaving. 
                                 JOHN
                        Good to meet you. 

           John tucks in his shirt, wanting to make a quick exit. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll see you.

                                 BOB
                        Right.

           John leaves. After he does, Rose looks at Bob. 

                                 ROSE
                        I’m sorry I interrupted.

                                 BOB
                        You didn’t. 

           No one speaks.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                            (teasing)
                        Are you offended? 

                                 ROSE
                        Of course not. 

           She smiles, with clear unsaid acceptance. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        You must know that whatever makes 
                        you happy makes me happy.

                                 BOB
                        Same goes for me. Single women and 
                        homosexuals have to stick together. 
                        At least as long as we stay 
                        Republican.

           Rose laughs. 

                                 ROSE
                        Well, he seems like a very nice 
                        man.

                                 BOB
                        His wife seems to think so. 
                            (re: tape)
                        What will you do?

                                 ROSE
                        I don’t know. 
           INT. SPECIAL PROSECUTION OFFICE - DAY

           AN INTERN delivers a DOCUMENT for Volner and the other 
           prosecuting attorneys we met earlier. 

                                 BEN-VENISTE
                        What now? 

                                 VOLNER
                        Ms. Woods is returning to amend her 
                        testimony. 

                                 BEN-VENISTE
                        Amend to what?

                                 FELDBAUM
                            (tries to sound like Rose)
                        “I’m sorry that when you asked if 
                        the President had access to the 
                        safe I lied. I love him. I looove 
                        him.”

           Volner shakes her head. She knows she has to hold her tongue. 
           The price of being the only woman lawyer in the room. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Maybe the President’s men had more 
                        access to the tapes than she 
                        originally testified... Or... 

                                 BEN-VENISTE
                        Or, what?

                                 VOLNER
                        Or, she lied. 

           Feldbaum senses an opportunity. 

                                 FELDBAUM
                        I can do the cross. If there is an 
                        inconsistency maybe --

                                 VOLNER
                        No. It’s my witness. I did her 
                        initial testimony. 

                                 FELDBAUM
                            (to Ben-Veniste)
                        This might lead to something. 

           Volner tries to keep her cool. 
                                 VOLNER
                        I know you guys joke about how the 
                        press calls me the lawyer in the 
                        miniskirt. Like how a dress defines 
                        me. Or, maybe the reason that I’m 
                        even on this committee...
                            (to Ben-Veniste)
                        They don’t know that I was one of 
                        23 females to graduate from 
                        Columbia Law School. Or that I made 
                        Dean’s List... 
                            (pointedly)
                        But you do. You both know.   
                            (beat)
                        In every aspect of my life, I’ve 
                        had to be better. Better than all 
                        of you. So, please don’t tell me I 
                        can’t handle a cross of a 
                        secretary.  

           Ben-Veniste nods. Volner smiles, triumphant. 

           E/I. 21ST STREET HIGH-RISE - DAY

           Rose and Sarah enter fresh from the cold into a nondescript 
           lobby room of sorts. A RECEPTIONIST, 20s, smiles. 

                                 SARAH
                        Sarah Rine of Rine & Associates and 
                        Ms. Woods to see Mr. Anderson.

           The receptionist presses the call button and announces them.

           INT. WAITING ROOM  - DAY

           Now in a smaller room. Rose holds on to her purse tightly, 
           nervous. Sarah smiles reassuringly. 

           MR. ANDERSON, 50s, middle-aged paunch and no sense of humor, 
           enters to greet Sarah. 

                                 MR. ANDERSON
                        Ms. Woods, Ms. Rine. How’s your 
                        father? I haven’t seen him since we 
                        campaigned for McGovern. Is he 
                        still tilting at windmills? 

                                 SARAH
                        He’s doing fine. 

           Mr. Anderson turns to Rose, as if noticing her for the first 
           time. 
                                 MR. ANDERSON
                        Okay. Ms. Woods, if you could wait 
                        here while Ms. Rine and I discuss 
                        the procedure. It won’t be long. 

                                 SARAH
                            (to Rose)
                        Don’t worry, this is just a 
                        practice run to see if we want to 
                        request a polygraph in court.

           Rose nods. 

           Sarah and Mr. Anderson leave. Rose is alone. Some Muzak wafts 
           in through the walls. 

           The receptionist enters --

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        We’ve met before, Ms. Woods. 

                                 ROSE
                        Oh?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                            (whispers)
                        At the RNC dinner in Chicago. Don’t 
                        tell all these Democrats...

                                 ROSE
                        Tell them what?  

           Mr. Anderson and Sarah return.

                                 MR. ANDERSON
                        All the paperwork’s been sorted 
                        out. Ready for the torture chamber?

           INT. POLYGRAPH ADMINISTERING ROOM - DAY

           Rose sits hooked up to the polygraph. The ADMINISTRATOR, 40s, 
           with thick glasses, adjusts the machine. 

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Not a great time to say you’re 
                        working for the White House.

                                 ROSE
                        I’m sure I don’t know what you 
                        mean. 
                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Well, we’ll get it all sorted. The 
                        Watergate Committee and all... Soon 
                        your boss might be out of a job. 
                        Boy, I’d love to get him strapped 
                        into one of these.  

           The administrator laughs. Rose doesn’t know what to say.  

                                 ADMINISTRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Now I want to warn you. If you’re 
                        guilty, you shouldn’t be here. I 
                        have my own integrity and 
                        reputation to consider. 

                                 ROSE
                        I understand.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        We’ll do some control questions and 
                        then we’ll move into the heart of 
                        the matter. 

           He readjusts the ARM BAND on Rose’s arm that’s connected to 
           the machine.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, it’s like the dentist. 
                        You think it’s going to hurt but it 
                        doesn’t.

                                 ROSE
                        I think that’s a little tight.

           He doesn’t adjust it. 

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Here we go. Are you called Rose?

                                 ROSE
                        Yes.

           He checks the machine. We can’t see the results. His blank 
           face is unreadable. 

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Do you work as a personal secretary 
                        to President Nixon?

                                 ROSE
                        Yes.

           Another check at the machine. 
                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Did you go to college?

                                 ROSE
                        I went to secretarial school.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Did you go to college?

                                 ROSE
                        No. 

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Have you ever cheated anyone out of 
                        anything?

           Rose’s a little taken aback.

                                 ROSE
                        No. I mean, not since I was a 
                        child. Maybe. Like to get an extra 
                        piece of candy.

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Yes or no. 

                                 ROSE
                        No.

           He checks the machine, his face impassive. 

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Have you ever stolen anything? 

                                 ROSE
                        No, maybe a penny or nickel when I 
                        was little. 

           She begins to sweat. The room starts to spin. 

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Yes or no.

                                 ROSE
                        No. 

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Did anyone order you to alter or 
                        erase the June 20th tape?

                                 ROSE
                        No.
                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Did you deliberately erase or alter 
                        the June 20th tape? 

                                 ROSE
                        No. 

           A beat. The Administrator looks disappointed. 

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        Did the President order you to 
                        alter the tape?

                                 ROSE
                        No. And I think it’s terribly 
                        unfair to say that when the man has 
                        done a tremendous job as President, 
                        and people are going out of their 
                        way to make him look terrible.

           The administrator doesn’t look happy. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        He would never order me to do 
                        anything like that. Never. No.

           The administrator clicks off the machine. 

                                 ADMINISTRATOR
                        You can go back to the lobby.

           INT. LOBBY - DAY

           Rose waits while the receptionist flips through magazines. In 
           a moment, Sarah comes to join her. Sarah’s pissed.

                                 SARAH
                        Let’s go.

           Rose looks up, follows her out. 

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Rose catches up with Sarah, who buys two hotdogs from a 
           VENDOR. She hands one to Rose. 

                                 ROSE
                        What happened?

                                 SARAH
                        They said that the test run was 
                        inconclusive.
                                 ROSE
                        Why? I couldn’t possibly have 
                        failed. I was telling the truth.

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t know. I guess we should 
                        have checked the party affiliation 
                        before we hired them. 

           Rose understands all too well.

                                 ROSE
                        The Democrats want me to blame the 
                        President and say he ordered me to 
                        do it... and the Republicans want 
                        me to take the blame for something 
                        I didn’t do. 

                                 SARAH
                        In a nutshell, yes. 

                                 ROSE
                        Well, I won’t do either. 
                            (beat)
                        Why is it that neither side wants 
                        to hear the truth?  

                                 SARAH
                        One word: politics.  

           Rose looks down at her hotdog.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        I’m thirsty. 

           INT. BAR - DAY

           Sarah and Rose are each drinking Manhattans. 

                                 SARAH
                        Do you mind me asking you a 
                        question?

                                 ROSE
                        I believe in the President. I don’t 
                        think that he --

                                 SARAH
                        No. Not that. 
                            (beat)
                        I saw your file. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        You graduated with top marks from 
                        high school, everyone agrees that 
                        you’re the best editor and writer, 
                        I just -- did you ever wish for 
                        more?

           Rose pauses. No one’s asked her that in a long time. 

                                 ROSE
                        I never had time to think about 
                        things like that, who I wanted to 
                        be, or who I admired... I had to 
                        work... I grew up knowing I had to 
                        take care of my family. 
                            (lifts her drink up)
                        I devoted my life to my career. 

                                 SARAH
                        It’s admirable.

                                 ROSE
                        I’d like to think so. That I’ve 
                        made a mark, however small...

                                 SARAH
                        I just don’t know how you do it. I 
                        couldn’t take orders from people 
                        all day. From men not as smart as --

                                 ROSE
                        You get used to it. 
                            (beat)
                        Besides, never underestimate the 
                        power of the secretary. If we don’t 
                        already know your secrets, we’ll 
                        find them... 
                            (wheels turning)
                        Which is what any good secretary  
                        would do... 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           ROSE heads down to the White House basement. 

           Rose arrives at the --

           BASEMENT

           Agent Wong stands to greet her.

                                 AGENT WONG
                        Ms. Woods, you’re working late.
                                 ROSE
                        Yes. The President wants the log of 
                        everyone that came in and out of 
                        the West Wing on July 13, 1973. 

           EXT. JOGGING TRACK, GEORGETOWN - EVENING

           Steve Bull runs the track like a former athlete. Rose 
           watches. As he does his last sprint, he sees her. Doesn’t 
           look too happy as he comes toward her and catches his breath. 

                                 ROSE
                        I read the logs. Ten days. General 
                        Haig had the tapes for ten days. 
                        That was after Haldeman kept them 
                        in a drawer. 
                            (beat)
                        Before I even got custody of the 
                        tapes. He had them. He had full 
                        control over them and must have 
                        know about the erasures.

                                 STEVE
                        Yes.

                                 ROSE
                            (pointedly)
                        And you had the key. 

                                 STEVE
                        Yes.

                                 ROSE
                        Did you tell them when you 
                        testified? About General Haig and 
                        his access long before I did?

           He looks at her. Sweat pouring down his face, we notice how 
           young he is. So does Rose. 

                                 STEVE
                        I told the truth. 

           E/I. LYNN’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Lynn carries in her groceries. She sees TWO SUITED MEN 
           sitting in the lobby, 
           INT. LYNN’S APARTMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Lynn pulls out the keys. She sees the men have come up the 
           elevator behind her. She quickly goes inside.

           She puts down the bags. There’s a KNOCK on the door. She 
           looks through the PEEP HOLE. 

           CLOSE ON: FBI BADGE

           With a deep breath, she opens the door, leaves the chain on.

                                 FBI AGENT #1
                        Ms. Hefner. May we come in?

           Lynn stands by the door. The TWO FBI AGENTS hover, mid-
           conversation.

                                 FBI AGENT #1
                        What do you know about the 
                        subpoenaed tape? 

                                 LYNN
                        What tape?

                                 FBI AGENT #1
                            (annoyed)
                        June 20th, 1972. 

                                 LYNN
                        Nothing.

                                 FBI AGENT #2
                        Nothing? You work right next to 
                        Rose Woods, don’t you? 

                                 LYNN
                        How did you get inside my building? 
                            (off no answer)
                        I think you should leave.

                                 FBI AGENT #1
                        If you’re not comfortable talking, 
                        feel free to retain an attorney.
                            (beat)
                        We’ll be in touch. 

           They leave. Lynn leans against the door. Frightened.
           INT. ROSE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Rose sits with Lynn on the couch. 

                                 LYNN
                        It was the way that they said it. I 
                        didn’t know what to do. What does 
                        the FBI want with you? 

                                 ROSE
                        Who knows. I’ll testify and it will 
                        be done. We’ll even laugh about it.

           Both smile. But neither really believe it. 

                                 RADIO (PRELAP) 
                        In Washington today we have an air 
                        pollution alert. People with 
                        respiratory problems are warned to 
                        stay indoors...

           CLOSE ON ROSE’S RADIO

           Pull out to reveal Rose getting ready for her big day in 
           court. WIDEN TO REVEAL --

           INT. ROSE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Rose takes out HER MOTHER’S CROSS NECKLACE and her ROSARY 
           RING to wear. Wears them like armored talismans. Half 
           dressed, she stares at her dress neatly laid out on the bed. 
           Bracing for the day. 

           INT. ROSE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Rose sifts through the MOUNDS OF MAIL. She opens and 
           catalogues each one. She checks her watch.

           Heads into -- 

           LYNN’S OFFICE, holding a DOCUMENT.  

                                 ROSE
                        I’ll run this to Mr. Garment’s 
                        office and be off.

           Lynn nods. Understands the code words.

                                 LYNN
                        What shall I say to the President?
                                 ROSE
                        Say I’m off at lunch. If it runs 
                        long. Or, that I have a doctor’s 
                        appointment I couldn’t reschedule. 
                            (quietly)
                        Just don’t tell him. 

                                 LYNN
                        I’m sure that he must --

                                 ROSE
                            (snipes)
                        I don’t care what he knows. Or what 
                        you think he knows. 
                            (apologetically)
                        I’m sorry. Please, just don’t tell 
                        him. 

                                 LYNN
                        Good luck. I’m behind you, no 
                        matter what. 

           Rose nods. Keeping a brave face. 

           INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

           A PACKED COURTROOM. Rose is in the WITNESS BOX, fidgety and 
           nervous. 

           Jerry’s at the defense table. Buzhardt beside him. At the 
           Prosecution table, Ben-Veniste and Feldbaum are hunched over 
           their legal pads. 

           Jill Volner is mid-cross.  

                                 VOLNER
                        You’re here today to tell us the  
                        reason for the erasure that was 
                        found on the June 20th tape. 

                                 ROSE
                        I thought it was a gap. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Ms. Woods, I would like to remind 
                        you of your constitutional rights. 
                        You have a right not to answer 
                        questions on the grounds that it 
                        might incriminate you. 

                                 ROSE
                        Yes.
                                 VOLNER
                        Are you represented by counsel?

                                 ROSE
                        Yes, I am. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Who recommended you to get an 
                        attorney?

                                 JERRY
                        Objection. 

                                 JUDGE SIRICA
                        Is this relevant?

                                 VOLNER
                        It bears on her testimony as to 
                        whether she talked to any of the 
                        White House attorneys.

                                 JUDGE SIRICA
                        Anyone has the right to an 
                        attorney.

                                 JERRY
                        I have nothing to do with the White 
                        House. Believe me.  

           The Press TITTER.

                                 VOLNER
                        How did you determine what part of 
                        the tape was part of the subpoena?

                                 ROSE
                        General Haig informed Mr. Bull and 
                        myself. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Anyone else?

                                 ROSE
                        Well, I checked with the President, 
                        of course. 

                                 VOLNER
                        How long did the conversation that 
                        you listened to on the tape last?

                                 GARMENT
                        Sidebar. Your Honor?

                                                                CUT TO:
           JUDGE SIRICA’S BENCH, all the lawyers huddle around. 

                                 GARMENT (CONT’D)
                        I’m not sure this discussion should 
                        be made public for the purposes of 
                        a Grand Jury. 

                                 JERRY
                        I want all this public, Your Honor. 

                                 BUZHARDT
                        We know what you want.

                                 JUDGE SIRICA
                        Is there an objection to making 
                        everything public?

                                 VOLNER
                        Not from us, Your Honor. 

                                 BUZHARDT
                        The White House objects. 

                                 JERRY
                        Not from me or my client. I want 
                        everything to come out.

                                 JUDGE SIRICA
                        Just so we’re clear... We have to 
                        balance the prosecution’s interest, 
                        the White House’s interest, and Ms. 
                        Wood’s interest. Have I got that 
                        right? Any more lawyers in here, 
                        we’ll have to build a bigger boat. 

                                 BUZHARDT
                        Your Honor, the White House is 
                        within its rights to be a part of 
                        this hearing since the very nature 
                        of what is being discussed --

                                 JUDGE SIRICA
                        Tread lightly, Ms. Volner. 

           Everyone returns to their tables. Volner addresses Rose.

                                 VOLNER
                        During the time that you listened 
                        to Mr. Ehrlichman and the 
                        President, who else participated?
                                 ROSE
                        I don’t know the exact moment Mr. 
                        Ehrlichman left and Mr. Haldeman 
                        arrived. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Was there ever a time when Mr. 
                        Ehrlichman, Mr. Haldeman, and the 
                        President spoke together?

                                 ROSE
                        I didn’t hear it. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Any discussion of Watergate?

           She looks over to Buzhardt.

                                 ROSE
                        No. Not that I heard. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Then how did this erasure magically 
                        happen?

                                 JERRY
                        Objection. 

                                 JUDGE SIRICA
                        Sustained. Ms. Woods, explain to 
                        the court how you came upon the 
                        gap. 

                                 ROSE
                        I was turning and reaching for my 
                        phone, which buzzes and buzzes and 
                        buzzes, I might have held my pedal 
                        down on the Uher. It was something 
                        like 4 1/2 to 5 minutes. 

                                 VOLNER
                        You told the President this?

                                 ROSE
                        Yes. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Who were you on the phone with?

           Rose debates. Shakes her head. 

                                 ROSE
                        I haven’t the slightest idea.
                                 VOLNER
                        How long were you on the phone?

                                 ROSE
                        4 1/2 to 5 minutes.

                                 VOLNER
                        Could the telephone call have 
                        lasted 18 1/2 minutes?

           She looks over to the White House lawyer table. Straight at 
           Buzhardt and Garment. 

                                 ROSE
                            (firmly)
                        No. 

           Judge Sirica leans down to Rose. 

                                 JUDGE SIRICA
                        Did you not think it was important 
                        to tell us everything you knew 
                        about what happened when you 
                        transcribed the tapes? Didn’t you 
                        think it was important? 

           Rose barely nods, ashamed. 

                                 ROSE
                        I understood that I was to talk 
                        about the subpoenaed tapes. 

                                 JUDGE SIRICA
                        And when asked about precautions, 
                        you used your head? Isn’t that what 
                        you said? 

                                 JERRY
                        Objection. I think it’s important 
                        that we allow Ms. Woods to explain. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Has the President ever told you 
                        about your erasure?

                                 JERRY
                        Objection. Ms. Woods never said 
                        that she caused the elimination

                        Why did you assume that your foot 
                        was on the pedal?
           Rose thinks. Good question. 

                                 ROSE
                        I just assumed. I wasn’t sure. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Is it possible you put your foot on 
                        the pedal after you finished the 
                        phone call? 

                                 ROSE
                        I reached back to answer my phone --

           Rose makes a motion to reach. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Your Honor, at this time, I would 
                        like to make an inspection of Miss 
                        Woods’ office.

           CLOSE ON: ROSE WOODS DOING THE ICONIC STRETCH

           Reaching for the phone while keeping her foot on the UHER 
           FOOT MEDAL MACHINE. PULL BACK TO REVEAL --

           INT. ROSE’S OFFICE - DAY

           The WHITE HOUSE PHOTOGRAPHER taking pictures of Rose posing. 
           We see her trying to replicate the stretch. But it’s awkward 
           and we can see she is struggling to get the exact angle of 
           having her foot on the pedal and answering the phone at the 
           same time. 

           Rose looks down and sees THE RUG INDENTATIONS of the carpet. 
           Her typewriter table has been moved to be closer. She can’t 
           help but be surprised. Ms. Volner follows Rose’s gaze and 
           notices the rug. Snaps to the White House Photographer.  

                                 VOLNER
                        I want pictures of the rug. 

           Rose stares at THE RUG INDENTATION as she holds the 
           humiliating pose, keeping her politically tight smile. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. ROSE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Rose sits in the same outfit she wore for court. It’s dark, 
           the shades aren’t closed. How long has she been sitting 
           there, we don’t know. As she stares off into some point in 
           space, the PHONE CONSTANTLY RINGS AND RINGS... She doesn’t 
           move. 

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Volner shows Rose the PHOTOGRAPH of her doing “the stretch”. 

                                 VOLNER
                        You’re in quite a balancing act 
                        here, would you agree? To get to 
                        the phone and press the pedal?

           Rose examines the photo.

                                 ROSE
                        Yes, that’s the photo you asked me 
                        to pose for.

                                 VOLNER
                        I didn’t ask you to pose, please 
                        correct that statement.

                                 ROSE
                        What did you have me do?

                                 VOLNER
                        I’m asking if you always stretch 
                        when answering the phone. 

                                 ROSE
                        I don’t know if I always do. I 
                        don’t pose for a picture usually. 

                                 VOLNER
                        That’s quite a stretch. 

                                 JUDGE SIRICA
                        All right, ladies. We have enough 
                        problems without two ladies turning 
                        this into an argument.

           The entire courtroom erupts in LAUGHTER. Except for Rose. 
           Except for Ms. Volner. They exchange a quick sympathetic 
           look. Welcome to the 1970s. 

                                 VOLNER
                        I would ask for you to please look 
                        at the photo closely. 
           CLOSE ON PHOTO. Rose examines it.

                                 VOLNER (CONT’D)
                        Do you see the rug indentations by 
                        your desk that showed someone moved 
                        the typewriter table closer?

                                 JERRY
                        Objection.

           Volner continues, emboldened. Not waiting for a ruling.

                                 VOLNER
                        Did you move your desk closer to 
                        make the stretch easier? 

                                 ROSE
                        No! Of course not. 

                                 VOLNER
                        But you see indentations. Someone 
                        moved you table, correct?

                                 JERRY
                        Objection. What indentations? What 
                        are we talking about? 

                                 VOLNER
                        She knows exactly what I’m talking 
                        about. 

                                 JUDGE SIRICA
                        Sustained. Move alone, Ms. Volner. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Okay, let’s look at the picture 
                        itself. Do you see that your foot 
                        isn’t even on the pedal? 

           Beat. Rose takes a breath. 

                                 ROSE
                        No. It’s not. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Did you erase the 18 1/2 minutes of 
                        conversation between the President 
                        and Chief of Staff Halderman the 
                        day after the Watergate break-in? 

                                 ROSE
                        No. 
                                 VOLNER
                        Then who did? 

                                 JERRY
                        Objection.

                                 JUDGE SIRICA
                        Sustained. 

           Rose looks back at her and then the photo, swallowing hard.

                                 VOLNER
                        Someone moved your table so that it 
                        would look like you could easily 
                        make that reach. Who are you 
                        covering up for? Why are you hiding 
                        the truth? 

                                 JERRY
                        Objection! Objection!

           The ROOM erupts in murmurs and opinions. 

                                 VOLNER
                        Withdrawn.

           The Judge bangs his gavel, but the damage is done. The words 
           hang there in judgment. 

           EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Jerry, Sarah, and Rose walk past the THRONGS of REPORTERS 
           trying to get Rose to make a statement. Pushing and shoving; 
           there’s blood in the water.  

           They walk past the press and round the corner -- 

                                 ROSE
                        I need to clear my head.

           Rose covers her red hair with a scarf and shrugs them off.

           As she goes around the bend -- we see that Volner is running 
           to catch up with her. Rose walks faster. Rose doesn’t 
           acknowledge her. Her eyes focused ahead. 

                                 VOLNER
                        These people are throwing you to 
                        the wolves... You know that, right? 
                        You need to tell the truth. 

           Rose stops. Turns.  
                                 ROSE
                        I’m sorry. Who are the wolves 
                        again? 

           Volner doesn’t respond. 

           Rose walks away toward the Washington Mall. Alone and 
           vulnerable against the magnificent Monument looming in the 
           horizon.

                                 HAIG
                        I've known women who think they've 
                        talked for five minutes and then 
                        have talked for an hour. I think 
                        Rose doesn’t really know how long 
                        she spoke. 

           PULL OUT TO REVEAL --

           INT. ROSE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Alone on her sofa, Rose watches his interview on her TV, 
           feeling the humiliation as millions of television viewers see 
           and judge. In Technicolor. 
           Rose lets the facade go. All of a sudden tears flood her eyes 
           in shame and anger.

                                 ROSE
                        Liar. 

           INT. POSIN’S DELI - DAY

           Jerry and Rose go over the case. A little of Jerry is growing 
           on her. She eats a pastrami sandwich with a fork. 

                                 JERRY
                        So, my spies tell me they can’t 
                        duplicate any of the erasures.

                                 ROSE
                        Any? Not even the four minutes?

                                 JERRY
                        Not a one. It’s the first time that 
                        twelve impaneled experts have 
                        agreed on anything. 

           This lands on Rose. 

                                 ROSE
                        So my Uher...

                                 JERRY
                        Could not have erased anything.

           Rose shakes her head.

                        You’re not as surprised as I 
                        thought you’d be.

                                 ROSE
                        A lot has happened since we first 
                        spoke. What’s the worst case 
                        scenario?

                        Say that all we have is my word.

                        You get indicted for obstruction. 
                        Possibly conspiracy. 

           The words hit Rose hard.

           Rose is waiting for her takeout. Garment spots her and comes

                            (dryly)
                        It’s an institution. 

           Garment hands his ticket to the CROTCHETY DELI GUY.

                            (to Deli Guy)
                        Easy on the mayo. 

           He turns to her.

                        I’m sorry.

                                 ROSE
                        For what?

                                 GARMENT
                        For how everything was handled.

                                 ROSE
                        How I was handled, you mean? 

                                 GARMENT
                        Rose, it’s more complicated --

                                 ROSE
                        It’s not complicated. I trusted you 
                        and you betrayed that trust. 

           Garment shakes his head. The Deli Guy gives her the take out 
           bag.

                        behind you. 

                                 ROSE
                        I know.

                                 PAT
                        And the girls love you so much.

                                 ROSE
                        They are remarkable women.

           Beat.

                                 PAT
                        I just want to say... We joke about 
                        you and handsome Bob, and Bob 
                        proposing...

                                 ROSE
                        Yes. He is, after all, Republican 
                        with a full head of hair.

           Pat nods, but her face is serious. 

                                 PAT
                        Rose, I know Bob. You’re never 
                        going to marry Bob. Neither of you 
                        have to pretend with me. 

           Rose looks at her surprised.

                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t think I knew. God, Bob 
                        is the best-kept open secret in 
                        Washington. Bless his heart. 

           Rose laughs. 

                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        We never talk about you and how 
                        much you have sacrificed... How it 
                        must feel for you to go home to 
                        your apartment... alone... 
                            (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        I can only imagine how hard it was 
                        when you first came to 
                        Washington... right after losing 
                        someone so close...

           Rose looks down, not expecting this intimacy. Her face falls. 
           Pat has poked at a carefully nursed wound. 

                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        We don’t have to talk about it. 

                                 ROSE
                        He’s been gone now longer than I 
                        knew him.
                            (quietly)
                        You know there isn’t even a word 
                        for when your fiance dies. You’re 
                        not a widow because you’ve never 
                        been a wife. 
                            (beat)
                        You’re just the person who makes 
                        all the phone calls and returns all 
                        the engagement gifts. 

           Rose chokes on the words. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        And then you have to pick yourself 
                        up and start again.

           She looks up at Pat, her eyes well up with tears. Pat puts 
           her hand on Rose’s. 

                                 PAT
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 ROSE
                        I still do miss him and wonder what 
                        our life would have been like...

           Rose’s eyes well up. She tries collect herself. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        But, that was a different time. Now 
                        I have the greatest job in the 
                        world. Working for the President.
                            (beat)
                        And to my mind there has been no 
                        better First Lady. You and your 
                        family. You’re enough. You have to 
                        be...

           Pat finishes off her drink. She squeezes Rose’s hand.  
           INT. SPECIAL PROSECUTION OFFICE - DAY

           Ben-Veniste, Volner, and Feldbaum and a ROOMFUL OF 
           PROSECUTORS are mid-debate. Jaworski sits at the head, 
           listening. 

                                 FELDBAUM
                        Prosecute her for what? For what? 
                        Blind devotion to the President?

                                 VOLNER
                        For lying. For obstruction. For 
                        conspiracy. 

                                 BEN-VENISTE
                        This is sounding personal.

           Volner gives a look. 

                                 VOLNER
                        She’s lying. She knows more than 
                        she’s saying.

           Turn to their boss, Jaworski, who has been silent.

                                 JAWORSKI
                        Write it up. If there’s enough to 
                        indict, we’ll indict the secretary 
                        to the President of the United 
                        States. 

           INT. ROSE’S OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE ON A MOUND OF MAIL

           Rose starts opening LETTERS. Calls out to Lynn.

                                 ROSE
                        There’s not that many for one week. 
                        Although we should see --

           Lynn comes in HOLDING A LARGE CARDBOARD BOX. Full of letters.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Spoke too soon. Hopefully most of 
                        these letters are supportive of the 
                        President. The hate mail, I swear 
                        to God, we’re burning. 

                                 LYNN
                        They’re not for the President.
                            (off Rose’s surprised look)
                        They’re for you. Boxes of them. 
                                 ROSE
                        For me? Why? 

                                 LYNN
                        Secretaries who believe in you. 
                            (beat)
                        I put my favorite ones at the top. 

           INT. ROSE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Rose gets ready for bed. The box full of letters that Lynn 
           gave her is by her side. We see she has opened many of the 
           well wishes. The PHONE RINGS. 

                                 ROSE
                        Woods residence... Where did you 
                        get this number? 

           A cloud comes over Rose as she listens. 

           She hangs up fast, as if it were hot to touch.

           After a few moments the phone RINGS again. She stares at it. 
           Then answers.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Hello? Who is this? 

           She hangs up again. She looks out her window, the street 
           below is deserted. The phone RINGS again. She puts the phone 
           in the closet. 

           We can still hear the MUFFLED RINGING. 

           INT. BOB’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Bob fixes Rose a drink. He’s in a tux and tails. 

                                 BOB
                        Are you sure you don’t want to 
                        come? 

                                 ROSE
                        The last thing I want to do is go 
                        out and have people talk about what 
                        a joke I am.

                                 BOB
                        You’re not a joke. 
                                 ROSE
                        I’ve been getting phone calls at 
                        night. Sometimes hang ups. 
                        Sometimes breathing. The other day, 
                        one said they were pollsters. 

                                 BOB
                        Pollsters? Really? 

                                 ROSE
                        Exactly, and it’s my private line. 
                        I think they were checking up to 
                        see if the number the phone company 
                        gave them was the proper number.

                                 BOB
                        They?

                                 ROSE
                        The Special Prosecution Committee. 
                        Who else? 

           Bob doesn’t answer. Rose steels herself. The question hangs 
           between them. 

           INT. ROSE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Rose sets out TWO SUITS, one RED and ONE GREY, out on her 
           bed.

           The phone RINGS.

                                 ROSE (INTO PHONE)
                        Mrs. Nixon. Ready for the big day? 

           INT. PAT NIXON’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Pat stands at her closet looking at her suits.

                                 PAT (INTO PHONE)
                        I was just thinking what would be 
                        the most powerful color to project 
                        for the day. For all those creeps.

           INTERCUT BETWEEN PAT AND ROSE

                                 ROSE
                        A powerful color...

                                 PAT
                        I’m thinking red. Red is nice.
           Rose looks at her red suit.

                                 ROSE
                        You’re wearing red?

           She starts to put the red suit back in her closet.

                                 PAT
                        Not me. I think WE should wear red. 
                        Rose. Let them come at us, Rose. 
                        Let them try. 

           USING ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE WE ARE CLOSE ON: GERALD FORD as he 
           gets sworn in. Nixon’s behind him -- 

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL --

           We’re in --

           INT. THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - DAY

           The swearing in ceremony for GERALD FORD as VICE PRESIDENT OF 
           THE UNITED STATES. Pat Nixon and Rose sit beside each other 
           both WEARING RED POWER SUITS.

           Rose notices Haig on the same row. She doesn’t look at him. 
           Pat turns to her and gives her an encouraging pat on her 
           hand. 

           EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY

           Rose and Jerry meet at a bench for lunch. Lots of TOURISTS 
           pass them, but Jerry is focused and animated.  

                                 JERRY
                        I found a way to exculpate you.

                                 ROSE
                        How?

                                 JERRY
                        The President.

                                 ROSE
                        No.

                                 JERRY
                        Hear me out. There’s an argument to 
                        be made that the 18 1/2 minute gap 
                        has to be the presidential 
                        responsibility because he said they 
                        were his tapes. 
                                 ROSE
                        No.

                                 JERRY
                        No? No, what? No, I want to be a 
                        martyr? No, I want to go to jail?

                                 ROSE
                        No. I will not implicate the 
                        President.

           Silence.

                                 JERRY
                        Rose, you hired me so that I could 
                        represent you to the best of my 
                        abilities.

                                 ROSE
                        I won’t betray the Nixon family.  

           He gets up. Annoyed. 

                                 JERRY
                        You’re not doing yourself any 
                        favors protecting people who don’t 
                        need your protection. More 
                        importantly, you’re not letting me 
                        do my job. 

                                 ROSE
                        We’ll just have to find another 
                        way.

                                 JERRY
                        That worst case scenario that we 
                        talked about?  It’s here. You need 
                        to look out for yourself.  

                                 ROSE
                        I know. 

                                 JERRY
                        Do you?

           He waves NEWSPAPERS at her.

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        The country is at war and the

                        have orchestrated the biggest cover-

                        platter. And your boss... is going 
                        to need a scapegoat.  

                                 ROSE
                        There has to be another way. 

                                 JERRY
                        When you come to your senses and 
                        let me defend you, let me know.

           He gets up, is about to say something else, and then exits. 
           Leaving Rose alone. 

           INT. ROSE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Rose sits at her dining room table. Her tape recorder in 
           front of her. She presses play. The beginning of the June 
           20th tape. She listens. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           ROSE CLEANING HER KITCHEN

           The tape’s still playing. Rose mops the floor. The 18 1/2 
           minutes of clicks begin. Rose pushes the mop harder...

                                                                CUT TO:

           ROSE

           on her hands and knees scrubbing the floor. The clicking 
           continues... then Nixon’s voice comes back...

                                 NIXON (O.S.)
                        Back to the wiretapping. I think 
                        it’s very serious.

                                 HALDEMAN (O.S.)
                        Right.

                                 NIXON (O.S.)
                        No question there is a double 
                        standard. Prior authorizations have 
                        done it. That’s a standard thing. 
                        Why the Christ do we have to hire 
                        people to sweep our rooms?

           This gets Rose’s attention. What did he just say? She goes 
           over to the tape recorder. Rewinds. Plays.
                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        Back to the wiretapping...

           Rose listens. Really listens. Her mind spins. For the first 
           time getting a clearer picture. 

           EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - EVENING

           Rose power walks alongside Bob. Some ONLOOKERS recognize her 
           and whisper but Rose’s oblivious. She’s revved up, energized. 
           We haven’t seen Rose this focused for a long time.

                                 ROSE
                        As far as I can tell, there are 
                        three theories on what happened to 
                        the missing 18 minutes. 

                                 BOB
                        Shoot.

                                 ROSE
                        One is that the dumb secretary 
                        erased them because she’s in love 
                        or blindly devoted to her boss. 

                                 BOB
                        I have it on good authority that 
                        the dumb secretary didn’t do it.

                                 ROSE
                        Second, is that some of the people 
                        in the White House erased the 
                        portion of the tape while it was in 
                        my safe. 

                                 BOB
                        How did they get into the safe?

                                 ROSE
                        That’s the question. And if they 
                        could, why didn’t they just take 
                        the tapes? 

           She stops. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        I listened to the tape. All of it. 
                        And at the end, they are talking 
                        about a phone wiretap.
                            (beat)
                        What if the erasure happened 
                        earlier? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Right when the taping system was 
                        dismantled? Before I even got them.

                                 BOB
                        Why?  

                                 ROSE
                        Because the tape talks about an 
                        illegal wiretap. An illegal phone 
                        tap that was approved of by HRH, 
                        Ehrlichman, all of them. Including 
                        Haig. All the damn lawyers. 

           Bob nods, thinking. 

                                 BOB
                        What wiretap would they want to 
                        erase that would have been worse 
                        than Watergate? 

                                 ROSE
                        That’s what I have to find out. 

                                 BOB
                        And then what? 

                                 ROSE
                        What do you mean?

                                 BOB
                        I mean, after you find out. What 
                        will you do?

                                 ROSE
                        I tell the President. I tell my 
                        lawyer, he tells Judge Sirica. I 
                        don’t get indicted. 

           Beat.

                                 BOB
                        What if the President already 
                        knows.

                                 ROSE
                        What?

                                 BOB
                        An illegal wiretap made by the 
                        White House... The President would 
                        have known.
           Her face falls. She nods ever so slightly. She knew this but 
           to hear it said out loud...

           INT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM - NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY - DAY

           Bob stands before an ENGRAVED PORTRAIT. Handsome as ever. A 
           40-SOMETHING SUITED MAN in a conservative suit comes up 
           beside him. Stares at the portrait with equal intensity. 
           Neither looks at the other. We see the suited man’s WEDDING 
           RING. We get a better look a the suited man and realize that 
           he is JOHN, the same handsome man that we saw earlier exiting 
           Bob’s bedroom. 

                                 BOB
                        You’re looking well. How’s Lisa?

           No answer.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        I think Lisa would like me.
                            (beat)
                        We have so much in common. We both 
                        like The Carpenters and emotionally 
                        unavailable men. 

                                 JOHN
                        What do you want?

                                 BOB
                        What does anyone want? World peace, 
                        an end to the oil crisis, to see 
                        Paul Newman naked...

           Silence.

                                 JOHN
                        I told you never to call me at my 
                        home. 

                                 BOB
                        I’m a lobbyist, you know I don’t  
                        listen.
                            (serious)
                        I need a favor. I need some 
                        information about some FBI 
                        wiretaps.

                                 JOHN
                        No.

                                 BOB
                        No? Pretty definitive for someone 
                        with a pretty wife and family. 
                                 JOHN
                        You think I’m worried about my 
                        family finding out? 
                            (quietly)
                        These people I work for are 
                        dangerous. 

                                 BOB
                        The FBI will never find out.

                                 JOHN
                        You say that but they always do. 

                                 BOB
                        They won’t. 

           John fiddles with his wedding ring, nervously. He looks up to 
           Bob, they make eye contact for the first time. 

           INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE - WHITE HOUSE LAW LIBRARY - EVENING  

           Rose looks through the shelves of books, yellow pad in hand. 
           The place is cleared out for the most part. A LIBRARIAN 
           approaches her.

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        Ms. Woods, anything I can help you 
                        with?

                                 ROSE
                        I’m looking for surveillance cases. 

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        Federal or state?

                                 ROSE
                        Federal. Where the government had 
                        surveillance on private citizens.  

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        I’ll start digging. Might be a long 
                        list.  

           Rose stands at the counter waiting. She glances over to the 
           back LIBRARY CARRELS and sees Mr. Buzhardt leaning over a 
           table of TWO YOUNG ATTRACTIVE WOMEN. She quickly turns 
           around. Shit. Did he see her?

           She stands still for a moment. Not sure what to do. 

           From the distance, she sees the librarian heading toward her 
           with a LAW BOOK. Out of the corner of her eye, she sees that 
           Buzhardt has seen her. 
           Rose points to her watch, as the librarian comes closer.

                                 ROSE
                        I’ll come back. I’m in a rush.

           She rushes out. 

           INT. GEORGETOWN LAW SCHOOL - DAY  

           CLOSE ON: LAW BOOK - UNITED STATES v. KEITH

           PULL BACK to reveal:

           Sarah and Rose sitting in one of the long library tables.

                                 SARAH
                        So what’s this about?

                                 ROSE
                        Nothing. Just doing some extra 
                        research and I don’t want to use 
                        the White House library.  

           Rose doesn’t say more. Sarah doesn’t press. 

                                 SARAH
                        Here are the Fourth Amendment 
                        wiretapping cases you asked about. 

           She hands Rose the advance sheets and Rose starts to read. 
           Sarah points to a particular section. 

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        United States v. Keith. The Supreme 
                        Court said that the government 
                        illegally wiretapped a private 
                        citizen’s home.

                                 ROSE
                            (reads)
                        “The revelations posed the 
                        frightening possibility that the 
                        conversations of untold thousands 
                        of citizens of this country are 
                        being monitored on secret devices 
                        which no judge has authorized...”

                                 SARAH
                        Makes you wonder what they would do 
                        when someone disagreed with them, 
                        or refused to tow the party line. 
                                 ROSE
                        We know the answer to that, don’t 
                        we. 

           Sarah can’t help but be surprised at this critique. Rose 
           doesn’t look up.  

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t tell your father?

                                 SARAH
                        No. Although he’s working hard for 
                        you. He is at the office right now 
                        writing a brief to the judge.

                                 ROSE
                        I know he is. I don’t want anyone 
                        to know.

                                 SARAH
                        Know what? You still haven’t told 
                        me.

           We see on Rose’s face she has found what she’s looking for. 
           She takes THE PAPERS and folds them up and places them into 
           her purse. 

           Rose looks around at the YOUNG LAW STUDENTS. We see a touch 
           of envy in her face.

                                 ROSE
                        When I grew up, girls were either 
                        teachers or secretaries. 

           She motions to the law books surrounding them. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Now the world seems much bigger. 
                        You’re lucky, you can be so much 
                        more. 

           Rose looks around at all the women law students buried in 
           their books, and gives Sarah a bittersweet smile. 

           INT. WATERGATE CAFE - NIGHT

           Rose nurses a cup of coffee. Highlighting the cases in front 
           of her like a regular law student. 

           A WAITER comes over to her table.

                                 WAITER
                        Ms. Woods? 
                                 ROSE
                        Yes.

                                 WAITER
                        There’s a telephone call for you. 

           Strange. Rose gets up, leaves her paperwork at her table. 
           Goes to the --

           BAR

           Rose picks up the TELEPHONE RECEIVER. 

                                 ROSE
                        Hello?

           Nothing.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           She looks around. All of a sudden nervous. Who would know 
           that she’s here? 

           She sets the phone down. The BARTENDER takes the phone and 
           sets it under the bar. Rose goes back to her table.

           At the corner of her eye, at the CAFE DOOR, she sees -- 

           Bob’s friend, John -- Rose can’t hope but show her surprise. 
           He comes toward her.

                                 JOHN 
                        We need to talk.

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER

           Rose sits across from John, who chain-smokes. 

                                 JOHN
                        My Grandma used to listen to other 
                        people’s conversations with a 
                        glass. Held it up to the wall. Thin 
                        walls. 

                                 ROSE
                        I’m not sure what Bob has told 
                        you... 

           He stamps out his cigarette.
                                 JOHN
                        You want to know about the 
                        wiretaps. 

                                 ROSE
                        Yes. 

           John takes a moment. 

                                 JOHN
                        Even as far back as 1969, your boss 
                        was increasingly suspicious of 
                        leaks to the press. SALT talks, 
                        Vietnam, Sino-American relations. 

                                 ROSE
                        I know all that. I’m talking about 
                        something that the President’s men 
                        might worry would be worse than...

                                 JOHN
                        Breaking into the Democratic 
                        National Committee? 

           Beat.

                                 ROSE
                        Yes. 

                                 JOHN
                        Well illegal wiretaps on private 
                        citizens are an impeachable 
                        offense. Any lawyer would know 
                        that. 
                            (beat)
                        Your boss likes to tap people’s 
                        phones. Whether he has permission 
                        or not. 

                                 ROSE
                        And if there were an illegal 
                        tapping of phones. Who would be 
                        involved?

                                 JOHN
                        The President and his men.

                                 ROSE
                        Mr. Haldeman? 

                                 JOHN 
                        Yes.
                                 ROSE
                        Mr. Kissinger?

                                 JOHN
                        Yes.

           Beat.

                                 ROSE
                        General Haig? 

                                 JOHN
                        Yes. All of them. Anyone connected. 
                            (pointedly)
                        To your boss. Everyone. You 
                        understand?  

           Rose understands. He pulls out a MANILA ENVELOPE and gives it 
           to her. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Tell Bob we’re even.

           He gets up and leaves. Once he is out of sight she carefully 
           opens the envelope. 

           She pulls out the STACK OF PAPERS.

           CLOSE ON PAPERS: DOCUMENTATION OF WIRETAP REQUESTS FROM THE 
           WHITE HOUSE.

           Rose can hardly believe it. 

           EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

           Rose heads back to her apartment. With the MANILA ENVELOPE 
           tucked in her bag, she’s nervous.

           A sudden rush of traffic, but the sidewalk is empty. As the 
           traffic lulls, Rose can hear her own footsteps.

           And the footsteps of someone behind her.

           She looks back to see a YOUNG MAN IN SUIT, Washington lawyer 
           type. He moves closer and closer. He comes in step twenty 
           feet behind her.

           And stays there. Their steps echo like heartbeats in sync.

           She stops to pretend to admire some window shopping. He 
           passes her. Probably was nothing, but her heart is racing.
           INT. ROSE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Rose holds the MANILA ENVELOPE, thinking. Not sure what to 
           do. She looks over at HER PHONE. We see the thought occur to 
           her. Her phone is probably bugged.

           She quickly takes the phone apart, piece by piece. Looking 
           for a evidence of a bug. Anything. Soon there it is nothing 
           more than screws, coils, and wires.  She stares at the pieces 
           as if they are a some sort of puzzle with no solution. And 
           then --

           There’s a KNOCK at the door -- it’s Pat. 

                                 PAT
                        Sorry for the surprise visit. But I 
                        didn’t want the visit on my 
                        official schedule. There’s a throng 
                        of reporters downstairs that I 
                        slipped by. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           ROSE’S LIVING ROOM

           Pat surveys the elephant figurines. Rose puts the ENVELOPE 
           casually on a pile of magazines as she makes a drink for 
           herself and Pat. 

                                 PAT
                        Julie said something funny to me 
                        today. She told me there was no 
                        point in telling me she isn’t 
                        feeling well because I would have 
                        no sympathy... She’s right. You 
                        know me, even if I were dying, I 
                        wouldn’t let anyone know...

           She laughs at her joke and then picks up a JADE ELEPHANT. 
           Even though her hair is perfect, and she’s perfectly 
           poised... we can see she’s drunk just enough to smooth out 
           the edges. 

                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        Is this one from China?

                                 ROSE
                        Yes. 

                                 PAT
                        Henry still gets all the credit.

                                 PAT (CONT'D)
                        Did you hear about the Vassar 
                        intern? 

                                 ROSE
                        Not surprising. 

                                 PAT
                        No. Not surprising at all. The 
                        smartest Washington minds are being 
                        ruled by the smallest heads. 

           They LAUGH. Easing some tension in the room. 

           Silence. Rose waits for Pat to speak. Her eyes dart to the 
           MANILA ENVELOPE. Not sure if Pat sees. 

                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        Any word on what the prosecution 
                        has decided?

                                 ROSE
                        No.

           Pat sees the completely dismantled phone. She looks back to 
           Rose. 

                                 PAT
                        Politics. I never wanted Dick to 
                        run for President; did you know 
                        that?
                            (lost in thought)
                        When you first arrive at the White 
                        House, the previous first lady 
                        gives you the lay of the land. And 
                        you look around thinking about how 
                        to make the place yours. How to 
                        decorate. Small things like, should 
                        I purchase the King Charles China 
                        pattern?...

           Beat.

                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        They don’t tell you how to prepare 
                        for this kind of crisis.
                            (beat)
                        Jackie and her pill box hats would 
                        never be able to withstand five 
                        minutes of Woodward and Bernstein. 

                                 ROSE
                        Never.
                                 PAT
                        Where’s my Aristotle Onassis to 
                        whisk me away to one of his yachts 
                        and outta this fishbowl?  

           She and Rose laugh. Pat looks out the window. 

                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        They’re talking impeachment. 

                                 ROSE
                        Never going to happen. The 
                        Democrats can talk all they want. 

                                 PAT
                        It’s not just the Democrats. 
                            (beat)
                        Do you think they can force Dick to 
                        resign? 

                                 ROSE
                        No. Of course not. He’s weathered 
                        worse... they tried the same thing 
                        in ‘52 with the expense fund 
                        accusations. It passed.  

                                 PAT
                        This is different. This feels very 
                        different. 

           Silence.

                                 PAT (CONT’D)
                        Dick will never recover. They won’t 
                        stop until they find something.   

                                 ROSE
                        There’s nothing to find. 

                                 PAT
                        Are you sure? 
                            (off no answer)
                        Is there nothing to find?

           Beat. Rose holds her gaze, and does everything but look over 
           at the MANILA ENVELOPE. 

                                 ROSE
                        There is nothing to find. 

           Pat nods, this seems to satisfy her. 

                                 PAT
                        I will do anything to protect him.
                                 ROSE
                        I know. 

           Rose keeps her face fixed in a tight smile. 

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE LAWN - NIGHT

           ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE OF Nixon lighting the White House Christmas 
           tree - A CAMP FIRE GIRL AND A BOY SCOUT at his side.  
           SUPPORTERS OF NIXON are there with BANNERS cheering him on. 
           PULL OUT TO REVEAL -- 

           Rose standing alongside Pat as they watch on.

           EXT. MARYLAND PARK - DAY

           Rose pushes her 5-YEAR-OLD NIECE on the swings. Rose laughs, 
           as the little girl squeals with delight.

                                 5-YEAR-OLD NIECE
                        Higher! Higher!

                                 ROSE
                        We can’t tell your mom. She’ll hate 
                        that we’re --

           Rose stops. 

                                 5-YEAR-OLD NIECE
                        Why are you stopping? Push more!

           Rose doesn’t move. Coming toward her is a striding Jill 
           Volner.

                                                                CUT TO:

           PARK BENCH

           Rose and Jill sit as Rose watches her niece play in the 
           sandbox.

                                 ROSE
                        You needn’t bother coming here. I 
                        have nothing to say.

                                 VOLNER
                        I am not going to stop until I find 
                        the person accountable, and if you 
                        happen to be in the way... 

           Rose watches her niece, betrays nothing.

                        You were as surprised as I was when 
                        you saw the indentations in the 
                        rug. 

           Beat.

                        I know what it’s like to be the 
                        only woman in a room of men.

           Rose smiles.

                                 ROSE
                        That doesn’t make us on the same 
                        side. 
                            (calls to Niece)

                        Have you read the papers? Your boss 
                        is going to be impeached, it’s just 
                        a matter of time. 

                                 ROSE
                        So says The Washington Post.

                        Miss Woods, you’re loyal. I get it.

                        are in conflict. 

           She pulls out a PEN and writes her number on her BUSINESS 
           CARD.

                        certain that the person you’re 
                        protecting is worth it? 

           Rose takes the card. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE SCREENING ROOM - NIGHT

           Rose sits in the screening room alongside Pat, Julie, and 
           Tricia. Rose is subdued. 

                                 JULIE
                        I cannot wait to see this, can you? 
                        Robert Redford. So dreamy. 
                                 TRICIA
                        Yes. But do you really believe he 
                        would ever love Barbara?

                                 ROSE
                            (blurts)
                        Why not. She’s her own woman and 
                        she doesn’t take any shit.
                            (half to herself)
                        No matter who gets in her way. 

           Julie and Tricia laugh. Rose smiles at her joke. She has 
           surprised herself. Pat looks at her curiously. Rose evades 
           her gaze. 

           The LIGHTS go down and the MOVIE CREDITS begin to roll...

           INT. WHITE HOUSE CAFETERIA - DAY

           Rose gets her tray. She sees the gaggle of secretaries 
           huddled together (the same women as before). They stop 
           talking when she passes them. 

                                 KIMBERLY ANNE
                        Rose. How are you?

                                 ROSE
                        Peachy.

           She walks on. The women turn back to their discussion. We 
           stay on Rose’s face. She’s done turning the other cheek. She 
           doubles back. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        I would understand being treated 
                        this way if you were men. I’m 
                        surrounded by men who fuck and lie, 
                        and they do it just because they 
                        can. 

                                 KIMBERLY ANNE
                        Rose -- sure this isn’t the right 
                        forum for this kind of talk.

                                 ROSE
                        No, this is the perfect forum. 
                        Here. In the White House. Where I 
                        have served the President. 
                            (beat)
                        I thought you women were my 
                        friends. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        When you got engaged I threw the 
                        parties, I sent the flowers to the 
                        hospital when you gave birth, I was 
                        the shoulder you cried on when some 
                        man here crossed a line...

           She looks at each one of the women. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                            (lowers her voice)
                        I have kept your secrets. Married 
                        men you’ve slept with, lies you 
                        have told... and I have never 
                        judged. 
                            (gets emotional)
                        I was silly to think... assume that 
                        I would get your support.
                            (beat)
                        Well, guess what? I can fight my 
                        battles myself. 

           She leaves, the other secretaries are speechless. 

           INT. ROSE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Rose opens the MANILA ENVELOPE. 

           Takes a PIECE OF WHITE PAPER, consulting with the WIRETAP 
           LIST, and starts making a list. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: WHITE PIECE OF PAPER 

           Rose, finished with her list, folds it carefully.. 

           Paper in hand, she makes her way down the corridor of the --

           WEST WING to --

           GENERAL HAIG’S OFFICE

           Rose stands outside the door. Armed with her tiny folded 
           piece of paper and as much bravery she can muster. She 
           KNOCKS. 

           General Haig’s at his desk, immersed in a pile of paperwork. 
           He looks surprised to see Rose. 
                                 HAIG
                        Rose. I didn’t know anyone else was 
                        here tonight. I thought there was a 
                        tree lighting.

                                 ROSE
                        There was. 

           She swallows, deep breath. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Jill Volner visited me. 

                                 HAIG
                        Jill?

                                 ROSE
                        The Special Prosecutor. 

                                 HAIG
                        Jill Volner, right. And what plumbs 
                        of wisdom did the miniskirt impart? 
                        Fashion tips? 

                                 ROSE
                        Ms. Volner thinks that I might know 
                        something about what happened to 
                        the June 20th tape. She’s convinced 
                        I’m covering up for someone. 

                                 HAIG
                        Ah. Well, hope you settled things.

                                 ROSE
                        I told her nothing.

                                 HAIG
                        Good.

                                 ROSE
                        But what I haven’t decided is 
                        whether I tell her that I know. 

                                 HAIG
                        You know what?

           She holds THE FOLDED PAPER tightly in her hand.

                                 ROSE
                        I know.

           Haig looks up from his work. 
                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        On June 20, 1972 Haldeman and 
                        Ehrlichman were talking about 
                        illegal phone taps on private 
                        citizens that you sanctioned. 
                        That’s what was erased. It had 
                        nothing to do with Watergate. 

           He looks at her curiously, leans back in his chair. He 
           doesn’t like this, but he’ll play. 

                                 HAIG
                        You’re going to have to help me out 
                        here, Rose. What are you talking 
                        about?

                                 ROSE
                        And I have a list of them. The ones 
                        that were ordered. Every illegal 
                        wiretap that was requested by the 
                        White House. 

                                 HAIG
                        Rose. 

                                 ROSE
                        There have been lots of theories 
                        about those 18 1/2 minutes.

                                 HAIG
                        Rose. I don’t think this --

                                 ROSE
                        I blamed myself. How could I have 
                        erased those 4 1/2 minutes. What 
                        good luck for you, that the dumb 
                        secretary was taking blame. 

           He looks at her. Then stands. He’s tall. Towering over her. 
           She won’t back down. 

           He sees the FOLDED PAPER in her hands.

                                 HAIG
                        Rose. You need to calm down. I 
                        don’t know what you’ve --

                                 ROSE
                        I know you think that people won’t 
                        believe me. Heck, I don’t know 4 
                        minutes from 18, isn’t that what 
                        you said? 
                                 HAIG
                        Rose --

                                 ROSE
                        Someone will want to know the names 
                        and dates I have on this paper. 

                                 HAIG
                        You do this, you harm the 
                        President. You harm the family. 

                                 ROSE
                        That’s why I’m coming to you first. 
                        Because I know you will understand. 
                        But if there are charges lodged 
                        against me... I promise I will not 
                        remain silent.

           For the first time Alexander Haig looks uneasy. Could this 
           woman really hold all this power in her hands? 

           Rose holds the FOLDED PAPER tightly. Doesn’t flinch. Maybe 
           for the first time Haig sees Rose as more than a secretary 
           willing to take the blame. 

           And then he smiles.

                                 HAIG
                        We all do what we think is best. So 
                        you’re not going to do anything. 

                                 ROSE
                        No?

                                 HAIG
                        You come after me. You think that’s 
                        as far as it will go? You come 
                        forward and what do you think 
                        happens to the Nixon family?

                                 ROSE
                        This isn’t about the Nixons. This 
                        is about you.

                                 HAIG
                        No, this is about the White House. 
                        Which has become a house of cards.  
                        Anything about the President’s men 
                        will eventually lead to the 
                        President. 
                            (beat)
                        Your betrayal would hang our 
                        President. Your boss. Could you 
                        live with that? 
           Rose looks down. He knows he has her. 

                                 HAIG (CONT’D)
                        You better get going, Rose. These 
                        are not the games a woman like you 
                        can play. 
                            (beat)
                        Now, if you will excuse me, I have 
                        work to do. Aren’t the Nixons 
                        expecting you at the residence for 
                        dinner and a movie? 

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Rose, still burning from Haig’s words, passes a GROUP OF 
           PROTESTORS holding “IMPEACH NIXON SIGNS” and chanting. 

           They try and pass her pamphlets as she trudges by. Rose’s 
           eyes are focused somewhere far out in space. 

           INT. ROSE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Rose, still in her trench coat, sits at the kitchen table. 
           Maybe she has been sitting there all night. In her hands is 
           the JADE ELEPHANT. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Rose finds Pat smoking and flipping through the National 
           Enquirer, visibly tired. Pat looks up at Rose and smiles. 

                                 ROSE
                        Where’s the Boss?

                                 PAT
                        In the library. Muttering. 

                                 ROSE
                        I need to speak with him. 

           Pat watches her curiously. Rose’s nervousness shows. She 
           doesn’t move. Pat takes a long drag. 

                                 PAT
                        Remember the sixty-two campaign? 
                        All those envelopes...

                                 ROSE
                        By the end, my tongue was numb. 
                                 PAT
                        I don’t think I could have gotten 
                        through it without you beside me... 

           Rose takes a breath. 

                                 ROSE
                        I had a talk with General Haig.

                                 PAT
                        I heard. 

           Silence. Pat waits for her to speak. 

                                 ROSE
                        He doesn’t think I’ll have the 
                        courage to do it. 

           Beat. 

                                 PAT
                        Do you?  

                                 ROSE
                        I don’t want to hurt anyone... 

                                 PAT
                        Well, do what you think is best. 
                        But, know that we would never let 
                        anything happen to you. 
                            (beat)
                        You’re the fifth Nixon, you’re one 
                        of us.

                                 ROSE
                        I’m the secretary accused of doing 
                        something I did not do. 
                            (determined)
                        And I won’t say that I did.  

                                 PAT
                        Of course not...

                                 ROSE
                        No matter who it may hurt.  

                                 PAT
                        Rose, what’s happened? 

                                 ROSE
                        No matter who asks me to lie. 

           Pat’s face, unreadable, fixes into a tight smile.
                                 PAT
                        Best you go speak to the President 
                        then... it’s getting late. 

           Rose stands there for a moment longer, wanting to say more. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - PRIVATE STUDY

           We stay on Rose’s face as she KNOCKS. Her hand holds the 
           doorknob for a long moment. She closes her eyes and braces 
           herself. 

           We see the FOLDED PAPER in her hands as she enters the 
           President’s study.

                                 ROSE
                        I need a moment, Mr. President. 
                            (deep breath)
                        Because I need to tell you what I 
                        know about what was erased and what 
                        I intend to do...

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

           Rose, determined, dials and then speaks.

                                 ROSE (INTO PHONE
                        Jerry, you said I had to start 
                        protecting myself... Well, I’ve 
                        done something... No, not on the 
                        phone... Tomorrow. Great. Yes...

           She hangs up the phone. Doesn’t let the receiver go. 

           EXT. WASHINGTON OFFICE BUILDING - MORNING

           Jerry leaves his office building and hurriedly makes his way 
           down the street. We realize that we are not the only ones 
           watching him. PULL OUT TO REVEAL --

           HAIG sitting in a parked car. As Jerry moves down the street, 
           Haig starts his car.  We stay with Haig as he trails him. 
           Jerry seems unaware that he is being followed. 

           Jerry stops at the light ready to cross the street to enter 
           the Mall. He looks around. We hope he realizes someone is 
           tailing him. We wait with baited breath for the light to 
           change. When the pedestrian light goes green, he crosses. 
           Haig stays with him, now on foot. We wonder what he will do.   
           EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - MORNING

           Rose watches the sunrise. She’s been up all night. Coffee and 
           cigarette in hand, she looks on at the majesty of the 
           building. It still has meaning for her. She pulls out the 
           WHITE FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER from her pocket, to make sure 
           it’s still there. 

           CLOSE ON: THE WHITE FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER

           Rose looks at it, knowing what this will mean. She looks up 
           to see -- General Haig heading straight toward her, out of 
           breath. Rose can’t help but show her surprise. 

                                 HAIG
                        You shouldn’t have called your 
                        lawyer.  

                                 ROSE
                        What do you want? 

                                 HAIG
                        To tell you, you’re not getting 
                        indicted. Any and all allegations 
                        against Rose Mary Woods are 
                        officially being dropped.  

           Beat. 

           Rose digests the information. 

                                 ROSE
                        Why are you telling me this? 

                                 HAIG
                        To let you know the good news. And 
                        that the President hopes that 
                        you’re pleased with this outcome.

           She looks at him. 

                                 ROSE
                        So you’re speaking for the 
                        President? 

                                 HAIG
                        Always. I’m always speaking for the 
                        President. Don’t you know that by 
                        now?  

           He eyes the PIECE OF PAPER. She follows his gaze. 

                                 HAIG (CONT’D)
                        They care for you.
                                 ROSE
                        I know. 

           Silence.

                                 HAIG
                        Am I right about you still not 
                        wanting to hurt them?

           We see him look at the note in her hand. She follows his 
           gaze. She holds the power in her hands. She has the one thing 
           that can make General Haig nervous.

                                 ROSE
                        You mean about me not revealing the 
                        truth to the world about the 18 1/2 
                        minutes? The 18 1/2 minutes you 
                        wanted everyone to believe I 
                        erased? And tried to frame me for? 

           This time Haig is silent.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        I was thinking about what you said, 
                        how I would never hurt the Nixons. 
                        That’s true...

                                 HAIG
                        That’s what I thought. 

                                 ROSE
                        Loyalty means something to me, even 
                        if it doesn’t to anyone else.

                                 HAIG
                        I’m happy to hear that.

                                 ROSE
                        I have spent over 30 years with a 
                        family. A family that loves me. And 
                        I need to believe that they would 
                        never intentionally harm me. 

                                 HAIG
                        Good.

                                 ROSE
                        Still... You know, I hear that even 
                        the Judge is trying to sell his 
                        story of Watergate.
                            (beat)
                        Can you believe it? Everyone 
                        selling their story for a price?
                            (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        Do you know how many reporters call 
                        me each day?  After all, I was the 
                        first secretary to make the cover 
                        of Time Magazine. People will want 
                        to hear my story of the 18 1/2 
                        minutes... and your role in it. 

           Haig doesn’t move. 

                                 HAIG
                        You think I did anything without 
                        the President knowing?

                                 ROSE
                        We all do what we think is best, 
                        isn’t that what you say? 
                            (beat)
                        I have an entire lifetime to decide 
                        whether I tell my story or not. 

           They stare, not speaking. Haig blinks first. 

                                 HAIG
                        That’s the choice you must make.  

                                 ROSE
                        That’s right. My choice. Not yours. 
                        Not the President’s.  
                            (beat)
                        You should go. The President will 
                        be expecting you. 

           Haig leaves. She watches him disappear into the CROWD OF 
           TOURISTS. After a moment, she looks down at the WHITE FOLDED 
           PAPER in her hands.

           We see Jerry in the distance, waving his briefcase in 
           happiness.  Rose goes to meet him. She passes a TRASH CAN. 
           She stops. Looks at the paper in her hand. Then --

           Rose tosses -- THE WHITE FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER in it. The 
           secrets of the 18 1/2 minutes joining the rest of the 
           garbage. She watches it sink into the trash. We have our eyes 
           on this white paper. We HOLD ON this image. 

           Rose heads down Grand Avenue, not looking back. Not ever 
           looking back. She passes the looming marble Washington 
           Monument. She moves ahead of us. Determined.

           We CRANE UP to see the full majesty of The Washington Mall, a 
           symbol of Washington at its best. The Capitol, Lincoln 
           Monument... the title cards begin to roll... as we show 
           actual footage of events (including Alexander Haig’s infamous  
           speech on the court house steps)
           CARD #1: RICHARD NIXON RESIGNED THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY 
           ON AUGUST 9, 1974. HE WAS PARDONED ON SEPTEMBER 8, 1974. 

           CARD #2: JUNE 1974 ALEXANDER HAIG TESTIFIED DENYING 
           RESPONSIBILITY FOR MORE THAN 100 WIRETAPS THAT WERE SENT TO 
           THE WHITE HOUSE. FBI RECORDS SHOW THAT HAIG REQUESTED 12 OUT 
           OF THE 17 INDIVIDUAL WIRETAPS. 

           CARD #3: GENERAL HAIG SERVED AS CHIEF OF STAFF FOR BOTH 
           GERALD FORD AND RONALD REGAN. 

           CARD #4: ROSE CONTINUED TO WORK FOR PRESIDENT NIXON UNTIL HIS 
           DEATH.

           CARD #5: ROSE MARY WOODS NEVER SPOKE ABOUT THE INCIDENT TO 
           THE PRESS. UNLIKE ALL THE LAWYERS AND POLITICIANS THAT WERE 
           INVOLVED IN THE WATERGATE SCANDAL, ROSE NEVER GRANTED AN 
           INTERVIEW. SHE NEVER WROTE A BOOK. SHE TOOK THE SECRET OF THE 
           18 1/2 MINUTES TO HER GRAVE. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
