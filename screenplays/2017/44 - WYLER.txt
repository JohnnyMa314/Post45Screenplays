           EXT. ALLEY - LAUPHEIM, GERMANY - DUSK

           Rapid footsteps pound the stone pavement.

           A frail young BOY runs with desperation. Adrenaline. Terror. 
           Panicked, frozen breath. Behind him, FOUR SS STORMTROOPERS in 
           hot pursuit. Pistols drawn. Bloodthirsty.

                                 STORMTROOPER 1
                              (in German)
                        Come back here, Jew!

           They watch the Boy disappear around a corner. Then--

           The crack of gunfire. A WOMAN shrieks. The troopers turn the 
           corner to find TWO OTHER STORMTROOPERS standing over a bullet 
           riddled dead body. We see the face -- an OLD MAN.

           The troopers share a hearty laugh, admiring their work. 
           Hiding in a shadowed doorway, the Boy watches in horror.

           EXT. STREET LEVEL SHOPS - CONTINUOUS

           The CRASHING of glass as NAZI THUGS heave bricks and rocks 
           through the windows of Jewish-owned businesses. The SS arrest 
           all JEWISH MEN and line them up into rows, savagely beating 
           any who resist. Shooting a few for fun.

           SUPERIMPOSE: Laupheim, Germany  November 9, 1938

           SUPERIMPOSE: Kristallnacht (The Night of Broken Glass)

           A school EXPLODES in a ball of fire. A group of TOWNSPEOPLE 
           cheer the destruction. Local POLICE stand idly by.

           EXT. TRAIN DEPOT - NIGHT

           Nazi thugs herd terror-stricken Jewish men onto flatbed 
           trucks. The SS sing cheerfully in the streets. The trucks 
           leave the city -- driving past a synagogue, consumed by fire.

           The Boy and his SISTER watch from a distance. Close on their 
           shocked faces as the background behind them transforms into--

           EXT. PORT OF HAMBURG - HAMBURG, GERMANY - DAY

           The deck of a giant OCEAN LINER. The Boy and his Sister press 
           against the rails, waving goodbye to FAMILY and FRIENDS. 
           Imprinted on the ship in large letters: MS St. Louis Hamburg
           Hundreds of frightened MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN pack the 
           deck, waving with nervous uncertainty. A massive CROWD on 
           shore waves back, behind a barricade of ropes.

           Unmoved by emotion, DOCK MEN begin to unmoor the ship from 
           the harbor. Working at a practiced, steady pace. Matching 
           their rhythm, the opening drum beat of “Sing Sing Sing” by 
           the Benny Goodman Band fills the soundtrack.

           As the ship heads to sea, the crowd on land RUSHES the ropes, 
           having to be held back by POLICE. Their screaming, crying 
           faces fill the frame. They transform into:

           An hysterical mob of frenzied TEENAGERS rushing a velvet 
           rope, halfway around the world--

           EXT. BILTMORE HOTEL - LOS ANGELES, CA - NIGHT

           Search lights. Flashbulbs. Opulence and elegance.

           SCREEN GODS and GODDESSES grace the red carpet of the 
           colossal Renaissance hotel, hypnotizing the crowd with 
           elegant waves and practiced sophistication. The hotel marquee 
           reads: 11th Annual Academy Awards.

           INT. BILTMORE BOWL BALLROOM (BILTMORE HOTEL) - CONTINUOUS

           Magnificent baroque hand-carved marble, draped in red and 
           gold fabric, radiates wealth, glamour, and self-importance.

           HOLLYWOOD ROYALTY wine and dine at white linen dressed 
           tables, accented with sterling flatware and ivory china.

           In the center of the fray, WILLIAM “WILLY” WYLER (36, 
           unconventionally handsome, French-German accent), anxiously 
           pokes at his dinner. Next to him, MARGARET "TALLI" WYLER (24, 
           smart, stunning) charms their table of nervous nominees.

           On stage, the BIG BAND kicks into its opening number.

                                                                CUT TO:

           JAMES ROOSEVELT II at the podium, opening an envelope. Wyler 
           takes a deep breath, tensing with anticipation.

                                 ROOSEVELT
                        And the Oscar for Best Direction in 
                        a Motion Picture goes to--

           The soundtrack goes silent as the winner is announced. Other 
           ATTENDEES applaud, but the blood drains from Wyler’s face. 
           His fake clap and smile say it all.
           A melodramatic voice enters the soundtrack--

                                 OLIVIER (O.S.)
                        Strong enough to bring us both back 
                        to life, Kathy. If you want to 
                        live!

           INT. GOLDWYN STUDIOS SOUND STAGE - DAY

           Wyler sits in his director’s chair, which displays: William 
           Wyler -- Director -- Wuthering Heights. Lights hang from the 
           rafters. His CREW hangs on him. But he’s distracted. Distant.

           He shoots a love scene with two young actors. The actress, 
           MERLE OBERON (26, pretty but rigid) lays in bed, pretending 
           to be sick. Her lover, LAWRENCE OLIVIER (32, English, perfect 
           movie star good looks), kneels at her bedside, holding her.

           Both actors are beyond over the top.

                                 OBERON
                        Oh Heathcliff -- I want to die.

                                 OLIVIER
                        Oh Kathy--
                              (buries head in her chest)
                        -- why did you kill yourself?!

           Wyler grimaces at the overacting.

                                 OBERON
                        Hold me -- just hold me.

                                 OLIVIER
                              (bursting up with emotion)
                        No! I’ll not comfort you! My tears 
                        don’t love you, Kathy. They blight 
                        and curse and damn you!

           Wyler can’t take anymore.

                                 WYLER
                        Cut! For Chrissake, Larry! Stop 
                        trying to reach the third balcony 
                        of the Manchester Opera House!

                                 OLIVIER
                              (frustrated)
                        Now what do you want me to do?

                                 WYLER
                        Be better.
                                 OLIVIER
                        For God’s sake, I did it standing 
                        up. I did it sitting down. I did it 
                        fast. I did it slow. I did it with 
                        a smile. I did it with a smirk. I 
                        did it scratching my ear. How do 
                        you want me to do it?

                                 WYLER
                        Do it -- better.

                                 OLIVIER
                              (exasperated)
                        I suppose this anemic little medium 
                        can’t take great acting!

           Wyler and the crew burst out laughing. Olivier turns crimson. 
           BOBBY (16, studio page) approaches Wyler with a note.

                                 BOBBY
                        From Mr. Goldwyn.

           Wyler reads the message: Come see me. Sam.

           He glares at the paper with weariness. Then looks off to the 
           corner of the stage, where JOHN HUSTON (33, tall, lean, deep 
           melodic voice), sits, scribbling on a pad and puffing on a 
           large cigar. A gritty, dangerous look about him.

           They exchange a glance. Huston smirks. No words necessary.

           INT. GOLDWYN’S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

           SAMUEL “SAM” GOLDWYN (60, bald, Polish accent) dramatically 
           paces and gestures with gusto. A proud man in an expensive 
           suit and an aggressively terrible bow tie.

           Wyler sits across from him, frustrated but calm. Huston is 
           again off in a corner, plumes of smoke emanating from him.

                                 GOLDWYN
                        Dammit, Willy! You can’t keep doing 
                        take after take without explaining 
                        what must be redone!

                                 WYLER
                        If I tell them what to do, it won’t 
                        come from them. It won’t be the 
                        same reality--

                                 GOLDWYN
                              (ignoring him)
                        And you can’t berate the actors! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GOLDWYN (CONT'D)
                        People don’t respond to being 
                        screamed at!

           Before Wyler can interject, Goldwyn changes course.

                                 GOLDWYN (CONT’D)
                        You know what, nevermind -- you’re 
                        right. Olivier’s performance is 
                        rotten! He’s stagey. Look at him on 
                        set yesterday. He’s filthy!

                                 WYLER
                        He’s playing a stable boy.

           Huston chuckles to himself.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        Olivier is fine. It’s Oberon who 
                        can’t act. But she also can’t take 
                        the criticism; Olivier can. That’s 
                        why I ride him -- but I make sure 
                        it’s while she’s listening.

           Goldwyn sits, calming down.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        There’s a great performance in 
                        there and I’ll get it.

                                 GOLDWYN
                              (mulling this over)
                        Good, good. You’ll work with him. 
                        Good. Now that we’ve resolved that--
                              (with slight hesitation)
                        I screened your ending--
                              (goes for it)
                        Too gloomy. We need to reshoot.
                        Huston, write up some new pages, 
                        will ya? Something more upbeat?

                                 WYLER
                        Sam! They both die! How do you 
                        suggest we make that upbeat?

                                 GOLDWYN
                              (shrugging)
                        John’s the writer.

           Huston puffs his cigar, but says nothing. Cool as a cucumber.

                                 WYLER
                        Let’s get the first cut in the can, 
                        and watch the ending in context. 
                        And then decide what to do. Deal?
           Goldwyn’s eyes reveal he’s not quite sold.

                                 GOLDWYN
                        Deal.

           HALLWAY OUTSIDE GOLDWYN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Wyler and Huston walk briskly down a gaudy corridor.

                                 WYLER
                        If only I had your talent with the 
                        pen. I’d write myself out of this 
                        god damn contract.

                                 HUSTON
                        Never trust a man with a beard or a 
                        bow tie. He’s hiding something.

           They laugh.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD PRODUCTION CODE OFFICE (HAYS OFFICE) - DAY

           Close on a Nazi Flag on top of a car pennant pole. Attached 
           to a gleaming Rolls Royce, pulling into the drive.

           INT. HAYS OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           JOSEPH BREEN (51, severe) reviews various pages of 
           screenplays, marking them in red pen before handing them off 
           to an ASSISTANT.

           Flanking Breen are several NAZI OFFICIALS, the most prominent 
           of whom, GEORG GYSSLING (46, Germany’s Hollywood Consul), 
           encourages Breen with a pat on the back.

           EXT. WARNER BROTHERS STUDIO LOT - DUSK

           Tires SCREECH to a halt outside a darkened soundstage. SHADY 
           CHARACTERS hop out of black cars.

                                 MILTON (O.S.)
                        By order of Joseph Breen, this 
                        picture is shut down for violation 
                        of the Hays Code -- Article 10--

           INT. WARNER BROTHERS SOUNDSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           MILTON ROBERTS (40, buttoned up) reads a decree, backed up by 
           the Shady Characters and several LOCAL POLICE. A devastated 
           FILM CREW absorbs the awful news.
                                 MILTON
                        -- Paragraph 2 -- “the history, 
                        institutions, prominent people and 
                        citizenry of other nations shall be 
                        represented fairly”--

           The DIRECTOR throws over his chair in disgust. Off in a 
           corner, a couple TEENAGE EXTRAS start to cry.

           EXT. NATIONAL MALL - WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

           Gyssling speaks in incoherent whispers to a FIGURE shrouded 
           in darkness. A handshake. A smile. Then a briefcase moves 
           from Gyssling to the Figure. As Gyssling walks off--

           The eyes of the Figure appear through a sliver of light in 
           the shadows. Shallow, malicious eyes.

           The Capitol Building rises in the distance.

           INT. WEST HOLLYWOOD BAR - NIGHT

           Huston arm wrestles two local BIKERS simultaneously, crushing 
           them in an impressive display. He celebrates his victory with 
           an enormous swig of tequila. PAPARAZZI flash their bulbs at 
           the scene, until a BOUNCER shoves them all out the door.

           Wyler watches from the bar, laughing and throwing back a shot 
           himself. Discarding the glass next to several empty friends. 
           The BARTENDER smirks.

           Olivier sits next to Wyler -- out of his element.

                                 OLIVIER
                        Vodka martini, please.

           Wyler drunkenly holds up two fingers, indicating he wants one  
           also. The bartender leaves. Olivier turns sharply to Wyler--

                                 OLIVIER (CONT’D)
                        You think I’m a lousy actor.

                                 WYLER
                        Larry, you’re the most talented 
                        actor I’ve worked with.

                                 OLIVIER
                        Then why are you so hard on me?

                                 WYLER
                        That’s why.
           Huston lumbers over, snatches a bottle of Jack from the bar 
           and throws it back. He throws down a random assortment of 
           crumpled up bills and change. Olivier grimaces in disgust.

                                 HUSTON
                        On our last picture, Willy and I 
                        survived on baked beans, asparagus, 
                        and Scotch whiskey. Whenever a fly 
                        bit one of us, it dropped dead.

           Oliver winces at Huston’s breath. Huston trudges away.

                                 WYLER
                        You’re the best actor on the London 
                        stage. But you have a chip on your 
                        shoulder about Hollywood. Can’t you 
                        see your attitude is pure snobbery?

           Olivier starts to protest, but Wyler cuts him off--

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        There’s nothing you can’t do on 
                        film. You tell me you can’t do 
                        Hamlet on it -- you can do Hamlet
                        on it. You can do Oedipus Rex on 
                        it. You can do any damned thing in 
                        the world. All you have to do is 
                        find out how.

           Olivier takes it in. Suddenly, the front door BURSTS open! 
           It’s Bobby!

                                 BOBBY
                              (catching his breath)
                        Mr. Wyler -- Wuthering Heights -- 
                        there’s a situation.

           EXT. WEST HOLLYWOOD STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           Wyler and Huston recklessly SPEED through town on their 
           motorcycles. Bobby holds onto Wyler. Holding onto Huston is -- 
           Olivier -- soiling himself.

           EXT. GOLDWYN STUDIOS - CONTINUOUS

           Wyler and Huston BURST onto the Goldwyn Studios lot, racing 
           through incongruous backlots -- an old west town square -- a 
           colonial village -- a New York east side neighborhood.
           INT. GOLDWYN STUDIOS - SCREENING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Wyler, Huston, Olivier, and Bobby sit in the dark, watching a 
           projection of a scene from Wuthering Heights. The surprised 
           looks on their faces reveal this footage is unfamiliar.

           In it, the ghosts of Olivier and Oberon’s characters walk 
           together hand-in-hand, deeply in love, backs to the camera, 
           into a fog-filled horizon. Romantic music swelling.

                                 OLIVIER
                        That’s not me. I never filmed that.

                                 HUSTON
                        Goldwyn shot a new ending.
                              (half impressed)
                        That son of a bitch.

           We close on Wyler’s face -- filling with white hot rage.

           INT. PARLOR - WYLER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A fist SLAMS down on a desk. Wyler’s fist.

                                 WYLER
                        Dammit Sam! This is the last straw!

           We pull out to reveal Wyler performing for a boozy Huston. 
           The parlor is cozy, but smells of new money. An oak writing 
           desk. A French leather sofa. A marble fireplace.

           Talli sits on a chaise in the corner, immersed in a book. 
           Surrounded by a graveyard of scripts. Beside her, CATHERINE 
           (infant) coos in a playpen.

                                 HUSTON
                        Good one. Now make it sing.

           Wyler collapses in a chair and sips a whiskey.

                                 WYLER
                        What a terrible business. Nothing 
                        but humiliation.

           Talli raises an eyebrow, but says nothing.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        If I do this, go out on my own -- 
                        I’ll basically be auditioning again 
                        for the entire town. My next 
                        project -- it’s got to be great.
                                 HUSTON
                              (nods)
                        We’ll find top source material. 
                        I’ll adapt it. You’ll direct the 
                        shit out of it. As soon as your 
                        contract with Goldwyn is up--

                                 WYLER
                        I can’t wait that long. It’s -- 
                        it’s got to be now.

           Talli raises another eyebrow.

                                 HUSTON
                        You mean -- break your contract?

           Wyler nods, taking another drink.

                                 HUSTON (CONT’D)
                              (knowing his friend)
                        Is this about your birthday?

                                 WYLER
                        Twenty years in this town and I’ve 
                        gotten nowhere.

                                 HUSTON
                        You’re only turning 37.

                                 WYLER
                        Thalberg died at 37.

                                 TALLI
                              (had enough)
                        That’s it. Pity party’s over.

           She approaches Wyler and hands him her book with authority.

                                 TALLI (CONT’D)
                        Leaving Goldwyn -- maybe it gives 
                        us the chance we’ve been waiting 
                        for. To do something meaningful.

           Wyler considers it, unsure. He reads the cover--

                                 WYLER
                        How Green Was My Valley--

                                 HUSTON
                        Willy, that’s the hottest property 
                        in town. It’s a goddamned 
                        masterpiece. Talk about Oscar bait.

           Wyler’s eyes light up, but he tries to play it cool.
                                 WYLER
                        Oscar bait? Who owns the rights?

           Huston’s expression sours.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        Who?

                                 TALLI
                        Goldwyn?

           Huston shakes his head no. Wyler sickens as he realizes.

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - BEVERLY HILLS, CA - NIGHT

           Wyler parks his motorcycle on the curb.

           He stares up at the majestic facade of the Victorian mansion 
           on the corner. It towers over him. He starts to sweat.

           EXT. CARL LAEMMLE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A long walk up the stone path leading to the front door. 
           Lined with gaudy English landscaping.

           Wyler rings the doorbell. No one answers. On edge, he fidgets 
           with his motorcycle jacket. Smooths his hair.

           He rings the doorbell again. A long, excruciating silence. 
           Feet getting colder, he turns to leave. But before he can --
           MAX (65, butler) opens the door with a stone-face. Cementing 
           Wyler’s unease. Then Max smiles, letting him off the hook.

                                 MAX
                        Great to see you, Willy.

           Reassured, but only slightly, Wyler enters the--

           INT. GRAND HALLWAY (LAEMMLE’S HOUSE) - CONTINUOUS

           As he walks, he takes in the walls. Pictures of the master of 
           the house with various MOVIE STARS. With PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT.

           He reaches a photo of an OLDER, BALD MAN in a tux, smiling 
           proudly at the camera -- holding an Academy Award. Wyler 
           shrugs -- a complex cocktail of jealousy and nostalgia.

                                 LAEMMLE (O.S.)
                        All Quiet on the Western Front.
           Wyler looks up to see CARL LAEMMLE (72) in the foyer. The 
           old, bald man from the photo. He’s graceful, with a soft-
           spoken German accent. His eyes are kind, wise. But also, sad.

                                 WYLER
                        Great picture. They don’t make ‘em 
                        like that anymore.

                                 LAEMMLE
                        Some don’t try.

           Wyler ignores the dig.

                                 LAEMMLE (CONT’D)
                        I assume you’d like a Scotch?

                                 WYLER
                        Thank you.

           Laemmle waves Wyler to the sofa and approaches a wet bar in 
           the corner. Wyler hates needing him. More than anything.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        I love your new landscaping. Very -- 
                        well manicured.

                                 LAEMMLE
                        Willy, I’m not giving you How Green 
                        Was My Valley.

                                 WYLER
                              (stunned, angry)
                        Then why invite me here? To reject 
                        me in person?! You always were a 
                        mean old prick!

                                 LAEMMLE
                        I sold it. I -- I needed the money.
                              (letting his guard down)
                        I’m broke, Willy.

                                 WYLER
                        Broke? Look at this house!

                                 LAEMMLE
                        The bank owns it. They’re letting 
                        me stay. For now.

                                 WYLER
                        I don’t understand. What happened?

           Laemmle considers his response--
           INT. SCREENING ROOM (LAEMMLE’S HOUSE) - MINUTES LATER

           A state-of-the-art home theater. Wyler and Laemmle settle 
           into two red leather chairs near the back.

                                 LAEMMLE
                        You following the news back home?

           Wyler shifts in his chair, uncomfortable.

                                 LAEMMLE (CONT’D)
                        Thousands of Jewish businesses 
                        destroyed. Tens of thousands 
                        shipped to internment camps. 
                        Hundreds dead--

                                 WYLER
                        Kristallnacht--

                                 LAEMMLE
                        -- the synagogue in Laupheim -- my 
                        childhood synagogue -- burned to 
                        the ground!

                                 WYLER
                              (nods)
                        I saw pictures.

                                 LAEMMLE
                        You haven’t seen this.

           Laemmle turns off the light. And starts the projector. We see 
           BLACK AND WHITE FOOTAGE of:

           A title card: Havana, Cuba

           Then -- a giant OCEAN LINER in a harbor. Hundreds of weary 
           PEOPLE crowd the rails, staring desperately at the shore. 
           Imprinted on the ship in large letters: MS St. Louis Hamburg.

           Various shots of distraught PASSENGERS. The ELDERLY. 
           CHILDREN. Then footage of CUBAN OFFICIALS, on land, laughing 
           and joking. Carefree.

           A final shot of a despairing family, trapped on the boat.

           Laemmle turns off the projector and flips on the light.

                                 LAEMMLE (CONT’D)
                        900 Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi 
                        persecution in Germany. All with 
                        Cuban Visas. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LAEMMLE (CONT’D)
                        But just before they docked in 
                        Havana, the government instituted a 
                        Jewish ban. They’ve been stuck in 
                        that harbor six days.

           Wyler is disturbed. He stares at the blank screen.

                                 WYLER
                        Anti-Semitism is an evil as old as 
                        the world. This too will pass.

                                 LAEMMLE
                        If Hitler invades Poland, Europe 
                        will be thrust into war. And the 
                        extermination of the Jewish people 
                        will begin.

                                 WYLER
                        Hitler won’t invade Poland. He 
                        doesn’t want a war.

           Laemmle thinks Wyler is naive. He speaks to him in German.

                                 LAEMMLE
                        I’ve been sponsoring Jews from 
                        Laupheim and Wurttemberg so they 
                        can immigrate to America. We’ve 
                        gotten hundreds out so far. It’s 
                        cost my entire fortune.

           Wyler can’t believe it. He’s in awe.

                                 LAEMMLE (CONT’D)
                        But we’re out of time. And the US 
                        is asleep. As we speak, the 
                        Senate’s considering a petition to 
                        admit the St. Louis. It will be 
                        rejected. And these poor souls will 
                        be sent back to Germany.

                                 WYLER
                              (in German)
                        America is neutral in European 
                        affairs. You know that.

                                 LAEMMLE
                              (leaning in, switching 
                              back to English)
                        I want to make a picture that will 
                        expose the Nazi atrocities and 
                        convince America to take action. 
                        I’d like you to direct.

           Wyler is shocked at the offer.
                                 WYLER
                        Carl, the studios don’t release 
                        Nazi pictures. It’s impossible.

           Laemmle gives him a hard look.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        Carl, I wish I could, but -- I’m 
                        just under too much scrutiny right 
                        now. I’m sorry, Carl. I can’t.

           Laemmle nods, disappointed.

                                 LAEMMLE
                        It’s getting late.

           FRONT DOORWAY

           Laemmle escorts Wyler out of the house. Deafening silence 
           between the men. Until--

                                 LAEMMLE (CONT’D)
                        I sold How Green Was My Valley to 
                        MGM. Go see Louis B. Mayer -- I’ll 
                        put in a good word.

                                 WYLER
                        Carl -- I --
                              (can’t find the words)
                        -- thank you.

           They nod goodbye. Then Wyler walks off into the night. 
           Laemmle watches Wyler go, Max appearing behind him.

                                 MAX
                        What did Willy want?

                                 LAEMMLE
                        To apologize.

           INT. TROCADERO NIGHT CLUB - SUNSET STRIP, CA - NIGHT

           Black tie French-inspired supper club. A BIG SWING JAZZ BAND 
           plays the hits of Basie, Ellington, and Goodman.

           A giant banner above the stage: Happy Birthday L.B.!

           Celebrities. Socialites. Aristocrats. Packed like sardines. 
           Frolicking like teenagers. CARY GRANT and JIMMY STEWART joke 
           in one corner. CLARK GABLE and CAROLE LOMBARD flirt in 
           another. MYRNA LOY jumps on stage with the band.

           Wyler and Talli enter, dressed to the nines.
                                 TALLI
                              (in awe, but a little 
                              turned off)
                        This is his birthday party?

           Wyler smiles mischievously -- he could get used to this. He 
           notices Goldwyn across the room. The two men scowl at each 
           other. Interrupted by--

           Huston bounds over out of nowhere to give Wyler a bear hug 
           from behind and a big kiss on the cheek. Wyler squirms.

                                 HUSTON
                        Oops -- thought you were Garbo.

           Talli shakes her head at the endearing bohemian, as he leads 
           her and Wyler to the bar. Huston spots Jimmy Stewart nearby.

                                 HUSTON (CONT’D)
                        Jimmy -- you crazy, skinny son-of-a-
                        bitch! Come over here and meet the 
                        best director in the world!

           Stewart extends his hand to Wyler.

                                 STEWART
                              (joking)
                        Nice to meet you, Mr. Hitchcock.

           They all laugh -- except Wyler.

           ON STAGE - MINUTES LATER

           LOUIS B. MAYER (55, balding, commanding, malleable demeanor) 
           and his wife, MARGARET SHENBERG (35, depressed), grace the 
           main stage to much fanfare. Wyler, Talli, and Huston observe.

                                 HUSTON
                        If anybody on earth ever created 
                        himself, Louis B. Mayer did.

           Wyler watches Mayer with admiration. Talli is skeptical.

           PRIVATE MEETING ROOM - AN HOUR LATER

           TWO CLUB SECURITY escort Wyler and Huston into a private room 
           where Mayer and several HANGERS-ON drink the expensive stuff.

                                 MAYER
                              (spotting them)
                        Boys! Great to see you!
                                 WYLER
                        Thank you for inviting us, sir. 
                        Happy birthday.

                                 MAYER
                        I hear you just celebrated a 
                        birthday as well.

                                 HUSTON
                              (with a devilish smile)
                        Willy turned 40.

                                 WYLER
                        I turned 37.

                                 MAYER
                              (teasing)
                        Hey, we’re all 37 at heart, right?
                              (to the hangers-on)
                        Gentlemen, will you please excuse 
                        Mr. Wyler and I?

           Huston throws his arm around an ELDERLY HANGER-ON, whose 
           neckwear catches Huston’s suspicious eye--

                                 HUSTON
                        Bow tie, huh?

           Huston leads the crowd off for more drinks.

                                 WYLER
                        Mr. Mayer, I appreciate you taking 
                        the time--

                                 MAYER
                        Relax, Willy -- it’s yours.

           Wyler’s speechless. Mayer puts his arm around him--

                                 MAYER (CONT’D)
                        You’re an extraordinary talent. 
                        You’re ready to take your career to 
                        the next level.

           Ecstatic, Wyler grins his biggest possible grin.

                                 MAYER (CONT’D)
                              (toasting his glass)
                        “Do it right, do it big, give it 
                        class.” Welcome to the MGM family.

           MAIN DANCE FLOOR

           Music! Dancing! Laughter! Celebration!
           The room celebrates Mayer. Wyler celebrates himself.

           He and Talli swing with zeal. Huston dances over with a 
           beautiful ACTRESS (19). He slaps Wyler proudly on the back, 
           before he and his date lindy hop away.

           Smiling wide, Wyler dips Talli with a big kiss. They laugh.

           Wyler notices Goldwyn staring angrily at him from across the 
           room. Drunk with victory, Wyler ignores him.

           EXT. TROCADERO NIGHT CLUB - END OF THE NIGHT

           Wyler hands a ticket to a VALET, who promptly scurries off, 
           leaving the self-satisfied director alone at the curb. 

           Casually scanning the sidewalk, Wyler notices TWO ELDERLY 
           HOMELESS MEN sleeping near a bench. Before he can dwell on 
           them, he hears TWO YOUNG MALE PARTY GOERS behind him, joking--

                                 PARTY GOER 1
                        Hear the German weather report? 
                        Predicted reign, with a strong 
                        chance of heil.

           They laugh.

                                 PARTY GOER 2
                        Hitler taught the Queen the Nazi 
                        salute. Took some practice, but she 
                        got it “Reich” the third time.

           They laugh again. Wyler isn’t amused. He can’t help but--

                                 WYLER
                        Hey guys -- I know you’re just 
                        kidding around, but it’s really not 
                        something to joke about.

                                 PARTY GOER 1
                        What’s your problem, pal?

                                 WYLER
                        I’m just saying, it’s really pretty 
                        serious what’s going on over there.

                                 PARTY GOER 2
                        Why don’t you mind your fuckin’ 
                        business, asshole?

           Wyler’s temperature rises, but he doesn’t engage. The valet 
           returns with his car. Talli arrives as well, unaware of 
           what’s been unfolding. As the Wylers get in their car:
                                 PARTY GOER 1
                        Asshole.

                                 PARTY GOER 2
                        What do you expect from a Jew?

           Wyler’s blood boils. Talli is shocked. She turns to Wyler, 
           expecting her proud husband to launch himself at them. But he 
           bites his lip and drives away. To her surprise. And dismay.

           INT. CAPITOL HILL HALLWAY - DAY

           We see the back of a TALL MAN moving swiftly through the 
           marble corridors of power. An entourage behind him. A gang of 
           REPORTERS with note pads scramble to intercept him.

                                 REPORTER 1
                        Senator! Senator!

           Close on the back of the Tall Man’s head, as he stops. His 
           hair is slicked back. He has a Midwestern drawl.

                                 REPORTER 1 (CONT’D)
                        Your committee votes tomorrow on 
                        the MS St. Louis. What’s your 
                        position on allowing Jewish 
                        refugees from Germany into the US?

                                 TALL MAN
                              (cold)
                        I don’t think it would meet the 
                        better part of wisdom. Conditions 
                        here at home prohibit accepting an 
                        influx of population.

           The reporters quickly scribble down his every word.

           EXT. MOVIE COLONY HOTEL POOL - MIAMI BEACH, FL - DAY

           Swanky, exclusive ocean resort. Surrounded by lush tropical 
           beauty, turquoise waterfalls, pink lounge chairs, and 
           CELEBRITIES behaving badly.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY (MOVIE COLONY HOTEL) - CONTINUOUS

           Wyler, Talli, Huston, and a GIGGLY ACTRESS (20) check in. 
           Talli holds baby Catherine. She cringes at the gaudy splendor 
           oozing from the lobby.

                                 TALLI
                        Another understated MGM affair.
                                 HUSTON
                              (winks)
                        Good year for Andy Hardy.

           Giggly Actress giggles.

           Wyler notices a newspaper on the counter. The front page 
           headline: US Rejects Jewish Refugees. He lingers on this. 

           The sound of the others talking drains from the soundtrack.

           EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY

           Wyler, Talli, Huston, and Giggly Actress sunbathe along the  
           hotel’s lagoon pool. The men chat -- Wyler seeming 
           distracted. The ladies read -- we can’t see what.

                                 HUSTON
                        Miami was an inspired choice for an 
                        MGM sabbatical. Well done, sir!

           Giggly Actress takes an interest in Talli’s book.

                                 WYLER
                        Thanks. I guess I’ve been reading a 
                        lot about Miami lately.

           Giggly Actress bounces into Huston’s lap.

                                 GIGGLY ACTRESS
                              (re: Talli’s book)
                        Honey! I have to have this! Would 
                        you pick me up a copy at that cute 
                        little book shop in town?!

           Wyler and Talli roll their eyes at each other.

                                 WYLER
                        I’ll go. I could use a drive.

           Wyler walks off. Talli watches him go, concerned.

           EXT. PORT OF MIAMI - AN HOUR LATER

           Wyler drives up to the main cruise terminal and parks. He 
           investigates the empty Biscayne Bay. No ships.

           Wandering around the port, he sees HOMELESS MAN upon HOMELESS  
           MAN huddled together. Penniless. Starving. Staring back.

           He approaches an OLD SEA CAPTAIN, smoking a pipe.
                                 WYLER
                        You know the St. Louis?

           The Captain says nothing.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        Were any refugees able to land?

                                 CAPTAIN
                              (shaking head no)
                        Can’t feed our own damn people. 
                        What we gonna do wit bunch a Jews?

           Wyler feels sick. He stares back out at the empty bay.

           EXT. HOTEL ROOM PATIO - DAY

           Wyler and Talli read, overlooking the beach. White sands. 
           Palm trees. Children splashing in the clear, blue waves.

                                 TALLI
                              (laughing at her book)
                        This cute English family has the 
                        most charming adventures. You have 
                        to read this! Although the final 
                        chapters get more serious as 
                        hostilities rise in Europe. Scary 
                        world we live in.

                                 WYLER
                              (immersed in a newspaper)
                        Sounds great, my love.

           Talli realizes he’s not paying attention.

                                 TALLI
                        And then everyone dies.

                                 WYLER
                        Wonderful, my love.

           She lowers the newspaper from his face.

                                 TALLI
                        Where are you?

           Wyler breaks from his fog.

                                 WYLER
                        Hitler’s demanding Danzig from 
                        Poland. Yesterday, he and Mussolini 
                        signed a military pact.

                                 WYLER (CONT'D)
                        No one knows Hitler’s next move, 
                        but it sure doesn’t look like 
                        dinner and dancing. Meanwhile--

           He hands her his paper, pointing to an article.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        88% of Americans think we should 
                        stay out of European affairs.

           Talli reads the headline.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        If Hitler starts a war--

                                 TALLI
                              (finishing his thought)
                        -- is the US going to fight?

           Wyler ponders the question. He turns toward the water -- a 
           vast ocean between America and Europe.

           EXT. HOTEL POOL - NIGHT

           A pool side party. A mariachi band. Cocktails with umbrellas.

           Huston and Giggly Actress sizzle up a storm in the dance 
           area. Wyler and Talli are content to stay away from the 
           makeshift nightclub, but Huston finally convinces them to let 
           loose and do an uncoordinated jitterbug.

                                 HUSTON
                              (roaring with laughter)
                        Willy -- you’re a dead hoofer!

           They all laugh. And keep the limbs whirling.

           At that moment, an EMERGENCY BROADCAST comes over the hotel 
           loudspeaker. The band stops playing. The crowd stops dancing.

           We close on Wyler as he listens to the broadcast.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        This is a special CBS news report. 
                        This morning, shortly before 6 
                        a.m., German troops crossed the 
                        border into Poland--

           Wyler’s face drops. He’s frozen, white as a ghost. He turns 
           to Talli, who shares his expression.
                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        -- After a huge aerial and land 
                        bombardment, the force and speed of 
                        the invasion shocked the Polish 
                        military. In a matter of hours, the 
                        German airforce had destroyed the 
                        Polish railway system and shot its 
                        airforce out of the skies--

           Wyler looks at Talli, searching for the words--

                                 WYLER
                        I’ll be right back.

           INT. WYLER’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Wyler paces impatiently, in front of an erratic fire.

                                 WYLER
                        Dammit -- pick up the phone, Carl.

           Across the room, Baby Catherine coos in her crib. He picks 
           her up and plays with her. She erupts with giggles, melting 
           his heart. He kisses her on the forehead.

                                 TALLI (O.S.)
                        Laemmle?

           Talli enters the room, taking Catherine from him.

                                 WYLER
                              (shaking head no)
                        Not yet. It’s taking too long.

                                 TALLI
                        Britain and France have declared 
                        war on Germany.

           Wyler nods, solemnly. They both sit.

           The phone RINGS. Wyler picks it up.

                                 WYLER
                        Hello.

           He reacts to bad news on the line, sinking in his chair. He 
           looks up at Talli, pain in his eyes.

           INT. WILSHIRE B’NAI B’RITH TEMPLE - LOS ANGELES, CA - DAY

           A giant poster of Laemmle smiling, next to a closed casket.
           A packed house of HOLLYWOOD ELITE, including: Mayer, Goldwyn, 
           Olivier and his wife VIVIEN LEIGH, Jimmy Stewart, and more--

           Wyler sits in the front row, between Talli and Huston. Wyler 
           holds Catherine.

           RABBI F. EDGAR MAGNIN delivers a eulogy. Wyler tries to 
           remain stoic, but he’s clearly affected.

           We close on Wyler, consumed with his own thoughts.

           INT. MAYER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Massive, all-white, extravagant. The office of a man at the 
           center of Hollywood power, and letting you know it.

           Mayer sits behind a huge semi-circle desk. He has two phones, 
           an intercom, and a pen holder shaped like a race horse. 
           Flanking him is EDDIE MANNIX (48, balding, intimidating). He 
           wears a smile, but not the kind you want to see. 

           JUNE CALDWELL (30, tough, alluring), works at a small desk in 
           the corner. Typing relentlessly.

           Wyler sits across from Mayer.

                                 WYLER
                        I want to make a movie about 
                        Hitler.

           Mayer is taken aback, but tries to hide it. The typing stops.

                                 MAYER
                        Adolf Hitler?

                                 WYLER
                        No, Fred Hitler.

           Mayer ignores the quip. He leans back in his chair, carefully 
           considering his response.

                                 MAYER
                        Why do you want to make a movie 
                        about Adolf Hitler?

                                 WYLER
                        You and I came together to make 
                        prestige pictures -- to win awards--

                                 MAYER
                              (correcting him)
                        You and I came together to make How 
                        Green Was My Valley.
                                 WYLER
                        Hollywood has stayed silent on the 
                        events in Europe for six years. But 
                        the world’s at war now. It’s time 
                        to comment. Courage -- that’s what 
                        the Academy wants.

                                 MAYER
                        Willy, I founded the Academy. Robin 
                        Hood pictures are what it wants.

                                 WYLER
                              (frustrated)
                        I defer to your wisdom, of course. 

                                 MAYER
                        There’s a depression on. People are 
                        starving. They go to the movies to 
                        escape. The last thing they want to 
                        see are Nazi pictures.

                                 WYLER
                        But, sir--

                                 MAYER
                        Enough!
                              (sternly)
                        MGM is the biggest studio in the 
                        world. We’re a huge global 
                        corporation. I’m responsible to my 
                        stockholders. We have theaters all 
                        over the world -- including Berlin.

           Wyler knows he’s lost. He nods, defeated.

                                 MAYER (CONT’D)
                        Good.
                              (easing up)
                        And trust me, if it’s awards your 
                        concerned with, How Green Was My 
                        Valley is what the Academy wants.

                                 WYLER
                        Thank you, sir.

           Mayer nods, clearly signaling that Wyler should go. Wyler 
           does, Mayer watching him. As soon as Wyler exits, Mayer’s 
           face turns from cordial to troubled.

           June observes the crusty mogul closely.
           EXT. MGM LOT - MINUTES LATER

           Wyler gazes at his surroundings. Miles of massive sound 
           stages and glorious back lots. EXTRAS milling about in 
           colorful dress. PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS scampering to and fro. 
           MGM is a dream factory. Everything Wyler’s always wanted.

           He notices a CAMERAMAN and SOUND OPERATOR filming a lion, 
           lifted up on crates, for use as the studio’s production logo 
           at the beginning of pictures. The lion ROARS.

           Wyler kick-starts his motorcycle. About to ride off, when--

                                 JUNE
                              (rushing toward him)
                        Mr. Wyler! Mr. Wyler!--
                              (reaching him, breathless)
                        I can help you make your picture.

           INT. WYLER’S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Wyler, Talli, Huston, and June dine on red wine and meatloaf. 
           Catherine, in high chair, cutely dribbles milk down her chin.

                                 JUNE
                        He was lying. He doesn’t care about 
                        the German market -- there is no 
                        German market. American studio 
                        assets are frozen in German banks -- 
                        they have no access to them.

           Huston can’t help but check out June’s curves.

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Besides, Goebbels refuses to import 
                        films with Jewish crew members. So 
                        there’s no German market anyway for 
                        any picture you direct. You are 
                        Jewish, right?

           Wyler lays down his fork and knife.

                                 WYLER
                        I’m not religious.

           Talli notices Wyler’s evasive response. June moves on--

                                 JUNE
                        Mayer is afraid of the censorship 
                        office. Of Joseph Breen. Every 
                        Jewish studio executive is.

           Wyler and Talli exchange a glance of “where is this going?”
           June pulls a letter out of her work bag and slides it across 
           the table to Wyler and Talli.

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Breen’s handwriting.

           Talli takes the letter and reads it aloud.

                                 TALLI
                        “They are a rotten bunch of vile 
                        people with no respect for anything 
                        beyond the making of money. Here in 
                        Hollywood, sexual perversion is 
                        rampant. Ninety-five percent of 
                        these folks are Jews of Eastern 
                        European lineage. They are, 
                        probably, the scum of the earth.”

                                 HUSTON
                              (sarcastic)
                        What a charmer.

                                 JUNE
                        Most of Breen’s rules center on 
                        language and sex, but the code also 
                        bans criticism of a foreign 
                        country. Breen uses that to block 
                        anything negative of Nazi Germany. 
                        You comply or he shuts you down.

           Looks of growing concern around the table.

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        In ‘36, Mayer tried to adapt the 
                        book, It Can’t Happen Here. Breen 
                        proposed sixty cuts and threatened 
                        great difficulty for MGM. Mayer 
                        backed down. Cancelled the project.
                              (leaning in)
                        Last year, Mayer tried to adapt 
                        Three Comrades. History repeated.

                                 WYLER
                        Are you telling us Mayer wants to 
                        make a Nazi picture?

                                 JUNE
                        He’s been trying to for years. He 
                        just can’t figure out how.

           Wyler and Talli turn to each other, searching for answers.
           EXT. BACKYARD (WYLER’S HOUSE) - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Wyler and Huston kick back with a couple cigars. Wyler thinks 
           to himself. Huston watches him closely.

                                 HUSTON
                        Don’t do it, Willy.

           Wyler looks at Huston innocently, as if to ask, “do what?”

                                 HUSTON (CONT’D)
                        This Nazi thing. I’m telling you -- 
                        it’s trouble. Our careers are hot 
                        right now. This could destroy 
                        everything we’ve worked for.

           Wyler broods over this, not pushing back.

                                 HUSTON (CONT’D)
                        We’re artists, man. Country doesn’t 
                        want to hear what two Hollywood 
                        guys think about world affairs--

                                 WYLER
                              (cutting him off)
                        I’m not about to commit career 
                        suicide. All our friends are out of 
                        work, I’m not looking to join them.

           Huston nods. Leaning back with his cigar, relieved.

           INT. WYLER’S BEDRROM - MIDNIGHT

           Wyler and Talli lie in bed, staring at the ceiling.

                                 TALLI
                        Why’d you tell that woman you’re 
                        not Jewish?

                                 WYLER
                              (defensive)
                        I’m not religious. You know that.

                                 TALLI
                        That’s not what she was asking.

           The truth hits Wyler hard. He shifts uncomfortably, as Talli 
           rolls over to go to sleep. Wyler stares at the ceiling.
           INT.  WYLER’S KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING

           Exhausted, Wyler nervously drinks his morning coffee. Talli 
           enters, holding Variety. She looks to console him--

                                 TALLI
                        Sorry, my love--

           Wyler looks defeated. He curses under his breath.

                                 TALLI (CONT’D)
                              (with a smile)
                        -- but you’re gonna have to dust 
                        off your tux! Eight nominations!

           Wyler jumps out of his chair! He grabs the paper.

                                 WYLER
                        Wuthering Heights -- Outstanding 
                        Production! Best Direction! Oliver 
                        for Best Actor!
                              (proud)
                        Way to go, Larry.

                                 TALLI
                              (smiling wide)
                        People love the Brits.

                                 WYLER
                        Larry’s wife was nominated too. For 
                        Gone With the Wind.

                                 TALLI
                        Vivien Leigh? See, Americans love 
                        the Brits. It’s the accent.

           Wyler’s face is hidden behind the paper. He lowers it, 
           revealing he’s working out an idea in his mind.

                                 WYLER
                        What was that book you read on 
                        vacation?

           INT. MAYER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Accompanied by a jazz soundtrack, we see Wyler pitch his new 
           idea to Mayer. June listens eagerly by Wyler’s side.

           Wyler is animated, impassioned, persuasive.

           Mayer leans back in his chair, skeptically considering--
           INT. CIRO’S BAR - SUNSET STRIP, WEST HOLLYWOOD - THAT NIGHT

           A shimmering hot spot for celebrities and their entourages. 
           Seductive CIGARETTE GIRLS glide from table to table. Wyler, 
           Talli, Huston, and June celebrate at a corner table 
           overflowing with bottles of champagne.

                                 TALLI
                              (lifting her glass)
                        To Mrs. Miniver!

           They all toast and cheer.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Wyler and June talk privately. Talli and Huston do the same.

                                 WYLER
                              (energized)
                        Imagine -- a cute comedy about an 
                        adorable English family, that’s 
                        secretly a drama about the European 
                        war. We show Americans the 
                        destructive effect of the German 
                        war machine, but without any 
                        references to Hitler or the Nazis, 
                        Breen can’t block it!

           Huston, eavesdropping, is uncomfortable with Wyler’s plan.

           Wyler and June toast. As Wyler drinks, June looks like she 
           wants to tell him something, but doesn’t know how.

                                 JUNE
                        Willy, before we start production, 
                        there’s something you need to know--

           Wyler lowers his glass, sensing her ominous tone.

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        The forces against this picture -- 
                        go way higher than Joseph Breen.

           INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - DAY

           A packed house of professional Washington DC GAWKERS watches 
           BANKING EXECUTIVES testify in front of the SENATE COMMERCE 
           COMMITTEE. A creaky, stodgy old white room presided over by 
           creaky, stodgy OLD WHITE MEN. The only relatively young face--

           SENATOR GERALD NYE (46) aggressively commands the room, 
           pummeling a withering EXECUTIVE. He has slicked back hair and 
           a Midwestern drawl. And shallow, malicious eyes.
                                 NYE
                        And exactly what percent of allied 
                        financing did US banks provide 
                        during the Great War?

                                 EXECUTIVE
                              (stammering)
                        I -- I can’t recall--

                                 NYE
                        75 percent, sir! Meanwhile, you and 
                        your colleagues also financed 50 
                        percent of the German side!

           The crowd turns on the executive. A wild booing beast.

                                 EXECUTIVE
                        That’s not true. It’s complicated-- 

                                 NYE
                        You claim to operate in the name of 
                        patriotism, when, in fact, you’re 
                        profiteers! You and your friends, 
                        sir, are merchants of death!

           The audience goes wild. Nye smiles. Smug. Slick. Shifty.

                                 NYE (CONT’D)
                        Americans want no more war. Most of 
                        all, they want no more 
                        participation in foreign wars. The 
                        passing of today’s important 
                        neutrality legislation ensures the 
                        US will never again spill its blood 
                        and treasure on foreign soil!

           The rabid crowd EXPLODES violently. Looking like they could 
           tear the scared executive to pieces.

           INT. CAPITOL HILL HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

           Nye walks briskly down the marble corridors of power.  
           SENATOR BURTON WHEELER (57, colorful) follows close behind.

                                 WHEELER
                        A huge victory, Senator! “Gerald 
                        the Giant Killer” strikes again!

           Nye offers a polite, yet decidedly unfriendly, smile.
           INT. NYE’S SENATE OFFICE - OUTER OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Organized chaos. AIDS and ASSISTANTS flitter about. Nye and 
           Wheeler quickly power through. HENRY, a legislative aid (22, 
           male) chases after. Wheeler never stops talking.

                      WHEELER (CONT’D)
           -- But is the neutrality act 
           enough?--
                                                          HENRY
                                              Senator Nye -- telegram from 
                                              California.

           Still walking, Nye grabs the telegram from the aid and 
           hurries into his interior office.

           NYE’S INTERIOR OFFICE

           Nye rips off his coat and poses behind his desk, skimming the 
           telegram. Wheeler sits across from him.

                                 WHEELER
                        -- Is it enough to stop Roosevelt? 
                        He keeps pushing for war, while 
                        impersonating a man of peace. Rumor 
                        is he’ll run for a 3rd term.

                                 NYE
                        Of course he will. He’ll defeat 
                        Wendell Wilkie too. But hubris will 
                        be his downfall. That’s how I 
                        nailed Harding on Teapot Dome. FDR 
                        is ten times as arrogant.

           Wheeler nods with hero worship. He starts to speak. But Nye, 
           reading, holds up his hand, gesturing Wheeler to be quiet. As 
           Nye reads on, Wheeler sits in awkward silence. Then--

                                 NYE (CONT’D)
                        Henry -- get Joseph Breen on the 
                        phone! Tell him it’s urgent.

                                 HENRY (O.S.)
                        Yes, sir.

           Nye turns to Wheeler, scheming--

                                 NYE
                        Who the hell is William Wyler?

           INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL - LOS ANGELES - OSCAR NIGHT

           An explosion of excess. A sea of neurotic MOVIE STARS caked 
           in makeup. And that’s just the men.

           All eyes on BOB HOPE delivering his opening monologue--
                                 HOPE
                        Welcome to the Academy Awards! All 
                        over America, people are saying, “I 
                        wonder who will win?” And all over 
                        Beverly Hills, psychiatrists are 
                        dusting off their couches and 
                        saying, “I wonder who will lose?”

           Tense laughter from the star-studded crowd.

           Wyler sits nervously at his table, flanked by Talli and 
           Huston. Across the room sits a nervous Goldwyn, who Wyler 
           spies out of the corner of his eye.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Paramount executive Y. FRANK FREEMAN reads the nominees for 
           outstanding production--

                                 FREEMAN
                        -- and Wuthering Heights, Samuel 
                        Goldwyn Productions--
                              (opening envelope)
                        -- and the Oscar for outstanding 
                        production -- Gone With the Wind!

           The grand score of Gone With the Wind overpowers the room.

           INT. LOBBY (AMBASSADOR HOTEL) - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Wyler, disappointed (but almost getting used to it), chats 
           with Huston. Goldwyn bulldozes over. Wyler turns to his old 
           nemesis, willing to let bygones be.

                                 WYLER
                        Hey Sam, guess it wasn’t our year -- 
                        again.

                                 GOLDWYN
                        You double-crossing son-of-a-bitch.

           Wyler starts to steam, but lets the old man say his piece.

                                 GOLDWYN (CONT’D)
                        Your delicate ego gets bruised and 
                        you jump ship at the first 
                        opportunity. After all I’ve done 
                        for you. Now you’re already in 
                        trouble at MGM -- getting axed from 
                        How Green Was My Valley?
                                 WYLER
                              (defensive)
                        I left on my own accord.

                                 GOLDWYN
                        I’m going to crush you at the box 
                        office. And with the Academy. I 
                        guarantee I win an Oscar before 
                        you. I guarantee it.

           Goldwyn is pushing his buttons and loving it.

                                 GOLDWYN (CONT’D)
                        Carl Laemmle was right about you. 
                        You’ll never succeed in this 
                        business because you don’t care 
                        about anything but yourself.

           Over the line. Huston cuts in--

                                 HUSTON
                        Sam, is your ass jealous of all the 
                        shit that comes out of your mouth?

           Goldwyn storms off, leaving Wyler angry and stunned.

           INT. CUTTING ROOM (MGM STUDIOS) - DAY

           A dingy dungeon. Where the real magic happens. Wyler, Huston, 
           and HAROLD KRESS (27, Wyler’s editor) watch a projection of 
           the German propaganda film Triumph of the Will.

           Wyler is quiet. Focused. In his own head.

                                 KRESS
                        This German shit has no subtlety. 
                        I’ll edit Mrs. Miniver to draw out 
                        the message with finesse--

                                 WYLER
                              (cutting him off)
                        Our picture must be entertainment 
                        first, message second.

           Huston notices the comment, but stays silent.

                                 KRESS
                        But I thought the point is--

                                 WYLER
                        The most powerful message in the 
                        world falls on deaf ears in an 
                        empty theatre.
           Kress nods. Huston is stone-faced.

           A phone RINGS. Wyler picks it up.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        This is Wyler.
                              (listening)
                        Shit. Ok, we’ll be here.
                              (hangs up)
                        Breen’s man is on his way to read 
                        the treatment.

                                 KRESS
                        The Hays office probably doesn’t 
                        need to know we’re studying Nazi 
                        war propaganda.

           Wyler nods. Kress races off to empty the projector.

                                 WYLER
                              (to Huston)
                        This picture has to thread the 
                        finest of needles. It will be 
                        difficult to write.

           Huston blurts out what’s been on his mind--

                                 HUSTON
                        Willy, I can’t write it.

                                 WYLER
                              (shocked)
                        What?

                                 HUSTON
                              (with hesitation)
                        I’ve been meaning to tell you--
                              (excited)
                        Warner Brothers -- they want me for 
                        the new Dashiell Hammett picture -- 
                        The Maltese Falcon.

                                 WYLER
                        To write?

                                 HUSTON
                        -- and direct! You believe it?!

           Wyler tries to be happy for his friend. It’s not working.

                                 WYLER
                              (halfheartedly)
                        That’s great, Johnny. Really great.
                              (thinking)
                                 (MORE)
                                 WYLER (CONT'D)
                        But can’t you do Mrs. Miniver
                        first? I mean -- I need you--

                                 HUSTON
                        The studio wants to start 
                        preproduction right away.

           A KNOCK at the door.

                                 HUSTON (CONT’D)
                        Breen’s guy.

           Wyler doesn’t move. He’s too stunned.

           Another knock on the door. Huston looks at Wyler, to see if 
           he’ll answer it. They exchange a long pained look. 

           Another knock--

                                 WYLER
                        I’m happy for you, Johnny.

           Wyler walks to the door. Huston watches him, conflicted.

           INT. DC RESTAURANT - A DARK AND STORMY NIGHT

           Nye, Wheeler, and Breen sit at a shadowy corner table. Nye 
           leafs through a notepad. Breen is increasingly nervous.

                                 NYE

                        They argue it’s not propaganda 
                        because it tells a factual story. 
                        Hays agreed that-- 

                                 NYE
                              (interrupting)
                        -- William Wyler. Mrs. Miniver?

                                 BREEN
                        We’ve been all over it, sir. There 
                        are no references to Nazi Germany--

                              (losing his temper)
                        For Chrissake, Breen! They’re 
                        pulling the wool over your eyes!

           Nye throws the notes away, in a fury.
                                 NYE (CONT’D)
                        Are these filmmakers Jews?

           Breen pulls out a file and reads--

                                 BREEN
                        Wyler’s a Jew. He immigrated from 
                        the border of France and Germany as 
                        a teenager. On an expensive visa. 
                        We don’t know how he afforded it.

                                 WHEELER
                        This is exactly why we blocked the 
                        St. Louis in committee. See what 
                        happens when we let these people 
                        into our country?

           Nye mulls this over. Then refocuses on bullying Breen.

                                 NYE
                        Hollywood is attempting to drug the 
                        reason of the American people and 
                        rouse war fever. This, the U.S. 
                        Congress will not accept.
                              (with emphasis)
                        Will you accept it, Breen?

                                 BREEN
                              (intimidated)
                        No, sir.

                                 NYE

           INT. WYLER’S DINING ROOM - DAY

           Wyler, Talli, and JAMES HILTON (39, screenwriter) huddle 
           around the kitchen table. Hilton furiously scribbles notes.

                                 WYLER
                        In the book, the Minivers are an 
                        upper-class family. We need to make 
                        them middle-class, so Americans 
                        will relate to them better.

                                 HILTON
                              (eager to please)
                        Absolutely, Mr. Wyler.
                                 WYLER
                        Understatement and restraint are 
                        the key. The pulse of real humanity 
                        must beat through this picture.

                                 HILTON
                              (scribbling madly)
                        Yes, sir.

                                 WYLER
                        Remember, all pages go through 
                        Talli. She’ll pass them to me.
                              (Hilton nods)
                        And--
                              (conflicted, he pulls out 
                              a binder)
                        -- these notes from MGM’s 
                        production office -- we need these 
                        elements in the film to appeal to 
                        the Academy. It’s very important.

           Talli shoots Wyler a distressed look. He tries to deflect it. 
           She starts to speak, but before she can--

           A phone RINGS in the other room. He leaves to answer. Talli 
           lingers on the binder, disappointed in her husband.

           INT. WYLER’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS / INT. MGM LOT - DAY

           Wyler on the phone with June, mid-conversation. We cut back 
           and forth between Wyler and June on the MGM lot.

                                 WYLER
                        Breen can’t do that! What about the 
                        First Amendment?

                                 JUNE
                        The First Amendment doesn’t protect 
                        free speech in motion pictures.

                                 WYLER
                        Says who?!

                                 JUNE
                        The Supreme Court.

           Wyler exhales in frustration.

           INT. WYLER’S DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Talli and Hilton continue work on the notes. Wyler enters--
                                 WYLER
                        Breen just banned all pictures 
                        about the war. All of them.

                                 HILTON
                        What do we do?

           Wyler looks at Talli, both their wheels turning.

           INT. PRODUCTION CODE OFFICE (HAYS OFFICE) - DAY

           SUPERIMPOSE: Hays Office  May 1940 

           Wyler and Talli sit in a waiting area, flipping through 
           magazines. Talli looks up from hers.

                                 TALLI
                        French troops are in the 
                        Netherlands.

           Wyler grunts. Says nothing.

                                 TALLI (CONT’D)
                        Is all your family out of France?

           Wyler tenses at the question. Talli starts to ask another--

                                 WYLER
                              (confidently)
                        Germany will never defeat France. 
                        Maginot Line.

           Talli isn’t so sure.

           The door to the main office opens, revealing June.

                                 JUNE
                              (beckoning Wyler)
                        We’re ready.
                              (then)
                        Remember what I told you.

           INT. BREEN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Breen sits behind his desk. Wyler and June across from him.

           Wyler scans the sterile room. A giant wooden crucifix on the 
           wall. He notices that Breen is wearing a bow tie.

           Breen is no longer the whipping boy he was with Nye. In this 
           exchange, he’s the one with the power. And he relishes it.
                                 BREEN
                        “Jailbird Willy” -- always good to 
                        see you.

           Wyler holds back his contempt for Breen. He simply nods.

                                 BREEN (CONT’D)
                        Congrats on wrapping your latest 
                        picture. The Letter is already 
                        getting Oscar buzz.

                                 WYLER
                        Thank you.

                                 BREEN
                        I wish you luck. It’s tough always 
                        being a bridesmaid.

                                 WYLER
                        There are worse things to be.

           Sensing the hostility rising, June jumps in--

                                 JUNE
                        Mr. Breen has an offer which will 
                        enable Mrs. Miniver to resume 
                        production--

                                 BREEN
                              (interrupting)
                        -- under certain conditions.

                                 WYLER
                        I’m sure we can oblige.

           Breen hands them a multi-page list. Wyler is stunned as he 
           thumbs through it.

                                 BREEN
                        In addition, one of my men must be 
                        on set every day, all day -- to 
                        assure compliance.

           Wyler is livid. He turns to June, begging for permission to 
           speak his mind. With her eyes, June denies him.

                                 WYLER
                              (turning back to Breen)
                        Thank you for your generosity.
           INT. WYLER’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Wyler and Talli sit up in bed. Talli marking up the latest 
           draft of Mrs. Miniver. She pauses and turns to Wyler--

                                 TALLI
                        Can you still make the picture you 
                        want?

           He’s increasingly uncertain.

                                 WYLER
                        The key is the speech at the end. 
                        If we can rewrite that, I think we--

                                 TALLI
                        Hard enough in Hollywood to make a 
                        picture you want. Impossible to 
                        make a picture you don’t want.

           Wyler thinks it over. Weary before he’s even begun.

           INT. WARNER BROTHERS SOUND STAGE - MALTESE FALCON SET - DAY

           Huston sits in a director’s chair, reading a cast list. Wyler 
           stands over him.

                                 HUSTON
                        Greer Garson as Mrs. Miniver! 
                        Walter Pidgeon as Mr. Miniver!
                              (hands list to Wyler)
                        Serious A-list wattage.

           Insecure, Wyler hands him thirty pages of screenplay.

                                 WYLER
                        Anyway -- here it is. Act One. If 
                        you have time--

           To Wyler’s surprise, Huston immediately opens up the script 
           and starts reading.

                                 HUSTON
                        This is good. You write this?

                                 WYLER
                        Me and a couple hired studio guns.

                                 HUSTON
                              (reading)
                        This is really good, Willy.

           Wyler beams.
                                 HUSTON (CONT’D)
                        You can clip some of this plot 
                        though. Develop this Mr. Ballard 
                        character -- that’ll maximize the 
                        triviality of the domestic 
                        vignettes before the war comes.

                                 WYLER
                        Of course I was planning to--

           Huston takes out a red pen.

                                 HUSTON
                        What if the old lady, after she 
                        says “I don't know what the 
                        country's coming to,” she jokes “no 
                        wonder Germany’s arming!” It’ll get 
                        a laugh and tighten the exposition.

                                 WYLER
                        Well I don’t know--

                                 HUSTON
                              (filled with great ideas)
                        And if we move this line up here -- 
                        and get rid of this--

           Wyler watches in horror as Huston marks up the draft in a 
           flurry. Each pen stroke a stab to the heart. Blind to Wyler’s 
           sensitivity, Huston finishes his mark-up with enthusiasm.

                                 HUSTON (CONT’D)
                              (handing it back)
                        Isn’t this better?

           We close on Wyler reading. Insecurity and jealousy simmering.

                                 WYLER
                        Much.

           INT. WYLER’S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Wyler and Talli eat dinner in silence. He’s tense.

                                 TALLI
                        How’s the script?

           Wyler doesn’t respond. He picks at his food.

                                 TALLI (CONT’D)
                        How’s the meatloaf?

           Wyler’s shoulders stiffen--
                                 WYLER
                        The Maltese Falcon is 
                        inconsequential drivel. A silly 
                        murder mystery. I’m trying to do 
                        something important.

           Talli listens. A poker face.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        He doesn’t understand directing. I 
                        shot a dozen two-reelers before I 
                        figured anything out. Paid my dues.
                              (dialing it down)
                        Don’t get me wrong -- I’m happy for 
                        him -- but John has a lot to learn.

           Talli’s anger at his childish behavior bubbles to the 
           surface. But she holds back.

                                 TALLI
                        Well, I’m sure Johnny just 
                        appreciates you’re happy for him.

           Wyler stabs angrily at his food with his fork.

           INT. MGM SOUND STAGE - MRS. MINIVER SET - DAY

           SUPERIMPOSE: Mrs. Miniver - Day 1

           Wyler and June walk purposely to the set. Kress and Hilton in 
           tow. Milton Roberts, Breen’s errand boy, rushes after Wyler.

                                 MILTON
                        Mr. Wyler--

           Wyler hears him, but keeps walking. June stops him.

                                 MILTON (CONT’D)
                        Milton Roberts -- from the Hays 
                        office. Mr. Breen sent me--

                                 WYLER
                              (insincerely)
                        Great to meet you, Milton.

                                 MILTON
                        I have Mr. Breen’s script notes for 
                        the first week of shooting.

           Wyler takes the notes from Milton and starts to flip through. 
           Annoyed, he looks to June. She offers only a poker-faced nod.
                                 WYLER
                              (suppressing irritation)
                        Good. Good.
                              (shakes Milton’s hand)
                        Let’s get to work!

           Milton smiles, mistaking the handshake for a gesture of 
           genuine friendship.

           ON SET

           Wyler settles into his director’s chair. Adrenaline pumping. 
           He gazes over to the corner of the set where Huston usually 
           sits, scribbling notes. He sees -- an empty chair.

           Before he can dwell on it, Bobby appears out of nowhere--

                                 BOBBY
                        A present from Ms. Garson!

           Bobby hands Wyler a small ornate box, with a satin gold bow. 
           Wyler unwraps it to find -- a pair of black velvet gloves. 
           And a note: For the iron hand of William Wyler.

           Wyler looks up to find GREER GARSON (35, elegant, crimson 
           hair, classic beauty). She is already on her first mark, in 
           costume, laughing at Wyler’s reaction to the gift.

           Wyler appreciates the good-humored jab. He turns to his FIRST 
           A.D. and gives him a “go-ahead” nod.

                                 FIRST A.D.
                        Places everybody! Quiet on the set!

           Swing music consumes the soundtrack, as we transition into a--

           MONTAGE

           (Note: The montage covers a one-month period)

           -- Wyler directs Garson, WALTER PIDGEON (43), and other 
           ACTORS in various scenes. Wyler demonstrates the highest 
           expertise in framing and scene composition. But he frustrates 
           his actors by barking orders and generally abusing them.

           -- Wyler shoots take after take. Never offering specific 
           direction as to what his actors should do. After yelling 
           “cut,” Wyler will simply mutter:

                                 WYLER
                        Again.
                              (or)
                        Do it better.
                                 (MORE)
                                 WYLER (CONT'D)
                              (or)
                        No good. Do it again.

           -- In one instance, he angers RICHARD NEY (24, playing 
           Garson’s son) to the point were Ney EXPLODES in character, 
           yelling his lines at Garson. Garson is shocked by Wyler’s 
           seemingly brutal technique. She glares at Wyler, who simply 
           offers back a sly wink and smile -- Nye’s character is 
           supposed to be furious in that scene. And Wyler brought out a 
           brilliant performance.

           -- Milton stalks Wyler day after day, giving unwanted 
           directing tips. Sometimes, Breen is on set too. June tries to 
           keep them at bay. Grudgingly, Wyler complies with all wishes.

           -- Wyler, obsessed with work, comes home late night after 
           night, leaving an agitated Talli home alone with the baby.

                                                                END MONTAGE

           INT. MOVIE HOUSE

           Black and white newsreel footage: Nazis Invade France!

           A NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER speaks over various war scenes of 
           Germany attacking French forces.

                                 NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER
                        After smashing through Luxemburg, 
                        Belgium, and Holland, five Nazi 
                        armies bulldozed across France this 
                        morning. France and Germany are now 
                        engaged in a furious campaign as 
                        all the world watches. Who will 
                        survive? Who will crumble?

           We see Wyler and Talli, in the theatre, watching the 
           newsreel. Horror on their faces.

           INT. MGM SOUND STAGE - MRS. MINIVER SET - DAY

           SUPERIMPOSE: Mrs. Miniver - Day 22

           Wyler directs Garson and an Austrian actor, HELMUT DANTINE 
           (22, dark good looks), playing a German pilot, in a scene in 
           the Miniver kitchen.

           In the scene, Dantine threatens Garson at gunpoint.

                                 DANTINE
                        Move or make noise, I shoot.
           Garson trembles with fear.

           Milton stands over Wyler’s shoulder, looking concerned.

                                 DANTINE (CONT’D)
                        Alone?

                                 GARSON
                        My children are upstairs, and the 
                        maid. All asleep.

                                 DANTINE
                              (gesturing with the gun)
                        Food. Drink.

                                 GARSON
                        Alright.

                                 DANTINE
                        Food, quick.

                                 GARSON
                        I’m getting it.

           Milton doesn’t like the tone of this scene at all.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Between takes, Milton approaches Wyler.

                                 MILTON
                        Mr. Wyler -- I don’t think this 
                        scene is gonna work.

           INT. MAYER’S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

                                 MAYER
                        The German pilot comes off quite 
                        hostile. It’s alarming.

                                 WYLER
                        That’s the point.

                                 MAYER
                        Don’t forget what we discussed -- 
                        nothing offensive to Germany.

           Wyler leans back in his chair, frustrated.
                                 WYLER
                        With all due respect, you are aware 
                        of what is happening in Europe, 
                        aren’t you? Or have you been in a 
                        coma since 1933?

                                 MAYER
                        Watch your tongue, Willy. I’m not 
                        as forgiving as Sam Goldwyn.

                                 WYLER
                        What are you so afraid of?--

                                 MAYER
                        Dammit Willy, that’s enough! We’re 
                        not at war with Germany!

           The two man are at a standoff. Mayer breaks the silence--

                                 MAYER (CONT’D)
                        Let’s take a walk.

           EXT. MGM LOT - MINUTES LATER

           Wyler and Mayer stroll around the studio lot. EXTRAS and CREW 
           mill about, noticing the two famous men as they walk past.

                                 MAYER
                        I came to this country with a fifth 
                        grade education. Wasn’t good 
                        looking. Wasn’t charming. I had no 
                        natural advantages. All I had was 
                        drive. And look at how this country 
                        rewarded me. Far greater than if 
                        I’d done exactly the same in any 
                        other nation on earth. We have a 
                        lot in common, Willy. We’re proof 
                        of what America can do.

           Wyler resists him. Mayer leads him to a bench. They sit.

                                 MAYER (CONT’D)
                              (conceding)
                        There’s no denying the awful 
                        treatment of German Jews under 
                        Hitler. I’d have left long ago. But 
                        so many have stayed, because they 
                        believe the dark times will pass. 
                        Germany is their country. Just as 
                        America is our country.

                                 WYLER
                        I’m not afraid of Senator Nye.
                                 MAYER
                        You should be. He’s smart. And 
                        relentless. And in the pockets of 
                        the Nazi government.

           Wyler can’t believe it.

                                 MAYER (CONT’D)
                        They’re watching us, Willy. 
                        Closely. They’re ready to paint us 
                        as Jewish war-mongers at the first 
                        opportunity. And that will only 
                        stoke anti-Semitism in our own 
                        country and make things worse for 
                        Jews around the world.

           Wyler takes it in.

                                 MAYER (CONT’D)
                              (moving closer to Wyler)
                        You want to make a picture that 
                        will help Americans sympathize with 
                        Britain, fine. But you cannot 
                        attack Germany. I won’t let you. 
                        For your own good.
                              (then)
                        Nazism will fade away on its own in 
                        due course.

           Wyler feels overwhelmed.

                                 WYLER
                        I don’t believe in censorship.

                                 MAYER
                        This isn’t censorship. It’s 
                        survival.

           INT. MGM SOUND STAGE - MRS. MINIVER SET - LATER THAT DAY

           Wyler approaches Garson, still in costume from the German 
           pilot scene. Milton stands nearby, eavesdropping. As he 
           speaks to Garson, Wyler notices Milton.

                                 WYLER
                        Greer -- I’m making some revisions--
                              (pained)
                        I’m cutting the German pilot scene.

           June, listening off to side, hangs her head.

           Milton smiles at Wyler, who nods politely in return.
           INT. MAYER’S OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Mayer sits quietly at his desk, staring out the window.

           EXT. MGM SOUND STAGE - MRS. MINIVER SET - LATER THAT DAY

           Wyler sits on a stoop, head in his hands, cigarette dangling 
           from his lips. Hilton sits next to him, scribbling on a pad.

                                 HILTON
                        It’s gonna be hard to write around 
                        that scene.

                                 WYLER
                              (short)
                        Well we have to, understand?

           Before Hilton can respond, Wyler spots Huston walking over--

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        Shit! Jim -- pretend I just told 
                        you something funny--

           Wyler lets rip a big fake laugh. Completely confused, Hilton 
           follows his lead.

           Huston is upon them. He sees through the charade.

                                 HUSTON
                        What’s so funny?

                                 HILTON
                              (accidently honest)
                        I don’t know.

                                 WYLER
                        Johnny -- I didn’t see you there! 
                        John Huston, this is my great 
                        friend, Jim Hilton.

                        The John Huston?! Your screenplay 
                        for Jezebel was perfection! I’m 
                        your biggest fan!--

           Wyler kicks Hilton to shut him up. Huston is amused.

                                 WYLER
                        How’s the picture?

                                 HUSTON
                        Great. Great. Yours?
                                 WYLER
                              (awkwardly)
                        Oh great. You know -- great.

                                 HUSTON
                        Thought I’d drop by your set. See 
                        if you wanted to grab a drink.

                                 WYLER
                        Oh -- well -- that sounds great--
                              (putting his arm around a 
                              surprised Hilton)
                        -- but Jimmy and I were going to 
                        grab a drink tonight -- go over 
                        some notes for Mrs. Miniver.

                                 HUSTON
                              (taking the hint)
                        I see.

                                 WYLER
                        Next time?

                                 HUSTON
                              (cold)
                        You bet.

           Huston walks off. Wyler watches him go, hating himself. He 
           wants to call Huston back, but doesn’t.

           INT. SUNSET STRIP BAR - NIGHT

           Wyler and Hilton sit at the bar. Wyler nurses a whiskey. 
           Hilton scribbles on a pad.

                                 WYLER
                        Scotch?

                                 HILTON
                        I don’t drink.

           Beaten down by life, Wyler stares aimlessly at his beverage.

                                 HILTON (CONT’D)
                              (innocently)
                        Think Mr. Huston would give me an 
                        autograph?

           Wyler would strangle Hilton if he had the strength.

           Suddenly, the door SWINGS open. An AGITATED MAN pops his head 
           in and yells at the BARTENDER.
                                 AGITATED MAN
                        Harry, better turn on the news -- 
                        the Nazis -- they’ve taken France!

           Wyler and Hilton are stunned. As is HARRY (the bartender). 
           Harry turns on the radio behind the bar--

                                 RADIO REPORTER (V.O.)
                        -- Paris has fallen--

           Wyler is distraught.

                                 RADIO REPORTER (V.O.)
                        -- Just two weeks into the Nazi 
                        invasion of France, the German 
                        blitzkrieg overwhelmed French, 
                        English, and Belgian troops. A 
                        desperate situation for the British 
                        as the Nazis have trapped them at 
                        Dunkirk, backs to the sea--

           The bartender shuts off the radio.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Fuckin’ European nonsense.
                              (to Wyler and Hilton)
                        Not our business, that’s what I 
                        say. America first, right?

           Wyler stares at him blankly, shaken to his core.

           EXT. MGM STUDIO ENTRANCE - DAY

           Talli drives up to the front gate. The GUARD recognizes her 
           and lets her through.

           INT. MGM LOT - MINUTES LATER

           Talli and June walk along a concrete lined “lake” dressed as 
           a European town waterfront. EXTRAS and CREW bustle about.

                                 JUNE
                        He doesn’t talk about France.

                                 TALLI
                        And the actors?

                                 JUNE
                        Eating them alive, as usual. Never 
                        articulates what he wants. Thinks 
                        it produces more authentic 
                        performances. Oddly, he’s right.
                                 TALLI
                        That’s not his only reason.

           June thinks this over, then moves on. With regret--

                                 JUNE
                        The deal with Breen was my idea. 
                        Now it’s blown up in our face--

                                 TALLI
                              (cuts her off)
                        This picture doesn’t happen if not 
                        for you.

           June appreciates the kind words. With hesitation--

                                 JUNE
                        I used to work for Selznick.

           Talli stops dead in her tracks and turns to June. After a 
           moment of reflection, she keeps moving.

                                 TALLI
                              (knowing smile)
                        I thought I recognized you.

                                 JUNE
                        You were a finalist for Scarlett 
                        O’Hara. Why’d you drop out?

                                 TALLI
                        Why’d you leave Selznick?

                                 JUNE
                        Mayer offered me VP of business 
                        affairs. He was the first studio 
                        exec to take me seriously. View me 
                        as more than a pretty face. Turns 
                        out a Harvard degree only takes a 
                        girl so far in this town.

                                 TALLI
                        In most towns, I’m afraid.

                                 JUNE
                        I know Mayer seems like a son-of-a-
                        bitch. But he’s full of surprises.
                              (beat)
                        Anyway, I need to hustle for the 
                        next five years or so. Then, 
                        hopefully, I’ll still be young 
                        enough to start a family.

           Talli stops and turns to June. Hand on her shoulder.
                                 TALLI
                        A woman’s choices are never easy. 

                                 JUNE
                              (thoughtful pause)
                        I know what they’re doing in 
                        Europe. And if it can happen there, 
                        it can happen here. If this movie 
                        can somehow change any of that, the 
                        least I can do is work late hours.

           Talli nods with admiration. They walk on.

                                 TALLI
                        I’ll talk to Willy. Cheer him up. 
                        Try to get Miniver back on course.
                              (big smile)
                        I’m very glad you called me today.

           June smiles back.

           INT. MGM SOUND STAGE - MRS. MINIVER SET - LATER

           Wyler bullies Garson and Pidgeon, while a FEMALE MAKEUP 
           ARTIST applies mascara to Garson’s eyelashes.

                                 WYLER
                        Christ, Walter -- just be better!

                                 PIDGEON
                        I need direction, Willy! How am I 
                        supposed to know how to act?

                                 WYLER
                        Dammit, Walter! Try acting like a 
                        goddamn human being!
                              (impatient, to makeup 
                              artist)
                        Please, by all means, take all day! 
                        It’s okay -- we’ll live forever!

                                 ARTIST
                              (panicking)
                        Sorry, Mr. Wyler.

                                 GARSON
                              (stepping in)
                        Willy, she’s doing the best she 
                        can. My makeup takes time. I’m 
                        supposed to look old enough to have 
                        a twenty-year old son.
                                 WYLER
                        You don’t need that much makeup.
                              (mean-spirited)
                        Everyone knows you look old for 
                        your age.

           Garson’s mouth drops at the remark. She’s about to tear up, 
           but she composes herself--

                                 GARSON
                              (calmly)
                        You’re a real asshole, Willy.

           Garson storms off. Pidgeon follows her. Leaving Wyler alone, 
           staring at an empty set, fuming. Angry. Mostly at himself.

           In a fit of frustration, Wyler picks up his director’s chair 
           and THROWS it at the set, BREAKING it into pieces. He tries 
           to stop himself from going further, but now that the dam has 
           broken, Wyler EXPLODES with pent-up emotion. He picks up 
           various set pieces and props and destroys them -- KICKING, 
           TEARING, SLAMMING things down -- out of control. He 
           pulverizes the set.

           Finally, sweating, panting, Wyler regains his composure. He 
           studies his destroyed set, shocked at what he’s done.

           He looks up to see his crew staring at him, in stunned 
           silence. He’s embarrassed and ashamed.

           CORNER OF SET

           Talli and June witnessed everything. Talli’s overcome with 
           shock and disappointment. She turns to June--

                                 TALLI
                        I wasn’t here.

           Talli quickly walks off.

           INT. WAITING ROOM - OUTSIDE MAYER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Wyler stands in the waiting area, staring out a window.

           June exits Mayer’s office and approaches. Wyler awaits her 
           news, impatiently. She shakes her head in the negative.

                                 JUNE
                        He won’t see you.

           Wyler nods, understanding.
                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Suspended. Two weeks. No pay.

           Wyler takes it on the chin, feeling he deserves it.

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                              (with hesitation)
                        There’s more.

                                 WYLER
                        I can’t wait.

                                 JUNE
                              (delicately)
                        He’s not happy with the footage 
                        he’s seen. He thinks the picture 
                        isn’t working.

                                 WYLER
                              (frustrated)
                        That’s because it’s not.

                                 JUNE
                        When you get back, he wants to 
                        discuss maybe pulling the plug.

           Wyler nods and hangs his head in defeat.

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Willy. I still believe 
                        in you.

                                 WYLER
                        That makes one of us.

           INT. NYE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Nye holds court, seducing the FAMILY VALUES LOBBY.

           Henry (Nye’s aide), interrupts them. He whispers something in 
           Nye’s ear which causes the Senator to grin wide.

           INT. WYLER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Talli lays alone in bed, eyes open, unable to sleep.

           She hears footsteps downstairs, making their way to the 
           bedroom. She closes her eyes, pretending to sleep, as Wyler 
           tiptoes into the room.

           He slides into bed with her, without saying anything. He 
           rolls away from her, pretending to quickly fall asleep.
           She opens her eyes, distressed.

           EXT. BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT

           Oscar night. Glitz. Glamour. Flashbulbs.

           Wyler and Talli exit a limo and walk the red carpet. They 
           don’t hold hands. They look like strangers.

           INT. BILTMORE BOWL BALLROOM (BILTMORE HOTEL) - MINUTES LATER

           Wyler and Talli eat dinner at their table, watching the Oscar 
           ceremony. They both look uncomfortable, stressed.

           Finally -- the award for Outstanding Production. DAVID O. 
           SELZNICK finishes announcing the nominees--

                                 SELZNICK
                        And the Oscar goes to--

           Selznick opens the envelope and prepares to read the winner--

                                 SELZNICK (CONT’D)
                        -- How Green Was My Valley!

           INT. WYLER’S LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Wyler and Talli quietly enter the house. They do not speak or 
           even look at each other.

           He walks to the liquor cabinet and pours a drink. She hangs 
           up her coat.

                                 WYLER
                              (defeated)
                        I never should have left that 
                        picture. Walked away from an Oscar 
                        and for what? At this rate, I’ll 
                        never be up on that podium.

                                 TALLI
                        Maybe you don’t deserve to be.

                                 WYLER
                              (shocked)
                        Excuse me?

                                 TALLI
                              (standing firm)
                        You heard me.
                                 WYLER
                        Whose side are you on?

                                 TALLI
                              (angry)
                        I might ask you the same thing.

           Talli’s combativeness catches Wyler off guard.

                                 TALLI (CONT’D)
                        Why exactly are you making Mrs. 
                        Miniver?

           He hesitates.

                                 TALLI (CONT’D)
                        Are you aware of what’s going on in 
                        Europe? To your people?

                                 WYLER
                        Of course I’m aware--

                                 TALLI
                        Then what the hell are you gonna do 
                        about it?!

           Wyler EXPLODES--

                                 WYLER
                        What do you want me to tell you?! 
                        That I’m afraid of never working in 
                        this town again?! That I’m afraid 
                        of pushing too hard in support for 
                        the war because people will say 
                        it’s cause I’m an immigrant Jew?! 
                        I’ve spent twenty years in this 
                        country working my ass off to prove 
                        I belong -- that I’m an American. 
                        And now it could all go away!

           Now Talli is caught off guard.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        You’ve seen the polls. Americans 
                        don’t care about what’s happening 
                        to England or France, much less the 
                        Jews of Europe.

                                 TALLI
                        They would care if they really knew 
                        what was happening. If they knew 
                        the suffering. You can show them. 
                                 WYLER
                        I can’t! That’s the point! Mayer 
                        and Breen will never allow it! So I 
                        have to thread this impossible 
                        needle of subtlety and nuance and 
                        it’s just not working! The picture 
                        doesn’t work! Besides, you listen 
                        to the news. France has been taken. 
                        Britain is on the run. The war is 
                        over! Germany won! What the hell’s 
                        the point of making a shitty 
                        picture aimed at getting America 
                        into the war, when the god damn war 
                        is over anyway?!

           Wyler hurls his glass at the wall, shattering it. From 
           another room, baby Catherine starts to cry.

           Talli starts to leave, but turns back around--

                                 TALLI
                        A great man I knew used to say, 
                        “there’s nothing you can’t do on 
                        film. All you’ve got to do is 
                        figure out how.”

                                 WYLER
                              (defeated)
                        What would you have me do?

           Talli pauses a moment, then hits Wyler with his own advice.

                                 TALLI
                        Be better.

           Talli exits, leaving Wyler searching for a response--

                                 WYLER
                        Well, your meatloaf tastes like 
                        sandpaper!

           No response. Wyler is alone. More than he’s ever been.

           EXT. BEVERLY HILLS STREETS - NIGHT

           Wyler recklessly RACES down neighborhood streets on his 
           motorcycle. Barely dodging several angry, honking DRIVERS.

           EXT. GRIFFITH PARK TRAIL - NIGHT

           Wyler leans against his bike, drinking out of a paper bag.
           He looks up at the giant iconic “Hollywoodland” sign, 
           towering over him. Lost in thought.

           INT. WARNER BROTHERS SOUND STAGE - MALTESE FALCON SET - NIGHT

           After hours. The room is dark, save for a few overhead lights 
           illuminating a pair of wooden chairs.

           Huston sits alone, staring at his set, doubt in his eyes.

           He walks to the stage and puts his hand on a conspicuous prop 
           -- a foot high black statuette of a bird, perched on a table.

           He hears footsteps behind him. He turns to see Wyler, 
           stepping into a sliver of light. 

           They exchange a long look. Brothers. No words necessary.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD CANYON ROAD - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Wyler and Huston sit in the grass, laughing. Huston smokes 
           his customary cigar. The Hollywoodland sign glows above.

                                 WYLER
                              (turning reflective)
                        What kind of a world did I bring my 
                        daughter into? Hitler. Mussolini. 
                        It’s a descent into madness. Maybe 
                        Nietszche was right -- god is dead.

                                 HUSTON
                        I prefer to think he’s just drunk.

           Wyler laughs weakly.

                                 HUSTON (CONT’D)
                        I had to go my own way.

                                 WYLER
                        I know.

                                 HUSTON
                        Making Miniver -- that took balls. 
                        Big ones.

                                 WYLER
                        I’ve boxed myself into a corner. 
                        Played things too safe. Thalberg 
                        must be laughing his ass off.

           Huston feels for his friend.
                                 HUSTON
                        Remember Winter’s Eve? The director 
                        had that awful idea to shoot in the 
                        actual snow. Everyone’s getting 
                        hypothermia, so the crew pretends 
                        its equipment is frozen to persuade 
                        him to go back to the lot. But 
                        nothing worked. Until this clever 
                        young AD hatched a bolder plan. And 
                        locked the director in a closet.

                                 WYLER
                        The scene was filmed in the snow  
                        anyway and I was fired. I failed. I 
                        was reckless.

                                 HUSTON
                        Fearless. There’s a difference.

           Wyler sighs heavily.

                                 WYLER
                        If I take on Mayer and Breen and 
                        fail, my career is over.

                                 HUSTON
                              (after a reflective pause)
                        Yes.

           Wyler takes it in, the weight of the world on his shoulders.

           INT. WYLER’S PARLOR - NIGHT

           Wyler leans back in an arm chair in front of a fire. On a 
           side table, his binder of Miniver notes from the Hays Office.

           Wyler listens to WINSTON CHURCHILL speak on BBC radio.

                                 CHURCHILL (O.S.)
                        -- What General Weygand called the 
                        Battle of France is over. I expect 
                        that the Battle of Britain is about 
                        to begin. Upon this battle depends 
                        the survival of Christian 
                        civilization. Upon it depends our 
                        own British life, and the long 
                        continuity of our institutions and 
                        our Empire--

           We close on Wyler, as he listens carefully.
                                 CHURCHILL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        -- But if we fail, then the whole 
                        world, including the United States, 
                        including all that we have known 
                        and cared for, will sink into the 
                        abyss of a new Dark Age made more 
                        sinister, and perhaps more 
                        protracted, by the lights of 
                        perverted science. Let us therefore 
                        brace ourselves to our duties, and 
                        so bear ourselves that, if the 
                        British Empire and its Commonwealth 
                        last for a thousand years, men will 
                        still say, "this was their finest 
                        hour."

           Wyler makes his decision.

           He picks up the binder and tosses it into the fire.

           INT. MGM SOUND STAGE - MRS. MINIVER SET - DAY

           Wyler walks tentatively through the door. Still embarrassed. 
           Everyone turns to him, a quick silence falling over the set.

           He goes to Garson, who chats with Pidgeon by craft service.

                                 WYLER
                        Your performance in this film has 
                        been nothing short of remarkable.

           Garson examines him with great skepticism.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        Especially considering your 
                        director is an ass.

           Garson can’t help but crack a smile. Pidgeon too.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        You both have every right to hate 
                        my guts, but if you’ll humor me, I 
                        have a favor to ask.

           Garson and Pidgeon look at each other, puzzled.

           INT. EMPTY MGM STAGE - LATER THAT DAY

           Hilton and Kress walk hurriedly toward a semi-hidden door.

                                 HILTON
                        What’s this all about?
                                 KRESS
                        Beats me.

           They open the door and walk inside, to find a barren room 
           containing Wyler, Garson, Pidgeon, and SEVERAL OTHER CAST.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Minutes later, Wyler addresses the clandestine group. June is 
           by his side. The two exchange a knowing nod. Then--

                                 WYLER
                        What I say cannot leave this room. 
                        It must be kept from Mayer. It must 
                        be kept from Breen. It must be kept 
                        from all their associates. Agreed?

           Unsure of what’s happening, the group looks around at each 
           other. Then, one by one, slowly nods in agreement.

           For the first time in a while, Wyler smiles.

           INT. NYE’S SENATE OFFICE - TELEGRAPH ROOM - DAY

           The rapid RATTLING of telegraph copy going to print.

           Close on Henry, who reads the incoming message.

                                 HENRY
                        Oh shit.

           NYE’s INTERIOR OFFICE

           Nye stands behind his desk. Tall and imposing. He reads the 
           telegraph to himself. Processing its several pages.

           Wheeler and Henry sit across from him, bracing themselves.

                                 NYE
                        I don’t understand. Who approved 
                        these new Miniver script pages? 
                        How’d this get past Breen?

                                 WHEELER
                              (shrugging)
                        We’re looking into it.

                                 NYE
                              (reading)
                        “I don't know what this country's 
                        coming to. No wonder Germany’s 
                        arming.”
                              (perplexed)
                                 (MORE)
                                 NYE (CONT'D)
                        How’d that sneak in? What page is 
                        that on?

                                 HENRY
                              (nervously)
                        Page one, sir.

           Nye turns red in anger, the veins on his forehead throbbing.

                                 NYE
                              (calm, but with menace)
                        Get Breen on the phone now.

           Henry runs out the door to make the call.

                                 NYE (CONT’D)
                              (with venom)
                        Tell him to shut this picture down!

           INT. MGM SOUNDSTAGE - MRS. MINIVER SET - DAY

           Close on Hilton on the phone.

                                 HILTON
                        Yes, unfortunately Ms. Garson is 
                        still suffering from strep throat, 
                        so we had to shut down production 
                        two more days.
                              (listening)
                        Yes, sir -- I’ll call you then.

           Hilton hangs up.

           We see Wyler and Garson standing next to Hilton. Hilton nods 
           to Wyler who nods back, pleased.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - MILTON’S HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Milton sits in bed, wearing unforgivable pajamas, holding his 
           phone receiver. He hangs it up and rolls over, back to sleep.

           INT. MGM SOUNDSTAGE - MRS. MINIVER SET - LATER THAT DAY

           Wyler directs Garson and Dantine in a reworked pilot scene. 

                                 GARSON
                        The war won’t last forever.
                                 DANTINE
                              (menacing)
                        No. Soon we finish it. You will 
                        see. We will come. We will bomb 
                        your cities! Like Barcelona! 
                        Warsaw! Narvik! Rotterdam!

           Wyler watches closely, thrilled with the new material. 

                                 GARSON
                        Innocent people. Women and 
                        children.

                                 DANTINE
                        Thirty-two thousand in two hours. 
                        And we will do the same thing here!

           Garson slaps Dantine hard across the face. Wyler’s overjoyed.

           Suddenly, the stage door BURSTS open. Mannix enters, slowly, 
           methodically. Flanked by two seedy-looking GOONS. Underneath 
           a shadowy bowler hat, Mannix wears a most unfriendly face.

           June emerges from a corner of the set, a lump in her throat. 
           She slides over toward Wyler, who is increasingly unsettled.

                                 WYLER
                        Uh oh.

           Mannix is suddenly in front of them. His eyes bear into 
           Wyler, commanding the director to follow him.

           Wyler had been feeling brave recently. Until now.

           INT. HALLWAY (MGM OFFICES) - MINUTES LATER

           Wyler and June follow Mannix down the hallway to Mayer’s 
           office, like prisoners being led to their executioner.

           INT. MAYER’S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

           Wyler and June sit across from Mayer, who has never looked 
           more intimidating. Mannix is by his side.

                                 MAYER
                        Did I not clearly explain that we 
                        are not at war with Germany?

                                 WYLER
                              (trying to exude 
                              confidence)
                        You did, sir.
                                 MAYER
                        Did I not forbid anything offensive 
                        to Germany in this picture?

                                 WYLER
                              (increasingly nervous)
                        You did, sir. But--

           Mayer holds up his hand, ordering Wyler to keep silent. Mayer 
           has the answers he wanted. He turns to Mannix and nods.

           Mannix holds up a sheet of paper for Wyler to see. It reads: 
           This room is bugged. Nod if you understand.

           Shocked, Wyler turns to Mayer who eagerly awaits his 
           response. Wyler nods.

                                 MAYER
                              (continuing the 
                              performance)
                        Any scene you film that is anti-
                        Nazi will never make it into this 
                        picture. Do you understand?

           Mannix flips the page. This one reads: Keep doing what you’re 
           doing. Do you understand?

                                 WYLER
                        I understand.

                                 MAYER
                        This is your final warning.

           Mannix flips the page: Thank you.

                                 WYLER
                              (holding back a smile)
                        Thank you, sir.

                                 MAYER
                        Now leave.

           Wyler quickly gets up and walks out.

           June is befuddled. She turns to Mayer, in search of an 
           explanation. Mayer shoots her a wink and smile.

           EXT. NYE’S SENATE OFFICE - NIGHT

           Nye stands, staring out his office window at the Capitol 
           lawn, coldly focused. Wheeler sits, reading a document.
                                 WHEELER
                        The studios are emboldened by the 
                        President. By Lend-Lease.
                              (reading aloud)
                        MGM, Goldwyn, Warner Brothers--

           Nye turns to Wheeler with an icy stare. Wheeler takes the 
           hint and stops reading the list of offenders.

                                 WHEELER (CONT’D)
                              (trying to be positive)
                        Most Americans still think we 
                        should stay out of the war. But the 
                        numbers are dropping fast. 
                        Americans are starting to 
                        sympathize with the Brits.

           Nye looks out his office window, steaming.

                                 NYE
                        Roosevelt thinks he’s so damn 
                        clever. Shipping free war material 
                        to Britain isn’t neutrality, it’s a 
                        license to wage an undeclared war!

                                 WHEELER
                        He’s given Hollywood cover.

                                 NYE
                        Amazing how their pictures never 
                        reveal American sons writhing in 
                        agony in trenches. Or living 
                        legless, lungless, brainless, 
                        sightless in hospitals. This 
                        European war is not worthy of the 
                        sacrifice of one American mule, 
                        much less one American son!

                                 WHEELER
                        How do we win a PR campaign against 
                        the President? He’s the most 
                        popular public figure in America.

           A light bulb goes off in Nye’s head. He smiles.

                                 NYE
                        No, he’s not.

           EXT. STAGE - CAUMSETT STATE PARK - LONG ISLAND, NY - DAY

           CHARLES LINDBERGH (38, handsome, blonde, blue-eyed, All-
           American) addresses an adoring AUDIENCE OF WEALTHY PATRONS at 
           a state fair on the grounds of a vast manor estate.
                                 LINDBERGH
                        -- flying Northeast along the 
                        coast, I headed out over the 
                        Atlantic--
                              (dramatic pause)
                        -- with only a magnetic compass, an 
                        airspeed indicator, and a little 
                        luck to navigate me to Ireland.

           Awestruck, the crowd “oohs” and “ahhs.”

           BEHIND THE STAGE AREA

           Lindbergh gabs with a few of his wealthier SYCOPHANTS.

                                 SYCOPHANT 1
                        You’d beat Roosevelt if you ran!

                                 SYCOPHANT 2
                        Warmongering traitor!

                                 LINDBERGH
                              (always on)
                        Gentlemen, gentlemen -- that’s very 
                        kind -- but as I’ve assured you, 
                        I’ve no plans to run for President.

                                 SYCOPHANT 3
                              (wink)
                        No plans yet!

           They all laugh, as Henry (Nye’s aide), appears backstage--

                                 HENRY
                        Mr. Charles Lindbergh?

                                 LINDBERGH
                              (smugly)
                        How may I be of service?

           Henry whispers something in Lindbergh’s ear. We cannot hear  
           it, but whatever it is, Lindbergh’s intrigued.

           INT. WYLER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Wyler bounces through the front door, happier than we’ve seen 
           him. He holds a bouquet of flowers.

                                 WYLER
                        Talli! We’re going out! You won’t 
                        believe what Mayer did today!

           No answer. No sign of Talli. Or Catherine.
           DINING ROOM

           Wyler enters--

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        Talli?

           He reads a note on the dining room table: Gone to my mother’s

           Wyler’s heart sinks.

           INT. MODEST ROW HOUSE - WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA - NIGHT

           Talli sits at a kitchen table, drinking wine alone. She hears 
           a strange sound outside. She goes to the window.

           EXT. ROW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Bathed in moonlight, Wyler stands below the window, 
           serenading her with a violin.

           All his heart and soul go into this concert. The playing 
           isn’t perfect, but he’s trying his hardest.

           She gazes at him lovingly. The man she fell in love with.

           EXT. ROW HOUSE DOORWAY - MINUTES LATER

           Wyler pleads with Talli.

                                 WYLER
                        Come home.

                                 TALLI
                              (smiling knowingly)
                        Willy, I only came to my mother’s 
                        for dinner.

           Wyler smiles back. They laugh. Hard.

           INT. WYLER’S LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Wyler and Talli sit on the floor in front of a warm fire. 
           Drinking wine and listening to jazz on the radio. Suddenly--

                                 WYLER
                        Carl Laemmle was my uncle.

           Stunned, Talli turns off the music. Before she can ask--
                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        I never told you cause I was 
                        embarrassed. By what I’d done.
                              (then)
                        I was nineteen when he paid for me 
                        to come to the States to work for 
                        Universal. I’d never left Europe. 
                        Barely ever left Alsace-Lorraine.

           Talli listens intently.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        Irving Thalberg was his right-hand 
                        man. Thought I was a bum. That all 
                        I did was drink and gamble and take 
                        advantage of my uncle’s generosity.
                              (turning to her)
                        He was right, of course.
                              (then)
                        He tagged me “Jailbird Willy.” And 
                        Laemmle told me if I didn’t shape 
                        up, I’d never amount to anything. 
                        I’ve been trying to prove those two 
                        men wrong for twenty years.
                              (with regret)
                        As soon as my reputation as a young 
                        director grew, I left Universal for  
                        Goldwyn. Carl felt betrayed. We 
                        didn’t speak for years.

                                 TALLI
                              (comforting him)
                        You were young.

                                 WYLER
                        If it wasn’t for Uncle Carl, I’d be 
                        just another over-the-hill Jew 
                        living on the border between France 
                        and Germany. How would that be 
                        working out for me right now?
                              (Talli need not respond)
                        I owe everything I have in life to 
                        Carl Laemmle. But the damn old man 
                        went to his grave before I could 
                        thank him.

           Talli holds Wyler tighter. His face deep in thought.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - US SENATE BUILDING - DAY

           Nye chairs a meeting of two dozen OLD WHITE MEN in suits. 
           Wheeler sits at his side. The only young face in the room is 
           the charismatic Lindbergh.
                                 NYE
                        Morality and prudence dictate the 
                        United States avoid being drawn 
                        into this new European war at any 
                        cost. This is the sacred cause of--

           Nye holds up a pamphlet with a fancy logo on the front.

                                 NYE (CONT’D)
                        -- the America First Committee.

           A rousing round of applause.

                                 WHEELER
                        With Mr. Lindbergh as our spokesman 
                        and us working behind the scenes--

                                 LINDBERGH
                              (interrupting with gusto)
                        Nazi victory is certain. America's 
                        attention should be placed 
                        elsewhere. Germany is our friend.

           Nye and Wheeler are impressed by Lindbergh’s conviction.

                                 LINDBERGH (CONT’D)
                        America, Britain, and Germany must 
                        realize we share the same 
                        interests. We must preserve that 
                        most priceless possession, our 
                        inheritance of European blood.
                              (then)
                        The Jews will not drag us to war.

           Smattering of applause. A few disconcerted faces.

           Nye looks most displeased.

           INT. NYE’S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

           Nye, Wheeler, and Lindbergh congratulate themselves.

                                 LINDBERGH
                        Good meeting, gents.

                                 WHEELER
                        Very.

           They both seek Nye’s approval, but the Senator withholds it.

                                 LINDBERGH
                              (to Nye, cocky)
                        You ever smile or what?
                                 NYE
                        Cut out the Jewish shit.

                                 LINDBERGH
                              (pushing back)
                        We can never talk about the Jewish 
                        problem in this country?

                                 NYE
                              (angry)
                        You want to be President one day? 
                        Then listen to me very carefully. 
                        We all know who the real problem in 
                        this country is. Say it with 
                        innuendo if you must. Say it with 
                        insinuation. But mention the Jews 
                        by name again and you risk 
                        everything we’ve worked for. And 
                        then you’ll have to answer to me.

           Scared of Nye, Lindbergh nods sheepishly in agreement.

           EXT. AMERICA FIRST COMMITTEE RALLY - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

           Lindbergh delivers a fiery speech to a crowd of thousands.

                                 LINDBERGH
                        France has been defeated; and it is 
                        now obvious that England is losing 
                        the war. But they have one last 
                        desperate plan remaining.
                              (pause for effect)
                        They hope to persuade us to send 
                        another American Expeditionary 
                        Force to Europe, and to share 
                        militarily, and financially, the 
                        fiasco of this war!

           Raucous, angry boos from the crowd.

           BACKSTAGE

           Nye and Wheeler watch from the wings. Nye is pleased. SENATOR 
           CLARK approaches.

                                 CLARK
                        Great work here, gentlemen.

                                 NYE
                        Senator Clark, have you made the 
                        necessary arrangements?
                                 CLARK
                        The resolution is prepared. If 
                        Ambassador Kennedy can’t get 
                        Hollywood to do this the easy way, 
                        then we’ll do it the hard way.

                                 WHEELER
                              (to Nye, concerned)
                        But Gerald, I thought we agreed it 
                        would be too dangerous to--

                                 NYE
                              (coldly cutting him off)
                        We agreed to nothing.

           Sensing tension, Clark leaves them.

                                 WHEELER
                        I have an election coming up.

           Nye shoots daggers at Wheeler.

                                 NYE
                        Don’t ever let me hear you put 
                        politics above principle again.

           Wheeler shrinks, nervous about what he’s gotten himself into.

           BACK TO LINDBERGH

                                 LINDBERGH
                              (with passion)
                        There are many interventionists in 
                        America--

           Nye pays close attention to Lindbergh’s choice of words.

                                 LINDBERGH (CONT’D)
                        -- but there are more people among 
                        us of a different type.
                              (pause for applause)
                        And we demand faith in an 
                        independent American destiny. This 
                        is the policy of the America First 
                        Committee today. A policy not of 
                        isolation, but of independence; not 
                        of defeat, but of courage!

           Violent applause. The building shakes.

           A “Lindbergh” chant RISES from the crowd. Backstage, Nye 
           couldn’t be happier.
           EXT. MGM FRONT GATE - DAY

           AMERICA FIRST PROTESTORS block the entrance to the studio, 
           jeering and booing at STUDIO EMPLOYEES who try to sneak past.

           Wyler pulls up on his motorcycle, looking for a way in. He 
           drives around to the back of the lot.

           INT. MAYER’S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

           Mayer, Mannix, and June talk with Breen, Milton, and a POLICE 
           CHIEF. Wyler storms in--

                                 WYLER
                        I can’t get on my set.
                              (surprised to see Breen)
                        What the hell is going on?

                                 BREEN
                        The crowds are too dangerous. I’m 
                        shutting your picture down -- for 
                        your own safety.

           Wyler can’t believe it. He’s boiling over.

                                 WYLER
                              (moving toward Breen)
                        You son-of-a-bitch.

           Mayer raises his hand to Wyler, signaling him to stand down.

                                 MAYER
                        It’s temporary.

                                 WYLER
                        Till when?!

                                 POLICE CHIEF
                        Till I say so.

           Breen wears a smug look on his face. Wyler would like to 
           punch it off.

           INT. BALLROOM - WARNER BROTHERS STUDIOS - NIGHT

           Ambassador JOSEPH KENNEDY addresses a dining room so packed 
           with studio executives, it’s standing room only.

           In the wings, his sons JOE KENNEDY JR. and JACK KENNEDY (both 
           early 20s) listen on.

           Wyler, Mayer, and June stand in the back, watching.
                                 KENNEDY
                        Gentlemen, I speak to you tonight 
                        as a lover of motion pictures. As a 
                        former colleague. As a friend.

           Dead silence.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT’D)
                        As our nation’s Ambassador to Great 
                        Britain, I’m intimately familiar 
                        with the events in Europe. Of the 
                        interests of England and Germany. 
                        It is my most sincere opinion that 
                        the United States should limit aid 
                        to Britain in case the Nazis win 
                        the war -- an event I think likely.

           The crowd is on edge.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT’D)
                        I know many in this room hold 
                        animosity for the Nazi regime for -- 
                        personal reasons. However, for your 
                        own sake, I fervently ask you to 
                        stop making anti-Nazi pictures or 
                        using the film medium to promote or 
                        show sympathy to the cause of 
                        England versus Germany. Such 
                        pictures do more harm than good 
                        because they highlight Jewish 
                        control of the movies.

           Uncomfortable murmurs in the crowd.

           Backstage, Jack Kennedy winces at his father.

                                 KENNEDY (CONT’D)
                        Many Anglos blame the war on the 
                        Jews and anti-Semitism is on the 
                        rise in Britain. I advise you all -- 
                        for your own safety -- stop making 
                        these pictures immediately and get 
                        those Jewish names off the screen.

           Complete silence. The executives are speechless. And scared.

           INT. MAYER’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Mayer works at his desk. He sits in the dark, the only sliver 
           of light coming from the exterior office.

           Suddenly, a shadow covers the room in darkness.
           Mayer looks up. In the door -- a male silhouette. The shadowy 
           figure flips on the office light.

           It’s Nye.

                                 NYE
                        You look like hell.

           Mayer doesn’t respond. He watches the Senator take a seat.

                                 NYE (CONT’D)
                        I’m tired of fighting, LB.

                                 MAYER
                        Are we fighting?

           EXTERIOR OFFICE

           Wyler walks through toward Mayer’s inner sanctum. He hears 
           Mayer and Nye talking. He stops and eaves drops at the door.

           INTERIOR OFFICE

                                 NYE
                              (smug)
                        Senator Clark is preparing an 
                        investigation into war propaganda 
                        in motion pictures.
                              (dramatic pause)
                        I told him he was being rash, of 
                        course. Told him I was sure we 
                        could work something out.

                                 MAYER
                        You’re a man of honor.

                                 NYE
                        You’ve been against Mrs. Miniver
                        from the beginning. You know the 
                        picture’s reckless. Why not just 
                        shut it down?

                                 MAYER
                              (lying)
                        Too much money invested. My 
                        shareholders would revolt.

                                 NYE
                        Wyler’s a petulant child. You have 
                        to be the adult in the room.

                                 MAYER
                              (challenging)
                        Do I?
                                 NYE
                              (cold)
                        Senate investigations can be ugly 
                        things.

                                 MAYER
                        I have nothing to hide.

                                 NYE
                        MGM invested millions in German 
                        armament to bypass currency export 
                        restrictions. You signed the deal.

           Mayer’s turns a sickly pale.

                                 NYE (CONT’D)
                        Do I have your attention now?

           Wyler is stunned. He can’t believe it.

                                 NYE (CONT’D)
                        Shut down the anti-Nazi pictures. 
                        All of them.

                                 MAYER
                        Even if I did, there’s still Warner 
                        Brothers, Paramount--

                                 NYE
                        You’re the biggest fish. Whatever 
                        you do, the others will follow.
                              (then)
                        I’ll be back tomorrow. 8am. Give me 
                        your answer then.

           INT. MGM - EMPTY SOUNDSTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Wyler and Mayer sit on stools in a corner.

                                 MAYER
                        We didn’t know what the Nazis would 
                        become. We just didn’t know. It’s 
                        the biggest regret of my life.

                                 WYLER
                              (forgiving)
                        We were all blind -- for too long. 
                        That’s why we can’t back down now.

                                 MAYER
                        A Senate investigation could 
                        destroy MGM. This isn’t about you 
                        and me, Willy. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAYER (CONT'D)
                        This is about every man, woman and 
                        child who depends on MGM for a 
                        paycheck.

                                 WYLER
                        This is about right and wrong.

           June enters the soundstage and speed walks toward them. She 
           carries a notepad.

                                 JUNE
                        What’s the urgency?

                                 MAYER
                        Call the board. Tonight. I need 
                        their opinion on something. Off the 
                        record. Don’t keep minutes.

           June looks at them, quizzically.

                                 WYLER
                              (to Mayer, angry)
                        You chicken shit.

           Wyler storms off. Mayer is ashamed, but steadfast.

           EXT. MAYER’S OFFICE - DAWN

           Mayer stands on the lush MGM lawn, watching the STUDIO 
           WORKERS tend to their mundane daily tasks. June approaches 
           and hands him a note. He reads it.

                                 JUNE
                        The board will do whatever you 
                        think is best.

           Mayer nods in understanding and puts the note in his pocket. 
           His face reveals that’s not what he wanted to hear.

           It all rests on him now.

           INT. MAYER’S OFFICE - 8AM

           Mayer and June work at their desks. Mannix flanks Mayer. A 
           SECRETARY appears in the doorway.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Senator Nye to see you--

           Mayer waves his hand as a signal to let Nye in.

           Close on Mayer as he contemplates what to tell Nye.
           Nye enters, with his usual arrogant swagger.

                                 NYE
                        Morning, LB. Have an answer for me?

           Mayer pauses for a long beat, taking a hard look at Nye. June 
           and Mannix are breathless as they wait for his response.

                                 MAYER
                              (deliberately)
                        Yeah. Go fuck yourself.

           June grins wide. If possible, Mannix grins wider.

           From a side door, Wyler enters, radiating confidence. He 
           stands behind Mayer and flashes Nye a hard look.

           A long cold exchange. Both men understand. This is war.

           Nye smiles. A diabolical smile.

                                 NYE
                              (to Wyler)
                        I can’t wait to watch you burn.

           Nye rushes out of the office.

           June and Mannix congratulate Mayer.

           But Wyler and the old mogul resist celebration. They lock 
           eyes, worried about what they’ve just done.

           EXT. CAPITOL HILL - WASHINGTON DC - DAY

           Nye addresses a hoard of rabid reporters.

                                 NYE
                        The eight major film companies in 
                        Hollywood have taken advantage of 
                        their access to the American people 
                        to promote involvement in a war 
                        that is none of America’s concern.
                              (pause for effect)
                        This treason ends today. This 
                        morning, the Interstate Commerce 
                        Committee appointed a five-person 
                        panel to investigate war propaganda 
                        in Hollywood films--

           INT. CAPITOL HILL HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

           Nye and Clark talk, shadowed in a dark corner.
                                 NYE
                        Good work pushing this hearing 
                        through committee, Senator. I’ll 
                        make sure you’re rewarded.

                                 CLARK
                        Don’t reward me yet. We still need  
                        a victory at the hearing.

           Nye laughs, finding Clark naive.

                                 NYE
                        Silly man. Don’t you see? The 
                        hearing is the victory.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BILTMORE HOTEL - DAY

           The most powerful men in Hollywood sit around an oak table. 
           Goldwyn, Selznick, HARRY WARNER, JACK WARNER, DARRYL ZANUCK, 
           HARRY COHN, BARNEY BALABAN, WILL HAYS, and other EXECUTIVES.

                                 COHN
                              (whispers to Selznick)
                        Where’s our mystery lawyer?

           Selznick shrugs.

           OUTSIDE THE ROOM

           Wyler and Mayer approach the door.

                                 MAYER
                              (whispering)
                        Remember -- we’re just here to see 
                        which way the wind’s blowing. Don’t 
                        say a word.

           INSIDE THE ROOM

           Mayer slides into the room trying to go unseen. Wyler trails. 
           They sit at a far corner of the table.

           Goldwyn notices them. He shoots Wyler a dirty look.

           Hays opens the meeting.

                                 HAYS
                        Gentlemen, this morning I accepted 
                        Joseph Breen’s resignation as chief 
                        censor of my office.

           The room buzzes; surprised and pleased. Hays is somber.
                                 HAYS (CONT’D)
                        Our industry is under attack.
                              (thoughtful pause)
                        We must be united. Or the attack 
                        may be fatal.

           Wyler and Goldwyn exchange a glance. Each wondering if they 
           can bury the hatchet. The moguls look at each other, everyone 
           hesitant to speak first. Then--

                                 EXECUTIVE 1
                        We should just deny Hollywood’s 
                        trying to influence opinion on the 
                        war issue. If we stick to that line 
                        -- how can they prove otherwise?

           A low rumble of agreement around the room. Then--

                                 WYLER
                        That’s the wrong approach.

           Attention turns to Wyler. Hays shifts. Mayer isn’t happy.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        It would be a mistake to pull our 
                        punches in any manner whatsoever.

                            HAYS
                                                       EXECUTIVE 2
           What do you suggest?
                                              Is that “Jailbird Willy?”--

                                 MAYER
                        Please excuse young Mr. Wyler--

                                 WYLER
                        We go at this with bare knuckles. 
                        Blast the committee from the start 
                        as a pack of Nazi smear artists.

           Mayer feels a coronary coming on due to Wyler’s brashness.

                                 WILKIE
                              (storming into the room)
                        Mr. Wyler is absolutely right.

           The executives are shocked at the appearance of former 
           Presidential candidate WENDELL WILKIE (49) as their counsel. 
           All stand out of respect as he enters and slams a briefcase 
           down on the table.

                                 HAYS
                        Mr. Wilkie needs no introduction.

           Hays retreats and lets Wilkie take over.
                                 WILKIE
                        Nye is savvy. He knows he doesn’t 
                        have to put big points on the board 
                        to win these hearings. He just has 
                        to drag them on and on. As long as 
                        he can keep these hearings running 
                        into perpetuity, he can keep all 
                        your productions shut down till the 
                        end of the war.

                                 ZANUCK
                        Which means--

                                 GOLDWYN
                              (somber)
                        Bankruptcy.

                                 WILKIE
                        In Nye’s twisted game of musical 
                        chairs, the music doesn’t stop till 
                        you all go out of business.

           The room nods, understanding the gravity. Mayer feels sick.

                                 JACK WARNER
                        How do we win?

                                 WILKIE
                              (thoughtful pause)
                        We need a knockout blow.
                              (passes out one-sheet)
                        Nye stacked this committee with his 
                        lackies, but Senator Wheeler 
                        dropped out at the last second for 
                        reasons unknown. He was replaced by 
                        a young Junior Senator from Arizona 
                        -- Mr. MacFarland. Just elected. 
                        Been in the Senate seven months. No 
                        one knows his politics on this. 
                        Nye’s bet is that he’s so green, 
                        he’ll just keep his mouth shut. We 
                        must get to MacFarland.

                                 HARRY WARNER
                        How?

                                 WILKIE
                        As Mr. Wyler suggested, we punch 
                        and we punch hard. We hit them on 
                        their anti-Semitism. Attack them as 
                        un-American. We get MacFarland’s 
                        attention. He’s the only man 
                        capable of turning the heat up on 
                        Clark. And Clark hates controversy. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILKIE (CONT'D)
                        If he thinks he’s looking like the 
                        bad guy, he’ll turn just to save 
                        his own ass. Clark is the only one 
                        who can end this hearing. If we 
                        turn MacFarland, we can turn Clark.

           The executives look around at each other, uncomfortably. 
           Everyone afraid of the moment.

           Wyler and Goldwyn lock eyes, Wyler giving him a nod of silent 
           encouragement for Wilkie’s plan. Goldwyn stares back with 
           disdain. Finally, Goldwyn turn to Wilkie--

                                 GOLDWYN
                        Let’s do it.

           The room nods.

                                 WILKIE
                        Politics is theatre, gentlemen. And 
                        DC is the world’s biggest stage.
                              (with emphasis)
                        Let’s give them a show.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTER THE MEETING

           The room empties. Wyler and Mayer talk apart from the others.

                                 WYLER
                        I’m testifying on Mrs. Miniver.

                                 MAYER
                        Hell you are.

                                 WYLER
                              (insisting)
                        Nye will bring up MGM’s payments to 
                        Germany. He’ll destroy you.

           Mayer is well aware. But he’s made up his mind. Wyler sees he 
           can’t dissuade the old man.

                                 MAYER
                        We have two weeks before MGM 
                        defaults with the bank.
                              (pulls Wyler closer with a 
                              hand on the shoulder)
                        Your weapon’s the movie camera. 
                        Finish that goddamned picture, 
                        Willy. Shove it down the throats of 
                        those Nazi sons of bitches.
           Wyler nods, with unbreakable determination.

           INT. MGM SOUNDSTAGE - MRS. MINIVER SET - DAY

           SUPERIMPOSE: 14 Days Left

           Wyler shoots a tense scene with Garson, where her character 
           waits anxiously in a dark bedroom during an air mission. The 
           ominous buzz of bombers flying overhead building dread.

           INT. MGM SOUNDSTAGE - MRS. MINIVER SET - NIGHT / INT. SENATE 
           BUILDING - NIGHT

           Buried in storyboards, Wyler talks on the phone to June. We 
           cut back and forth between them.

                                 WYLER
                        How’s the hearing?

           June ponders how to respond--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HEARING - SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - DAY

           PRESS, POLITICOS, and HOLLYWOOD-OPHILES pack the chambers to 
           observe the juiciest show in town. The room is loud. Rowdy.

           Nye, Clark, SENATOR MACFARLAND, and two other SENATORS line 
           the dais. Clark sits center as chairman, flanked by Nye.

           Gerald the Giant Killer pulverizes the biggest names in 
           Hollywood, one after another. Each response to one of Nye’s 
           questions is from a different battered executive.

                                 NYE
                        Do you support pictures that breed 
                        hate and distrust of other nations?

                                 HARRY WARNER
                        As I said in my statement, I will 
                        do everything I possibly can to 
                        help destroy Nazi-ism.

                              (angry)
                        Even if you plunge your country 
                        into war and wreck it forever?

                                 SELZNICK
                        No, sir; I do not agree with you--

           Wyler directs Garson, Ney, and THERESA WRIGHT (22, playing 
           Ney’s fiancée) in a scene in the Miniver home. Ney’s 
           character, recalled to British military service, walks 
           upstairs to pack his bags. Garson and Wright are left behind 
           in the room, the backs of their heads to the camera.

           At first, the CREW is confused by the unusual technique of 
           filming backs to the camera. Then they realize Wyler has 
           focused all attention on the empty space left on the stairs 
           by Nye. A poignant moment.

           Wyler films a scene with Garson, Pidgeon and their 
           characters’ TWO YOUNG CHILDREN. They hunker down in an 
           underground bunker, trying to distract themselves as the 
           sounds of bombs falling are heard in the streets above. 
           Unspoken fear on Garson’s face.

           The scene works, burning with subtle intensity and power. 
           Hilton, standing next to Wyler, gives the director a nod of 
           approval. Wyler shoots him half a smile. Pleased at the 
           scene, but worried time is running out.

           June furiously scribbles down notes to send to Wyler.

                                 NYE
                        Nevertheless, your picture portrays 
                        Germany in a negative light.

           Nervous murmuring among the executives.

           Hilton’s new script pages.

           Next to them, Talli sorts through the hearing transcripts.

           Wyler scribbles faster and faster until his frustration BOILS 
           over. Finally, he EXPLODES, throwing the papers everywhere--

                                 WYLER
                        Dammit! It’s not enough time!

           Dead silence. No one can comfort him. Because he’s right.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        Three scenes to rewrite and shoot 
                        in two days. Impossible.

           Wyler grabs the last page of the script, tearing it up.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        And this vicar’s speech is shit. 
                        Total shit.

           Wyler realizes he’s gone too far as soon as the words leave 
           his mouth. He turns to the wounded Hilton.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Jim. I didn’t mean it.

           Talli jumps in, soothing Hilton. Leading him to the door.

                                 TALLI
                        My husband’s an ass. Your writing 
                        is phenomenal. Draft the other two 
                        scenes. We’ll handle the speech.

           Hilton nods and smiles, trusting in Talli. He exits.

           Alone, the married couple sit facing each other, sharing a 
           long silent look. Talli full of purpose. Wyler full of doubt.

                                 WYLER
                        You’re going to write the speech?
           Talli stays silent. But her slight smile clearly says no.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)

                        something not of their making. 
                        Something greater than themselves.

                        I’m not a writer. You know that. I 
                        can’t -- articulate what I want to 
                        say--

           She hands him blank paper and a pen.

                              (panicked, blurting out)
                        -- But my English! You know I have 
                        trouble with English!

           She knows how difficult that is for him to admit. She 
           lovingly touches his arm, encouraging.

                                 TALLI
                        When I gave up my acting career, 
                        the studios assumed it was to play 
                        the good wife -- to bake pies or 
                        pump out babies -- or whatever it 
                        is I’m supposed to do.

           Wyler motions to stop her. He knows none of it’s true.

                                 TALLI (CONT’D)
                        And I’m fine with that. It’s a 
                        sexist world. I get it. I don’t 
                        need the approval of the Hollywood 
                        boy’s club to feel good about my 
                        decisions. Or my reasons.

                        my help, preparing scripts, 
                        translating scripts, we’d be an 
                        invincible team. And together, we’d 
                        do more important work than I could 
                        ever dream of as an actress.

                                 WYLER
                        Something about Nye’s questions is 
                        off. I can’t put my finger on it.

           The doorbell RINGS. Talli leaves to answer.

           The radio catches Wyler’s attention. He turns it up.

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER
                        -- Controversy today in Iowa when 
                        Charles Lindbergh made the 
                        following remarks--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AMERICA FIRST RALLY - DES MOINES, IA - EARLIER THAT DAY

           Lindbergh’s actual remarks. Delivered to another capacity 
           crowd of supporters. “America First” and “Lindbergh for 
           President” signs are everywhere.
           Nye and Wheeler watch backstage.

                                 LINDBERGH
                        The greatest danger to this country 
                        lies in the large Jewish ownership 
                        and influence in our motion 
                        pictures, our press, our radio and 
                        our government.

                                 NYE
                        Fuck.

           Furious, Nye rushes off.

                                 LINDBERGH
                        I am not attacking the Jewish 
                        people. We cannot blame them for 
                        looking out for what they believe 
                        to be their own interests, but we 
                        also must look out for ours. We 
                        cannot allow the natural passions 
                        and prejudices of other peoples to 
                        lead our country to destruction!

           Huge, violent applause. Chilling.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. WYLER’S KITCHEN - DAY

           Wyler turns off the radio, stunned by Lindbergh’s rhetoric.

           He looks up to see Talli holding up the just-delivered 
           afternoon newspaper. The headline: Lindbergh Blames Jews for 
           Country’s Drift Toward War.

                                 TALLI
                        Should we call June?

                                 WYLER
                              (smiling)
                        Yes. But first call Pan Am. We’re 
                        going to Washington.

           INT. HEARING - SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - NEXT DAY

           Wyler and Talli slip into the crowd, listening attentively. 
           They see Mayer and June in the audience, and exchange nods.

           Wilkie testifies, passionately. Senator Clark, the committee 
           chairman, tries to keep Wilkie calm.
                                 CLARK
                        Mr. Lindbergh is not at issue in 
                        these hearings. At issue here--

                                 WILKIE
                        Why not, Senator? I have been in 
                        American politics a long time. And 
                        that speech is the most un-American 
                        talk made in my time by any person 
                        of national reputation!

           Nye squirms.

                                 CLARK
                        Mr. Lindbergh does not represent 
                        this committee. His interests are 
                        not our interests.

                                 WILKIE
                        With all due respect, the 
                        assertions of Mr. Nye regarding the 
                        Jewish people comport perfectly 
                        with the assertions of Mr. 
                        Lindbergh. And, frankly, possess a 
                        striking similarity to the 
                        outpourings of Berlin!

           Loud applause from the audience. Nye is pissed.

                                 CLARK
                              (striking gavel)
                        Order! Order!

           Wyler tries to read MacFarland’s reaction. But MacFarland’s 
           poker face is impenetrable.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Nye testifies. Wyler listens closely.

                                 NYE
                        I bitterly resent, Mr. Chairman, 
                        this effort to misrepresent our 
                        purpose and to prejudice the public 
                        mind by dragging this racial issue 
                        to the front. If the anti-Semitic 
                        issue is now raised for the moment, 
                        it is raised by those of the Jewish 
                        faith and those who would prejudice 
                        the issues in these studies -- not 
                        by me, not by this committee.

           Wilkie, still at the table, shakes his head angrily. 
           MacFarland watches every moment. Wyler watches MacFarland.
                                 WILKIE
                        Mr. Chairman, in light of these 
                        shocking new developments, and 
                        given the decided lack of evidence 
                        of Hollywood war propaganda 
                        presented thus far during this 
                        hearing, I respectfully request 
                        that this investigation be 
                        immediately adjourned.

                                 MACFARLAND
                        May I say something?

           Clark nods. Silence fills the room. The importance of 
           MacFarland’s impending statement is felt by all.

           Wyler’s been waiting for this moment. He holds his breath.

                                 MACFARLAND (CONT’D)
                        There is no tolerance for anti-
                        Semitism in the United States 
                        Senate. As for the statements of 
                        Mr. Lindbergh in Des Moines, there 
                        can be no doubt -- at best they 
                        were grossly insensitive, at worst 
                        flagrantly anti-Semitic.

           Wyler leans forward with anticipation, holding Talli’s hand 
           tight. The executives are on pins and needles.

                                 MACFARLAND (CONT’D)
                              (long thoughtful pause)
                        This committee -- this committee--

           Wyler can’t stand it.

                                 MACFARLAND (CONT’D)
                        -- this committee, however, has not 
                        demonstrated anti-Semitism itself. 
                        I take Senator Nye at his word. We 
                        are here to investigate Hollywood 
                        war propaganda which he has 
                        evidence of out of his own personal 
                        knowledge. He has watched these 
                        pictures and he has judged them. 
                        Until the rest of this committee 
                        has weighed enough evidence to 
                        judge for ourselves, this 
                        investigation must continue. Sorry, 
                        Mr. Wilkie, your request is denied.

           Wyler can’t believe it. He’s crushed. The executives are 
           utterly defeated.
                                 CLARK
                        Good. We shall adjourn for lunch 
                        and return this afternoon at two 
                        for testimony from MGM.

           Nye smiles wickedly, as Clark strikes his gavel.

           INT. CAPITOL HILL RESTAURANT - DAY

           Classic DC establishment. Immaculate. Sterile. Buttoned-up.

           Wyler and Talli sit at the bar. In silence. Uncomfortable, 
           Wyler blurts out what’s on his mind.

                                 WYLER
                        Do you regret marrying a Jew? With 
                        the way the world is now -- are you 
                        scared? For our daughter?

                                 TALLI
                              (thoughtful pause)
                        I’ve never been more proud.

           She kisses his forehead and walks off. Wyler sits alone, 
           trying to collect his thoughts.

                                 HUSTON (O.S.)
                        I always thought the death of the 
                        Republic would involve more gin.

           Wyler turns, surprised to see Huston walking towards him, 
           beer in hand. The men exchange a bear hug, a solemn embrace.

           They sit down at the bar, side by side. Like old times.

                                 HUSTON (CONT’D)
                              (sarcastic)
                        Industry’s all aces out there.

                                 WYLER
                              (playing along)
                        I think we’ve got Nye on the ropes.

                                 HUSTON
                        Man’s a Neanderthal. Naked and 
                        hungry.

                                 WYLER
                        He’s certainly eaten us alive.
                              (pause)
                        Naked?
                                 HUSTON
                        The emperor has no clothes.

           Wyler’s clearly puzzled. Huston swigs back his beer.

                                 HUSTON (CONT’D)
                        How many pictures you see this 
                        year?

                                 WYLER
                        Ten? Fifteen?

                                 HUSTON
                        Same here. And this is our 
                        livelihood.
                              (then)
                        Nye’s condemning a list of 150 
                        pictures, all from the last three 
                        years. Think he’s seen them all?

           The world shifts beneath Wyler’s feet. At long last, 
           everything makes sense.

           Energized, Wyler pulls out a pocket watch, checks the time, 
           and bolts for the door. Now Huston is the one puzzled.

                                 HUSTON (CONT’D)
                              (joking)
                        Men’s room’s on the left. Don’t 
                        forget to jiggle the handle.

                                 WYLER
                              (turning back briefly)
                        Funny. I’ve known for a year I 
                        couldn’t finish Mrs. Miniver
                        without you. I just didn’t 
                        understand how.

           Huston gets it. The two men exchange a nod. Then Wyler 
           sprints out the door.

           INT. SENATE HALLWAYS - MINUTES LATER

           Wyler runs through the crowded hallway, darting in between 
           SEVERAL CONFUSED POLITICOS. Finally, he finds the door he 
           wants. He catches his breath and calmly enters a--

           SENATE BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM

           Mayer stands in front of a mirror, fixing his suit.

                                 WYLER
                        You look good.
                                 MAYER
                              (not turning around)
                        I look old.

           Wyler walks up to Mayer and extends his hand for Mayer to 
           shake. Mayer turns toward him.

                                 WYLER
                        LB -- thank you.

           With that, Wyler walks away, turning around just before 
           exiting. He takes one last look at Mayer and then disappears, 
           closing the door behind him.

           Alone with his thoughts, Mayer takes a breath. He’s ready.

           He walks to the door and tries to open it -- but the knob 
           won’t turn. Mayer tries harder, slamming his body against the 
           door several times. It won’t budge. He’s locked in.

           Mayer turns red with anger--

                                 MAYER
                        God dammit, Willy!

           INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - DAY

                                 CLARK
                              (striking his gavel)
                        Order please.

           The room quiets.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Speaking on behalf of MGM today--

           A LEGISLATIVE INTERN walks up to Clark and whispers in his 
           ear, handing him a note. Clark looks confused. 

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        We have a change on the schedule--

           Nye furrows his brow. This is a surprise to him.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        -- speaking on behalf of MGM -- Mr. 
                        William Wyler.

           As Wyler enters the room and heads to the witness table, a 
           buzz of intrigue ripples through the crowd. Wilkie is 
           stunned; he whispers something to a LAWYER COLLEAGUE.

           Wyler stops and stands at the table.
                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Wyler, please hold up your 
                        right hand.

           Wyler does so.

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        Do you solemnly swear the evidence 
                        you are about to give will be the 
                        truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
                        but the truth, so help you God?

                                 WYLER
                        I do.

                                 CLARK
                        You may be seated.

           Wyler sits. Nye lasers in on him -- a hunter after his prey.

                                 NYE
                        Mr. Wyler -- where were you born?

                                 WYLER
                        Mulhouse in Alsace-Lorraine.

                                 NYE
                        Is that in Germany or France?

                                 WYLER
                        Tough to tell these days.

           Trickles of laughter in the crowd. Nye ignores it.

                                 NYE
                        And what is your religion?

           Talli leans forward.

                                 WYLER
                        I’m Jewish.

                                 NYE
                        Interesting.

                                 WYLER
                        If you’d ever been to temple, you’d 
                        know it’s not that interesting.

           A bigger laugh from the crowd.

                                 CLARK
                        Mr. Wyler, this is a serious 
                        proceeding. Please.
           Wyler nods in compliance.

                                 NYE
                        Mr. Wyler, are you engaged in the 
                        production of a picture for MGM 
                        Studios entitled Mrs. Miniver?

                                 WYLER
                        I am.

                                 NYE
                        What is the plot of this picture?

                                 WYLER
                        A British family struggles to 
                        survive the war against Germany.

                                 NYE
                        And the purpose of this picture?

                                 WYLER
                              (without missing a beat)
                        It’s propaganda, sir.

           A buzz of surprise in the room. Nye smiles at the confession. 
           Wilkie grows nervous -- where is Wyler going with this?

                                 NYE
                              (smiling)
                        I’m sorry -- can you repeat that?

                                 WYLER
                        It’s a propaganda picture, Senator.

                                 NYE
                        So you admit the picture is 
                        manipulative and deceitful?

                                 WYLER
                        The picture is neither. It portrays 
                        the truth about the Nazi threat.

                                 NYE
                        But you admit its propaganda?

                                 WYLER
                        It’s a factual portrayal of life in 
                        Britain during the war. If that’s 
                        propaganda, I plead guilty.

           Nye can’t believe his ears.
                                 NYE
                              (to Clark, smiling)
                        We have all we need.

           MacFarland reflects on what just transpired.

                                 CLARK
                        Well, uh -- thank you, Mr. Wyler. 
                        Unless you have something else you 
                        would like to present--

                                 WYLER
                        I do have one thing -- and I’ll be 
                        brief.

                                 CLARK
                        Go ahead.

           All eyes on Wyler. He feels the weight of the room. He drinks 
           a sip of water. A long beat.

           At that moment, the door to the chamber CREAKS open. Wyler 
           turns to see a MAN slip into a seat near the back. He locks 
           eyes with the man. It’s Huston. Wyler smiles.

           Wyler then moves his gaze towards Talli, sitting in the 
           crowd. She smiles proudly and nods. Emboldened, Wyler turns 
           back toward the committee.

                                 WYLER
                        When I first heard of this proposed 
                        investigation, I was deeply 
                        resentful, naturally. After awhile, 
                        in thinking it over, my anger 
                        cooled a bit. It gives me the 
                        opportunity to say what I am going 
                        to say now.

           You can hear a pin drop.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        I am proud to be a part of the 
                        motion picture business. I go back 
                        and I think of what this little 
                        nickelodeon business has grown to, 
                        and I cannot help but be proud. I 
                        recall the hours and hours and 
                        weeks and months and years of 
                        entertainment that the people of 
                        the world have received from this 
                        industry and it makes me proud.

           The room’s at rapt attention. A disheveled Mayer slips in.
                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        I look back and I can see Charlie 
                        Chaplin as the “little tramp” in 
                        Kid Auto Races at Venice. His baggy 
                        pants and oversized shoes. I look 
                        back and see John Gilbert in the 
                        Big Parade. I see Renée Adorée on 
                        the truck when he kissed her 
                        goodbye and went away to war. I 
                        look back and recall picture after 
                        picture, so strong and powerful 
                        they sold the American way of life, 
                        not only to America but to the 
                        world. They sold it so strongly 
                        that when dictators took over Italy 
                        and Germany, what did Hitler and 
                        his flunky, Mussolini, do? First 
                        thing was ban our pictures, throw 
                        us out. They wanted no part of the 
                        American way of life.

           Listening, Mayer nods. As do the Warners. As does Goldwyn.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        And I come down right now to the 
                        pictures of today. To Gone With the 
                        Wind and The Wizard of Oz and How 
                        Green Was My Valley. To the 
                        pictures at issue during this 
                        hearing which I remember so well--
                              (lingering on Nye)
                        -- even if some others do not.

           McFarland notices the statement and the long look at Nye. He 
           glances at Nye himself, thinking things over.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        I remember all these pictures and 
                        the enjoyment they have given. And 
                        I am very proud. This industry has 
                        stood for a lot. It has stood for 
                        the American way of life.

           McFarland nods in agreement.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        And so yes, MGM is currently  
                        producing and I am directing a 
                        picture revealing the astonishing 
                        threat which Nazi Germany presents 
                        to Great Britain, to America, and 
                        to people all over the world. 
                        Guilty as charged.
                              (staring hard at Nye)
                                 (MORE)
                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        And we will continue to disregard 
                        threats and pleas intended to 
                        dissuade us from our purpose.

           Nye angrily stares down Wyler. Talli’s never been more proud.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                              (turning back to Clark)
                        Senator Nye has repeatedly accused 
                        myself and my colleagues of 
                        manipulating the motion picture 
                        medium to argue for war. On this 
                        point, the Senator completely 
                        misses the boat. So much so, that I 
                        sometimes wonder if he has in fact 
                        seen any of the pictures he so 
                        regularly attacks.

           Wilkie’s ears perk up as he realizes what Wyler is trying to 
           establish -- Nye has never actually watched these pictures!

           MacFarland’s eyes narrow. He listens more closely than ever.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                        With all due respect, Senators, war 
                        is coming, whatever course we take. 
                        The real issue is whether we are 
                        going to live in the future as free 
                        men, or whether the attack of the 
                        Axis powers is to destroy our 
                        prospect of liberty. Senators, we 
                        are not arguing for war, we are 
                        arguing for freedom!

           The power of Wyler’s speech leaves the room stunned silent.

                                 WYLER (CONT’D)
                              (with conviction)
                        Now, if you please, I’d like to go 
                        home and finish my picture.

           Wyler removes himself from the witness table, as the room 
           ERUPTS in thunderous applause. Pandemonium.

           Nye looks uncomfortable.

                                 CLARK
                              (striking his gavel)
                        Order -- order please. The 
                        subcommittee will have order.

           Everyone congratulates Wyler with hugs and handshakes. But 
           Wyler keeps his eyes on McFarland.
           McFarland is calm and steely during the chaos, lost in 
           thought. As soon as Clark manages to quiet the crowd--

                                 MCFARLAND
                        Mr. Chairman -- I’d like to recall 
                        Senator Nye to the stand.

           Clark is surprised, but seems fine with it. Clark turns to 
           Nye, who shrugs and nods in agreement.

           Wyler and Talli lock eyes in understanding. They silently try 
           to hide their excitement.

           Nye descends to the table.

                                 CLARK
                        We thank you, Senator Nye. Please 
                        remember you are still under oath.

                                 NYE
                        Yes, Senator.

                                 MCFARLAND
                              (to Nye)
                        Senator, you stated that you have 
                        seen the war pictures in question?

                                 NYE
                        That is right.

           Wyler smiles knowingly. Checkmate.

                                 MCFARLAND
                        Which of those picture was the most 
                        objectionable from your point of 
                        view?

                                 NYE
                              (arrogantly)
                        That is a question that is most 
                        difficult to answer. It is a 
                        terrible weakness of mine to go to 
                        a picture tonight and not be able 
                        to state the title of it tomorrow 
                        morning. Somehow or other, I have a 
                        rather lasting impression of a 
                        picture titled I Married a Nazi.

                                 MCFARLAND
                        Alright. We will take that picture. 
                        What was there in that picture that 
                        was particularly objectionable from 
                        your point of view?
                                 NYE
                        Senator -- I have not reviewed that 
                        picture in a long, long time--

                                 MCFARLAND
                              (combative)
                        I am trying to find out about what 
                        we are asked to investigate. You’ve 
                        drawn a lot of conclusions here. I 
                        want to be able to determine 
                        whether they are well-founded.

                                 NYE
                              (backpedaling)
                        Yes, but--

                                 MCFARLAND
                        Did you see the picture Escape?

                                 NYE
                        Perhaps if you can tell me a bit of 
                        the story, I could tell you better 
                        whether I have seen Escape or not.

           Clark shifts nervously in his seat. Wyler squeezes Talli’s 
           hand harder with excitement.

                                 MCFARLAND
                              (pulling out a list)
                        Senator, I might pick some of the 
                        pictures you enumerated in your 
                        testimony at this very hearing.
                              (reading)
                        Convoy -- did you see that picture?

                                 NYE
                        I am at a loss to call to mind any 
                        particular features--

           Nye is rattled. Wyler is exuberant. The movie executives 
           can’t hide their smiles. The shift in momentum is palpable.

                                 MCFARLAND
                        Did you see Flight Command?

                                 NYE
                        I do not believe I did, Senator.

                                 MCFARLAND
                        That Hamilton Woman?

                                 NYE
                        I did not.
                                 MCFARLAND
                        Man Hunt?

                                 NYE
                        I did not.

                                 MCFARLAND
                        Mortal Storm?

                                 NYE
                        I did not.

                                 MCFARLAND
                        Sergeant York?

                                 NYE
                              (delighted)
                        Yes! I saw that one!

           The crowd laughs at Nye.

                                 MCFARLAND
                        What in that picture was 
                        particularly objectionable to you?

                                 NYE
                        Why, it was a -- I -- I cannot 
                        quite recall--

                                 MCFARLAND
                              (going in for the kill)
                        Senator -- from what I can tell, 
                        you have either not seen or cannot 
                        remember any of these pictures! Yet 
                        you have dragged us to this 
                        inquisition because these pictures 
                        do not coincide with your views in 
                        regard to the foreign situation -- 
                        is that not a fact?

           Loud applause. Nye feels the crowd against him.

                                 MCFARLAND (CONT’D)
                        You are of course entitled to your 
                        beliefs. But what about the motion 
                        picture industry? Do they not have 
                        a right to a little belief?

           Wyler and Mayer lock eyes in glee.
                                 MCFARLAND (CONT’D)
                        Senator Nye, the United States, 
                        with England and its allies, remain 
                        the bulwark of the rights of the 
                        individual in the world today. But 
                        the rights of the individual mean 
                        nothing if freedom of the press and 
                        freedom of speech are destroyed. 
                        There can be no disunity within the 
                        United States on this principle--
                              (staring down Nye)
                        -- and I know there is none.

           Nye sinks in his chair. He’s never felt smaller. Clark 
           doesn’t know what to do--

                                 CLARK
                        Perhaps we need a short recess--

                                 MCFARLAND
                              (ignoring Clark)
                        As such, I recommend to the 
                        Chairman the immediate adjournment 
                        of this subcommittee and the 
                        permanent close of this 
                        investigation.

           Loud applause.

                                 CLARK
                              (pounding gavel)
                        Order -- order please--

           Clark can’t control the room. He looks at Nye for direction, 
           but Nye’s too deflated to notice. Clark panics--

                                 CLARK (CONT’D)
                        In light of a -- recent events -- 
                        this investigation is hereby -- 
                        and, uh, permanently --- adjourned.

           An EXPLOSION of cheers and celebration in the crowd. Mayer, 
           June, Wilkie, and the Hollywood executives rejoice.

           Wyler and Tally embrace. But are interrupted by a MAN bear 
           hugging Wyler and offering his hand in friendship.

           Goldwyn. Wyler hugs him right back.

           INT. MGM SOUND STAGE - MRS. MINIVER SET - DAY

           Wyler walks onto the set to applause from his cast and crew. 
           Garson and Pidgeon hug Wyler. They all laugh and celebrate.
           ON SET

           At long last, Wyler gets to shoot his vicar speech.

           Close on Wyler watching from his director’s chair as HENRY 
           WILCOXON (36, playing the vicar) addresses the Minivers and 
           their neighbors in the ruins of a bombed out parish church.

                                 WILCOXON
                        Because this is not only a war of 
                        soldiers in uniform. It is a war of 
                        the people, of all the people, and 
                        it must be fought not only on the 
                        battlefield, but in the cities and 
                        in the villages, in the factories 
                        and on the farms, in the home, and 
                        in the heart of every man, woman, 
                        and child who loves freedom!

           Wyler glows with the relief of accomplishment.

           EXT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATRE - HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           CROWDS cheer wildly outside a sold-out movie premiere.

           INT. LIMOSINE - CONTINUOUS

           Wyler and Talli sit in the back, pulling up to theatre.

           Talli makes a move to exit, but notices that Wyler is frozen, 
           distracted. Outside, wild FANS try to see who’s inside.

                                 TALLI
                        What is it?

                                 WYLER
                        This war -- a lot of people are 
                        going to die. Those who survive 
                        will come back changed.

                                 TALLI
                        It’s a necessary war. Hitler must 
                        be defeated. Your picture makes 
                        that a greater possibility.

                                 WYLER
                              (burdened)
                        If propaganda can be shaped for 
                        moral purposes today, it can be 
                        shaped for immoral and indecent 
                        purposes tomorrow.
                                 TALLI
                        Which is why we must make sure that 
                        never happens.

           Wyler nods, deep in thought. She kisses him on the cheek. He 
           lets go of his worrying, for the time being.

           They exit the limo and walk the red carpet of the raucous 
           movie premiere. PAPARAZZI and screaming FANS on all sides.

           We pan up to read the theatre marquee: The Maltese Falcon

           EXT. HOME OF PEACE CEMETERY - LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Wyler, Talli, and a three-year old Catherine pay their 
           respects at a gravestone. Catherine holds a white rose.

           Close on the tombstone, which reads:

                     Carl Laemmle, Beloved Father, 1867-1939

           Catherine looks over the tombstone with curiosity and awe. 
           She looks up at her father. With a nod, he encourages her to 
           place the rose on the tombstone.

           She does.

           We close on Wyler and Talli as they hold hands, looking on.

           INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL - LOS ANGELES - OSCAR NIGHT

           A giant red velvet curtain opens, revealing the stage of the 
           Academy Awards. The musical fanfare reaches a crescendo--

                                                                CUT TO:

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Bob Hope!

           To rousing applause, Bob Hope saunters on stage.

                                 HOPE
                        Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. 
                        Welcome to the Academy Awards. Or 
                        as they call it at my house, 
                        Passover.

           Laughter.

                                                                CUT TO:
                                 HOPE (CONT’D)
                        Announcing this year’s award for 
                        best director -- Mr. Frank Capra!

           Legendary director FRANK CAPRA graces the stage. He announces 
           the nominees, including:

                                 CAPRA
                        -- William Wyler for Mrs. Miniver.

           Close on -- an EMPTY SEAT -- next to Talli.

           Several OSCAR GOERS notice Wyler’s absence. Curious whispers 
           amongst the crowd.

                                 CAPRA (CONT’D)
                              (opening envelope)
                        And the Oscar goes to--

           As Capra reads the name to himself, the crowd holds its 
           collective breath. 

           Mayer, June, Goldwyn -- all on pins and needles.

                                 CAPRA (CONT’D)
                              (excited)
                        -- William Wyler for Mrs. Miniver!

           An EXPLOSION of exuberant applause overtakes the room.

           Much to her surprise, Talli loses control of her emotions, 
           crying tears of joy as she moves toward the stage to accept 
           the award on her husband’s behalf.

           June stands, clapping wildly. Mayer hugs everyone around him. 
           Goldwyn cheers loudly and pumps his fist.

           Talli ascends the stage and reaches the podium. She looks out 
           at the jam-packed ballroom, in boisterous celebration. She 
           tries to speak, but can’t find the words. She just stands 
           there proudly, holding Wyler’s Academy Award.

           The room RISES to give her a STANDING OVATION.

           INT. BOEING B-17 BOMBER - OVER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

           Halfway across the world--

           Wyler sits, dressed in army gear, on a bench seat next to 
           another GI. His hand shakes as he tightens his helmet.

           We see the GI next to Wyler. It’s Huston.
           The cheers of the Oscar crowd fade from the soundtrack, 
           leaving only the hum of the bomber’s four engines.

           We close on Wyler as he stares into the distance, embracing 
           an uncertain future.

           We hold on Wyler as we--

                                                             FADE TO BLACK.

           The hum of the engines remains in the soundtrack.

           CARD #1: Mrs. Miniver was the highest grossing film of 1942. 
           It won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best 
           Director.

           CARD #2: Senator Nye’s reputation never recovered after the 
           Hollywood propaganda hearings. He lost his next election.

           CARD #3: President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime 
           Minister Winston Churchill credited Mrs. Miniver with helping 
           to promote American intervention in World War II. Said 
           Churchill, “Mrs. Miniver did more for the allied cause than a 
           flotilla of battleships.”

           CARD #4: Nazi propaganda minister Josef Goebbels called Mrs. 
           Miniver an exemplary piece of propaganda and ordered German 
           filmmakers to study the film and adapt its devices.

           CARD #5: William Wyler is the most acclaimed director in 
           Hollywood history, holding the records for Academy Award 
           nominations for Best Director (twelve) and for directing the 
           most Oscar-nominated performances (thirty-five).

           CARD #6: Wyler also holds the distinction of directing 
           thirteen Best Picture nominated movies and three Best Picture 
           winning movies, Mrs. Miniver (1942), The Best Years of our 
           Lives (1946), and Ben-Hur (1959).

           Superimpose over CARD #6: He won an Academy Award for Best 
           Director for all three films.

                                          THE END
