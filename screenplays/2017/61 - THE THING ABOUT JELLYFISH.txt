           EXT. UNDERWATER - THE ATLANTIC OCEAN - MORNING 

           A FIVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL swims in a ray of sunlight. Ethereal. 
           She wears a goggles and a bathing suit with stars on it.

           We see: her freckles catch the light, like constellations 
           against her skin. Her long, distinctive RED HAIR. Her smile. 

           She beckons for us to follow her - this way. Then she swims 
           off into the deeper water, her flippers kicking bubbles...

           We MOVE TOWARDS her, trying to keep up with her, but she’s 
           WAY too fast. Her long, red hairs disappearing into the dark.

                                 A FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Suzanne? Did you hear what I said?

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT.  THERAPY OFFICE - THE PRESENT 

           DR. LEGLER (50s, kind-eyed) blinks at us, expecting us to 
           answer.  She sits in a standard-issue shrink armchair.

                                 DR. LEGLER
                        I asked if you know why you’re here 
                        today. 

           We see: Dr. Legler’s cobalt blue tights, her legs crossed.

           We see: a sad fake plant in a cheap basket.

           We see: a poster of a cat leaping into the sky. Go for it!

                                 DR. LEGLER (CONT’D)
                        You’re here because your parents 
                        are worried about you. They tell me 
                        you haven’t spoken in two months. 
                             (silence)
                        Is that right, Suzanne?

           Finally, we REVERSE to REVEAL - 

           A TWELVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL, in the corner of a couch, staring 
           into a fish tank. She’s more child than teen. Doesn’t give a 
           crap about boys yet. Black clothes, hair unwashed. Wild. 

           This is SUZY SWANSON, known mostly as ZU. 

           From her POV: we see the dark water lapping the fish tank.
                                 DR. LEGLER (CONT’D)
                        Grief is a complicated thing, Suzy. 
                        But there’s no right or wrong way 
                        to talk about it.
                             (gently)
                        You can use any words at all. 

           A long beat. 

                                 JIM (O.S.)
                        We’re sorry, Dr. Legler. We don’t 
                        mean to waste your time with this.

           REVEAL: Suzy’s parents MEG and JIM,(30s, eccentric and 
           conservative, respectively). Their faces open and big. 

                                 DR. LEGLER
                        No no - this is all part of the 
                        process, Jim. 

                                 MEG 
                        Suzy? Can’t you try to talk, honey?

                                 JIM
                        We love you so much, sugar-sugar. 
                        We wanna know what’s in your head. 

           We see: the dark water in the tank again. Lapping the glass.

           We see: the plastic scuba diver. Scum on his face.

                                 DR. LEGLER
                        Where does Suzy spend most of her 
                        time? You have shared custody?

                                 JIM
                        Yes. I get her Saturdays.

                                 MEG
                        ...because I’m an ogre. That’s the 
                        rest of that sentence. 

                                 JIM
                             (to Dr. Legler)
                        Do you see? This is what I’m 
                        talking about. Even with this we 
                        can’t be a unified team - 

                                 MEG
                        Really, Jim?! You’re gonna -

           Jim & Meg start getting into it - VOICES ESCALATING, fingers 
           pointing - but the sound CUTS OUT and we stay on Suzy.
                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Dumb old words. Dumb old words that 
                        don’t say a thing. 

           They keep arguing, on MUTE. Zu sees their actual words appear 
           in the air, as objects that dart and shoot around the room.

           WORDS: “MY DAUGHTER” “RED FLAGS” “YOUR FAULT!” “MY FAULT?!” 
           “HER FRIEND!” “FAULT” “DIED!” “FAULT” “FAULT!” “FAULT“ - 

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Sometimes I want things to change 
                        so badly, I can’t be in the room 
                        with the way they actually are.

           Suzy stands, pushes through her parents’ angry words, and 
           slips out of the room. Absolutely no one notices. 

           EXT. DR. LEGLER’S BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINOUS

           On the other side of Legler’s door, Zu takes a deep breath.

           At the end of the hall, there’s a window with a view of the 
           OCEAN. Bright and blue. She heads towards it.

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        I saw a video on YouTube once. Of 
                        the saddest polar bear on earth. He 
                        was trapped in a small glass cage 
                        in a Chinese Shopping mall.  

           We see: the Youtube clip of this polar bear, lying catatonic 
           on his side, dead eyes, lips moving noiselessly. (Google it.)

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        He laid on his side all day, like a 
                        lumpy white rug, one paw up in 
                        surrender.  And he kept trying to 
                        roar... but no sound came out.

           CLOSE ON: the bear’s lips, moving without sound. 

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        That’s what it would be like if I 
                        tried to talk. 

           Suzy’s at the window now, her nose pressed against the glass.

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Franny Jackson is dead and things 
                        ended between us in the worst 
                        possible way. Words can’t fix that. 
                        So why bother?
           INT. MEG’S SUBARU - CONTINUOUS 

           Meg drives. She peeks in the rearview mirror. 

           We see: Zu in the backseat, eyes trained on the sea. 

                                 MEG
                        I’m sorry your Dad and I weren’t 
                        our best selves in there, honey. 
                        We’re still figuring out how to be 
                        around each other, you know? And 
                        we’re both out of our skulls 
                        worried about you.

           We see: the surf, crashing against rocks. 

           We see: a seagull pecking at a dead fish on a boulder.

           Out Meg’s window, we see South Grove, MA go by. It’s a small, 
           blue collar town. Cape Cod-y. Sun beaten. Backlit by ocean.

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re still hurting. Of 
                        course you are, Zu. Tragedies are 
                        just that: tragic. They don’t make 
                        sense and they aren’t fair. But... 

                                 ZU (V.O.)
                        Here they come. The four most 
                        useless words of all:

                                 MEG
                        Sometimes things just happen, Zu. 

           Those words: “SOMETIMES” “THINGS” “JUST” “HAPPEN” dart by 
           Zu’s face and she angrily swipes them away. 

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Things don’t just happen. There’s 
                        supposed to be a reason why they 
                        happen. Logic. A leading to B. Like 
                        we’ve been learning in Life Science 
                        class. 

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. MRS. TURTON’S SCIENCE CLASSROOM   

           Suzy at a black board in a science classroom with a pointer. 
           Behind her, the board says “The Scientific Method.” 

           Zu doesn’t speak, but she is Vanna White during this, 
           providing the visual aids for this confident presentation: 
                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        First, you state your question.

           ZIP! Zu pulls down a CHART on a string, from above. It says: 

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        “Why did Franny Jackson drown?”

           ZIP! She pulls down a PIE CHART called: “Accidental Drownings 
           in North East, 1950-2017.”

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        As you can see, there are three 
                        leading causes of drowning.
                             (pointing)
                        A.) The victim could not swim.
                        B.) The victim was under the 
                        influence of drugs and or alcohol. 
                        And C.) The ocean was too rough.

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Now you interpret the data. 

           Zu picks up the SmartBoard remote, and presses it. A picture 
           of Franny Jackson in a bathing suit holding a HUGE trophy. 

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Fact: Franny Jackson was an expert 
                        swimmer. Captain of the JV team as 
                        a sixth grader, which is unheard 
                        of. So “A” is out.

           ZIP! She pulls down a GRAPH, “Autopsy Toxicology Reports.”

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                             (pointing)
                        Fact: Franny Jackson's autopsy 
                        results showed no signs of alcohol 
                        or drugs. (Duh.) So “B” is out. 

           ZIP! She pulls down a REPORT, "Surf Reports South Grove, MA”

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                             (pointing)
                        Fact: On July 3, 2017 the sea was 
                        unusually calm. There was no rip 
                        tide in the surf report, not a 
                        cloud in the sky. And Franny knew 
                        Cove Beach like the back of her 
                        hand. Swam there every summer since 
                        she was 5. So “C” is out.

           ZIP! ZIP! ZIP! Suzy pulls the strings on all her visual aids, 
           dismissing them all back into the ceiling. 
                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Conclusion: Franny Jackson didn’t 
                        drown.
                             (writing it on the board:)
                        Something killed her. 

           Zu adds an exclamation point! 

           EXT. EUGENE FIELD MIDDLE SCHOOL - SCHOOL YARD - CONTINOUS

           We see: Meg’s Subaru pull up to the bustling school. HUGE 
           CROWDS of ‘tweens, cliques already, make their way in.

           INT. MEG’S SUBARU - CONTINUOUS

                                 MEG
                        Hey, don’t forget your shirt for 
                        the field trip. I ironed it for ya.

           She leans over and hands Zu a tie-dyed shirt. 

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        I love you, you know. Very much. 

           Zu stuffs the shirt in her bag an climbs out, into the crowd.

           WE TRACK with her as she gets jostled and bumped by elbows, 
           No one seems to even register she’s there...

           INT. EUGENE FIELD MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Fun fact. Did you know that you can 
                        become invisible in middle school 
                        simply by not speaking?

           A STUDENT opens a locker RIGHT INTO HER FACE, banging her 
           square in the nose and knocking her to the ground. 

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Not that being invisible is without 
                        challenges. 

           MONTAGE:

           We see: Suzy reading in the library. The motion-detecting 
           lights turn OFF. 

           We see: Suzy on the school bus, silently but frantically 
           trying to get the driver's attention. He drives by her house.
           We see: Suzy on the ground, her nose bloody from the locker 
           attack, people stepping over her. Or on her. She’s not there. 

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS 

           Zu’s in the lunch line in a LOUD cafeteria, her face buried 
           in book called, “PREDATORS OF THE SEA.” She flips through it.  

           We see: illustrations of bad things happening to swimmers. A 
           SHARK biting a leg. An OCTOPUS strangling a throat.

                                 CAFETERIA WORKER
                        Kid. What do you want?

           Zu points to the tater tots. Gets a nasty scoop of stew. 

           She sighs and turns to search for somewhere to sit. Many 
           unfriendly, unwelcoming face glare at her until... 

           Something stops her dead in her tracks.

           It’s the smiling face of 12-year-old FRANNY JACKSON on a huge 
           poster up on the wall. Her most recent school portrait.

           Zu takes her face in, and for an instant, we see: Franny’s  
           beautiful freckles project constellations across the ceiling.

                                 JENNA (O.S.)
                        Hey. You’re blocking our sign.

           Zu startles and we see: MOLLY, JENNA, and AUBREY (all 13) at 
           a folding table under Franny’s picture. They’re all perfectly 
           coiffed and effortlessly cool. (Jenna’s the leader; Aubrey’s 
           the nice one; Molly’s the most boy-crazy.)

           The sign Zu is blocking says: “Memory Board for Franny.” 

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           Zu doesn’t move, just stands there, staring at the portrait.

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                             (to Molly & Aubrey)
                        Is she pretend-deaf now, too?

                                 AUBREY
                             (whispers)
                        SHH! My mom said we should be nice. 
                        Because she’s special needs.  
                                 JENNA
                             (whispers)
                        She’s not special needs - she’s 
                        like a super genius. 

                                 AUBREY
                        Hey Suzy - you ok? 

           Zu doesn’t answer. It’s very awkward, how silent she is.

                                 MOLLY
                        Wow, love your new look this year. 
                        So free and... um... natural.

           Jenna and Molly snicker under their breath.

                                 AUBREY
                        Shh!
                             (back to Zu)
                        We’re making a display for Franny’s 
                        memorial, see? They’re rose petals.
                        Everyone’s writing memories of 
                        Franny on them, and then we’re 
                        gonna make a big rose garden. 

                                 JENNA
                        We saw it on Pinterest. 

                                 MOLLY 
                        Dylan Parker’s petal? Oh my God. So 
                        sweet. We were like ugly crying.

           Zu stays silent. Then Audrey makes a bold move: 

                                 AUBREY
                        Do you want to write one, Suzy?

                                 MOLLY
                        Aubrey.

                                 AUBREY
                        What?

                                 JENNA
                             (whispers)
                        After what she did to her??

           A beat. Zu stares at the yellow petal in Aubrey’s open palm. 
           The girls are whispering, but Zu can hear...

                                 MOLLY
                        It was pee. Actual pee. 

           Zu backs away, upset, and takes off with her food tray. 
           INT. EUGENE FIELD MEMORIAL MIDDLE SCHOOL - LIBRARY

           Zu sits down with her lunch, the lone student in the library. 
           Rows and rows of empty tables.

           We see: the super sad beef stew in her tray. 

                                 FRANNY (PRE-LAP)
                        Pst. Who circumnavigated the world?

           INT. LIBRARY - FLASHBACK - A YEAR AGO, SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR

           Zu startles and turns to see FRANNY (12) beaming at her from 
           the table behind her. She has distinctive, frizzy RED HAIR 
           and a face full of freckles. She wears uncool glasses. 

                                 FRANNY
                        I’ll give you a clue. He wiggled 
                        and jiggled all over the globe...?

                                 SUZY
                        ...Ma-Jell-O!

           The girls start snickering. [We see now that Zu looks 
           different in flashback, too. She has a mouth full of BRACES, 
           and she still takes care of herself. Hair combed.] 

                                 FRANNY
                        Bingo!  Alright Alec, she'll take 
                        Spanish explorers for five hundred.  
                        Who was the first European to 
                        explore the southern United States?
                             (then)
                        Clue: he needed a soda?

                                 SUZY
                        Hernando De Soto!

                                 FRANNY
                        DING DING DING! YEAH ZU!  

           A LIBRARIAN (60s, dour) looks up, pissed.

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        Franny Jackson. 

                                 FRANNY
                        Sorry, Miss P. My sixth grade 
                        education just makes me so 
                        exuberant!

           The librarian rolls her eyes. These damn kids. 
                                 SUZY
                        Hey - you want to come over after 
                        practice today? To study? 

                                 FRANNY
                             (yes)
                        Duh.

                                 SUZY
                        Got us a rainbow pack of index 
                        cards. 

                                 FRANNY
                        So things are about to get lit is 
                        what you’re saying. 

                                 SUZY
                        Yeah, super “lit.”

           They LAUGH. Two total dorks who love each other. But then -- 

           INT. LIBRARY - THE PRESENT

           The motion-detector lights overhead turn OFF. 

           We see: Zu is alone in the dark library. No Franny, no joy. 
           Her motion not detected.

           She starts eating her sad stew.

           EXT. SCHOOL BUS - SAME DAY, SHORTLY LATER

           CLOSE ON: THE DOOR on a school bus jolting OPEN.

           WE see: thirty SEVENTH GRADE STUDENTS next to the bus, lined 
           up to get on board. [Note: all the kids on the bus are 
           wearing matching tie-dyed “Eugene Field JHS” tee-shirts].

           Upfront, MRS. TURTON (40s, down to earth, been doing this too 
           long but still cares) checks their names off her clipboard.

                                 MRS. TURTON
                             (to students)
                        ‘Sup... ‘sup... afternoon, Mr. 
                        Nevins. Ms. Tinsley. 
                             (to the line)
                        Oh come on, people. Can I see some 
                        Aquarium excitement?!

           The students GROAN as they pass her and climb in.
                                 MRS. TURTON (CONT’D)
                             (more students)
                        Wow, maybe just two pumps of 
                        cologne next time, Mr. Cook.

           Zu is last in line, wearing her tie-dye shirt.

                                 MRS. TURTON (CONT’D)
                        There she is! Suzy Swanson's TV 
                        dinners! 
                             (with a high five)
                        You must be excited about the 
                        Aquarium! You’ve been signing out 
                        all the shark books from our class 
                        library, you go-getter!
                             (then)
                        Can I get a “what what”?

           Zu shakes her head, she won’t speak. 

                                 MRS. TURTON (CONT’D)
                             (warmly)
                        It’s the second week of school. 
                        Probably time to start talking.

           Zu looks away and climbs up onto the bus...

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - CONTINOUS

           ...where she starts scanning for an open seat. There is only 
           one seat available, and it is next to, Oh God...

           JUSTIN MALONEY (12). He has a full set of braces, a distinct 
           mullet, and a hoodie that says ASK ME ABOUT MY T-REX. 

                                 JUSTIN
                        Hey, Suzy! Got an open one here. 

           Zu slides in next to him, wanting to die. 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                             (re: breakfast sandwich)
                        Want some? There's no cheese 
                        because I'm lactose intolerant. And 
                        the bacon is actually bacon-shaped 
                        wheat gluten slash tofu, hence the 
                        smell. Sorry ‘bout that.

           Zu tries to put as much space between them as possible. 

           Justin wears a wristwatch BEEPS, and he throws a pill into 
           his mouth. Swallows it dry. 
                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        It’s for my ADHD. Don’t worry, I 
                        have’t been on anti-psychotics 
                        since 5th grade. Well, 6th. 

           Mrs. Turton’s at the front of the bus, trying to use the 
           microphone. 

                                 MRS. TURTON
                             (to the driver)
                        Is this broken? It’s not working?
                             (into microphone)
                        Testing, testing... 

           She gives up and just uses her regular voice.

                                 MRS. TURTON (CONT’D)
                        ALRIGHT PEOPLE! EYES UP HERE. I 
                        need you to quiet down now and --

           The microphone snaps on and it is SUPER LOUD:

                                 MRS. TURTON (CONT’D)
                        - LISTEN TO ME!!!! 
                             (joke)
                        Whoa, is this thing on?

           No one laughs at her corny joke. Silence. Not a smile.

                                 MRS. TURTON (CONT’D)
                        Okay hello, my greasy little 
                        petunias. I want to see excellent 
                        behavior at the Aquarium today. Any 
                        shenanigans? Any mouthing off? What 
                        will happen to you?
                             (beat, then calling on:)
                        Kai? What will happen to you?

                                 KAI
                        The cow birthing video.

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        Correct. So let’s have good day. 
                        Assignments coming around now.

           GROANS as she makes her way down the aisle with worksheets.

                                 MRS. TURTON (CONT’D)
                        For this project, you’re going to 
                        be working with a partner. And drum 
                        roll...the person you’re sitting 
                        with on the bus is your partner.

           CHEERS and GROANS throughout the bus. Justin smiles at Zu.
                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Oh God. Not Justin Maloney... 

           INT. SCHOOL - MAIN HALLWAY - A YEAR AGO - QUICK FLASH

           A HUGE CROWD of students watch the train wreckage as Justin 
           smears his naked chest with little packets of butter. 

                                 JUSTIN
                        HUMAN SLIP N’ SLIDE! YES!!!!

           Students CHEER as he takes a RUNNING LEAP onto the floor.  
           Instead of sliding he SQUEAKS to abrupt and painful halt.  He 
           pops up, his belly a bloody mess -

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        NO! OW OW OW OW OWWWWW!

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - PRESENT

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        You and your partner will be 
                        formulating a hypothesis together 
                        at the Aquarium. What’s a 
                        hypothesis again, Tamara?

                                 TAMARA
                        The thing you prove using the 
                        Scientific Method.

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        Exactamundo.

           Mrs. Turton arrives at Zu and Justin’s seat -- 

                                 MRS. TURTON (CONT’D)
                        Justin. Suzy. Think you guys can 
                        come up with a great hypothesis?

           Suzy looks away. 

                                 JUSTIN
                        Maybe something about Sea anem- sea 
                        anem-a ma ma

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        Sea anemones?

                                 JUSTIN
                        ... yes! They shoot venom out their 
                        tentacles. Which is impressive.
                                 MRS. TURTON
                        What do you think, Suzy?

           Suzy still looks away.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Don’t worry, Ms. T. She can talk. 
                        She did a whole thing on vampire 
                        bats at science fair last year. 
                             (to Suzy)
                        Big fan, by the way. 

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        You two will be giving an oral 
                        report. Public speaking is an 
                        important part of the grade.
                             (kindly)
                        Let me know if you need any help.

           Molly, Jenna, and Aubrey appear behind Mrs. Turton, making 
           their way to the back of the bus. They have knotted the 
           corners of their shirts at their hips, making them midriffs. 

                                 MRS. TURTON (CONT’D)
                        Girls! You’re late! 

                                 AUBREY
                        No we’re not. Dylan saved us seats 
                        in back. 

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        Sit down! And untie those. No one 
                        needs to see your belly buttons. 

                                 JENNA
                        They don’t need to, but they might 
                        want to, actually.

           They continue down the aisle, LAUGHING. As they approach ZU:

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh my God. Look. How perfect is 
                        that couple?

                                 JENNA
                        Hope you like pee, Maloney.

           Zu tries to stare straight ahead as their little midriff-
           exposed bodies pass her seats and head to the back.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Hey why do they always tease you 
                        about pee, anyway? Did you pee your 
                        pants or something?
                                 (MORE)
                                 JUSTIN (CONT'D)
                             (then)
                        Yes? No?

           Zu looks out the window.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I've got an idea: sign language!  
                        Do you know sign language?  Well, 
                        wait, that won't work because I 
                        don't know sign language. 

           Zu closes her eyes, and the screen goes BLACK. 

                                 JUSTIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You want me to pull out some, like,   
                        Miracle Worker stuff? Because we 
                        read it in Mr. Sullivan's class -

                                 YOUNG FRANNY (PRE-LAP)
                        Oh my God, Suzy - look at this! 

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - FLASHBACK - OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR

           Suzy (with braces) opens her eyes and we see Franny sitting 
           where Justin was, in the seat next to her. Her hair dorky.

           She’s holding up her iphone and we see a pic: a white puppy.

                                 SUZY
                        Awwww. He’s adorable! 

                                 FRANNY
                        I know. I’m naming him 
                        “Fluffernutter.”

                                 SUZY
                        Really? Kinda on the nose...

                                 FRANNY
                        No, “White Dog” would be on the 
                        nose. “Guilt Dog” would be on the 
                        nose. Fluffernutter is perfect.

                                 SUZY
                        What’s your mom guilty about? 

                                 FRANNY
                        Working weekends again. She’s 
                        worried I’m gonna be sad and lonely 
                        in our sad lonely apartment.

                                 SUZY
                        But you’ve got me! 
                                 FRANNY
                        That’s what I said. I was like, 
                        Mom, Zu lives three blocks away, 
                        pull your shit together. 

           Zu laughs. She looks back at the puppy picture.

                                 SUZY
                        Pretty cool to get a dog, though. 
                        Definitely in my top five animals. 

                                 FRANNY
                        Too bad your parents are so gross 
                        in love. Divorce is how you get the 
                        big ticket items.
                             (then)
                        I did the 200 in 2:25 yesterday.

                                 SUZY
                        You did not. 

                                 FRANNY
                        Better time than Rachel Blum, which 
                        means: varsity starter next year.
                             (then)
                        Just 317 days to go.

                                 SUZY
                        You’re the only person in the 
                        history of the world who has ever 
                        counted down the days until seventh 
                        grade, you know that?

           Their conversation comes to a sudden halt as Molly, Jenna and 
           Aubrey come down the aisle. They talk too loudly on purpose: 

                                 JENNA
                        Hey, Aubrey. Do you have any hair 
                        product with you? Something for 
                        frizzy, fugly red hair?

                                 AUBREY
                        No. Why do you ask, Jenna?

                                 JENNA
                        NO REASON. 

           They all LAUGH as they pass. Franny stares at her hands, 
           trying not to cry. Face blotchy. Tears right on the cusp.

                                 SUZY
                        Hey. Wanna know something awesome 
                        about rabbits, Franny?
                                 FRANNY
                        ...Not now, Zu.

                                 SUZY
                        I think you really need to know.

                                 FRANNY
                        Stop.

                                 SUZY
                        Their teeth never stop growing.

           A moment. Franny can't help herself. She looks up, curious.

                                 FRANNY
                        Like never?

                                 SUZY
                        Ever. Also: they can't throw up,  
                        their ears can be up to 31 inches 
                        long, and they eat their own poop!

           Then both girls burst out LAUGHING. OFF Franny, full of love - 

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - PRESENT 

           Zu opens her eyes. Justin Maloney is mid-monologue:

                                 JUSTIN 
                        I'm also allergic to nuts. And 
                        beans. If I have beans...whoosh, 
                        watch out - I mean get out. I'm 
                        allergic to Cool Ranch Doritos, 
                        too. Not regular nacho flavor - 

           Suzy glances back at Aubrey, Jenna and Molly, holding court 
           in the back of the bus to a rapt crowd of pre-teen girls.

           EXT. AQUARIUM OF NEW ENGLAND - TOUCH TANK AREA 

           All the tie-dye shirted Eugene Field students have clamored 
           around the touch tank, excited. Justin is so into the touch 
           tank, he’s almost in it. 

           An AQUARIUM EDUCATOR (20s) tries to keep the kids calm.

                                 AQUARIUM INSTRUCTOR
                        Remember! Hands flat, two fingers. 

           DYLAN PARKER (12, future convict but gorgeous) splashes the 
           girls with water and they all SCREAM like they might DIE.
                                 MRS. TURTON
                        Dylan Parker! Do you cow birthing?

           Zu keeps her distance - watching the spectacle of her class. 
           When no one is looking, she backs away from them and escapes.

           We TRACK with her as she finds a sign [with an arrow] for 
           “SHARKS & PREDATORS!” and follows it into....

           INT. AQUARIUM OF NEW ENGLAND - MAIN LOBBY

           ....the lobby, which boasts a massive floor-to-ceiling, two-
           story tank of sea life. (See: Aquarium of the Pacific.) 

           Zu hurries across the lobby towards SHARKS & PREDATORS, but 
           she stops abruptly because... 

           We see: a SMALL BLOOM OF ELECTRIC RED JELLYFISH (Atolla 
           Jellyfish) in the huge tank seem to be looking at her.  

           She walks a little closer and... yes, they are watching her. 
           They are congregated against the glass, facing out. 

           It’s creepy, but it’s also very beautiful.

           She puts her hand up to the glass and gives them a small 
           wave. Incredibly, the jellyfish move back and forth, as if 
           waving back. 

           Zu is stunned! She looks around; is anyone seeing this?? 

           No. THE TOURISTS to her left and right are on their phones. 
           She is alone with this magical moment. 

           She moves her hand a few feet to the right. They follow!

           She moves to her had a few feet to the left. They follow!

           Then: the jellyfish SHOOT ten feet to their right. 

           They wait until Zu catches up, then shoot ten feet further. 

           A game of follow the leader has developed, the jellyfish zig-
           zagging across the tank. Zu runs to keep up with them. 

           At the end of the tank, the bloom stops short. They can go no 
           further, but they clearly want Zu to see what she now sees... 

           INT. A DARK AND ABANDONED CORNER OF THE AQUARIUM

           ...a blocked-off room, concealed by curtains. A slight glow 
           emanating from within. A placard on the wall says: 
                                  IRUKANDJI: THE BEAUTIFUL ENIGMA

           Zu parts the curtains, and slips inside. 

           INT. IRUKANDJI EXHIBIT

           We see: a pitch dark room that contains a single tank in its 
           center. It’s made of very thick, magnified glass. 

           There is a large button below the tank and Zu presses it.

           Suddenly, A BLACK LIGHT illuminates the water - 

           We see: A DOZEN of what appear to be little baby jellies. 
           They look like delicate flowers. Little ballerinas, really. 

           A recorded voice (Male, Australian, which we will soon know 
           to be the voice of DR. JAMIE SEYMOUR) begins to play:

                                 RECORDED VOICE
                        Don't be fooled by their delicate 
                        appearance and tiny size; inside 
                        this tank are the most deadly 
                        creatures of the sea... the dreaded 
                        Irukandji Jellyfish, whose venom is 
                        among the most lethal in the world. 

           CLOSE on the Irukandji. So sweet-looking. Dainty. 

                                 RECORDED VOICE (CONT’D)
                        They live in large numbers off the 
                        coast of Australia, but unlike the 
                        rest of their box jellyfish family, 
                        who prefer the warm waters of the 
                        Pacific, these silent killers have 
                        begun to migrate over greater 
                        distances, and have begun appearing 
                        in Atlantic waters. This bloom was 
                        trapped off the coast of Maryland.

           ON Zu, listening. 

                                 RECORDED VOICE (CONT’D)
                        The few people who have survived a 
                        sting report symptoms that include 
                        excruciating headache, brain 
                        hemorrhage, and cardiac arrest. 

           On Zu, really listening.
                                 RECORDED VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Which is why most victims of the 
                        Irukandji bite will appear to have 
                        drowned. 

           Zu presses the button and plays it again. 

                                 RECORDED VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Which is why most victims of the 
                        Irukandji bite will appear to have 
                        drowned.

           Zu gets very close to the tank, her nose up to the glass. 

           There, in the water, we see it...

           A long red hair. One of Franny’s beautiful red hairs swirls 
           around the tank!

           Zu reels back, startled. Breathless. She looks again, and the 
           hair is gone, disappeared into the dark water.  

           Zu runs from the room, grabbing all the Irukandji pamphlets.   

           EXT. SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

           Zu sprints up to the bus where Mrs. Turton is waiting outside 
           the bus, not looking happy with her.

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        COME ON ZU, COME ON! We’ve been 
                        waiting ten minutes for you! 

           Zu gives Mrs. Turton her most apologetic look, slips onto ...

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS 

           ... where THE ENTIRE CLASS is glaring up at her. You suck.

           Zu does a long walk of shame down the aisle, enduring the 
           shaking heads and cruel eyes of her peers. 

           Someone throws a yogurt at the back of her head and it 
           breaks. Yogurt all through her hair. Everyone LAUGHS.

           Finally, she plops into the seat next to Justin. 

                                 JUSTIN
                             (tasting yogurt)
                        Mmm. Strawberry banana. 

           He hands her a tissue.
                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Hey where did you go in there? I 
                        thought we were going to study sea 
                        anemon- anemon- ma ma -
                        ...goddamnit.

           He sees the Irukandji pamphlets.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        O! Who are those cute little guys!? 

           Zu tucks the pamphlets away from his prying eyes - turns her 
           body away from his as much as she possibly can.

                        Partner means two, you know. Dos. 

           Zu pulls out a notebook, and, shielding it from him, writes:

                       HYPOTHESIS: FRANNY JACKSON WAS KILLED BY AN IRUKANDJI JELLYFISH.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I feel like maybe you just aren’t a 
                        nice person.

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Things don’t just happen. Maybe I 
                        could actually prove that. Maybe I 
                        could prove that there was a real 
                        villain in Franny’s story, a 
                        villain far worse than me. 

           The bus She underlines the words: Irukandji Jellyfish.

           The bus comes to a stop at a RED LIGHT, and Zu glances out 
           the window. Something catches her eye, and she sits forward. 

           We see: a Stop n’ Shop parking lot. 

           We see: A WOMAN (30s) crosses the lot, going in the store. Zu 
           raises her hand, as if to wave to her, or touch her somehow.  

           But then the bus pulls away and the woman’s gone. 

           INT. STOP N' SHOP - SOUTH GROVE, MASSACHUSETTS - DAY 

           THE WOMAN (30s) comes down the aisle with a shopping cart. We 
           don’t know yet, but this is NAOMI JACKSON. Franny’s mom.

           The lights are too bright, and this is still hard for her. 
           Being out in public. Trying to buy milk and bread. 
           She puts some cereal in her cart and continues along until - 
           she realizes she’s standing in the Baby Section. 

           We see: diapers, wipes, baby food, bottles, pacifiers. 

           We see: a beautiful freckly toddler on a box of baby soap.

           A beat.

           Naomi has a bursting desire to weep. But she forces herself 
           to continue down the aisle, not looking back. 

           She passes TWO MOMS (30s, Lululemon-ed out) who appear to be 
           engrossed in organic flour but are actually staring at her.

           Naomi meets their eyes, and both women quickly dart their 
           eyes back to the flour, pretending to be engrossed.

           INT. STOP N’ SHOP - CHECKOUT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Naomi with her cart at checkout, pawing through a magazine.

           In the next aisle over, we hear: the MOMS gossiping softly. 

                                 MOM
                        No, it was her. I’m sure of it.

                                 MOM #2
                        God. Poor woman. She looked awful.

                                 MOM
                        Of course she did. I mean...
                             (quietly)
                        Can you imagine? The guilt?

                                 MOM #2
                        Ugh. I can’t even think about it.
                             (then)
                        That’s why - God help me - I’m fine 
                        being a helicopter mom. If it means 
                        my kid’s not gonna drown, fine.

           Naomi abandons her cart mid-checkout and exits. Fast. 

           EXT. SUZY’S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING 

           The school bus doors open and Suzy climbs out. A trail of 
           paper airplanes and general pre-teen debris follow. 

           But as the bus pulls out of the frame... 
           We see: a shiny red Jeep in the driveway of her house. It has 
           Boston University and Red Sox stickers all over it. 

           For the first time since we’ve met Suzy, we see her smile.

           INT. SUZY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           She races in though the front door. Where is he? She hears 
           VOICES coming from upstairs, darts to the stairs... 

           INT. AARON’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           ...and flies into Aaron’s room, where we find Meg talking to 
           two handsome men who row crew: AARON and ROCCO (both 19).

           Zu tackles Aaron with a huge hug, crashing him onto the day 
           bed (which is covered with frilly pink throw pillow crap).

                                 AARON
                        Z! What's up, monkey?!

           She clutches her brother tightly. We see that she adores him.

                                 AARON (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I wanna introduce you to my 
                        friend here. This is Rocco.   

           Rocco offers his hand to Suzy, flashing a lovely smile. 

                                 ROCCO
                        You must be Z. Or does only Aaron 
                        get to call ya that?

           Zu doesn't answer, but Rocco does earn a shy smile.

                                 MEG
                        Don’t mind her silence. Suzanne’s 
                        in a bit of a shy period right now.

                                 AARON
                        Which I wish would end. You 
                        should’ve told me what this monster 
                        was doing to my bedroom, Z.

           We REVERSE to see: Aaron’s room is now a craft center. 
           Ribbons. Bows. Stickers. Glue guns. Mason jars. Faux fur.

                                 MEG
                        It’s not like I threw anything out. 
                        Your rowing machine’s in the garage 
                        with the kayaks. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MEG (CONT'D)
                        Everything else is in the closet, 
                        with Dad’s stuff that he still 
                        needs to pick up.

           Zu abruptly exits.

                                 AARON
                        Where’s she going? 

           INT. SUZY’S ROOM

           Suzy stuffs clothes into a backpack. She grabs the pillow off 
           her bed, books, pajamas. Her retainer. Most importantly: 
           Irukandji pamphlets. She can’t wait to tell Aaron about this!

           WE TRACK with her as she bolts out of her room and back to - 

           INT. AARON’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Suzy appears at the door, wearing her backpack, ready to go!

                                 AARON
                        Whoa! Going someplace, Z?

           She LAUGHS, like he’s made a joke. But he doesn’t seem to get 
           the joke. He looks confused.

                                 MEG
                        Oh. I think, you maybe uh...
                             (quietly)
                        You said something about maybe 
                        taking her back to your dorm for a 
                        sleepover. Last time you were here.

                                 AARON
                        ...Ohh.

           Aaron has clearly forgotten that. 

                                 AARON (CONT’D)
                        Shoot. I’m sure I said that, 
                        monkey, and I meant it, but we have 
                        an away race in the morning. And 
                        Rocco and I have a thing tonight...

           Zu's face falls. 

                                 MEG
                        Rocky, why don’t I show you that 
                        casserole dish I mentioned to ya.
                                 AARON
                        It’s Roc-co, Mom. Not Rocky, Rocco.

                                 MEG
                        Rocco, right. Like Morocco. 
                             (as they exit)
                        Have you been to Morocco, Rocco? 
                        Beautiful country. I hear. 

           Meg closes the door behind them.

                                 AARON
                        The first few weeks of college are 
                        crazy, Zu. I’m sorry. 

           He rumples her hair, lovingly. Her eyes are down.

                                 AARON (CONT’D)
                        Look, I know you’re miserable right 
                        now. And you’re supposed to be. Mom 
                        and Dad got divorced the same year 
                        your best friend died, AND you 
                        started junior high. I mean. Do you 
                        know how eff’ed up that is, Suzy Q?
                             (then)
                        But it won't always be like this. I 
                        promise. Things get way better.

                                 ROCCO (O.S.)
                        AARON? DO WE WANT A BROKEN FONDUE -- 

                                 MEG (O.S.)
                        HEIRLOOM FONDUE SET! HEIR-LOOM. 

                                 ROCCO (O.S.)
                        DO WE WANT AN HEIRLOOM FONDUE SET?

                                 AARON
                        We’ll put a sleepover on the books  
                        for October. Okay, kid? Gimme paw. 

           Suzy gives him paw (bops his hand) and he takes off. A moment 
           later we hear A DOOR CLOSE downstairs. 

           INT. SUZY’S ROOM - DAY

           From the window, we see: Aaron and Rocco emerge from the 
           house and head to Aaron’s JEEP, beaming at each other. 

           Aaron tries to toss the fondue set into the trash can; Rocco 
           faux-chastises him. Then Aaron spins and hook-shots the pot 
           into the trash. LAUGHING, the guys climb into the jeep. 
           Off the fondue in the trash, we flash to -- 

           INT. SUZY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - A COUPLE YEARS AGO 

           Meg, Aaron, and Zu (slightly younger) are seated around the 
           table wearing French berets. Jim appears with the fondue pot.

                                 JIM
                        Viola! Hot cheese for dinner!  
                             (re: fondue forks)
                        Alright - everyone chose a weapon.

                                 MEG
                        This smells amazing, honey.

                                 JIM
                        No, you smell amazing.

           Jim leans down and give Meg a long, wet kiss. They are very 
           adorably happy. Which, of course, the kids find revolting.

                                 AARON
                        Are you trying to make me throw up?

                                 MEG
                        You should be proud we love each 
                        other. That makes you a love child.

                                 AARON
                        Barf.

                                 ZU 
                        Can we eat the cheese soup now?

                                 JIM
                        First, a toast! To Fondue. It’s how 
                        I got your mother back to my 
                        apartment 19 years ago today.

                                 MEG
                        Well. “Apartment” is strong.

                                 JIM
                        One-room shanty. But still. It had 
                        a mattress. All we needed.

                                 AARON
                        For the Love of God. If not for me, 
                        for the young one.  

           But ZU is beaming at her parents, so deeply in love.
                                 JIM
                        Okay ready guys? On three!

           They all raise their forks. Four happy dorks in berets.

                                 EVERYBODY
                        One- two...

           INT. SUZY'S ROOM - PRESENT

           Zu lies on her bed, clutching her packed bag, going no where. 

           Aaron’s long gone. So is fondue. 

           Out her window, the sun has set.  

           INT. NAOMI JACKSON’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A “Hello Kitty” landline next to a child’s canopy bed RINGS. 

           It RINGS several times before a hand reaches for it.

                                 NAOMI
                             (groggy)
                        Hello?

           Naomi sits up in her daughter’s polka dot-themed bed, covered 
           in stuffed animals. She turns ON the bedside table light.  

           We see an empty wine bottle and glass on the table.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Suzy? Is that you? 
                             (then)
                        It’s okay, I’m awake.

           We hear: BREATHING on the other end.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s you, honey. You’re the 
                        only one who knows this number. 
                        Everyone else called her cell.

           We see Suzy in bed with a phone to her ear.

                        Is everything okay? 

           Silence. 

           Then we hear: A PHONE BUTTON PRESS ONE TIME. 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Just missing her?

           ...ONE PRESS.

           We see on Naomi’s face: a wash of utter anguish... 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Oh me, too, Zu. So much. I’m 
                        cuddled up with Fluffernutter as we 
                        speak. Want to say hi to him?

           ONE PRESS!

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)

                        and say hi. It’s Zu. Your favorite! 
                        It’s Zu, stinker butt.

           We hear: a DOG BREATHING and SNARFING.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        He doesn’t seem to want to talk

           INT. SUZY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS  

           Zu smiles. We hear: Naomi LAUGH a little on the other end. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Poor guy. I had to put him on doggy 
                        valium, Zu. He kept sitting by the 
                        door waiting for her. Just...

           Naomi’s voice cracks.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        ....24-7. Looking out. 

           Silence. They sit in silence together a long beat. 

           When Naomi speaks again, her voice is clearly tearful.
                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Is school going okay? You like 
                        seventh grade?

           ONE PRESS.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to come for that memorial 
                        thing in a few weeks. Everyone 
                        keeps telling me it’ll be good for 
                        me.  It’ll be good for you, Naomi. 

           Silence. 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Why do they say that, Zu? 
                             (then)
                        You think it’ll be good for us?  

           TWO PRESSES.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Me, neither.
                             (dark)
                        More people staring at me. 

           Silence.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you’ll be talking by then and 
                        you could say something about her 
                        at the memorial. That’d be nice. 

           Silence.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        She loved you so much, Zu. You were 
                        best friends, Since you were five 
                        yours old. 

           TWO PRESSES.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        What do you mean, “no”? Yes. You 
                        were best buds since you were five.

           A beat.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Zu? You still there, honey?

           Zu hangs up. A tear sneaks down her cheek. OFF her dark room - 
           INT. FRANNY’S BEDROOM - SIX MONTHS AGO - FLASHBACK

           We see: a FLASHLIGHT landing on Franny’s LAUGHING face.

           She’s striking a bitchy pose, pretending to be Jenna from 
           school. She’s wears a tin-foil “crown.” A hairbrush as a mic:

                                 FRANNY
                        Silence! I will now speak!

                                 SUZY
                        You look just like Jenna when you 
                        make that face!

                                 FRANNY
                        Silence! I, Jenna the Great, will 
                        now bestow upon you a performance 
                        in honor of my reign over the 
                        entire sixth grade.
                             (to Franny)
                        Minions: Molly! Aubrey! Press play!

           Franny signals Suzy, who gleefully pushes play on her iPhone, 
           and IGGY AZALEA’s “I’m so Fancy” plays LOUDLY.

           Suzy and Franny know every word, and co-rap surprisingly 
           well. This is a favorite song.

           There’s a KNOCK, and Naomi appears. She looks well. Happy. 

                                 FRANNY’S MOM
                        Girls. It’s 10:45 and I’ve got a 
                        double tomorrow. You have to stop 
                        being fancy. 

                                 FRANNY
                        Sorry, Mom.

                                 SUZY
                        Sorry, Miss Jackson. 

                                 FRANNY
                             (cueing Suzy:)
                        Yeah... “sorry Miss Jackson...”

                                 SUZY & FRANNY
                             (co-singing Outkast song)
                        “Ooo! I am for re-al!!
                        Never meant to make your daughter 
                        cry! I apologize a trillion times!”

                                 NAOMI
                        Go to sleep. I am for re-al.
           She kisses them both on the head and exits. 

           Franny and Suzy topple back onto the polka-dot themed canopy 
           bed, the best of friends.

                                 FRANNY
                        Hey. Will you do me a favor?

                                 SUZY
                        ‘course.

                                 FRANNY
                        Will you shoot me if I ever become 
                        like Jenna, Aubrey and Molly?

                                 SUZY
                        No. I’m anti-gun. 

                                 FRANNY
                        I’m serious. Do something then. 
                        Send me a signal. If I ever become 
                        like Jenna, Aubrey and Molly.

                                 SUZY
                        What kind of signal?

                                 FRANNY
                        I don’t know. Make it big. Get my 
                        attention. I don’t want to be like 
                        them, Suzy. Not ever. Promise me.

                                 SUZY
                        Okay. Promise. 

           OFF their entwined pinkies we cut back to - 

           INT. SUZY’S ROOM - PRESENT. 

           Zu closes her eyes in bed. Her ceiling goes BLACK.

           INT. EUGENE FIELD MIDDLE SCHOOL - COMPUTER LAB - PRESENT 

           It’s a bright, beautiful morning.

           Zu is at a computer, scrolling through photos of graphic 
           Irukandji bites. She makes notes. 

           Justin taps her on the shoulder. He has a worksheet.  
                                 JUSTIN
                        Um. Suzy? Mrs. Turton says we have 
                        to fill out this worksheet updating 
                        our progress on our evidence but -
                             (noticing)
                        - whoa, a jellyfish did that? Sweet 
                        Hell. Where’d his skin go?  

           We see on the screen: a picture of a leg covered in slashes. 
           Like the leg has been whipped. Tortured, down to the bone. 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Anyway I’m not sure what to write 
                        down because you don’t talk to me 
                        and you don’t seem to be doing any 
                        research on sea anem- anem-
                        whatevers and I feel like maybe 
                        you’re doing a secret hypothesis 
                        which isn’t very cool of you 
                        because we’re partners - God...

           Suzy’s has clicked on and BLOWN UP another photo. This one of 
           a woman’s FACE. She survived, but barely. Justin is woozy. 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        And I sorta feel like you should be 
                        including me in said secret 
                        hypothesis or else I’m gonna fail 
                        out of school and end up in a van 
                        down by the river and yep, I’m 
                        having an asthma attack... 

           Justin takes a hit of his inhaler, closing his eyes. 

           When he opens them, Zu is fanning him with the worksheet, a 
           hint of concern and sympathy in her eyes.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Can I please please help with our 
                        project, Suzy? 
                             (then)
                        There must be something I can do?

           Now that he’s okay, Zu stands and walks off, ignoring him.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Is that a no?

           INT. SUZY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Suzy, tucked into her bed (with the covers all the way to her 
           chin), pours over videos of jellyfish on YouTube. 
                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        A jellyfish, if you watch it long 
                        enough, begins to look like a heart 
                        beating. 

           They beat like a heart.

                                 SUZY
                        It’s their pulse, the way they 
                        contract swiftly, then release. 
                        Doesn’t matter what kind of 
                        jellyfish. The blood-red Atolla 
                        with its flashing siren lights or 
                        the near-transparent moon jelly.
                        They’re all like a ghost hearts. A 
                        heart you can see right through. 
                        Right into some other world where 
                        everything you ever lost has gone.

           Zu looks out her window at the sea. At the big, full moon.

           We hear: THUNK THUNK. Hearts beating out there in the ocean.

           We see: her hypothesis worksheet on her side table, the words 
           “Get Evidence” circled. 

                                 MEG (O.S.)
                        Wow. In bed already?  

           Zu startles and closes her laptop as Meg enters.

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

           Zu nods. Faux-yawns.

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        Okay. You sleep tight, pumpkin.

           Meg kisses her on the cheek and turns OFF the lights. 

           The moment she’s gone, Suzy throws off the covers.

           We see: She is fully clothed. She hops out of bed and pulls a 
           bulky backpack out from under her bed. Then a fishing pole. 

           EXT. SWANSON HOUSE - NIGHT

           Suzy climbs out of her bedroom window with her gear.  
                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        If anyone’s gonna believe me, I 
                        need to catch an Irukandji, and the 
                        only time to catch an Irukandji is 
                        at night, during a full moon. 

           She shimmies down the gutter, climbs on to her bike and rides 
           off through the silent sleeping town.

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        They light of the moon lures them 
                        to the surface. It’s the only time 
                        they’re ever vulnerable. 

           EXT. SOUTH GROVE BEACH - NIGHT

           Suzy rides her bike up to the empty beach in the middle of 
           the night, the CRASHING SURF the only sound. 

           She stows her bike behind a sand dune.

           She pulls a pair of high waders out of the backpack and 
           wiggles them on. She snaps and shakes some glow sticks. 

           Her face illuminated by the glow, she tapes the sticks 
           together and hooks them to the end of her fishing line.  

           Then, in her coup de grace, she extracts a Red Sox hat with 
           binoculars taped to the underside of the bill and places it 
           on her head, her eyes perfectly aligned to the binoculars.

           Net in one hand, fishing pole of glowing bait in the other, 
           Zu waddles towards the surf to begin her hunt for Irukandji.  

           EXT. COVE APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING 

           A run-down apartment complex on the edge of the beach. The 
           kind of place that’s fine in the summer but sad in off-
           season. An empty pool. A chain link fence. 

           Cove Beach is literally its backyard.

           EXT. NAOMI'S DECK - CONTINOUS

           Naomi, in her nursing scrubs, peers through the sliding glass 
           door towards the beach where she sees something... glowing?

           She strains to get a better look. Through the mist and spray 
           she sees a ghostly figure moving through the surf’s glow.

           Naomi disappears from the window. 
           EXT. COVE BEACH - CONTINOUS

           The water up to her waist now, Suzy is methodically sweeping 
           the glow sticks through the water.

           POV through her binoculars: a bloom of tiny thumb-size, 
           translucent white jellyfish appear by the glow sticks. 
           Irukandji! 

           Suzy catches her breath, begins to sweep the net towards it -

                                 NAOMI (O.S.)
                        FRANNY? FRANNY! 

           Startled, Suzy turns toward the beach. 

           Her POV veers widely through magnification of the binoculars 
           strapped to her hat.  For a moment she catches the sight of a 
           highly magnified NAOMI running towards the water and 
           screaming -

           A wave SMACKS Suzy from behind and she falls into the surf, 
           dropping her hunting tools as she goes down.  She tumbles 
           underwater, and the screen goes dark. WAVES CRASH.

           HANDS REACH DOWN and pull her up. 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Hold on to me! Hold on to me! 

           A struggle ensues as Suzy tries to get to her feet and Naomi 
           fights to pull her to shore.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        ...I've got you. I’ve got you, 
                        baby. You’re okay. 

           Suzy shoves Naomi off of her in frustration - she almost had 
           one. She looks back out at the surf, at the glow sticks 
           drifting out to sea. The jellyfish capture ruined.

           Naomi sees Suzy’s face clearly now. Realizing it’s her.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Suzy... 

           She falls back on the sand, her hands still shaking. 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        I thought you were someone else. 

           A beat. 
                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        I thought... I don’t know what I 
                        thought. What was I doing?

           With a sudden and almost scary abruptness, she starts to sob. 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing? Why the hell 
                        are you out here, Zu? 
                             (off Zu’s silence)
                        Answer me! Do you want to drown, 
                        too? 

           Zu gets up and RUNS AWAY.

           Naomi, wet, panting, is too exhausted to give chase -

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        ZU! WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE!

           INT. DR. LEGLER’S OFFICE - THERAPY - MORNING

           Dr. Legler’s got new tights on today. They’re a deep purple.

           She’s looking at us, expecting an answer.

                                 DR. LEGLER
                        Is this true, Suzanne? That you 
                        snuck out of the house in the 
                        middle of the night and went to 
                        Cove Beach? 

           We see: the fish tank. The dark waves lapping the glass. 

                                 DR. LEGLER (CONT’D)
                        Why did you do this?
                             (then)
                        Any idea?

           Jim and Meg, on their couch, look more worried than usual.

                                 JIM
                             (confidential)
                        It’s the beach where her friend 
                        drowned. I think that’s why. 

                                 MEG
                        She knows that, Jim. She was being 
                        rhetorical.
                                 DR LEGLER
                        It’s okay, Meg. We’re all in this 
                        process together, one step at a 
                        time.
                             (to Zu)
                        Were you looking for something at 
                        the beach, Suzanne? 

           We see: the books on Dr. Legler’s shelf: The Miracle of 
           Mindfulness. Loss and Grief. Overcoming Bedwetting Is Easy..

                                 DR. LEGLER
                        Were you looking for your friend?

           We see: the words on the spine of the books lift off, 
           shuffle, and rearrange so the books say: Loss of Mind. 
           Depression is Easy. The Bedwetting Miracle.

                                 DR. LEGLER (CONT’D)
                        Are you aware that you could’ve 
                        drowned or hurt yourself?

                                 MEG
                        Not to mention the horrible fright 
                        you gave Naomi, Zu.
                             (to Dr. Legler)
                        You should’ve heard this woman on 
                        the phone. Can you imagine? She 
                        thought it was Franny’s ghost, 
                        risen from the surf. 
                             (to Suzy)
                        You can’t do that to that woman, 
                        Zu. You have to let her grieve.

                                 DR. LEGLER
                        Is that what you were looking for 
                        out there, Suzanne? Your friend?

                                 MEG
                        We just want to understand. So we 
                        can get through this as a family. 

           Jim and Meg’s faces fill the frame. Big and open as the moon.

           INT. ELMER SUDS DINER - FLASHBACK - FALL OF LAST YEAR, NOV.

           A plate of pancakes land in front of Suzy. 

           We PAN UP to Meg & Jim’s faces. Big and open like the moon.

                                 MEG
                        Oh, good. Here comes your brother. 
           Aaron slides into the booth next to Suzy and says to her:

                                 AARON
                        Gimme paw, kid.
                             (they dap, then)
                        What’s this about? Why are you guys 
                        being so opaque and creepy? 

           Now Meg and Jim smile, in a creepy opaque way. 

                                 MEG
                        We have something we want to talk 
                        about with you guys. As a family. 

                                 JIM
                        And before we say it, I just want 
                        you to know that I think your mom 
                        is a very beautiful woman. She’s 
                        going to date again for sure.

                                 MEG
                             (you are an idiot)
                        You buried the lead, Jim.

                                 JIM
                        It’s going to be a very smooth 
                        transition for you kids. Your mom 
                        found me a great apartment.

                                 MEG
                        Hard wood floors, EIK, good light. 

                                 JIM
                        With a bedroom for both of you.

           Beat.

                                 AARON
                        I don’t understand. Are you guys 
                        getting divorced!?

                                 JIM
                        Let's stay calm, son.

                                 AARON
                        Do you know how crazy this is?! I’m 
                        leaving for college in the fall. 
                        This is supposed to be your victory 
                        lap. One down, one to go.

                                 JIM
                        Well. We aren’t feeling very 
                        victorious. Towards each other.  
                                 SUZY
                        But this doesn’t make any sense. 
                        You just celebrated your 
                        anniversary with that cruise.

                                 JIM
                        And it was a lovely memory we will 
                        both treasure forever. But we’d 
                        kind of prefer to take our next 
                        cruises... alone.

                                 MEG
                        Or with you guys!

                                 JIM
                        Or with new boyfriends. 

                                 MEG
                        Or with sluts who work at Costco.

           Beat.

                                 SUZY
                        I thought you guys loved each 
                        other. How did this happen?

                                 MEG
                        I don’t know. Sometimes things just 
                        happen, Zu. You know?

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - STILL IN FLASHBACK - MOMENTS LATER

           Suzy ‘s face on the bus, staring out the window. She’s still 
           stunned from the divorce bombshell her parents just dropped. 

           Her spirits lift as Franny plops down on the seat.

                                 SUZY
                        You’re not going to believe this. 
                        My parents just told me and Aaron 
                        that they’re getting a  - 

                                 FRANNY
                        Hey: who do you like? 

                                 SUZY
                        What?

           Franny scans the bus, too wrapped up in boy-garbage to notice 
           Suzy’s despair. 
                                 FRANNY
                        Boys. Who do you like?

                                 SUZY
                        No boys. Zero boys. 

                                 FRANNY
                        You have to like someone, Zu! We’ll 
                        be in middle school in September. 
                        You have to have an answer when 
                        people ask and they WILL ask.

           We hear the BOYS LAUGHING, the way they do in a big group. 

           CLOSE ON Dylan Parker, the cutest and meanest.

                                 SUZY
                        Why? Do you like someone?

           As if it’s the biggest secret ever, Franny points at Dylan. 

                                 SUZY (CONT’D)
                        Are you kidding me? DYLAN PARKER?!

                                 FRANNY
                        Shhhh!! Geezus Zu, quiet -

                                 SUZY
                        He’s a masochist. And a misogynist. 

                                 FRANNY
                        I don’t know those words. 

                                 SUZY
                        They mean AWFUL. He’s awful, 
                        Franny. And you’re awful if you 
                        like him. 

                                 FRANNY
                        God. What’s with you today? Geez. 

           Franny pulls out a compact and starts adjusting her intricate

           EXT. COVE APARTMENTS - SIDEWALK - AFTERNOON

           Zu pulls Justin up the walkway leading to Cove Apartments. 
           Justin holds a stack of pink index cards.

                                 JUSTIN
                        So I’m supposed to read these 
                        cards? To who? I don’t understand. 
                        And where are we? 
           They’ve arrived at a door and Zu knocks on it. 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Who’s house is this? 

           After a beat, Naomi comes to the door. Sun in her eyes.

                                 NAOMI
                        Zu? 
                             (then)
                        Who is this?

                                 JUSTIN
                        Justin Maloney, M’am. Kenneth and 
                        Joyce’s son, from over on Emerson.

           Those names don’t ring a bell. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Okay. Come in, I guess.

           INT. JACKSON HOME - KITCHEN 

           The kitchen is a mess. Dishes piled high in the sink. Flowers 
           that are so dead they are now wilted to black. 

           Zu and Justin sit at the kitchen table, Fluffernutter in Zu’s 
           lap, licking her face happily. Suzy pets his ears. 

           Naomi looks in the fridge for something - anything - to eat. 
           Finally, she gives up and brings them over some tap water.

                                 JUSTIN
                        By the way, I’m very sorry for you 
                        loss, M’am. She had such rad hair. 
                        I like red. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I like red, too.

                                 JUSTIN
                        That’s not written on any of the 
                        cards. I just wanted to say that. 

           Naomi smiles at him warmly, then looks like she might sob, 
           having two children her daughter’s age in her kitchen again. 

                                 NAOMI
                        ...so what can I do for you two?

                                 JUSTIN
                        Uh. Well. 
                             (reading)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JUSTIN (CONT'D)
                        We’re doing a science project and 
                        I’m Suzy’s lab partner. And I guess 
                        her voice, too. Like how Ursula 
                        speaks for Ariel in The Little 
                        Mermaid?
                             (then)
                        Anyway. Suzy has some inquiries. If 
                        you don’t mind. 

                                 NAOMI
                             (slightly irritated)
                        Isn’t enough enough already, Zu? 
                        With the no-talking?

           Zu looks down. Like her feelings are hurt. She pets 
           Fluffernutter behind the ears. 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Sorry...I’m tired today.
                             (then)
                        Go ahead, Justin. Ask away.

           Zu hands Justin some carefully-prepared pink index cards. 

                                 JUSTIN
                        Okay. Great. Question one.
                             (reading)
                        “What was the official...”

           He stops. Looks at Zu dubiously...

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I’m not sure we should ask this.

           Zu nods, yes we should. Justin turns back to Naomi.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                             (resuming)
                        “What was the official cause of 
                        Franny’s death? On her death 
                        certificate.”

                                 NAOMI
                        She drowned, Zu. You know that.

                                 JUSTIN
                             (consulting the card)
                        So: “Fluid in the lungs”? 

           Naomi nods, unsure where this is going. 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        “Any blood in the lungs or signs of 
                        hemorrhage?”
                                 NAOMI
                        No. 

                                 JUSTIN
                        “Any signs of cardiac arrest?” 

                                 NAOMI
                        No.

           This next card gives Justin real pause. He looks at Zu, 
           hesitant. Zu nods. Ask her. 

                                 JUSTIN
                        “Did you witness the accident?”

                                 NAOMI
                        No. I was going to meet her at the 
                        beach after I’d...
                             (beat)
                        After I’d had some coffee and 
                        loaded the dishwasher. 

                                 JUSTIN
                        “Did anyone see what happened?” 

                                 NAOMI
                        No. She was alone down there. 

           Naomi looks down. 

           Silence.

           Then, almost to herself - 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        I mean. Bill Carpenter saw her 
                        standing out there at low tide, in 
                        the waves, putting her goggles on.
                             (then)
                        But nobody saw her after that. 
                        Until her body washed up in the 
                        cove and scared those toddlers. 

                                 JUSTIN
                        “Were there any marks on her body? 
                        Anything that looked like...”

           Justin flips to the next card - sees what he’s supposed to 
           show Naomi - and stops. 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                             (to Suzy)
                        You want to show her that you can. 
                        I’m not doing that. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                             (to Naomi)
                        It was nice to meet you, Ms. 
                        Jackson. I’m uh... I’m sorry.

           He exits. 

           Naomi and Zu look at each other, from across the table.

           Then, Zu slides the index card (the one Justin refused to 
           show her) towards Naomi.

           We see: a picture of a child’s leg that’s been stung to hell 
           by Irukandji bites. Like it’s been whipped raw to the bone. 

           Naomi takes it in, processes. 

                                 NAOMI
                        ....is this why you were out there 
                        the other night in the water? You 
                        think a jellyfish killed Franny?

           Zu nods. Certain of it.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        Zu. I want you listen to me. 
                             (then)
                        Franny drowned in a rip tide. 
                        Or she drowned because she swam out 
                        too far.
                        Or she drowned because she choked 
                        on that gum she was always chewing.
                        We don’t know why she drowned but 
                        we know that she drowned, honey. 
                        While her mother was loading the 
                        goddamn dishwasher. No one heard 
                        her cry and no one saved her and 
                        she drowned.

           Zu shakes her head, pointing at the card - no, you don’t 
           understand. But Naomi pushes the card back, firmly: 

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to have to ask you to 
                        leave right now, Zu. I’m sorry...I 
                        can’t. 
                             (upset)
                        But you have to go, honey. 

           OFF Naomi’s bereft face, we MATCH CUT to -

           EXT. THE COVE APARTMENT - OUTSIDE THE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Justin’s innocent face as he waits outside.  As Zu arrives:
                                 JUSTIN
                        Are you crazy? You can’t show a 
                        grieving mother that medieval crap. 
                        Even I know that. Jesus, Suzy.

           Suzy walks right past him, distracted by the sound of 
           CHILDREN PLAYING ... 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        And I am going to request the right 
                        to PREVIEW all material in the 
                        future. That was really uncool, 
                        springing those pink cards on me - 

           Suzy bolts around the side of the apartment building. 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Suzy? Where are you going? 

           Justin follows, confused, and as we TRACK with him and turn 
           the corner of the building we cut to - 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        SUZY!

           EXT. SOUTH GROVE BEACH AT LOW-TIDE - CONTINUOUS  

           A group of A DOZEN OR SO TODDLERS are playing in the surf. 
           They are throwing crabs at each other and splashing around 
           while THEIR PARENTS (30s) chat with their Starbucks nearby. 

           We see: Suzy sprinting towards the beach, waving her arms in 
           alarm, signaling: GET OUT OF THE WATER! NO SWIMMING!!

           We stay with Justin, and from his POV: we see her run into 
           the water, fully clothed. She starts yanking and pulling the 
           children out of the water and rushing them to safety on the 
           sand.

           We see: the mothers all go red-alert: Don’t touch my child! 
           What the hell’s wrong with you? Get away from her/him! 

           OFF Zu, thrashing in the water, realizing a beach-full of 
           adults have decided she is mentally unhinged -- 

           INT. CAFETERIA - FLASHBACK - NINE MONTHS AGO, LAST DECEMBER 

           Franny and Suzy on the lunch line. Dylan Parker is a ahead of 
           them, messing around with THREE PALS. He turns and looks 
           Franny up and down, approvingly. She’s hot.
           (And she is now. Franny has started blowing her hair out 
           straight. Her glasses replaced by contacts. Clothes tight.)

           Zu glares at Dylan, and he gives her a look like, what’s your 
           problem? Like she’s mentally unhinged. 

                                 FRANNY
                        BTW. I saw the cutest pair of Chuck 
                        Taylors at the mall yesterday.

                                 SUZY
                        ....are you talking to me? 

                                 FRANNY
                        Yeah. Obvi.

                                 SUZY
                        No, not “obvi” because you aren’t 
                        looking at me - you’re looking at 
                        Dylan Parker. And I dunno who Chuck 
                        Taylor is, “btw.”

                                 FRANNY
                        Chuck Taylors are sneakers. It’s 
                        super-cute you don’t know that.

           ON Zu. Did she just say “super-cute”? As if to confirm Franny 
           is now an alien, Jenna appears next to them.

                                 JENNA
                        Frances. We’d like to invite you to 
                        join our lunch table today.

                                 FRANNY
                        ....really?

                                 JENNA
                             (congratulations)
                        Really. 

                                 FRANNY
                        Wow, that’s so cool. I mean. So 
                        long as there’s room for Suzy, too? 

           Jenna looks Suzy up and down, assessing. 

                                 JENNA
                        ...sure. Shouldn’t be a problem.

                                 FRANNY
                        Great, we’ll be right over! Stat! 
                        Not stat. That’s a weird thing to 
                        say. My mom’s a nurse, sorry.
                                 JENNA
                        No, I’m into it. Stat. 
                             (warmly)
                        See you “stat,” girl.

           Jenna smiles and walks off. Suzy leans into Franny: 

                                 SUZY
                        Are you kidding me? We are not 
                        sitting at the Barbie table. 

                                 FRANNY
                             (stunned)
                        I can’t believe she knows my name. 

                                 SUZY
                        She doesn’t know your name. No 
                        one’s called you Frances in the 
                        history of your whole life. 

                                 FRANNY
                        Come on. Do I look okay?

                                 SUZY
                        YO! Earth to Franny. I’m not 
                        sitting there. What’s wrong with 
                        our usual table? I like it there. 

           We see: the dork table. Kids dressed as wizards playing 
           Magic: The Gathering and building a rice cake tower. 

                                 FRANNY
                        Can’t you just try, Zu?  Please?

           A beat. Zu takes in Franny’s excited, hopeful face. 

                                 SUZY
                        Fine. 

           Gleeful, Franny rushes over. Zu follows begrudgingly. 

           AT THE COOL TABLE: 

           Jenna has make-up out and is working on Aubrey’s face. Zu and 
           Suzy slide into the two open seats. 

                                 FRANNY
                        Hey! What’d I miss? 

                                 AUBREY
                        Jenna’s 80th contour tutorial. 

                                 JENNA
                        Defining your cheekbones is goals.
                                 FRANNY
                        Wow. You’re good at that. My face 
                        would just look dirty if I tried.

                                 JENNA
                        You just need the right products. 
                        We should all go to Sephora today! 

                                 MOLLY/AUBREY
                        Yesssss!/ For sure! 

           Franny beams. This is the best day of her life.

                                 JENNA
                        When are you out of ballet, Moll?

                                 MOLLY
                        Four. But I can’t go in public. The 
                        plastic wrap makes me so sweaty. 

                                 SUZY
                        You wear plastic wrap? To ballet?

           A beat. Everyone is surprised Suzy has addressed them.

                                 AUBREY           
                        She wears plastic wrap under her 
                        tights, so she sweats more. 

                                 SUZY
                        Why would you want to sweat more?

                                 JENNA
                             (duh)
                        So her skinny jeans fit better. 

                                 SUZY
                        Then you should put plastic wrap on 
                        your feet. We have the most sweat 
                        glands in our feet, you know.

           The three vipers stare at her.

                                 SUZY (CONT’D)
                        Fun trivia: sweat is also 
                        completely sterile when it leaves 
                        the body. Just like pee. Did you 
                        know that? Everyone thinks pee is 
                        gross, but it’s actually totally 
                        clean. Some people even drink it.

           The table has gotten very quiet. Mouths are agape.
                                 FRANNY
                             (fake laugh)
                        She’s joking. People don’t drink 
                        pee.

                                 SUZY
                        Sure they do. They drink it in 
                        emergencies or for health reasons.

           The girls are trying not to laugh, but this is too much. 

                                 SUZY (CONT’D)
                        Like butterflies. They drink their 
                        pee to get salts and minerals. And 
                        other animals communicate with 
                        urine. Send each other messages -- 

           Jenna stands up, which means the others do, too.

                                 JENNA
                        Well...we gotta get going, I think. 
                             (to Franny)
                        See you later, yeah? 

                                 FRANNY
                        Definitely. Let me know if you hit 
                        Sephora. I’m so in. 

           The three of them turn and exit, whispering amongst 
           themselves. Franny turns to Zu, furious. 

                                 SUZY
                        What? 

           OFF Zu’s genuinely confused face...

                                 A YOUNG VOICE  (PRE-LAP)
                        The next thing that happens is A 
                        FUNGUS takes over the ant's brain, 
                        controlling what the ant thinks.

           INT. MRS. TURTON’S SCIENCE CLASS - THE PRESENT 

           A student, SAMIRA NASRI, is mid-presentation. A picture of an 
           ant on the smart-board behind her: 

                                 SAMIRA NASRI
                        It makes the ant do things that no 
                        ant would do otherwise. The fungus 
                        turns ants into actual zombies.

           Justin is gripped by Samira's presentation. He leans to Zu:
                                 JUSTIN
                        Zombie ants? Why didn’t we do our 
                        presentation on this?? 

           The rest of the students don't look as bored as usual.

           ON Suzy, looking nervous. She pours over a small stack of 
           pink index cards in her hands, under the desk.

                                 SAMIRA NASRI
                        The ant stumbles away from the 
                        colony like a drunk.  Until now 
                        everything the ant did was for the 
                        good of the colony, but not 
                        anymore.

                                 JUSTIN
                             (whispering to Suzy)
                        I think Samira's presentation is 
                        way better than ours. Wayyy better. 

                             (off her look)
                        You ok?  

           We see: Suzy’s hands shaking, holding the index cards. 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                             (to Suzy)
                        You gonna be able to do this? You 
                        have to speak for us to pass. 

           Suzy nods weakly. 

                                 SAMIRA NASRI
                        When the ant dies a stalk begins 
                        growing out of his head.

           Samira clicks and a time lapses video appears of a desiccated 
           ant with a stick growing from it's corpse.

                                 JUSTIN
                        HO-LY SCHNIPPERS...

                                 SAMIRA NASRI
                        Then one day that stalk explodes 
                        raining spores down on a new colony 
                        and a new generation of zombie ants 
                        are born.  Thank you.

           The class claps politely. Justin leaps up clapping furiously.

                                 JUSTIN
                        BRILLIANT!  JUST BRILLIANT!
           Mrs. Turton is sitting way in the back of the classroom.

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        Excellent job, Samira. Thank you.
                             (referring to her list)
                        OK. Justin and Suzy. Get up here 
                        and tell us about sea anemones.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Actually, we switched to killer 
                        jellyfish. At least, I think we 
                        did. Honestly, I have no idea what 
                        we’re doing. She doesn’t give me  
                        my lines until right before.

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        Killer jellyfish? I sense a theme 
                        today. Can't wait. OK, sally forth.

           Justin gets up but Suzy stays seated.

                                 JUSTIN
                             (whispers)
                        Come on. It’s go time. 

           Suzy takes a deep breath and they make their way to the front 
           of the room. She hands Justin some pink index cards and keeps 
           some for herself. She presses the smart-board control and  - 

           And the first slide comes up: a pic of Irukandji jellyfish. 
           Justin begins, reading from his card. 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Okay. So um this might not look 
                        like much, but the uh... 
                             (sounding it out)
                        Ir-u-kon-gee jellyfish is one of 
                        the most lethal and poisonous jelly 
                        fish in the world. If not the most 
                        lethal! And our hypothesis is...
                             (then)
                        That these deadly creatures have 
                        invaded South Grove Beach.

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        South Grove Beach, our town beach?

                                 JUSTIN
                        Correct. That’s our hypothesis 
                        heretofore, your eminence.

           Suzy hits the next slide: "HYPOTHESIS: The deadly Irukandji 
           has invaded South Grove beach."
                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        And now, my esteemed colleague will 
                        present our evidence. Take it away, 
                        Suzy. 

           Justin gives Zu the floor. She looks very, very nervous.

           We see: thirty SEVENTH GRADERS staring at her, slight concern 
           on their faces about the invading jellyfish. 

           We see: Molly, Jenn and Aubrey smiling fake smiles.

           We see: Mrs. Turton, thinking their hypothesis is unlikely...

           Zu clicks next slide: a picture of the melting North Pole.

           Zu is supposed to talk but she does not. 

           Justin improvs. He gently takes the card from her and reads: 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        We uh... present to the jury 
                        evidence #1: Global Warming. 
                        Irukandji jellyfish are migrating 
                        from Australia in increasing 
                        numbers because global warming is 
                        changing the temperatures of the 
                        world’s oceans.
                             (then)
                        Back to you, Suzy.

           But Zu is still frozen. 

           Justin takes the remote, clicks to the next slide: a giant 
           bloom of jellyfish clogging a beach at low-tide.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                             (to Suzy)
                        Want to tell them about the 
                        increase in blooms in the Atlantic?

           Suzy is trying to speak, but nothing is happening. 

           We see: that polar bear, the saddest one in the world, from 
           YouTube again. His lips moving, no sound coming out. 

           We see: Dylan Parker miming taking a piss in the corner.

           We see: Molly, Jenn and Aubrey whispering and giggling.

           We see: the whole class as a bloom of jellyfish.

           We see: the whole class as a group of zombie ants. 
                                 MRS. TURTON
                        Do you need a second, Suzy?

                                 JUSTIN
                        No, she’s fine. Evidence #2 - 

           But Suzy grabs the remote in a panic and clicks quickly 
           through the PowerPoint presentation - skipping ahead. 

           Justin’s not sure what she’s doing, until:  

           She stops on the final image. A picture of Franny Jackson. 

           She clicks again and text appears beneath Franny's picture: 
           “Evidence #5: Franny Jackson killed by Irukandji sting.”

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        OK. Stop - stop right there. Justin 
                        and Suzy, sit down.

                                 SAMIRA
                        ....What does that say?

                                 PANICKED STUDENTS
                        Franny Jackson was stung by a 
                        jellyfish??/ Oh my God./ She was? 

           Mrs. Turton is making her way to the front to shut this down. 

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        Someone unplug the PowerPoint!  

                                 HIMKAR 
                        I thought Franny drowned. 

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        That’s what I’m saying! NO! She 
                        didn’t! She didn’t drown!

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        JUSTIN. SUZY. SIT DOWN. 

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        But they aren’t listening to me! If 
                        they would just LISTEN TO ME - 

           Zu is incensed and determined. She points emphatically at 
           Franny's picture and opens her mouth to speak...

           HOLD ON HER OPEN MOUTH.
                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Interesting fact. When you don't 
                        use your vocal cords for two 
                        months, and then you suddenly try 
                        to use them to shout, this is what 
                        happens.

           Suzy emits a strangled, hoarse, almost animal cry of protest. 
           Like a bird’s CAW, a wolf’s HOWL, and a human ORGASM at once. 

           It’s a horrible, guttural sound. 

           And it’s met with: utter silence from class. Mouths agape.

           A beat. Then - 

           The class ERUPTS into hysterical LAUGHTER.

           Aubrey, Jenna and Molly laugh hardest. OFF them, we cut to - 

           EXT. ROCK LAKE - FLASHBACK - FOUR MONTHS AGO, IN MAY - NIGHT

           - the four laughing faces of Molly, Aubrey, Jenna and Franny, 
           lit by a nearby bonfire. We’re at a camp out in the woods. A 
           Ranger’s sign down by the lake says, ROCK LAKE. 

           We see: the four girls are in front of a huge group of SIXTH 
           GRADERS, all of whom are laughing and pointing at Zu. 

           We see why: Suzy is cradling a dead frog in her hands. 

           Franny’s LAUGHING FACE almost looks demonic. 

                                 FRANNY
                        Freak-show.

           All the SIXTH GRADERS start to chime in, chanting while they 
           point at Suzy:

                                 SIXTH GRADERS
                        FREAK SHOW FREAK SHOW FREAK SHOW 
                        FREAK SHOW FREAK SHOW FREAK SHOW -

           INT. MRS. TURTON'S SCIENCE CLASS - CONTINOUS - PRESENT

           The whole class is still LAUGHING and pointing at Suzy.

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        OKAY. Quiet down, everyone - that’s 
                        enough. I mean it. 

           Justin puts his arm around Zu, gently. 
                                 JUSTIN
                        Come on, Suzy - let’t sit down.

                                 DYLAN PARKER
                        Ew! Don’t touch her, Maloney! 
                        You’ll get Rabies or whatever the 
                        eff that was. 
                             (imitating her cry/howl)
                        “ERRRRRGGGGKKK!!!” 

           Everyone in the class LAUGHS. Dylan’s imitation is spot on. 

                                 JUSTIN
                        Why don’t you shut up, Dylan 
                        Parker. 

           Whoa. A record just scratched.

                                 DYLAN PARKER
                        ....what?

                                 JUSTIN
                        You’re just a big Zombie Ant, you 
                        know that? You’re all a bunch of 
                        big dumb zombie ants -  

           But he doesn’t finish his sentence because Dylan Parker 
           pushes Justin hard, and he falls back over a desk. 

           The class erupts into CHAOS. Girls SCREAM. Boys yell 
           “FIGHT!!!” Mrs. Turton screams for everyone to calm down, but 
           we don’t hear any of this because the SOUND CUTS OUT and we 
           stay on Zu... 

           INT. PRINCIPAL HALL'S OFFICE - FEW HOURS LATER

           ....as she takes a seat in the Principal’s office.  

           She is ringed by PRINCIPAL HALL (40s, stern), Jim, Meg, and 
           Mrs. Turton.

           Mrs. Turton is speaking, but there’s no sound.  

           Meg and Jim are agreeing, but there’s no sound.

           Zu looks out the Principal’s cracked door, and we see a 
           sliver of Justin waiting for her in the hall. Leaning against 
           the lockers, an ice pack to his lip.

           We hear: the crisp tissue in Meg’s lap. CRUMPLE. CRUMPLE.

           We hear: the car keys that her father is nervously jingling 
           in his hand.  JINGLE. JINGLE.
           We hear: Hall’s pen, writing in a file. SCRIBBLE SCRIBBLE. 

           Meg taps Suzy’s knee, indicating she should pay attention. 

           A beat. 

           All the adults look at Zu, expecting an answer to some 
           unheard question.

           A beat. 

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        Come on, Suzy.

                        Why don’t I take you back to class.

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - CONTINOUS 

           Justin stands up as Mrs. Turton and Suzy arrive. 

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        Shouldn’t you be in lunch, Justin?

                                 JUSTIN
                        They expelled Dylan Parker for 
                        pushing me. So no, I can’t show my 
                        face in lunch ever again.

           Mrs. Turton can’t help it, she laughs and gives the top of 
           his head a little love-pat.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        So we got an A today, am I right?

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        No. You did not get an A, Justin. 
                        But I will accept a written paper 
                        about sea anemones. With a 
                        hypothesis you actually support. 

                                 JUSTIN
                        How do you know we didn’t support 
                        the jellyfish claim? You didn’t get 
                        to hear the rest of it. 
                             (then)
                        I mean, I didn’t either. But Zu 
                        worked really hard on it, Ms. T.

           Mrs. Turton regards Zu patiently, kindly. Tries to make this 
           a teaching moment.
                                 MRS. TURTON
                        You know the scientific method, Zu. 
                        If you were to successfully prove 
                        that a rare jellyfish was here in 
                        South Grove, you’d need evidence. A 
                        specimen. Or an expert to back up 
                        your claim. You’d need his or her 
                        scientific analysis and testimony. 

                                 JUSTIN
                        A jellyfish expert? That’s not a 
                        thing. 

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        Stick to sea anemones. 
                             (gently)
                        Due next Monday, okay?

                                 JUSTIN
                        Thanks, Miss T. Sounds great. 
                        Doesn’t it, Suzy?
                             (then)
                        Suzy?

           She has already taken off down the hall, excited. 

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        That’s what I need. A jellyfish 
                        expert. The question was, how would 
                        I get one?

           OFF Justin as he watches her disappear, yet again. 

           INT. SUZY’S ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Zu throws herself into the desk at her chair, opens up Google 
           on her computer and types:

           “Jellyfish Experts”

           A bunch of results pop up, pages and pages of results. 

           Zu starts scrolling through them, but there are too many. She 
           goes back to the google homepage, and adds:

           “Irukandji Jellyfish Expert”

           A PAUSED VIDEO comes up, looking like a news desk of some 
           sort. She clicks on it. 
           EXT. A BEACH IN FLORIDA - CONTINOUS

           KIP (30s, windbreaker, bad newscaster hair) stands on a dock 
           with a sizable crowd. Wind whips his hair. He points to:

           DIANA NYAD (64, very muscular, not at all grandmotherly) on 
           the edge of a dock. She adjusts her goggles and cap.

                                 KIP
                         ...live on the scene this morning 
                        with champion long distance swimmer 
                        Diana Nyad as she attempts to make 
                        the daring and dangerous swim from 
                        Florida to Cuba. 

           Diana waves to the crowd and flexes her biceps. Diana yanks a 
           silicone mask over her face. It’s super creepy (google it).

                                 KIP (CONT’D)
                        She’s been fitted with a new 
                        silicone mask designed to protect 
                        her face from jellyfish stings, 
                        which is what ended her last 
                        attempt in 2009.

           We see: old photos of Diana's face on the screen, blistered 
           and swollen beyond recognition by jellyfish bites.

           Yikes! Suzy leans towards her monitor, getting a better look - 

           EXT. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN CUBA AND FLORIDA - CONTINUOUS

           Suzy is suddenly next to Nyad, on a big swan floatie. She 
           holds a microphone, like she is reporting to us on the news:

                                 SUZY 
                        Potential expert #1. Advantages: 
                        Has firsthand expertise with 
                        jellyfish stings. Could be useful 
                        as an expert. Also, she looks 
                        tough. Might be good to have 
                        someone tough helping me. 

           Suzy and Nyad are suddenly surrounded by a ring of jellyfish.

                                 SUZY (CONT’D)
                        Disadvantages: She seems to be some 
                        sort of a jellyfish magnet. And 
                        she’s a horror movie in that mask.

           Nyad turns towards Suzy, wearing the freaky, scary silicone 
           mask, a swarming jellyfish bloom climbing up behind her...

                        about today?  

           Suzy’s swan floatie starts rapidly deflating...

                                 DR. LEGLER (CONT’D)
                        Maybe what happened in Science 
                        class yesterday? Suzanne?

           OFF Zu sinking into the water, we cut to - 

           INT. THERAPY BUILDING - CONTINUOUS - PRESENT

           Dr. Legler blinks at us, expecting us to talk. 

           We see her cross and re-crosses her legs. She’s wearing weird 
           tights again. Plaid this time. 

                                 DR. LEGLER
                        I understand a lot of students were 
                        upset by your presentation.
                             (then)
                        They were bullies about it?

           Silence.

                                 DR. LEGLER (CONT’D)
                        Suzy, your parents aren’t here 
                        today, as you can see. They aren’t 
                        here because I have to fill out an 
                        assessment form on you for your 
                        school. About how I think you’re 
                        coping with all this. 
                             (then)
                        How do you think you’re coping?

           We see: the form in her lap. Boxes that are not yet checked.

                                 DR. LEGLER (CONT’D)
                        I understand you had a bullying 
                        incident last spring, too, at Rock 
                        Lake. The sixth grade retreat? 
                             (no answer)
                        Did it make you angry? Did it make 
                        you want to scream? 

           Dr. Legler has decided to take another tactic today:
                                 DR. LEGLER (CONT’D)
                        DO. YOU. WANT. TO. SCREAM?!

           EXT. ROCK LAKE - FLASHBACK - FOUR MONTHS AGO, IN MAY 

                                 DYLAN PARKER
                        BLUE 52! BLUE 52! HUT HUT HIKE! 

           Dylan Parker and KEVIN (12, big forehead, feral eyes) are 
           tossing something back and forth in front of a SMALL CROWD. 

           Franny is standing a couple feet away with Aubrey, Jenna and 
           Molly, delighted. Their hands on their hips, laughing.

           Suzy abruptly enters the frame, goes right up to Franny.

                                 SUZY
                        Make him stop! He’s gonna kill it!

           Aubrey, Jenna and Molly exchange a look. Ugh, her again.

           We see why Zu is upset: it’s A FROG Dylan and Kevin are 
           playing catch with. 

           We see: the poor frog is tying to hop out of Dylan’s hand, 
           but it’s too beat up to stand. It’s suffering. 

                                 SUZY (CONT’D)
                        He’s just doing it to impress you. 
                        If you tell him to stop, he will.

           Dylan arrives at their side, wiggling the animal in Franny’s 
           face. Franny SQUEALS, pushing him away, loving the attention. 

                                 SUZY (CONT’D)
                        Dylan!

                                 DYLAN
                        Kiss it! Make it a prince, Frances. 

                                 FRANNY
                             (coy)
                        Ew! Don’t touch me with that thing!  

                                 DYLAN
                             (as the frog)
                        “Come on, kiss me, Frances. Give me 
                        a big, wet french kiss, baby!” 

           Franny pushes him away coquettishly and without a word, Dylan 
           turns and bunts the frog as hard as he can into a tree.
           We hear: A JUICY CRACK as it splats against the tree. The 
           kids scream and laugh, crying “Gross!” “Ew!” “Nasty!”

                                 SUZY
                        NOOO! YOU STUPID JERK! 

           Suzy runs over to pick up the mangled frog, cradling it in 
           her hands. The campground FALLS SILENT. All eyes on Suzy.

                                 SUZY (CONT’D)
                        It’s a life! You just stole a life, 
                        Dylan. Don’t you care about it’s 
                        life? 

                                 DYLAN
                        No. It’s a frog, you weird little 
                        freak show.

                        When she was a young woman, Dr. 
                        Yanagihara was stung by a box 
                        jellyfish. Barely made it to shore 
                        before blacking out.

           Dr. Yanagihara tapes the mouse belly-up to a table in her 
           laboratory and shaves the fur off his belly. 

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Since then, she’s developed the 
                        first-ever treatment for stings.

           She fills a long injection needle. Turns towards the camera.
                                 DR. YANAGIHARA
                             (no emotion)
                        I will now inject the mouse with 
                        box jellyfish venom.

           The cute little mouse contorts in fear as Dr. Yanagihara 
           lowers the needle towards its gut.

           POV of MOUSE as the needle bears down. The mouse SQUEAKS.

           From the POV of a wobbly, hand-held camera we MOVE IN on 
           Jamie, as he emerges from the water, clutching his lip. 

                                 JAMIE
                        He got me. Bugger got me.  

                                 HIS CREW MEMBERS
                        GET THE VINEGAR!/ He’s stung!/ GET 
                        THE GODDAMN VINEGAR!

                        ALERT EMS ON THE SATELLITE PHONE!

                                 JAMIE
                        He just brushed me, I might live.
                             (laughing)
                        Little bugger, got me right in the 
                        kisser. One place I was exposed. 
                             (relaxed)
                        Let’s get to hospital. My pulse is 
                        starting to race. Throat closing. 

           The crew members start dousing him with vinegar solution, 
           sitting him down and taking his wet suit off. 

           We stay on Jamie, who speaks directly to the hand-held. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        I won’t be able to breathe in about 
                        eight minutes, and the vomiting 
                        will start any minute now.

           We see the boat take off, speeding back towards land, and 
           Jamie starts projectile vomiting off the side -

                        As Jamie's condition rapidly 
                        deteriorates his crew races him to 
                        shore. Hoping against hope that 
                        doctors could save his life!

           INT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - HOSPITAL - QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA 

           We see Jamie writhing in pain in a hospital bed now. All the 
           monitors BEEPING; his vitals are all CRASHING. 

           Jamie, curled in a ball, turns to the hand-held camera:

                                 JAMIE
                        Yeah. Pain level’s about an 11 
                        right now. On a scale of 1 to 10. 
                        Not very comfortable, no. 
                             (laughs)
                        But you should see the other guy!

           He holds the test-tube up again. Zu is rapt by him. 

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Jamie Seymour isn't like Dr. 
                        Yanagihara, who stung a mouse and 
                        then watched it die. Jamie Seymour 
                        is the mouse. The Irukandji 
                        inflicted great pain on him...

           Jamie peers into the test-tube with empathy. Curiosity.

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        But he doesn’t hate them. He wants 
                        to understand them.

           Meg pops her head into Zu’s room, and she slams her laptop. 

                                 MEG
                        After midnight, honey. You know the 
                        drill. Chop chop. Get in bed.

           Zu climbs into bed, pulls the covers up. Meg kisses her.

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        I got a note from the school about 
                        Franny’s memorial. Coming up in a 
                        few days, huh?

                        Your Dad and I are both gonna take 
                        a day off from work, and come. 
                        Would you like that?
                             (no answer/beat)

                        Okay. We can talk about it later, 
                        sugar pie. Good night.

           Meg closes the door and the screen goes BLACK.

           We see: the frog contorting in pain.

           We see: the mouse contorting in pain.

           We see: Jamie contorting in pain.

           We see: the spit falling from Franny's cruel face.

           We see: the frog hitting the tree.

           We see: Jamie’s kind eyes, wanting to understand jellyfish.  

           Suzy turns ON her light, grabs her laptop and starts to type.

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Dear Doctor Jamie Seymour. After 
                        considerable research and much 
                        deliberation, I’ve decided that you 
                        are the jellyfish expert I am most 
                        interested in speaking with.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING

           Suzy getting her books from her locker.

                        I’m writing I'm writing to report 
                        an Irukandji sighting in the South 
                        Grove, Mass. Please contact me as 
                        soon as possible, Dr. Seymour.

           We hear: the WHOOSH! Sound of a sent e-mail, just as Justin 
           slides up next to her locker.  

                                 JUSTIN
                        Hey. Asking for no real reason, but 
                        you haven’t been on line in the 
                        last 24 hours, have you?

           Zu looks at him.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Just. Might be some content you 
                        don’t need to see. If you smell 
                        what I’m stepping in.
           Suzy gives him a knowing look.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Oh. You've already seen?

           She nods.

           We see: videos of her ANIMAL CRY in Science class.

           We see: her Facebook wall’s endless tags of photos of her, 
           standing in front of the class, terrified and angry.

           We see: all the posts about #PeeGirl #freakshow #pathetic. 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t see the meme, did you?

           We see: a meme of her emotional outburst during her 
           presentation, with vomit shooting out of her mouth.  

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        They’re just a bunch of idiots who 
                        we won’t even remember at our 
                        reunion. Which we won’t even go to 
                        cause we’ll be too busy heli-skiing 
                        on the mountain that we own. 

           Suzy shoots him a look.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Not “we” like we own the mountain 
                        together. Like, each of us have our 
                        own mountains. Near each other.   

           Suzy shoulders her book bag and SLAMS her locker, taking off.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)

                        didn't get my first email. 
                        Following up again. Send. [Whoosh!]

           She passes a gauntlet of girls MOCKING HER CRY and staring.

           Suzy enters and sees that the mean meme is up on the 
           SmartBoard, a prank for all to see. Zu holds her head high.

           Suzy enters the locker room, just as Jenna, Molly and a 
           GAGGLE OF GIRLS finish doing something mean to her backpack.

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Jamie, it’s Suzy again, from Eugene 
                        Field Middle School. Hit me back 
                        when you can. Okay, pal? [Whoosh!]

           They girls watch as Zu picks up her backpack. Someone has 
           drawn a huge cartoon Jellyfish and the words: “#FREAKSHOW.” 

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Look, I really can’t do this 
                        without you, Dr. Seymour. There is 
                        death and destruction here!  The 
                        Irukandji  have unleashed a blood-

           INT. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

           Zu and Justin at a library table in a quiet corner. She 
           presses a pink index card into his hand.

                                 JUSTIN
                        No, I told you: I’m not doing this 
                        anymore. Hard pass. Passing hard. 
                        No means no.

           ON Suzy’s face, streaked by sunlight from the window. She 
           really needs him to do this. Her eyes, a [pretty] plea... 

           Justin takes the card, dials a number on his iPhone. 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)

                        you something. If I may!

           Zu rolls her eyes; he’s a such a disaster.

                        to report an Irukandji sighting.

                        Yeah. Jamie’s out on the reef. 
                        Don’t hear from him for months when 
                        he’s there. Just like he likes it.

                        Any other way to reach him?

           Justin hangs up. He knows immediately what Zu is thinking.

                        No. You can’t go to Australia to

                        “Why not, Justin?”
                        I’ll tell you why not, Suzy.
                        A.) You don’t have any money. 
                        B.) You can’t fly alone. 
                        C.) You probably don’t...

                        ...Have a passport. Most 13 year 
                        olds don’t. 
                        D.) I’ll miss you. Did I say that 
                        out loud? 

           Suzy digs through her brother's boxed belongings, tearing 
           through cleats and uniforms and trophies and oars.  

           She finds:

           - a picture of the whole family together, from happier times.

           - a collage Aaron made in middle school of soccer star 
           Cristiano Ronaldo festooned with heart stickers. Suzy smiles.

           - an old jockstrap... oh God. 

           - Aaron's passport. Eureka!

           She turns to his photo and takes a long look. It's a photo of 
           Aaron from four years ago. He has a Bieber cut and baby face. 

           Zu looks at herself in the mirror, pulls her hair back, 
           adopts her best "teenage boy" scowl.  

           Could it work? They do look very similar...
           INT. MING PALACE CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT - LATER 

           Zu sits across from Jim in a mostly-empty Chinese restaurant. 
           He stares at the menu, deep in thought. 

           We hear: NOODLES FRYING.

           We hear: THE NEON SIGN FLICKERING IN THE WINDOW.

           We hear: LAUGHTER. Zu turns to look, and we see a quick 
           flashback of the Swanson family in one of the booths, 
           laughing and passing the Lo Mein around. Aaron has chopsticks 
           up his nose, being a Walrus. All four of them LAUGH.

           But A WAITRESS (50s) interrupts Zu’s memory.

                                 WAITRESS
                        It’s my Saturday night regulars! 
                        You two ready to order? 

           Zu looks back at the booth, now empty. 

                                 JIM
                        Sure. Uh. Zu will have the Lo Mein 
                        and I’m gonna go with -

                                 WAITRESS
                        Moo Shoo Pork, extra Pancakes on 
                        the side?

                                 JIM
                        The usual, yes.

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Now he’ll order a Rolling Rock.

                                 JIM
                        And maybe a Rolling Rock tonight.

                                 WAITRESS
                        You got it, Jim.

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Now my dad will pretend not to 
                        watch the ballgame playing on the 
                        screen behind me while we sit in 
                        awkward silence. 
                             (then)
                        Not much to see for a little while.

           Time speeds up to 2x or 4x speed, as if Suzy can control it. 

           We see: the waitress on super-speed serving the other tables, 
           dropping checks, serving and clearing their dinner. Fast.
           Then time normalizes. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Another Rolling Rock?

                                 JIM
                        Whoo-boy... I better not.

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        He never orders a second beer. He 
                        always says Whoo-Boy first. He also 
                        irons his jeans, but I digress. 

           Time speeds up again. The waitress clears their table, brings 
           dessert menus, clears dessert menus, drops Jim the check.

           He dabs his mouth with a napkin, time slows down again...

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Here it comes...

                        SUZY (V.O.)
                                                           JIM
           Gonna go wash this Moo Shu 
           Pork off my hands. 
                                              Gonna go wash this Moo Shu 
                                              Pork off my hands. 

           Jim gets up and puts his credit card down as he exits. 

           Zu moves fast. She pulls out a pink index card and scrawls 
           her dad's credit card info down. Even the CVC on the back. 

           Jim returns, sliding into the booth with fortune cookies.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        I got a bad one. “Land is always on 
                        the mind of flying birds.” 
                             (laughs)
                        What birds? Boo. What’d you get?

           Suzy opens hers and reads it. “A smooth long journey ahead!”

           OFF Suzy’s smile, we cut to - 

           INT. SUZY'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING - THE NEXT DAY

           Justin spies on Meg’s Subaru from the window. It pulls away.

                                 JUSTIN
                        You sure she won’t be back? 

           Suzy nods. She’s seated by the mirror, down to business.
           Justin takes in the wonderland that is a girl’s bedroom. So 
           many stuffed animals. Lots of pictures of Aaron and Zu. 

           She SNAPS her fingers, getting his attention. 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Sorry...  I've never been in a 
                        girl's bedroom before.  So many 
                        textures. I’m very tactile. Does it 
                        smell like coconuts in here? Mmm.

           He joins her by the mirror and Suzy holds out the scissors. 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        You sure about this? 
                             (then)
                        It’s going to physically hurt me to 
                        Bieber you. I don’t think I can.

           Suzy serves him up some super cute Disney eyes. 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                             (softly)
                        Sigh.
                             (like a surgeon)
                        Scalpel.

           She hands him the scissors and he starts at it. A lock of 
           Suzy’s hair falls to the floor, then another. Then one more. 

           Justin and Suzy stare at her new Bieber fever in the mirror.

           Suzy holds Aaron's passport up. Resemblance is darn close.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll add some layers through here, 
                        some texture. But yeah. They just 
                        might buy it. Let’s talk costume. 
                             (pointing to the closet)
                        Look for something three sizes too 
                        big. Clown pants.

           Suzy disappears back into her closet. 

           Justin eyes her boarding pass (for “Aaron Swanson”) and 
           travel documents. She also has: a reservation with Cairns Cab 
           Company, Coral Sea Coach shuttle service, Tropicana Lodge 
           motel. A weather report. Exchange rate form. She’s serious.  

           Suzy returns in baggy sweats, a Boston University sweatshirt, 
           and Red Sox hat.  Justin nods.
                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Not bad. Now remember: firm 
                        handshake, eye contact. 

           Justin holds his hand out and Suzy clasps it hard. Strong.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Okay, you aren’t trying to kill the 
                        Aussie. Firm but gentle. Lock eyes.

           They make firm eye contact until Zu GIGGLES. A slight blush. 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        No, you gotta laugh in a much lower 
                        register. Like this. Manly. 

           He giggles, it’s actually WAY HIGHER than Suzy’s. He adjusts 
           and goes lower. She tries it. He adjust and goes even lower. 
           She COUGH-CHOKES and they both LAUGH. Hands still clasped.

           EXT. SUZY'S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - AFTERNOON

           Justin and Suzy stand on the street corner with her luggage.

                                 JUSTIN
                        This charter boat. Did you check 
                        them out on Yelp? It’s not a guy 
                        with an inner tube, is it? 

           Suzy sees her Uber coming towards them, grabs her stuff.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        How are you going to find Dr. 
                        Seymour in the middle of a reef?  

           Suzy's Uber pulls up.

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Swanson?

                                 JUSTIN
                        Suzy, wait. I don’t have a good 
                        feeling about this. Something could 
                        happen to you out there, and I 
                        don’t have a passport yet so I 
                        couldn’t come find you and I don’t 
                        know anyone in Australia I could 
                        even call except that weird kid 
                        from my camp but he’s from New 
                        Zealand actually and that’s not - 

           Suzy gives him a genuine, grateful hug and he melts. 
           She climbs into the Uber.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Please call my cell and let me know 
                        you got there ok? Breath into the 
                        receiver. I’ll know it’s you! 

           The door closes and Justin watches her drive off in an Uber. 

           INT. AIRPORT - SECURITY CHECKPOINT

           Suzy nervously waiting in line. Her turn. She hands the TSA 
           agent her passport.

                                 TSA AGENT
                        Remove your hat.

           The TSA agent looks at her (Aaron's) passport for a moment.  
           Then her.  Then her passport again.  

           Then he stamps her boarding pass and waves her through. She’s 
           through! 

           Suzy can’t believe how easy that was. She heads towards the 
           metal detectors with a sigh of relief, as  - 

                                 TSA AGENT (CONT’D)
                        Wait! Hold right there, son.  

           Suzy freezes and turns back to the agent. Her heart in her 
           throat. Is she busted? 

                                 TSA AGENT (CONT’D)
                        B.U.? 

           Suzy has no idea what B.U. means. She nods weakly and shrugs?

           The TSA reaches his hand out, giving her a big thumbs up - 

                                 TSA AGENT (CONT’D)
                        Me too, class of 92.
                             (re: her BU sweatshirt)
                        Go Terriers! 

           Oh. BU! Boston University. Suzy gives him an enthusiastic 
           thumbs up and heads to the metal detectors. Close one! 

           INT. AIRPORT - GATE

           Suzy in a crowded gate. She looks out at the plane, catching 
           her reflection in the glass. She looks like a determined boy.
                                 AIRLINE AGENT
                        We will now continue boarding 
                        flight 1409 to Brisbane. Passengers 
                        in Zone 3 are welcome to board.

           Suzy’s line starts moving towards the door. 

           INT. AIRPLANE - ECONOMY - CONTINOUS

           Suzy seated with a neck pillow, waiting for take-off.

           We see: two security officers enter the plane, looking 
           concerned. They head down the aisle towards us. 

           Suzy pulls her cap down low, tries to become invisible.

           But the officers stop at her seat. They are looking at her.

           INT. AIRPORT SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Suzy sits in a plastic airport chair in the office.

           We hear: FLIGHTS being announced. People going places. 

           We hear: THE ROLLING of luggage carts and bags.  

           We hear: People GREETING each other, excited to be reunited.

           Stony-faced, Zu watches out the window as Meg’s Subaru pulls 
           up at the curb outside at lightening speed. She bolts out her 
           car, barely managing to close the door. 

           One second later, Meg bursts through the doors and throws 
           herself at Zu, grabbing her. Not letting go. 

           We hear: Meg SOBBING into Zu’s lap. 

           OFF Suzy’s detached and somber face, we cut to - 

           INT. THERAPY - MORNING 

           A tense beat.

           Meg and Jim are in their usual seats. Dr. Legler is wearing 
           red and blue striped tights today. 

           The adults are all very serious today.

                                 DR. LEGLER
                        Help us understand, Suzanne. What 
                        you were thinking.
                                 JIM
                        Christ! She doesn’t talk, Doctor. 
                        How many times do we have to do 
                        this? Week after week.

                                 MEG
                        Jim! 

                                 JIM
                             (to Meg)
                        Where the hell were you when this 
                        was going on anyway? Huh? 

                                 MEG
                        Where was I? It was your credit 
                        card she used!

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Bang.

                                 JIM
                        Zu, you need to start speaking 
                        right now, young lady.

                                 MEG
                        Or what? You gonna ground her?

                                 JIM
                        Of course we’re gonna ground her. 
                        No e-mail. No phone. No TV. She was 
                        on her way to Australia! We have to 
                        ground her until the end of time. 

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Bang, bang, bang.

                                 DR. LEGLER
                        Jim. Meg. 

                                 JIM
                        What happened to my well behaved, 
                        well adjusted daughter? 

                                 MEG
                        What do you think happened to her? 
                        We happened to her! 

           Suzy holds her fingers together, to form a little GUN with 
           her hand. None of the adults notice. 

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        BANG, FRANNY JACKSON!
           EXT. A SWIMMING POOL - FLASHBACK - FOUR MONTHS AGO, MAY

           Zu marches to the edge of a pool, where we see Franny doing 
           fast, serious laps. Zu tries to flag her down.  

           Finally, Franny sees Zu and stops swimming, annoyed. When she 
           emerges and takes off her goggles, her gaze is cold.

                                 FRANNY
                        What are you doing here? I told you  
                        I couldn’t hang out today. 

                                 SUZY
                        I need to talk to you.

                                 FRANNY
                        Just! I’ll see you at school, okay?
                             (putting goggles back on)
                        Varsity try-outs are at the end of 
                        the summer, I’m behind in my 
                        training -- 

                                 ZU
                        Why did you spit on me at Rock 
                        Lake?

           A beat.

                                 FRANNY
                        ...I didn’t. 

                                 ZU
                        You spit in my face, Franny.
                             (then)
                        I saw you do it. 

           Franny takes her swim cap off. Unsure what to say. 

                                 FRANNY
                        Look, it was really dark in the 
                        cabin. You probably don’t know what 
                        you even saw -

                                 ZU
                        I. SAW. YOU. DO. IT. 

                                 FRANNY
                        Alright, fine, okay?! I spit on 
                        you. But t wasn’t supposed to be 
                        this big thing. It was just a dare.

                                 SUZY
                        Someone dared you to spit on me, 
                        and you said yes? 
                                 FRANNY
                        It wasn’t like that. You wouldn’t 
                        understand.

           A beat. Franny looks away, into the water.

                                 SUZY
                        Are we not best friends anymore?

                                 FRANNY
                             (hard)
                        Sometimes you have to make a 
                        choice.

                                 SUZY
                        And you’re choosing them? A bunch 
                        of vapid Barbie dolls?

                                 FRANNY
                        They aren’t vapid. They’re actually 
                        really nice Zu, and I tried so hard 
                        to bring you along with me. I 
                        introduced you to them, tried to 
                        get you to use some hair product...

                                 SIZU
                        This is because I wouldn’t use gel?

                                 FRANNY
                             (an outburst:)
                        No! You almost blew this for me, 
                        Zu. Going on about pee in the 
                        cafeteria?? What were you thinking? 
                        I almost got dropped from their 
                        table because of you.  

                                 SUZY
                        So? Get dropped from the table! Who 
                        cares what they think? 

                                 FRANNY
                        I do, Zu. I want to sit with them.

           Zu puts her hands together in a gun and points it at Franny:

                                 ZU
                        You know what? BANG! 

                                 FRANNY
                        ...what?
                                 ZU
                        You told me to shoot you if you 
                        ever became like them - SO I'M 
                        SHOOTING YOU! BANG!

                                 FRANNY
                        You’re so weird now. 

           Franny turns around and heads back towards the water.

                                 ZU
                        DON'T YOU GET IT!? BANG!

           Franny pulls her goggles on and dives in to the water.

                                 ZU (CONT’D)
                        I'M SENDING YOU A SIGNAL! I'M 
                        MAKING IT BIG, LIKE I PROMISED YOU! 
                        DO I NEED TO MAKE IT BIGGER? 

           But Franny is already out of earshot, swimming steadily.

                                 ZU (CONT’D)
                        I'm going to make you hear me, 
                        Franny Jackson. I’m gonna make you 
                        be you again.

           INT. SUZY’S HOUSE - NIGHT - PRESENT 

           Zu is lying on her bed, utterly destroyed by her failed trip.  
           A tear SNEAKS down her cheek, but she wipes it away.

                                 MEG (O.S.)
                        Honey? Justin Maloney is here.

           Without turning, Suzy shakes her head: no.

                                 MEG (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        He's really sweaty, honey  - I 
                        think he ran here. He’s really 
                        insisting on seeing you.

           We see: Meg step aside to REVEAL Justin. He is indeed very 
           sweaty. Guilty, sorry, worried and relieved all at once. 

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                             (to Justin)
                        Just make it quick, she is 
                        technically grounded.

           Meg exits, closing the door. (Then she re-opens it again and 
           leaves it slightly ajar. They are pre-teens, after all.)
           Suzy glares at Justin from her bed. A thousand yard stare. 

                                 JUSTIN
                        I'll just get right to it:
                        I'm sorry I narc'd on you. But your 
                        plan was basically the premise of 
                        all the Taken movies. And you are, 
                        you know, super pretty, and the sex 
                        slavery thing is real...I panicked.
                             (then)
                        I know I broke your trust by 
                        calling your Mom and I’m sorry. But 
                        I only did it because I like you.
                             (softly)
                        I’ve liked you since third grade. 

           Suzy continues to stare at him. Ice cold.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Even though you've given me no sign 
                        that I should continue speaking, 
                        I’m going to.
                             (summons his courage)
                        The Fall Dance is coming. The theme 
                        is Heroes and Villains, which is 
                        actually strangely cool for our 
                        hellhole of a school...and I’m 
                        wondering if you want to go with 
                        me. I could be Boba Fett and you 
                        could be Princess Leia. Or, with 
                        that new hair cut, maybe Hans 
                        Solo?. ....but Boba Fett is a 
                        villain and Leia and Hans are both 
                        heroes and you are a hero to me for 
                        being so brave and trying to help 
                        your dead best friend. So think 
                        about it. But I need an answer now, 
                        actually, because I forgot my 
                        inhaler. Will you go with me? 

           A beat.

                                 SUZY
                        No.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Hey! You spoke! Suzy, you spoke!
                             (beat)
                        You broke your months-long silence 
                        to say no to me... 
                             (realizing)
                        I’m that big a "no,” huh?

           A beat. Justin is crushed. The wristwatch on his neck BEEPS.
                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Of course.

           Justin pops his pill and tries to exit with dignity. 

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll just. See you in Science, 
                        then. Good night. 

           Suzy watches him go, a flicker of remorse.

           INT. SCIENCE CLASS - PRESENT - NEXT MORNING

           Suzy at her desk, depressed. She has a hoodie up over her 
           head. She’s grounded. Justin betrayed her. Australia was 
           stolen from her. Now she’ll never meet Jamie Seymour. 

           Justin glances at Zu. A quick peek. She turns away from him.

           Mrs. Turton at the SmartBoard, pointing to a picture of the 
           huge, colorful, happy Earth rising above the moon.

                                 MRS. TURTON
                        Now, I know you guys have grown up 
                        with this famous image, but I want 
                        you to try to imagine what it must 
                        have been like to see it for the 
                        first time. To be the first living 
                        humans to see our Earth, in full 
                        color like this, shot from outside.

           Mrs. Turton clicks the remote and another photograph of outer 
           space appears. This one is mostly BLACK, with just a few pale 
           brownish rays of light streaking across the vast nothingness.

                                 MRS. TURTON (CONT’D)
                        Now, here’s a different view. Taken 
                        more recently.

           She points to a tiny dot. 

                                 MRS. TURTON (CONT’D)
                        That little speck is also Earth. 

                                 MRS. TURTON (CONT’D)
                        Shot from three billion miles away. 
                        Earth doesn’t seem so big now, does 
                        it. When you see how alone we are.

           We see: Suzy walking alone down an empty school hallway.

           We see: Suzy changing for gym alone in an empty locker room.
                                 MRS. TURTON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        The cosmologist Carl Sagan once 
                        called Earth “a mote of dust 
                        suspended in a sunbeam.”

           We see: Suzy staring out the window on an empty school bus.

           We see: Suzy walking through her empty neighborhood. 

                                 MRS. TURTON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Isolated and alone. Surrounded by 
                        nothingness. 

           We see: Suzy eating alone in a completely empty cafeteria. 

           We PAN OUT to a view of the cafeteria from above: Suzy 
           becoming a tiny pin dot in a huge galaxy of nothingness. 

                                 MRS. TURTON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Nothingness in every direction.

           Suddenly, a CRACKLING VOICE comes over the PA speaker, which 
           is located above the classroom door. 

                                 PA ANNOUCEMENT
                        Suzanne Swanson, please report to 
                        the office.
                             (firm)
                        Suzanne Swanson to the office.

           A beat. Unsure what to do, Suzy raises her hand. 

                                 MRS. TURTON 
                        Imagine that! Three billion miles. 
                             (calling on her)
                        Yes. Suzy. 

           Zu points to the PA speaker [above the door]. Should I go? 

                                 MRS. TURTON (CONT’D)
                        Yes, go. Fine. Make it quick.

           Suzy hurries out of class. Justin watches her go, curious. 

           INT. EUGENE FIELD MIDDLE SCHOOL - MAIN OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Suzy enters the busy office and sits down on the bench, next 
           to a couple students. The phone on the front counter RINGS. 

           Zu looks around. The Secretary has her hands full. No one 
           else looks like they’re gonna answer it. It keeps RINGING.

           Finally, Zu picks it up and clears her throat. 
           We hear, in a deep, winning, fantastic Australian accent:  

                                 JAMIE’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Oh Good! Hello?  Is someone there?  
                        I was cut off I think.  This is 
                        Jamie Seymour. Holding for Suzy 
                        Swanson?

           Suzy is dumbstruck. She tries to reply, nothing comes out.

                                 JAMIE’S VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Can you hear me?  
                             (then)
                        Bugger, this is a bad connection, 
                        I’m on my mobile... anyone there?

           Suzy swallows hard. Summons all her energy and says: 

                                 SUZY
                        I'm... here.

           Words! They are working! She smiles.

                                 SUZY (CONT’D)
                        I'm here!  This is Suzy Swanson! 

           INT. LECTURE HALL - GRADUATE SCHOOL OF OCEANOGRAPHY, 
           UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND - MORNING 

                                 JAMIE
                             (into phone)
                        Oh, good. I found you. 

           We see Jamie now, standing in front of a busy lecture hall. 
           His lecture has just ended and he’s balancing his phone on 
           his shoulder while he packs up his stuff. He waves BYE to - 

           Some GRAD STUDENTS. They all adore him. 

                                 GRAD STUDENT
                        See ya, Jelly Dude from Nemo Land! 

                                 JAMIE
                        Shut it, you little ripper. 
                             (back to phone)
                        So is this the same Suzy Swanson 
                        who’s been sending me all those e-
                        mails? Too many. Lost count at 65.

                                 SUZY
                        Yes, that's me. Sorry. I was eager 
                        to get a hold of you, Dr. Seymour.
           Jamie’s making his way out of the lecture hall. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Well I’m back on land and I go to 
                        call you, dolly, and your phone’s 
                        deactivated. E-mail bouncing back. 

                                 SUZY
                        Oh yes. Sorry. I’m on a bit of a 
                        ...forced communication black out. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Well, good ol Google helped me 
                        track ya down. Only one Eugene 
                        Field Middle School in America.

           INT. EUGENE FIELD MIDDLE SCHOOL - MAIN OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Zu is excited. Jamie Seymour’s on the phone with her! 

                                 JAMIE
                        So listen. I’m actually at URI 
                        today. What’s your schedule like?

                                 SUZY
                        What’s URI?

                                 JAMIE
                        University of Rhode Island. Bay 
                        campus, in Narraganset.

           A STUDENT enters the office and takes a seat on the bench. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got a consult on transgenics 
                        and pathogens now but I can fit you 
                        in at 2 if you can get over here? 

                                 SUZY
                             (quietly)
                        Yeah. I can be there. Yes. 

           EXT. UNIVERSITY PARKING LOT - RHODE ISLAND - CONTINUOUS

           Jamie exits the building now and heads towards his car, still 
           on the phone. He BEEPS the car unlocked. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Great. I’ll be in the Seawater 
                        Facility. Bring the specimen. 
                                 SUZY
                        ...the specimen?

                                 JAMIE
                        The jellyfish. I seriously doubt 
                        it’s an Irukandji you caught, but 
                        either way, I’ll need to see it. 

                                 SUZY
                        No, yes. I’ll...bring it.

                                 JAMIE
                        Two o’clock. Don’t be late. 

           Jamie climbs into his car.

           INT. EUGENE FIELD MIDDLE SCHOOL - OFFICE

                                 SUZY
                        Great! I’m on my way!

           Zu exits quickly. Exuberant. 

           OFF the students on the bench, giving Zu the hairy eyeball.

           INT. SCIENCE CLASS - CONTINUOUS 

           Justin’s anxious, wondering where Suzy has gone. She’s been 
           gone awhile. 

           He glances out the window and sees Suzy running across the 
           school yard and jumping on her bike, making her escape. 

           OFF Justin’s concerned look, we cut to - 

           EXT. BUS STATION - MAIN STREET - CONTINOUS

           Zu bikes up and tosses her bike aside, hurries inside. 

           INT. SEAWATER FACILITY - RHODE ISLAND COAST - 2:06 PM

           Suzy hurries into the facility, late. 

           Her eyes travel to a tall tubular tank in the center of the 
           room that is ringed with a staircase to the rooftop.

           We see: a multiple blooms of jellyfish clustered around a 
           VERY CALM SCUBA DIVER who appears to be playing with them.

           He turns and we see: "SEYMOUR" on the back of his suit.
           Suzy RAPS on the glass to get his attention. 

           He waves at Zu, indicates she should take the stairs to the 
           top of the tank. He heads to the surface, a glowing tail of 
           jellyfish following him. Like the Pied Piper.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - SEAWATER FACILITY - DAY

           Zu steps onto the roof. There are various outdoor tanks and 
           exhibits out there, in the bright sun. 

           She sees Jamie, his arms resting over the side of the tank.  
           She runs over. He pulls off his mask and scuba hood. 

                                 SUZY
                        Dr. Seymour!

                                 JAMIE
                        Let’s see it. Where is it?

                                 SUZY
                        Oh. Uh....

                                 JAMIE
                        I told you to bring the specimen.  

                                 SUZY
                        I know. I’m afraid...it’s still in 
                        its natural habitat. 

                                 JAMIE
                        You don't have anything to show me? 

           Jamie pulls his mask back on, done with her. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Waste of my time. 

                                 SUZY
                        No! I'm sorry I lied, but I did see 
                        one. A whole bloom! At Cove Beach.

                                 JAMIE
                        Not possible. They’re almost 
                        impossible to see with the naked - 

                                 SUZY
                        Without magnification, I know! I 
                        had binoculars taped into my hat.
                             (a plea)
                        There was a full moon and I was 
                        this close to catching one.
                                 JAMIE
                        Sorry, kid. I’m too busy for this.

           He pushes off the side, about to go under... 

                                 SUZY
                        So that’s it?? 

                                 JAMIE
                        Yes. Evidence is the only language.  
                        You can’t offer an unsupported 
                        claim - or worse, an outright lie - 
                        and expect your findings to be 
                        taken seriously. It’s just bad 
                        science, Miss Swanson.  
                             (bye)
                        Careful on the stairs.

           Jamie goes under water, disappearing from Zu forever...

                                 SUZY
                        An Irukandji killed my best friend. 
                        She didn’t drown, she was an 
                        excellent swimmer. The waters were 
                        calm. Not a cloud in the sky.
                             (as loud as she can:)
                        HER NAME WAS FRANNY JACKSON AND AN 
                        IRUKANDJI STUNG AND KILLED HER.  

           Jamie reappears at the surface. His face softer, patient.

                                 JAMIE
                        How do you know?
                             (beat)
                        Was there evidence of a sting? 

                                 SUZY
                        ... I didn’t get to see her body. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Anyone log her symptoms? Was there 
                        evidence of cardiac arrest?
                             (Suzy shakes her head no)
                        Anyone drag the beach? Check the 
                        sand for salp? Test the water?

                                 SUZY
                        I was hoping that’s where you’d 
                        come in. What I need is an expert.

                                 JAMIE
                        Look, dolly. I’m very sorry for 
                        your loss. I really, truly am, but.
           Jamie studies this small, unkept girl. Her intensity. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Crap. Fine. 8AM tomorrow. I'll take 
                        a few readings. You bring coffee. 

                                 SUZY
                        Oh my God. Really??

                                 JAMIE
                        Venti dark roast. Two sugars.

           Jamie pops the oxygen back in his mouth and goes under.

                                 SUZY
                        THANK YOU, DR. SEYMOUR! 

           INT. NAOMI JACKSON’S HOUSE - EARLY THE NEXT MORNING 

           Fluffernutter is BARKING HIS BRAINS OUT at the beach. 

           Naomi enters, coffee in hand, almost afraid to look out. 

           We see: Suzy alone on the beach in her waders again. She’s 
           filling up test tubes with water and scooping sand into jars.

           OFF Naomi, what the hell’s she doing out there?, we cut to -

           EXT. SOUTH GROVE BEACH - CONTINUOUS

           Suzy’s not alone on the beach, Jamie was just underwater. He 
           emerges from the surf now, in his stinger suit, hands empty. 

                                 SUZY
                        See anything?

                                 JAMIE
                        No. Didn't expect to. They’ve 
                        surely gone out deep at this point. 
                        No evidence of rip tide, though. 
                        You were right about that. 
                             (pointing)
                        Someone is waving at us.

           We see: Naomi waving from her deck with a look of concern. 

                                 SUZY
                        Oh. Just wave back. 

           Jamie and Suzy wave.
                                 JAMIE
                        She's a beaut, who’s she?...

                                 SUZY
                        Franny Jackson’s Mom.

                                 JAMIE
                        Oh. The gal that...?

                                 SUZY
                        Yeah.
                             (teasing)
                        So it would be super appropriate to 
                        go mack on her right now. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Hey! I was just making a scientific 
                        observation, ya cheeky bugger. 
                        She’s pretty. 

                                 NAOMI
                        ZU! SHOULDN'T YOU BE AT SCHOOL??

           Suzy smiles and waves. Points to Jamie as an explanation.

                                 SUZY
                             (to Jamie, softly)
                        Why don’t you tell her you’re the 
                        famous jelly dude from Nemo land. 

                                 JAMIE
                             (to Naomi)
                        I”M A SCIENTIST. WE’RE ON A FIELD 
                        TRIP. IT’s OK - SHE’S WITH ME.

                                 SUZY
                             (laughs)
                        Are you done? We should get going.

                                 JAMIE
                             (re: test tube)
                        I am done. Got everything I need.

           Suzy and Jamie gather up their equipment. 

           We see: Naomi advancing down the beach towards them, a 
           football field away. Lots of questions on her face.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Shouldn’t we at least say hi to 
                        her? She clearly wants to meet me.

                                 SUZY
                        No. Come on.
                                 JAMIE
                             (to Naomi)
                        BYE! MEET YOU ANOTHER TIME I GUESS!  

           Suzy drags Jamie away. Waves bye to Naomi as she hurries off. 

           EXT. A PARKING LOT - LATER

           Jamie examines the water and sand samples in the trunk of his 
           car using scientific-looking instruments. 

                                 SUZY
                        What do you think?

                                 JAMIE
                        Conditions are right. High 
                        concentration of salp, the little 
                        shrimp they love to eat. Water’s 
                        unseasonably warm. High PH, also 
                        indicative of Irukandji.

                                 SUZY
                        So: yes? I’m right?

                                 JAMIE
                        No. All we did was not disprove it. 
                        Scientifically, we don't have any 
                        evidence. Just could’ve’s. 
                        Circumstantials. 

                                  SUZY
                        But if you don't tell everyone I’m 
                        right then nothing will change.

                                 JAMIE
                        Wouldn’t change anyway, Suzy. We 
                        don't have enough to get a city 
                        ordinance or drag of the water. 

                                 SUZ
                        So we're going to give up? Even 
                        though you think I'm right?

                                 JAMIE
                        Thinking you're right isn’t enough.

                                 SUZY
                        Maybe we could go out and catch 
                        one. Maybe the moon will be full 
                        again soon and we can  -
                                 JAMIE
                        I’m due in Cairns tomorrow, love. 
                        Back in Australia.

           Suzy's face falls, and she crumbles into a nearby bench. 
           Jamie studies this odd girl. How upset she is. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Why’s this mean so much to you, 
                        dolly?

                                 SUZY
                        ...I didn't think it would be the 
                        last time I ever saw her.

                                 JAMIE
                        Your friend?

                                 SUZY
                        She told me to send her a message.  
                        She said to make it big.

           INT. SUZY'S KITCHEN - FLASHBACK - THREE MONTHS AGO, IN JUNE 

           We see: Suzy pulling Ming Palace take-out containers from the 
           freezer, trying to be ninja quiet and stealth. It’s dawn.

           They contain a yellow frozen liquid. She puts them into an 
           insulated bag. Just as she finishes, Meg appears.

                                 MEG
                        Wow, look who's up early! Excited 
                        for the last day of sixth grade?

                                 SUZY
                        I volunteered to help my homeroom 
                        teacher clean out the classroom.  
                        Ok if I go in early?

                                 MEG
                        Sure. Give me a minute and I'll 
                        drop you.

                                 SUZY
                        That’s okay! Got my bike. Bye, Mom!

           INT. SCHOOL - EARLY MORNING - STILL IN FLASHBACK

           The hallways are deserted. Suzy walks up to Locker #605. 

           We see: the locker is covered in heart stickers and swimming 
           stickers. Someone’s grafitti’ed Franny’s name in a cool way.
           Zu takes the containers from her bag one at a time. There are 
           tons of them. She opens the containers, removes the frozen 
           discs of urine, and slips them into the slats of the locker.   

           Then Zu ducks around the corner of the hallway to watch.

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - AN HOUR LATER - FLASHBACK

           The hallway is now crowded with STUDENTS.  

           We see: Franny head down the hall, flanked by Dylan and 
           Jenna, like this is any other day. Too cool for school.

           We see: Franny approach her locker and unlock it casually.

           We see: the liquids POUR all over her, and all over the 
           floor. Buckets of it. She is soaked. And in shock.  

           We see: STUDENTS cluster around her, GROANING IN DISGUST and 
           POINTING at Franny. Aubrey and Molly run over, in shock.

                                 DYLAN PARKER
                        Holy shit, it’s piss!
                             (laughing)
                        SOMEONE PISSED IN FRANNY JACKSON’S 
                        LOCKER! 

                                 MOLLY/AUBREY
                        OH MY GOD. / Someone get Ms. Hall!

                                 JENNA
                        Someone get Ms. Hall! It’s PISS!!!!

           Zu watches as Franny slinks to the floor, sobbing. 
           Humiliated. Her freckles covered in tears. 

                                 FRANNY
                        WHO DID THIS? WHO THE HELL PUT PEE 
                        IN MY LOCKER?!

           But she knows who did it. She looks up and down the hall 
           until she finds Zu’s face, poking around the corner. 

                                 FRANNY (CONT’D)
                        ZU. How could you do this to me?

           Jenny, Molly and Aubrey turn. The whole hallways does. They 
           look at Zu like she’s a monster. WTF’s the matter with her?

           OFF Franny’s face, she will never forgive Zu, we cut back to -
           EXT. BENCH IN SOUTH COVE - PRESENT 

           Jamie puts his arm around Suzy’s shoulders.

                                 SUZY
                        I hurt her. Worse than she hurt me.

                                 JAMIE
                        Look. I've been stung by jellies 
                        more times than I can count. And 
                        they damn-near kill me every time. 
                        But I don't blame the jellyfish for 
                        lashing out. They’re doing what all 
                        species do when they feel 
                        threatened. Protect themselves.
                             (then)
                        You were protecting yourself. 

                                 SUZY
                        I thought I was helping her.

                                 JAMIE
                        Doesn't make you a bad person, 
                        Suzy. Just makes you alive. Like 
                        the rest of us.   
                             (tenderly)
                        Besides. Urine is completely 
                        sanitary. 

           Zu LAUGHS, loves her new friend.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Come on. I’ll walk you to school.

           They walk off, his arm around her.

           EXT. EUGENE FIELD MIDDLE SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS 

           We see: STUDENTS pouring into front doors of the school. They 
           are all dressed in black. 

           The mood is somber. It’s a sad morning. ADULTS in black, too. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Geezus...that’s a dreary school 
                        uniform you’ve got. Black?

                                 SUZY
                        Oh no....what day is it.

                                 JAMIE
                        Thursday the 12th. Why?
                                 SUZY
                        ....Franny’s memorial is today.

           A beat. 

                                 SUZY (CONT’D)
                        Will you come in with me?

                                 JAMIE
                        Oh. 
                             (beat)
                        Won’t your parents be there?

           Suzy nods. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Probably better to sit with them 
                        then, right? I didn’t know her. 

           Suzy nods, she understands.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll tell you something, though, 
                        Suzy Swanson. I think you’re gonna 
                        be one hell of a scientist, kid. 

           Jamie exits, with a gentle wave. OFF Suzy, dreading this...

           INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS 

           We see: A sea of black clothes. The entire school is in this 
           airless, dark space. Too loud for such a somber occasion.

           Zu shuffles in with a large crowd of students. Blending in.  

           We see: a picture of Franny projected onto a SCREEN onstage, 
           where a slideshow will surely be shown. 

           We see: a podium ringed by funeral flower arrangements.

           We see: The flower garden memory board, proudly displayed. 

           We see: Jenna, Molly, and Aubrey, in seats up on stage. As 
           VIP speakers. They bestow royal waves to their devotees.

           We see: Meg and Jim, sitting a few seats apart. 

           We see: Justin Maloney, reading the program.

           IN THE FRONT ROW:

           Naomi is ushered in by Principal Hall. Hand on her back.
                                 NAOMI
                        ...Where’s Zu?

                                 PRINCIPAL HALL
                        Suzanne Swanson?

                                 NAOMI
                        Yeah. Why isn’t she up on stage? 

                                 PRINCIPAL HALL
                             (confused)
                        Was she supposed to be?

           Naomi scans the auditorium looking for Zu. Meg and Jim catch 
           her eye, a couple rows back, and give her a sympathetic wave.

                                 NAOMI
                        Is Suzy with you?

           They can’t hear her.

                                 NAOMI (CONT’D)
                        IS ZU WITH YOU? 

           Jim shakes his head. They haven’t seen her yet. 

           We see: Meg, Jim, Naomi and Justin all scan the crowd for Zu.

           IN THE BACK ROW:

           Zu DARTS into an empty seat and buries her face in the 
           program. She does not want to be found by any of them.

           We see: the interior of the program. Franny’s face. 

           Then a hush falls over the room as Ms. Hall takes the podium. 

           The principal steps to the podium and the crowd hushes.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Good morning students, parents, 
                        faculty, friends. 
                             (then)
                        Today, we take a moment to honor 
                        the extraordinary life of Frances 
                        May Jackson. 
                             (then)
                        Before we begin, Franny’s best 
                        friends would like to present a 
                        Memory Board in her honor. Girls?

           Jenna, Molly, and Aubrey step up to the podium. 
           Zu’s face BURNS HOT with anger. She’s not sure she can sit 
           here and listen to this. She looks for the nearest EXIT sign.

           And then she sees him... sliding through the door in the back 
           corner of the auditorium. 

           It’s Jamie Seymour.

           He sees her immediately and gives her a little nod. I’m here. 

           Zu is so touched, her eyes well up with tears. 

                                 JENNA
                        Thank you, Ms. Hall.

           Jenna clears her throat, preparing to recite a speech.

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        When we think of our friend 
                        Frances.  We think of...

                                 MOLLY
                        Sunlight.

                                 AUBREY
                        Giggles.

                                 JENNA
                        Trips to Pinkberry!

           Some polite GIGGLES.

                                 MOLLY
                        We think of radiant red hair.

                                 JENNA
                        We think of... 

                                 AUBREY
                        Shopping. 

                                 JENNA
                        Makeovers.

           Zu's eyes narrow, looking murderous. 

                                 MOLLY
                        The huge crush she had on...

                                 MOLLY/JENNA/AUBREY
                        We’ll never tell.

           ON Naomi, confused. Franny had a crush? Who are these girls?
                                 AUBREY
                        We think of... 

                                 AUBREY (CONT’D)
                        Laughter.

                                 MOLLY
                        Cute shoes.

                                 JENNA
                        Dance parties!

           We see: the screen on stage change from Franny's picture to 
           an underwater ocean scene.

                                 MOLLY
                             (re: the Memory Board)
                        Frances, your memory garden may be 
                        full of beautiful sunlit flowers.

                                 JENNA
                        But you are the one and only...

                                 JENNA/AUBREY/MOLLY
                        Rose. 

           They point to the single red rose. Then they begin an 
           Acappella performance of “The Rose” by Bette Midler.

                                 JENNA/ MOLLY/ AUBREY
                             (singing)
                        Some say love, it is a river...
                        that drowns the tender reed.

           It is terrible.

                                 JENNA/ MOLLY/ AUBREY (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        Some say love, it is a razor...
                        that leaves your soul to bleed.

           ON Zu, blood boiling.

           We see: A bloom of blood-red jellyfish appear on the screen 
           on stage. 

           We see: water pooling around Zu’s feet. Water seeping under 
           the auditorium walls, spilling down the aisles...

                                 JENNA/AUBREY/MOLLY
                             (singing)
                        Some say love, it is a hunger! 
                        An endless aching need!
                        I say love, it is a flower, and you- 
                                 ZU
                        NO! STOP! THIS IS BULLSHIT!!!!

           The auditorium falls silent. Everyone looks to the back.

           Zu charges towards the stage. 

           We see: water streaming down the walls now, waterfalls. 

                                 ZU (CONT’D)
                        Franny Jackson hated this GIRLY 
                        PINK-ALICIOUS ROSE PETAL CRAP. SHE 
                        LIKED GANGSTER RAP AND POOP JOKES 
                        AND SHE DREAMED OF SWIMMING IN THE 
                        OLYMPICS AND HIKING THE APPALACHIAN 
                        TRAIL AND YOU DIDN’T EVEN KNOW HER! 
                        ALL YOU DID WAS RUIN HER!

           The girls on stage are dumbstruck. Everyone is. 

                                 MEG /JIM
                        Suzy! Honey! / Sit down, Zu.

           We see: the jellyfish multiplying on screen now. 

           We see: the screen starting to ripple and bend, buckling. 

           Zu hoists herself up on stage and stomps to the podium. 

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Ms. Swanson! Sit down right now! 

                                 ZU
                        SHE WAS MY BEST FRIEND AND I’M THE 
                        ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS HER. WHO KNOWS 
                        WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. 

                                 MEG /JIM/ PRINCIPAL
                        Zu!/ Suzy!/ Sit down, Ms. Swanson! 

                                 ZU 
                        Why won’t you listen to me? They’re 
                        here. They killed her and they’re 
                        here. THE IRUKANDJI ARE HERE.  

           We see: screen is pulsing with beating, venomous jellyfish. 
           Waves of seawater spill over the top of the screen. 

           Naomi sprints across the stage to Zu, and tries to drag her 
           from the podium. Zu holds on with dear life. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Let go - come on. Let’s go outside. 
                                 SUZY
                        LISTEN TO ME!

                                 NAOMI
                        A jellyfish isn’t what killed her.

                                 SUZY
                        YES IT IS! LISTEN! 

                                 NAOMI
                        What killed her was me, Zu. 
                        Don’t you know that?
                             (then)
                        Everyone in this auditorium, in 
                        this whole town knows it. She died 
                        because she had a shitty mother who 
                        wasn’t watching her at the beach. 
                        Who let her go out there alone and 
                        die a horrible, unspeakable death, 
                        her mouth full of salt. This was my 
                        fault. 

                                 SUZY
                        It wasn’t your fault! I can prove 
                        it was an Irukandji! My friend! 
                        He’s an expert! He’ll tell you -  
                        JAMIE! 
                             (to the back of the house)
                        JAMIE! COME UP HERE! 

           Zu holds her hand up to her forehead, straining to see him in 
           the bright stage lights. The whole auditorium turns to look.

           We see: the corner by the EXIT door’s empty. He’s gone.

           WE see: HUNDREDS of people staring at Zu. She is humiliated. 

           Then - 

           The screen on stage explodes, and a giant wave filled with 
           twitching jellyfish pours into the auditorium.

           Everyone runs for cover. It’s chaos. Water everywhere. 
           Students drenched, SCREAMING. A tidal wave of seawater.

           Zu runs off stage and out the backstage EXIT door...

           EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE STAGE DOOR - CONTINOUS

           ... and finds Jamie, right outside, waiting for her. 

                                 ZU
                        Where did you go? You abandoned me!
                                 JAMIE
                        I had no choice! You can’t present 
                        half-baked research like that. I 
                        told you. We don’t have definitive 
                        proof. 

                                 ZU
                        I’m so sick of science rules. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Really? That’s too bad because I 
                        just changed my flight.

                                 ZU
                        What do you mean? 

           We see: a wave roll under Zu's feet on the asphalt. Coming 
           out the stage door. We hear the SCREAMS within. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Come on. We gotta get out of here.

                                 ZU
                        Where are we going? 

           Jamie holds up his phone, open to an advanced weather app. 

           We see: a picture of the moon and the words: “97% Full Moon.”

                                 JAMIE
                        Let’s go out deep and catch 
                        ourselves an Irukandji!

           OFF Zu’s elated face, as she sprints off with Jamie.

           EXT. SUZY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 

           Meg opens the front door to REVEAL Naomi standing outside.

                                 MEG
                        Naomi. God, I’m so sorry you had to 
                        go through that today... 

                                 NAOMI
                        I’m okay - is Zu here?

                                 MEG
                        No. She just called and said she 
                        was gonna go to Justin’s. 
                             (then)
                        She was upset - so I thought I’d 
                        give her a little space.
                                 NAOMI
                        Oh. Well, tell her to call me, ok?

                                 MEG
                        Of course. Hey. Why don’t you come 
                        in?
                             (off Naomi’s hesitance)
                        I'll put on some tea. You’ll love 
                        my tea. I add whiskey and lemon.

                                 NAOMI
                             (laughs)
                        You really don’t have to do that.

                                 MEG
                        I think I do.

           EXT. URI SPEEDBOAT - ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT 

           Suzy grips the gunwale in the bow of a small speedboat as 
           Jamie mans the outboard motor from the stern. Seas are rough. 

           While small, Jamie’s boat is equipped with state-of-the-art 
           oceanography equipment. "URI" is printed on it's side.

           Jamie whistles to Suzy and points towards the horizon.

           We see: dark thunderheads in the clouds.

                                 JAMIE
                        Better be quick about it! Don’t 
                        like the way those heads turned.

           Zu nods, determined. Holds on tighter. They speed ahead. 

           INT. SUZY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           Meg and Naomi at the kitchen counter over cups of tea. 

                                 MEG
                        When was that 2009? 10? 

                                 NAOMI
                        Eleven.

                                 MEG
                        God. Where does the time go. That 
                        woman was such an ogre! With her 
                        faux British accent.

                                 NAOMI
                        “Miss Geneva from Yorkshire.” 
                                 MEG
                        No wonder Zu hated ballet. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Didn’t she take off one time? Right 
                        in the middle of a performance?

                                 MEG
                        Right in the middle, yes. Just 
                        exited stage left. Wasn't pleased 
                        with her performance. She's always 
                        been so hard on herself, that Zu. 
                             (then)
                        But you’re the one with the great 
                        ballet story. Remember? When all 
                        those girls struck their final pose 
                        and Franny broke character and 
                        turned to the audience and shouted - 

                                 MEG/NAOMI
                        “I love you, Mommy!” 

                                 NAOMI
                        Yep. Got it on video. Somewhere.

           A beat.

           Meg takes hold of Naomi’s hand.

                                 MEG
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 NAOMI
                        Don’t be. It's good to remember 
                        happy stuff.

                                 MEG
                        No, I’m so sorry that I haven’t 
                        been a better friend to you.

                                 NAOMI
                        ... you were going through a 
                        divorce. I know what hell that is.

                                 MEG
                        That, yes - and our kids stopped 
                        hanging out. That’s the worse part 
                        of these dramatic friend breakups. 
                        It trickles down to the parents.

                                 NAOMI
                        What do you mean our kids stopped 
                        hanging out? Zu and Franny did?
                                 MEG
                        Yeah. They had a falling out. 
                        Around the time me & Jim broke up.

                                 NAOMI
                        Wait - didn’t Franny spent weekends 
                        here all summer last summer? 
                             (off Meg’s blank face)
                        When I worked? She was with Zu.

                                 MEG
                        Not this past summer, no. I 
                        think... she had some new friends.

                                 NAOMI
                        The Barbies up there today?  

                                 MEG
                        Yeah. And I don’t think Zu was very 
                        welcome at the Barbie Mansion.
                             (a confession)
                        They were pretty mean about it, I 
                        think. 

           The DOORBELL rings. 

           EXT. URI SPEEDBOAT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 

           The ENGINE cuts out. Wind picking up, Jamie has to shout:

                                 JAMIE
                        ALRIGHT - WE'RE OVER A ROCK REEF 
                        NOW! IF THERE ARE IRUKANDJI OUT 
                        HERE THIS IS WHERE THEY’D BE. HELP 
                        ME GET THESE LIGHTS OVER THE SIDE!

           Jamie hits a switch. A string of metal halide lights come to 
           life, SHINING BRIGHT.

           They drag them to the side of the boat and start throwing 
           them over, but Jamie is distracted by the sky.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        I THINK WE SHOULD HEAD IN! DON’T 
                        LIKE THE WAY THE SKY’S LOOKING.

                                 SUZY
                        NO! IF WE WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT FULL 
                        MOON, THE WATER WILL BE TOO COLD! 
                        WE’LL MISS OUR CHANCE.

           Determined, Suzy doubles her speed. 
           We see: the lights sinking into the depths of the sea, 
           illuminating the reef and rocks and sea life below.

           EXT. SUZY’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS 

           Meg and Naomi open the front door to find Justin.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Hi, Ms. Swanson. Is Zu here?

                                 MEG
                        No... because she’s with you. At 
                        your house. 

                                 JUSTIN
                        Uh. I haven’t seen her, M’am. 

                                 MEG
                        Well if she’s not with you, then 
                        where the hell is she?

           EXT. URI SPEEDBOAT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Suzy and Jamie peer over the side of the rocking, buffeting 
           boat. The lights illuminate for leagues below them. 

           They each hold a fancy plankton net (a long-handled net with 
           a narrow conical). A crack of THUNDER. Rain starts to fall.

                                 JAMIE
                        We have to go!

                                 SUZY
                        No - not yet! NOT YET! 

           Suzy peers desperately into the sea, they must be here. Then -

           We see: several pale white jellyfish, the elusive Irukandji, 
           dancing in a beam of light.

                                 SUZY (CONT’D)
                        There! I see them! Look!

                                 JAMIE
                        BINGO! 

           INT. SUZY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Meg and Naomi interrogating Justin in the kitchen.
                                 MEG
                        What do you mean a scientist? What 
                        scientist? 

                                 JUSTIN
                        I dunno - he’s a professor at James 
                        Cook University in Australia. An 
                        expert in jellyfish. We left him a 
                        message at his lab and - 

                                 MEG
                        Wait. This is why Zu was going to 
                        Australia?? To meet a stranger?

                                 JUSTIN
                        A famous stranger, yeah. But anyway 
                        it turns out she didn’t have to go 
                        to him - he came to her. They’ve 
                        been hanging out this whole week, 
                        doing research in town.

                                 MEG
                        Hold on. Zu has been “hanging out” 
                        with an adult man this whole week?

                                 JUSTIN
                        Think so. I mean, she’s not really 
                        talking to me right now, but she’s 
                        been sneaking out of school to meet 
                        someone and she called out to 
                        “Jamie” at the memorial today, so. 

           Meg’s face turns very grave.

                                 MEG
                        I’m calling the police.

                                 NAOMI
                        You said you called this man's lab? 
                        Do you still have the number?

           Justin scrolls through his phone.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Yeah. I should...

           EXT. URI SPEEDBOAT - NIGHT

           Jamie's net is poised above the water about to strike, but a 
           strong wave knocks the boat and his net jerks, shakes.

           We see: the jellyfish scurry away. Opportunity blown.
                                 JAMIE
                        DAMN IT! IT'S TOO ROUGH OUT HERE!

                                 SUZY
                        LET ME TRY!

                                 JAMIE
                        NO! IT’S TIME TO GO!

           Jamie throws his net, heads to the stern to start the boat. 

           But Suzy picks up his net and goes to the side again. 

           We see: they’re back. The bloom of Irukandji swim into the 
           light. Their long tentacles like a string of pearls.

           Suzy leans way over the gunwale with the net. She’s going to 
           get one of them if it kills her...

           INT. SUZY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Meg paces back and forth, Justin’s phone to her ear.

                                 MEG
                             (into phone)
                        YES! Hello. I need to speak to 
                        Jamie Seymour please. 
                        It’s an emergency.
                             (beat)
                        I don’t care - transfer me to his 
                        cell then. 

           Naomi looks out the window. Looking worrisome out there.

           We see: the full moon. Big and open. The rain. The wind. 

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        Yes! Is this Dr. Jamie Seymour of 
                        James Cook University?

           INT. DR. JAMIE SEYMOUR’S BEDROOM - CAIRNS, AUSTRALIA - NIGHT 

           DR. JAMIE SEYMOUR (late 50s) sits up in bed, a cellphone to 
           his ear. He was sound asleep. HIS WIFE sleeps next to him. 

           [Note: Dr. Jamie Seymour is a real person. Might be cool if 
           we got him for this cameo?] 

                                 REAL JAMIE SEYMOUR 
                        Hello. This is Jamie Seymour. 
                        What’s the emergency? 
                                 MEG
                        This is Meg Swanson, Dr. Seymour. 
                        Suzy Swanson’s mom.

                                 REAL JAMIE SEYMOUR
                        ...who?

                                 MEG
                        Suzy Swanson! The 13-year-old 
                        you’ve been “palling around” with 
                        in South Grove.

                                 REAL JAMIE SEYMOUR (O.S.)
                        Sorry, what’s South Grove?

                                 MEG
                        Massachusetts! South Grove, 
                        Massachusetts. And you better bring 
                        her home right now! 

           A beat.

                                 DR. JAMIE SEYMOUR 
                        M’am, I haven’t been to 
                        Massachusetts since 1978. I have no 
                        idea what you’re talking about.

                                 MEG
                        ...You’re not with my daughter?

                                 DR. JAMIE SEYMOUR
                        I am in bed. I’m in Cairns, 
                        Australia. Where it’s 7AM.

           OFF Meg, shock and worry flooding her face...

           EXT. KAYAK - ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT  

           We see: Suzy is not on a well-appointed URI speedboat with 
           Jamie Seymour and his intricate equipment.

           She is in a beat-up kayak. Alone. In the middle of these 
           rough seas, with a jerry-rigged net and single glow stick 
           around her neck. 

           We see: Suzy stand in the swaying kayak. She leans over the 
           side with her net. So unbelievably dangerous. 

           From SUZY POV’s we see: the Irukandji. She takes a swipe!  

                                 SUZY
                        THEY’RE TOO FAST, JAMIE! 
           EXT. URI SPEEDBOAT - CONTINUOUS 

           From SUZY’s POV we see: Jamie, at the stern, yanking on the 
           starter cord of the outboard Engine.

                                 JAMIE
                        ENOUGH! WE HAVE TO GO NOW!

                                 SUZY
                        I ALMOST HAVE IT! 

           The ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE and the boat LEAPS FORWARD. 

           We see: Suzy fall over the side of the kayak, into the water.

           INT. SUZY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Meg’s on the phone. Naomi leans into Justin for more info.

                                 JUSTIN
                        I don’t know! 

                                 NAOMI
                        Anything you can tell us, Justin. 
                        Anything. An address. A location.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Besides the beach, I don’t know 
                        where she’d be. And she’s not 
                        there, I looked.

           Meg hangs up the phone.

                                 MEG
                        The police are on their way.

                                 JUSTIN
                        I mean, she really wanted to catch 
                        one? I know that. Obsessed with it.

           Naomi looks out at the moon, a terrible thought dawning...

                                 NAOMI
                        Meg. She doesn't have access to a 
                        boat does she?

                                                              SMASH TO:

           EXT. MEG'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The garage door opens. There’s a big, dusty spot where a 
           kayak was.
                                 MEG
                        ... oh God... Aaron’s kayak. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I’ll call the Coast Guard. 

                                 MEG
                        Oh my God. That thing is so tiny.

           EXT. KAYAK - NIGHT

           We see: the kayak, now empty, tosses in the rough waves.  

           EXT. UNDERWATER - ATLANTIC OCEAN - CONTINOUS 

           Suzy tumbles through the water, sinking down down down. The 
           single glow stick around her neck is her only light.   

           It’s so dark.

           Her head SCRAPES the side of the reef and blood STREAKS 
           through the water.

           Zu puts her hand to her head. It hurts. Where is she? She 
           holds the glow stick up and -  

           We see: An Irukandji. Two inches in front of her face. 

           It extends its pearl-string tentacles towards her. The end of 
           it SPARKS with a secret electricity. 

           Zu jerks away, afraid. Treads water. The Irukandji advances. 

           And now we see: he is not alone. Two dozen other Irukandji 
           are behind him. An army of them, now lined up to attack Zu. 

           Zu’s defenseless. 

           As they take a murderous lunge towards her, she closes her 
           eyes and the screen goes BLACK. 

           We hear: ZWIRP! as they sting her.

           ZWIRP! and we see: Franny drenched in pee, weeping. 

           ZWIRP! Meg and Jim’s faces, breaking the news of the divorce.

           ZWIRP! Franny’s casket, being lowered into the ground. 

           ZWIPR: Aaron waving from Meg’s Subaru, leaving for college.  

           ZWIRP! Naomi standing alone in the surf, staring out. 
           ZWIRP! That polar bear’s lips, not moving. 

           ZWIRP! Five year-old Franny, happily kicking away from us. 

           ZWIRP! Spit falling from Franny’s cruel lips. 

           ZWIRP ZWIRP ZWIRP ZWIRPPPPPP

           A beat. 

           We see: Suzy’s body falling away into the dark cold water.

           The screen goes BLACK.

           INT. SOUTH GROVE GENERAL HOSPITAL - MORNING 

           Still in BLACK, SOUND starts to FADE IN...

           We hear: OXYGEN PUMPING in and out. 

           We hear: the TICK-TOSH-TICK of a heart monitor. 

           We hear: the PUSH-PUSH-PUSH of a blood pressure cuff.

           Suddenly, Suzy’s eyes JOLT OPEN.

           We see: Jim and Meg at the foot of our bed. 

           We see: Aaron in an armchair studying a textbook.

           We see: a NURSE (30s, in white) adjusting our IV and noticing 
           our eyes are open. She turns and whispers to Jim and Meg:

                                 NURSE
                        I think someone’s waking up.

           Jim, Meg, and Aaron leap up - their faces fill the frame. 

           Meg’s eyes are teary. Jim takes Zu’s hand. Aaron smiles.

                                 AARON
                        Z? Can you hear us? 

                                 SUZY
                             (groggy)
                        ...where am I?

                                 MEG
                        You’re in the hospital, honey.  
                                 JIM
                        You’re going to be okay, but there 
                        was a lot of water in your lungs. 
                        The Coast Guard had to do CPR.

                                 MEG
                        And you have concussion. You hit 
                        your head, honey. 

                                 AARON
                        You almost drowned. 

           Zu sits up, alarmed. 

                                 SUZY
                        Where's Jamie?? Is he okay?

           Meg and Jim exchange a look. Aaron takes Suzy's other hand.

                                 MEG
                        Dr. Seymour’s in Australia, Suzy.

                                 SUZY
                        He went back?

                                 MEG
                        No. He was never here, sweetheart. 
                        You must’ve imagined him. 

           Zu laughs. Because that’s the only possible reaction.

                                 SUZY
                        What are you talking about? We were 
                        in his boat last night.

                                 JIM
                        You weren’t, honey.

                                 SUZY
                        Yes. In his URI Research Vessel.

                                 AARON
                        You were in my kayak, Z. Alone.

           A beat. 

           Suzy looks down at her body, expecting to see welts and 
           lashes and Irukandji butchery. But there’s nothing there. 

           Suzy struggles to make sense of this. Reality starts to 
           unfurl...

           We see: Suzy talking to herself on the roof of the Seawater 
           Facility at URI. Pleading her case to an empty tank. 
           We see: Suzy on the beach with test tubes, reassuring Naomi 
           she’s with him - pointing to absolutely no one on the beach.

           We see: Suzy raising her hand in class.  Mrs. Turton saying, 
           “Yes. Go. Make it quick” - assuming she has to go to 
           bathroom. There’s been no PA announcement.

           We see: The corner of the auditorium during the memorial was 
           always empty. Jamie was never there. 

           We see: Suzy talking to herself on a parking lot bench. 

           We see: Suzy pushing off a dock alone in a kayak. 

                                 SUZY
                        Oh God....I made him up? 

           Suzy starts to CRY. Like a child. Unfiltered, big tears.

                                 SUZY (CONT’D)
                        ...I’m crazy?

                                 JIM
                        No! You aren’t crazy. You were 
                        trying to tell us you were in pain.

                                 AARON
                        We weren’t listening to you.

                                 MEG
                        Your silence was a scream for help 
                        and we missed it, Zu. We all missed 
                        it. But we’re here for you now.
                             (beat)
                        We love you so much, Zu.

           Jim, Meg, and Aaron’s faces fill the frame, full of love. 

                                 NURSE
                        She should lay back. We can’t let 
                        her get too excited. 

                                 JIM
                        Here, honey. Lie back now and rest.

           Jim gently guides Zu’s head back to her pillow. Meg kisses 
           her cheek.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        When you wake up, we’ll all be 
                        sitting right here.

                                 AARON
                        All of us. 
           Zu’s eyes drift back to sleep.

           INT. DR. LEGLER'S OFFICE - SOMETIME LATER - MORNING 

           We see: tie-dyed tights this time. 

                                 DR. LEGLER
                        How do you feel about that? 

                                 SUZY
                        I don’t know. Lucky? But also, 
                        like, whoa, my brain did that?
                             (then)
                        It’s a lot. 

                                 DR. LEGLER
                        ... it is. Though delusions are not 
                        uncommon. When we lock away or 
                        repress our feelings - like guilt, 
                        and grief - they find ways to 
                        escape. Alter our worlds for us.

                                 SUZY
                        I didn’t know I even felt guilty. 

                                 DR. LEGLER
                        We are complicated creatures. 
                        Especially in the face of grief.

           Suzy considers this. 

                                 SUZY
                        Question. Do you always wear such 
                        crazy tights? Or was that a 
                        delusion, too? 

           Dr. Legler laughs. So does Zu.

                                 DR. LEGLER
                        No, these are very real. We all 
                        have our obsessions.

           A beat.

                                 SUZY
                        I don't want to see things that 
                        aren't there again, Dr. Legler.
                             (then)
                        How do I do that?
                                 DR. LEGLER
                        You talk about it, Zu. You come 
                        next week and we talk about it some 
                        more. Lather, rinse, repeat. 

           Zu nods. That’s a promise.

                                 DR. LEGLER (CONT’D)
                        In the meantime, try to enjoy what 
                        is real. If you can. 
                             (then)
                        Forgive yourself. Take baby steps. 

                                 MEG (PRE-LAP)
                        You ready for this, honey?

           INT. MEG’S SUBARU - EARLY EVENING 

           Meg pulls up to a curb and puts the car in park. She points. 

                                 MEG
                        Oh! Cute! They went all out!

           EXT. EUGENE FIELD MIDDLE SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS 

           We see: kids streaming into the school in their heroes and 
           villains costumes.  Harry Potter & Voldemort. Hamilton & 
           Burr.  Cruella DeVil & a Dalmatian. The Titantic and an 
           iceberg. Katniss Everdeen & President Snow.  

           We see: Aubrey, Molly and Jenna pass by, all dressed as 
           Harley Quinn, of course. 

           We see: Zu in the front seat of Meg’s car, not in a costume. 

                                 SUZY
                        I don’t think I can do this, Mom.

                                 MEG
                        Well, okay. You don’t have to. We 
                        can always go home and order pizza.

                                 SUZY
                        No. I want to. I just... 

           Zu stares at the heroes and villains again, paralyzed. Until -

           Justin appears in the school yard. He’s dressed as a Zombie 
           Ant. His costume is elaborate and gross. He sees Meg’s car, 
           waves, and heads over. Happy to see Zu.

           She climbs out of the car and takes a deep breath.
                                 JUSTIN
                        Hey. You showed.

                                 SUZY
                        What are you supposed to be? A fly? 

                                 JUSTIN
                        No. A villainous Zombie Ant! 
                             (pointing)
                        Hence the stalk sprouting from my 
                        brain?

                                 SUZY
                        Oh, right. 
                             (laughs)
                        It’s awesome, Justin. 

                                 JUSTIN
                        I know it is. Here. 

           He hands her a small shopping bag.

                                 JUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        It’s all they had left at the 
                        costume store. Best I could do on 
                        such short notice.

           Zu pulls out a long cape and... a rainbow clown wig. 

           She puts the cape and wig on. Not the most inspired costume, 
           but it’s a costume anyway.

                                 SUZY
                        Am I a hero or a villain?

                                 JUSTIN
                        Up to you.

           Zu smiles. 

           Justin offers her his arm and they head into the building.  
           Suzy turns for a second and waves good-bye to Meg.

           Meg waves back, watching her daughter go to her first dance.

           As Zu climbs the stairs to the school with Justin, we see 
           Mrs. Turton smile at her. Samira, too. Even Aubrey. A feeling  
           that this dance will be the beginning of a new chapter.

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Turns out there are many things to 
                        be scared of in this world...
           EXT. SOUTH GROVE BEACH - MORNING

           Suzy stands on the beach in the surf. Waves lapping her feet. 

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        Blooms of jellies.  
                        A global extinction.  
                        A middle school dance. 
                        Someone you love dying.

           ON the ocean, so wild and free, CRASHING against the shore. 

                                 SUZY (V.O.)
                        But that’s what makes us us.
                             (then)
                        Jellyfish don’t have hearts.
                        They don’t feel fear or pain or 
                        love or grief.
                        They just float along, unaware of 
                        the life they’re missing up here.
                             (then)
                        How beautiful it can be.

           A dog BARKS.

           We see: Fluffernutter on the beach, darting towards her.

           We see: Naomi approaching, hair blowing in the sea air.

                                 SUZY
                        Hey, Mrs. Jackson.

                                 NAOMI
                        Done. Can you believe I got all 
                        that stuff in one van?

                                 SUZY
                             (laughs)
                        No.

           We see: there’s a U-HAUL parked at Cove Apartments.

                                 NAOMI
                        I think it’ll be good for me. A 
                        place with less reminders. 
                             (off Zu’s nod)
                        You’re gonna come visit me in 
                        Boston, though, right?

                                 SUZY
                        Of course. Gotta see Fluffernutter!
                                 NAOMI
                        Actually... that’s what I wanted to 
                        talk to you about. How would you 
                        feel about him staying with you for 
                        awhile?

                                 SUZY
                        ...really? 

                                 NAOMI
                        Shared custody. Your mom said okay.

                                 SUZY
                        Oh my God - no way!
                             (to him)
                        You’re gonna come stay with me, 
                        Fluffynut?! Wanna stay with me?

           Suzy drops to the sand, petting the dog behind the ears and 
           the belly. He’s so excited, lapping her face with kisses.

           Naomi takes this happy sight in.

                                 NAOMI
                        I’m sorry I didn’t know how unkind 
                        Franny and those girls were to you 
                        last year, Zu. I wish I’d known.

           A beat. 

                                 SUZY
                        It’s okay, Mrs. Jackson.

                                 NAOMI
                        She didn’t mean it. She loved you. 

                                 SUZY
                        I know she did. 
                             (then)
                        Sometimes things just happen. 

           Naomi smiles. A moment between them. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Ready for a walk? 

           Suzy and Naomi begin walking along the beach, as 
           Fluffernutter trots happily behind them.

           Miles of empty beach ahead of them.

                                 END.
