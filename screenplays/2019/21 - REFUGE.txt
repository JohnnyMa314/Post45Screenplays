           EXT. SORGHUM FIELD  - NIGHT

           A moonless night. Dark. Quiet. Tall sorghum sways softly in 
           the evening air.

           A beat-up SEDAN BENCH SEAT sits nestled against the perimeter 
           of the field. On it, a young couple.

           The boy is BRUJO (early-20s). His face fills the screen. He’s 
           earnest. Eerily so.

                                 BRUJO
                        You’re special, Mari. The first 
                        time I saw you, I knew. Could have 
                        any girl I want. But I want you.

           Just a boy wooing a girl.

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                        Fuck, you’re beautiful. You’ll see. 
                        It’s gonna be good with me. You’re 
                        gonna have all the best shit. 

           He smiles, wide and dumb.

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                        Yo, this is crazy. I ain’t never 
                        felt like this before.

                                 MARI (O.C.)
                        You’re sweet, Brujo. I’m so lucky.

           Brujo nods. Smiles.

                                 MARI (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                        But I should go home now. My 
                        parents are going to worry.

           He shakes his head.

                                 BRUJO
                        Nah, don’t stress that. No one’s 
                        gonna mess with you anymore. You’re 
                        my girl now. 

           He moves closer. Gets serious.

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                        Plus, we’re gonna make things 
                        official tonight.

           Finally, we see the object of Brujo’s courting: MARI (16). 
           Awash with terror. She forces a small smile. A single tear 
           slides down her face.
           Her eyes fall to his hand. Tattooed with a large XVIII. And 
           wrapped around a PISTOL. More tears come.

           Brujo sees the change in her. 

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                        Oh, baby girl. You don’t have to be 
                        scared.

           He pulls her face to his. Kisses her hard. She doesn’t 
           reciprocate. He examines her. His face grows dark.

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                        First time’s always hard. But 
                        you’ll get used to it.

           He leans in again. She turns her face away. He kisses her 
           cheek. Her neck. Forcing his affection on her. 

           Mari closes her eyes. Makes peace with her fate.

           Turning away from them, we find TWO ARMED GUARDS waiting 
           dutifully nearby: FLACO (20) and JUNIOR (16). Both covered in 
           the tats of the dominant gang of the area -- BARRIO 18. 
           Junior to a lesser extent.

           The field sits far back from a cluster of small structures. 
           The gang’s clique (headquarters). Soft light and sound 
           emanate from the compound. A tall fence encloses it all. 

           Flaco clicks his tongue at Junior. Nods at the scene beyond 
           them. Smirks. Junior glances over to Brujo and Mari. His eyes 
           find the ground. Not his idea of fun.

           A LACKEY runs out from the clique. Finds Flaco. Hurriedly 
           whispers. Flaco hustles over to Brujo.

           Brujo’s mid-assault. Mari, still clothed, lies back on the 
           seat. Brujo gropes her hard. Clumsy. He stops as Flaco 
           approaches, annoyed.

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                        The fuck...

                                 FLACO
                        Smiley. Someone spotted him in Mal 
                        Paso. Gotta move quick though.

           Rage and delight flash across Brujo’s face. He rises.

                                 BRUJO
                             (to Mari)
                        I’ll be back soon.
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                             (to Flaco)
                        C’mon.

           He quickly heads off. Consumed by the hunt. Flaco and Lackey 
           follow. Junior hangs back. 

           Mari sits up. Wipes her tears. Mari and Junior listen as a 
           rowdy group get in a car. Doors slam. Tires screech away. 

           The night grows quiet again. Mari and Junior stew in it. 
           Mari’s eyes downcast. Prey in waiting. 

           Junior looks to the compound. No one in sight. He moves to 
           the fence along the perimeter. FLIPS the LATCH. Swings the 
           gate open.

           Mari watches him, confused. He shoots her a look. Then walks 
           off toward the buildings. Mari eyes the open gate. Junior 
           gets smaller and smaller. Not turning back.

           Mari rises. Sprints out. Disappears into the inky night.

           EXT. CORN FIELDS - DAY

           A sun-dappled Mari sleeps serenely. Her eyes pop open. 

           She blinks into the light streaming in through the tall CORN 
           STALKS around her. Time to get back to work. 

           She rises. Picks up the large CANVAS BAG she was resting 
           against. Already heavy with the afternoon’s haul. 

           Mari gropes an ear. Pulls down hard. Adds it to her bounty.

           Something rustles against the stalks nearby. Mari stops. 
           Alert. She scans. Listens.

           Silence.

           A moment passes. She calms. Reaches up for another ear.

           A loud BANG sounds. Someone runs through the stalks.

           Instinct takes over. Mari gets low. Scrambles away. Abandons 
           her haul.

           Another BANG. It’s close. The unseen assailant right on her. 

           She rises. Runs as quickly as the corn will allow. Trips.

           Mari cowers, terrified. The perpetrator emerges from the 
           corn: a bespectacled boy with kind eyes. This is Mari’s 
           brother, MEMO (13). He explodes into laughter.
                                 MARI
                        Jesus, Memo. What’s wrong with you?

                                 MEMO
                        What? It’s funny.

           He proudly holds out his hand. Displays three small paper 
           tubes with large wicks. FIRECRACKERS.

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        I just got them.

           Mari snatches them from him. 

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        Hey!

                                 MARI
                        You’re gonna get yourself shot. 
                             (then, defensively)
                        And it’s not funny.

           He holds something out to her. A PUPUSA wrapped in a paper 
           towel. 

                                 MEMO
                        I brought your lunch.

           She takes it, grateful.

                                 MARI
                        Thank you.  Now go home.

           She pushes past him back toward her bag. Feels him lingering. 
           Turns back.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        What is it?

                                 MEMO
                        Maybe you should come home with me. 

           Mari considers. Memo makes his case...

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        You’ve been out here a month and...

           He dies off.

                                 MARI
                        And what?

           She reads the trepidation on his face.
                                 MEMO
                        Mom needs eggs. But Dad’s still at 
                        work.

           Mari’s face falls.

                                 MARI
                        Memo, I can’t go into town.

           He looks to the ground, ashamed.

                                 MEMO
                        I don’t want to go alone.

                                 MARI
                        Memo...

           He pleads.

                                 MEMO
                        Please. It’s better if we go 
                        together. Plus, Brujo has another 
                        girl. He already forgot about you.

           Mari studies him. Sees his fear. Her love for her brother 
           supersedes her self-preservation. She nods. 

                                 MARI
                             (re: the bag)
                        Help me get this back to the barn.

           Memo smiles. Scampers off. As he disappears, her face grows 
           dark.

           EXT. RURAL TOWN - MAIN SQUARE - DAY

           Mari and Memo navigate the pockmarked sidewalks of their 
           rundown, vibrant town. Music and bright buildings surround 
           them. Verdant hills line the horizon.

           The pair are alert. On edge. They arrive at the main square. 
           TIENDAS line the perimeter. VENDORS pepper the open areas.

           Mari eyes the surroundings warily. She grabs her brother’s 
           hand. They beeline to one of the small stores.

           INT. RURAL TOWN - TIENDA - MOMENTS LATER

           Mari pays the woman behind the counter. Memo’s focus locked 
           outside the door. She grabs the EGGS. Nods to her brother.
                                 MARI
                        Let’s go.

           EXT. RURAL TOWN - MAIN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

           As they exit, Memo spots a MAN. His body, a chaos of tattoos, 
           including a distinct XVIII across his forehead. 

           Memo freezes. Mari notices.

                                 MARI
                             (hushed whisper)
                        Keep moving.

           He doesn’t budge. Mari grabs his hand. He looks at her. She 
           offers a reassuring nod. He subtly returns it.

           They move toward a side street, maintaining an easy pace.

           EXT. RURAL TOWN - SIDE STREET - CONTINUOUS

           They round the bend onto the smaller street. Mari glances 
           behind them. Waits. Nothing. 

           They exhale. 

           EXT. RURAL TOWN - OUTSKIRTS STREET - LATER

           Mari and Memo traverse the outskirts of town. The street, 
           less populated. The two, a bit more at ease. They pass a wall 
           adorned with a large spray-painted 18. Mari speeds up a bit.

           Memo swings the BAG OF EGGS as they walk. 

                                 MARI
                        Be careful.

           He continues swinging.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        If you break them, I’ll make you go 
                        back alone.

           Memo shoots her a sidelong glance. Doesn’t respond. But stops 
           swinging the bag. 

           Faint RAP MUSIC wafts through the street. Mari keeps her eyes 
           forward, trying to mask her unease. 

           The source of the music - an OLDER SEDAN - turns the corner. 
           And slowly creeps toward them.
           As it approaches, Mari looks to her brother. Part to hide her 
           face, part to calm his fears. 

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                             (quietly)
                        Keep walking. They’re going to 
                        drive right past us.

           Memo continues. Frightened. Staring at the ground. 

           The car approaches. Slows... Then PASSES. Memo smiles.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        I told you.

           BRAKE LIGHTS. The sedan pulls onto the sidewalk - blocking 
           Mari and Memo’s path.

           Memo freezes. Mari grips his hand, tight.

           Flaco and Junior exit.

                                 FLACO
                        Hey, hold up!

           He pulls a PISTOL from his waistband, emphasizing the point. 
           Mari shifts uneasily as they approach. Memo looks back. 
           Contemplates running. Mari clocks this. Shakes her head.

                                 MARI
                        They’ll shoot.

           Memo remains.

           Flaco and Junior reach them. Flaco hits Junior’s shoulder.

                                 FLACO
                        What’d I fucking tell you.

           Junior exchanges a look with Mari. Sadness in his eyes. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Brujo’s been lookin’ for you.

           Flaco gets close to Mari.

                                 FLACO
                        Shit, he don’t want you anymore, 
                        maybe I’ll have a go.

           Memo’s agitated by Flaco’s insinuation. He steps closer. 
           Wants to say something. But can’t. Mari clocks this. Puts a 
           reassuring hand on his shoulder.
           Flaco grabs Mari by the waist. Starts leading her to the car.

                                 FLACO (CONT'D)
                        C’mon. Let’s go.

           As she’s lead away, Mari turns to her brother.

                                 MARI
                        Go home. Tell mom.

           Memo’s on the verge of tears. He shakes his head. Mari nods.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                             (unsure of this)
                        I’ll be home soon.

           She turns back to the car. Each step, sheer dread. 

           Flaco opens the door. The backseat’s littered with implements 
           of terror: KNIFE with dry blood, homemade PIPE GUN, ROPE.

           Flaco notices this. He holds Mari back for a moment.

                                 FLACO
                             (to Junior)
                        Get that shit in the back.

           Junior obeys. As he collects the items, a CAR passes. 

           Flaco locks eyes with the passenger, SMILEY (20s). His stare 
           turns cold. Smiley’s eyes go wide.

                                 FLACO (CONT'D)
                             (under his breath)
                        Fucking Smiley...

           Flaco pulls his GUN. Starts SHOOTING wildly. The other car 
           SCREECHES away. Mari seizes the opportunity. 

                                 MARI
                             (to Memo)
                        Run!

           Wasting no time, the two book it back down the street. Memo 
           drops the bag as he flees. They turn down an alley.

           Flaco and Junior watch them run.

                                 FLACO
                        Fuck! 
                             (to Junior)
                        Get in the car!

           Junior gets behind the wheel. Flaco sits shotgun.
           INT. SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

           Starting the car...

                                 JUNIOR
                        Who should I follow?

                                 FLACO
                        This fucker’s not getting away 
                        again. Brujo can handle her later. 

           They peel out. Tear down the road after Smiley.

           EXT. RURAL TOWN - ALLEY - SAME

           A PILE OF TRASH. Mari and Memo peer out from behind it, their 
           breath rapid and hot.

                                 MARI
                        They’re gone.

           She grabs his hand. Pulls him up. They run for home.

           EXT. RURAL TOWN - SIDE STREET - SAME

           On the sidewalk, the GROCERY BAG sits open. EGGS BROKEN on 
           the hot, dirty sidewalk. The intense sun starts to COOK them.

           EXT. CRUZ HOME - NIGHT

           Darkness. A modest CONCRETE HOME sits quiet. No sign of life.

           Well, almost no sign. Memo’s bespectacled eyes peer out from 
           a gap at the bottom of the WINDOW COVERING...

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Guillermito! Get away from there.

           INT. CRUZ HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, Mari and CARMEN (mid-30s), their mother, prepare 
           dinner by candlelight. Tension permeates the house.

           Memo moves to a MACHETE near the to door. He holds the handle 
           in his small hand. Ready to defend.

           Carmen sees this. Takes it from him. Hands him a stack of TIN 
           PLATES. Nods to the table. He obeys. Laying them out.
                                 MEMO
                        Is papa coming home soon?

           Carmen tries to mask her concern in annoyance.

                                 CARMEN
                        Of course.

           The DOORKNOB jiggles. Everyone freezes. It jiggles again. 
           Then stops. 

           Carmen motions for the kids to get behind her. She holds the 
           MACHETE defensively.

           The knob moves again. Then turns. TOMÁS (late-30s) enters. 
           Quickly closes the door behind him.

                                 TOMÁS
                        I couldn’t see my key in the dark. 

                                 CARMEN
                        Tomás!

           She rushes over. Hits him. Then hugs him.

                                 TOMÁS
                        Everything’s okay. I got it.

           This lands on Carmen.

                                 TOMÁS (CONT'D)
                        We leave tomorrow.

           Mari and Memo go quiet. Carmen backs away, concerned.

                                 CARMEN
                        How much did Don Ramirez give you?

           Tomás looks lovingly at his wife.

                                 TOMÁS
                        Enough.

                                 CARMEN
                        How?

           The adults exchange a charged look. Tomás nods. Carmen closes 
           her eyes. Shakes her head. Tomás pulls her in.

                                 TOMÁS
                        It’s what’s best. This place isn’t 
                        our home anymore. 
                                 CARMEN
                             (sad, to herself)
                        Our land.  Our home.

                                 TOMÁS
                        Tomorrow, we go north. Start a new 
                        life. Make a new home.

           Mari’s mind spins with possibilities. Apprehension and 
           excitement on her face. Tomás sees this. Pulls her into a 
           seat. Beckons Memo over. 

                                 TOMÁS (CONT'D)
                        This will be hard. Probably the 
                        hardest thing you’ll ever do. But 
                        we’ll be together. That’s what’s 
                        important.

           Memo steps next to Mari. He puts a protective arm over her 
           shoulders. Tomás smiles at the gesture.

                                 TOMÁS (CONT'D)
                        We’ll leave in the morning. No 
                        warning.

           The family nods. Tomás senses their sadness. He gets an idea. 
           Pulls the KEY off his keyring. 

                                 TOMÁS (CONT'D)
                        You see this?
                             (off their nod)
                        It opened the door to our home for 
                        your entire lives. We’ll take it 
                        with us. As a charm. It will be the 
                        thing that opens the door to our 
                        new life. A better life.

           Mari smiles. Memo holds it in his hand, trying to feel its 
           power.

           Something CREAKS outside. The sticks and barbed wire that 
           serve as a gate shifting. Tomás is alert. Creeps to the 
           window. Peers out. It’s still. Quiet.

           A GUST of wind. The GATE sways. He watches for one minute 
           longer. Nothing.

                                 CARMEN
                        Tomás?

                                 TOMÁS
                        Just the wind. 

           He turns back to his family. 
                                 TOMÁS (CONT'D)
                        Eat. Then pack. We’ll leave before 
                        sun-up.

           They nod. Sit at the table. Tomás eyes the window, uneasy.

           INT. CRUZ HOME - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Mari slips down the hall. CANDLE in hand. HUSHED VOICES from 
           her parents’ room. She blows the candle out. Slides over to 
           the BLANKET covering the entrance of their room. 

           Peering through a CRACK, she sees the BED pulled to one side. 
           A HOLE dug in the hard dirt floor. Tomás drops the MONEY in  
           and covers it as he talks to his wife.

                                 TOMÁS
                        If something happens, you take the 
                        kids and go. 

                                 CARMEN
                        I won’t go without you.

                                 TOMÁS
                        You might have to.
                             (off her trepidation)
                        It’s only one more night. Then 
                        we’ll be free of this madness.

           Carmen nods. Tomás pushes the foot of the bed back in place, 
           hiding the disturbed dirt. 

           He reaches out for his wife’s hand. Carmen takes it. 

                                 TOMÁS (CONT'D)
                        Let’s get some rest. 

           Tomás blows out the CANDLE. Casts the room into darkness.

           Mari slips down the hall to her own room.

           INT. CRUZ HOME - MARI AND MEMO’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Mari sleeps deeply. 

           MACHINE GUN FIRE nearby. A HAND clasps over Mari’s mouth. Her 
           eyes pop open.

           It’s Carmen. Memo sits in his twin bed, frightened. Mari 
           tries to speak. Carmen gestures for her to keep silent. 

           A BANG from the front door. Followed by LAUGHTER. 
                                 BRUJO (O.S.)
                        This fucker’s sturdy.

           Mari panics. Tomás appears in the doorway, MACHETE in hand. 

                                 TOMÁS
                        They’re almost in. Get them out. 

           Carmen dashes to the WINDOW. Pulls it open. USHERS Memo out. 
           Reaches for Mari. She resists. 

                                 MARI
                        No.

                                 TOMÁS
                        Go. Now!

           Mari reluctantly obeys. Tomás stands behind his wife. 
           Readying to help her out. Carmen turns to her husband. The 
           BANGING gets louder. More SHOTS fired.

                                 CARMEN
                        No.

                                 TOMÁS
                        You don’t have a choice.

           A final BANG. The door RELENTS. The VOICES now in the house.

           Carmen turns to her children.

                                 CARMEN
                        We love you.
                             (then, urgent)
                        Run!

           She closes the window. Pulls the CURTAIN.

           EXT. CRUZ HOME - BACK FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Mari and Memo watch, helpless, as their parents disappear. 

                                 MARI
                        No!

           She looks to Memo. Fear on his face. She grabs his hand.

           Their house abuts rural hills and fields. They get low. 
           Scurry to a HILL several yards away. Duck behind a BUSH. 

           From this vantage, they can see the house. The RURAL ROAD. A 
           VAN by the gate.
           MUZZLE FLASHES illuminate the windows from within the house. 

           Commotion. A chaos of voices. Lights click on. One voice 
           above the others. 

                                 BRUJO (O.S.)
                        Where is she?!

                                 TOMÁS (O.S.)
                        We sent her north.

           A brief pause.

                                 BRUJO (O.S.)
                        Bullshit! Come on...

           Mari and Memo watch as their parents are pulled from the 
           house. Into the road. Brujo holds a GUN on them. He nods to 
           Flaco and Junior. They PUSH the couple to their knees. 

           EXT. RURAL ROAD - CRUZ’S FRONT YARD - SAME

           Carmen fights tears. Tomás remains defiant. Holds her. 

           Brujo PACES. A manic, drug-induced air about him. MACHINE GUN 
           casually draped across his arm. MACHETE in the other hand. He 
           bends. His face level with theirs.

                                 BRUJO
                        You gonna use this on me?

           The Cruzes meet his gaze, unyielding. Brujo looks to his men.

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                        Can you believe that? This fucker 
                        was tryin’ to off me.

           He gets in Tomás’ face.

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                        Tell me where she is and I promise 
                        to be gentle with her.

           Tomás’ eyes burn with rage. 

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                        Nah. You’re not gonna talk.

           He looks to Carmen.

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                        But you might.
           Brujo gets behind Tomás. Pulls his head back. Puts the 
           MACHETE to his throat.

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                        What about it, mamá? Where’s our 
                        little Mari?

           Tomás’ stare begs his wife to remain silent.

           Carmen is in agony. Tears spill from her eyes.

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                        No one has to die tonight...

           Tomás shakes his head.

                                 TOMÁS
                        He’ll kill me either way.

           Brujo examines Carmen. She’s staying strong. He smiles.

           Brujo SLIDES the machete across Tomás’ THROAT. BLOOD GUSHES.

           Carmen’s screams fill the night. Tomás FALLS.

                                 CARMEN
                        No!

           She brings her face close to her husband’s. Helpless as she 
           watches the life leak out of him.

           EXT. CRUZ HOME - BACK FIELD - SAME

           Mari and Memo take in the murder of their father. Memo’s 
           young mind can barely process the horror. Mari RISES. Memo 
           grabs her arm.

                                 MEMO
                        No. 

                                 MARI
                        They want me.

           Memo shakes his head, frantic. Refuses to release her. 

                                 MEMO
                        They’ll kill you. Kill all of us.

           His desperation is too much for her. She gets low again. 
           Pulls him in. They turn their powerless attention to the 
           chaos below.

           Carmen SOBS. Prostrate. Brujo pulls her up. 
                                 BRUJO
                        You want this to end? Tell me where 
                        she is. 

           Carmen meets his gaze. Past the point of no return.

                                 CARMEN
                        She’s gone.

                                 BRUJO
                        Lies. One of my guys saw her.

           Carmen stares back, defiant.

                                 CARMEN
                        You’ll never touch her again.

           He smirks at her bravado. Keeps his eyes locked with hers. 
           Yells commands.

                                 BRUJO
                        Find them. They’re close. 

           The men FAN OUT. Flaco and Junior move to the backyard. Memo 
           starts to squirm. Mari holds him tight.

           Junior starts up the hill. Moving his GUN across the TALL 
           GRASS, slowly wending his way toward their hiding spot. Flaco 
           takes the other direction. 

           Junior is close. Mari can see the TIP of his gun as it moves 
           through the grass. 

           Memo’s breathing gets heavy. Mari holds him tighter.

           Flaco impatiently searches. He stops. Looks to Junior.

                                 FLACO
                        Hey! Back up.

           He motions for Junior to fall back. Junior’s confused but 
           complies. Mari and Memo breathe a sigh of relief. 

           BURSTS of GUNSHOTS pepper the hill. Flaco smoking them out.

           A bullet WHIZZES by them, just missing Memo. His whimpering 
           almost audible.

           Brujo runs to the back of the house. 

                                 BRUJO
                        What the fuck are you doing? I 
                        don’t want to fuck a corpse. 
                                 FLACO
                        I just...

                                 BRUJO
                        Fucking idiot! 

           He turns back toward the house. 

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                             (re: Carmen)
                        Get that bitch inside.

           One of the men pulls Carmen inside the house. Brujo, Junior 
           and Flaco move around to the front. Brujo turns to Flaco.

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                        You stay here. 

           Flaco is pissed. Wants to partake in the fun. Brujo adds...

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                        And no more fucking shooting.

           Flaco hangs back. The other men file into the abode. 

           Carmen refuses to give them the satisfaction of her terror. 
           She stares at the hills. Willing her children to run.

           The horde disappears into the house. Loud MUSIC BLARES. 

           Flaco scans the area. No one else around. He moves to a 
           window. Tries to get a glimpse of the action.

           Mari shakes Memo. 

                                 MARI
                             (hushed whisper)
                        Let’s go. 

           Memo is in full shutdown. He shakes his head, frozen.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        If we don’t leave, we’ll die. 

           She’s getting through. He calms a bit.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Cut through the fields. We’ll hide 
                        in Señor Flores’ barn. Stay low 
                        until you get to the corn. Okay?
                             (off his nod)
                        We go on three.
           She checks. Flaco’s still looking through the window. Mari 
           thinks of her mother within. Fights tears. Takes a breath.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        One. Two.

           She gives one last look to Flaco. Finally...

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Three.

           They SCURRY up the hill. Stay low. Run fast. 

           Mari turns as they crest the hill. Flaco steps away from the 
           window. Peers into the dark. Did he hear something?

           There’s no turning back now. Mari runs harder.

           A SCREAM from inside the house. LAUGHTER. The guys are having 
           fun. Flaco’s pulled back to the window. He smiles.

           EXT. CORN FIELDS - NIGHT 

           Mari and Memo TEAR through the fields. Run for their lives.

           INT. BARN - LATER

           A BARN DOOR slides open. A small shaft of moonlight. Simple 
           FARMING EQUIPMENT and FOOD STORES within. Mari and Memo 
           TUMBLE in. Mari quickly CLOSES the door. LATCHES it. She 
           listens. It’s SILENT.

           Memo curls into a ball in the corner - emotionally and 
           physically spent. Mari finds a BURLAP SACK. Places it over 
           him. He doesn’t react.

           Mari leaves the catatonic Memo. Climbs up to a cantilevered 
           second floor. Looks into the night. Vigilant for danger.

           INT. BARN - MORNING

           Memo wakes with a start. Soft, pale light peeks through 
           cracks in the barn. Mari already up. She opens the LATCH. 

                                 MEMO
                        Where are you going?

                                 MARI
                        Back home. Latch the door.

           Memo stands.
                                 MEMO
                        What if you don’t come back?

           Mari considers the question.

                                 MARI
                        Go north alone.

           Mari starts to close the door. She stops. Adds...

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        And don’t go home.

           Memo looks down. Nods.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        I mean it. Promise me.

                                 MEMO
                        I promise.

           She studies him. He’s being genuine. She CLOSES the DOOR. 
           Memo rises. Quickly LATCHES it. 

           He scrambles up to the second floor. Watches his sister’s 
           tiny figure stalk off into the unknown.

           EXT. CRUZ HOME - BACK FIELD - MORNING

           Mari stares down at her family home. It’s quiet. CURTAINS 
           drawn. VAN gone. TOMÁS’ BODY still strewn in the street.

           Mari runs to the back of the HOUSE. Scans. Nothing. She moves 
           to the front. Curtains obscure the windows. But the place 
           seems abandoned. The GATE and FRONT DOOR sit OPEN, but 
           there’s no sound from within the house. Or without.

           Mari takes a BREATH. Then MOVES into action. 

           She creeps to the front door. Pushes it open. A chaotic scene 
           greets her. House trashed. TABLE flipped. FOOD everywhere. 

           Mari moves to enter. The soft SQUEAK of a BIKE comes to rest 
           behind her. She stops.

           She turns. Is met by the suspicious eyes of a BOY (10). It’s 
           clear the two don’t know one another. 

           Mari spins. Is he spying for the gang? Is he merely amazed to 
           see her alive? He’s giving her nothing.

           Mari does the only thing she can think of: she gives a slight 
           WAVE.
           The boy doesn’t reciprocate. He puts his feet on the PEDALS. 
           SPEEDS off.

                                 MARI
                        Fuck.

           Mari RUNS into the house.

           INT. CRUZ HOME - CONTINUOUS

           She BURSTS in. Crosses the chaos. Hopefully calls out...

                                 MARI
                        Mamá!

           In the hall...

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Mamá!

           She pushes into her parents’ room. Is STOPPED short by what 
           she sees.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        No...

           Mari turns back into the hall. Her hand over her mouth. 
           Trying to reconcile the PILE OF GORE with the woman that was 
           her mother. She takes a breath. No time to process right now.

           She forces herself down the hall to her room. 

           INT. CRUZ HOME - MARI AND MEMO'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mari grabs TWO BACKPACKS. Stuffs them with a few essentials: 
           SWEATSHIRT, UNDERWEAR, PRAYER CARD, a few U.S. DOLLARS. 

           Her face drops. The money triggering a memory.

           INT. CRUZ HOME - TOMÁS AND CARMEN’S ROOM - DAY

           BLOOD POOLS on the floor around Tomás and Carmen’s BED. Mari 
           enters. Keeps her eyes locked on the ground. Avoiding the 
           sight of CARMEN’S BODY. Makes her way to the bed. 

           She pulls it to one side. Exposes the DISTURBED DIRT. As the 
           bed moves, her mother’s FOOT shifts. It HANGS UNNATURALLY off 
           the side.

           Mari CLOSES her eyes. BREATHES. Fights tears. Fights reality. 
           Refocusing on the ground, she begins to DIG.

           INT. SEDAN - SAME

           Junior drives. Flaco’s shotgun. Brujo sits in the back with 
           the boy from the bike. He shows the boy Mari’s photo. 

           The boy nods.

                                 BRUJO
                        You sure?

           He nods again, positive. Brujo smiles. 

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                        I got you now, bitch. 
                             (to Junior)
                        Faster, bro.

           Junior reluctantly speeds up the car. 

           INT. CRUZ HOME - TOMÁS AND CARMEN'S ROOM - SAME

           Mari pulls the MONEY from the HOLE. No time to count. The 
           victory is cut short by tires SCREECHING to a halt out front. 

           Mari’s face drops. CAR DOORS OPEN. Close.

                                 BRUJO (O.S.)
                        Come on.

           Mari panics. Looks for an escape.

           INT. CRUZ HOME - KITCHEN - SAME

           Brujo enters the house. Junior and Flaco flank. All armed. 
           Boy hangs back, frightened by what his actions have wrought.

           Brujo smiles at the chaos of the house. He makes his way to 
           the hall. 

           INT. CRUZ HOME - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Brujo walks slowly. Listens for signs of life.

                                 BRUJO
                        Mari? Mi amor?

           He peers in Mari’s bedroom. All clear. Brujo turns back to 
           the hall. Moves to the parents’ room.
           Brujo THROWS the CLOTH back. His face twists in confusion. 

           Everything is as they left it last night. Including the BED 
           in its place.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Maybe she left.

                                 BRUJO
                        Maybe...

           Brujo gives the place a once over. 

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                        Nah. Nobody’s been here.

           INT. CRUZ HOME - TOMÁS AND CARMEN'S ROOM

           Mari’s UNDER the BED. CLUTCHING the MONEY. The THIN MATTRESS 
           above her SOAKED through with her MOTHER’S BLOOD. 

           INT. CRUZ HOME - HALLWAY - SAME

           A devilish GRIN spreads across Brujo’s face. An idea taking 
           root. He hands the gun to Junior.

                                 BRUJO
                        Get the cans from the car. 

           Junior walks off obediently. Brujo turns to Flaco.

                                 BRUJO (CONT'D)
                        This bitch isn’t gonna have a home 
                        to come back to.

           INT. CRUZ HOME - TOMÁS AND CARMEN'S ROOM - SAME

           Mari’s eyes widen, terrified.

           The blood above her has started to POOL. A DROP forms over 
           her face. Mari closes her eyes - willing it to go away.

           INT. CRUZ HOME - KITCHEN - SAME

           Junior returns with TWO LARGE GAS CANS. Flaco takes one. They 
           start DOUSING the house. 

           WALLS. FLOORS. PHOTOS. A family’s life, gasoline-soaked. 
           INT. CRUZ HOME - TOMÁS AND CARMEN’S ROOM - SAME

           Flaco enters. Mari sees his feet. SPLASHES from the can. The 
           harsh SCENT of gas assaults her. 

           The DROP of BLOOD hangs perilously above her. It finally 
           releases. Her mother’s BLOOD splatters across her face. 

           She closes her eyes tight. Prays. 

           EXT. CRUZ HOME - SAME

           Flaco trails gasoline behind him as he exits. Brujo smiles. 
           Ignites a LIGHTER. TOSSES it. 

           The gasoline catches quickly. FIRE consumes the house. 

           The men turn back to their car. As Brujo gets in...

                                 BRUJO
                        C’mon. Let’s get something to eat. 

           They drive off. No interest in staying to watch the 
           destruction they set into motion. Just another day.

           INT. CRUZ HOME - TOMÁS AND CARMEN’S ROOM - SAME

           The car DRIVES away.

           Mari rolls out from under the bed. SMOKE and HEAT overwhelm 
           her. Confronted with her mother’s CORPSE again, she turns 
           away. 

           Something catches her eye. Her father’s KEY on a SIDE TABLE. 
           Mari grabs it.  

           FLAMES overtake the room. Mari searches for a way out. She 
           runs to the WINDOW. Pushes through it. Falls to freedom.

           EXT. CRUZ HOME - SAME

           Mari COUGHS, desperately trying to catch her breath.

           She looks around, fearful of the attention the blaze might 
           garner. Mari pops to her feet. RUNS for the fields.

           INT. BARN - LATER

           Memo sits. WOODEN AXE HANDLE across his lap. Face strained 
           with anticipation.
           FOOTSTEPS outside the barn. He picks up the handle.

           The door slides open. It’s Mari, SOOT and BLOOD-STAINED.

                                 MEMO
                        Mari?...

           She staggers in. Her legs give out. She CRUMBLES. 

           Memo rises. He looks down the path. No sign of his mother. 
           His face falls. He closes the door.

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        Mamá?

           Mari gives a subtle shake of her head.

                                 MARI
                        It’s all gone. 

           This lands on Memo. 

                                 MEMO
                        What do we do now?

           Mari shrugs her shoulders. What other option do they have? 

                                 MARI
                        We go north.

           Memo gives a small nod. Mari nods wearily back. It’s decided.

           EXT. OPEN-AIR BUS DEPOT - DAY

           Mari and Memo navigate through a BUSTLING OPEN-AIR DEPOT. Not 
           much more than a parking lot full of COLORFUL BUSES. Mari, 
           hastily cleaned-up, leads Memo to the TICKET KIOSK. The KEY 
           now hangs from her neck. Memo looks around, vigilant.

           They reach the COUNTER. A gruff, middle-aged TICKETING AGENT 
           greets them.

                                 TICKETING AGENT
                        Destination?

           Mari and Memo look to one another. No idea how to do this.

                                 MARI
                        Mexico.

           The agent turns. Takes in the pair. Mari’s dirty clothes. 
           Their lack of luggage. It’s a story he’s seen before.
                                 TICKETING AGENT
                        Where in Mexico?

           Mari hesitates. 

                                 MARI
                        Mexico City.

           His eyes narrow in incredulity.

                                 TICKETING AGENT
                        Mexico City?

           Mari nods.

                                 TICKETING AGENT (CONT'D)
                        Long trip. Couple connections.

                                 MARI
                        That’s okay.

           The ticketing agent doesn’t move to process the request.

                                 TICKETING AGENT
                        Where are your parents?

           Mari momentarily freezes. Memo chimes in.

                                 MEMO
                        They’re waiting for us. There.

                                 TICKETING AGENT
                        In Mexico City?

                                 MEMO
                        Our aunt is sick.

           The agent rolls his eyes. He doesn’t have time for this.

                                 TICKETING AGENT
                        Tickets are $98. Each.

           Mari pulls a few BILLS from her pocket. The agent 
           begrudgingly takes the money. Turns to the COMPUTER. Mari 
           squeezes Memo’s shoulder. They’re on their way.

           INT. GENERAL STORE - LATER

           A GENERAL STORE teeming with TRAVELERS. Mari and Memo enter.

                                 MARI
                        Go grab some food.
           Memo enthusiastically heads for the snack aisle.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Be quick.

           INT. GENERAL STORE - SNACK AISLE - SAME

           Memo arrives at the snack aisle. Eyes alight at the options. 
           He grabs random BAGS OF CHIPS and SWEETS. 

           INT. GENERAL STORE - TOILETRIES AISLE - SAME

           Mari fishes TRAVEL-SIZED TOILETRIES out of bins. TOOTHBRUSH, 
           SOAP, etc.

           A rack holding VARIOUS CLOTHING ITEMS catches her eye. Mari 
           regards her shirt. Its melange of brown, black and red 
           stains. She moves to the rack. Rifles through the options.

           INT. GENERAL STORE - REGISTER - LATER

           Mari lays a few items in front of the CASHIER: TOILETRIES, a 
           BACKPACK, a JUG OF WATER. Memo approaches, holding an 
           assortment of BRIGHTLY-COLORED SNACK FOOD PACKAGES.  

           Mari takes in his bounty.

                                 MARI
                        We need real food.

           He looks through the items. Holds up some BEEF JERKY.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Fine. But take the rest back.

           The cashier eyes them sadly. So young. Memo reluctantly turns 
           back toward the food aisle. Mari continues checking out. 

           INT. GENERAL STORE - SNACK AISLE - SAME

           Memo returns the items to their shelf. Something catches his 
           eye. He freezes. The remaining BAGS FALL to the FLOOR.

           Outside, THREE YOUNG MEN exit a car. Among them Flaco and 
           Junior. The men head for the entrance of the store.

           Memo’s already running back to the front.
           INT. GENERAL STORE - REGISTER - CONTINUOUS

           The Barrio 18 trio enters. The patrons quiet. No sign of Mari 
           and Memo. The cashier closes her register. Flaco holds out a 
           COPY of Mari’s FACEBOOK PROFILE PICTURE.

                                 FLACO
                        Seen her?

           The cashier freezes. Torn between endangering innocents and 
           saving herself. Flaco senses her reticence. He pulls a GUN. 

                                 FLACO (CONT'D)
                        Where?

           Terrified, the woman POINTS toward the back exit. 

                                 FLACO (CONT'D)
                             (to Junior)
                        Go. We’ll take the front.

           EXT. GENERAL STORE - BACK ALLEY - SAME

           Mari and Memo run along the back of the building. Mari in the 
           HOODIE and BACKPACK she bought. 

           She peeks around the corner. Sees the BANGERS exit. Two go 
           out front. Junior heads toward them. She pulls back.

           She scans for cover. Points to a DUMPSTER. They scramble in.

           INT. DUMPSTER - CONTINUOUS

           Mari peers out under the lid. Sees Junior ROUND the corner. 
           He clocks the dumpster. The obvious hiding spot. 

           He eyes the dumpster for a beat. Thinks. He looks around. No 
           sign of the others. He looks back at the dumpster. Almost as 
           if he’s looking right at them. He NODS subtly, decision made.

           Junior turns and leaves.

           Mari and Memo exhale in relief.

           INT. GENERAL STORE - CASHIER - MOMENTS LATER

           The pair RUN back through the store. They stop at the front 
           door. Scan to make sure the coast is clear. It is.

           Mari pulls up her HOODIE. Grabs Memo’s hand. 
                                 MARI
                        We have to get to bus 21. Try to 
                        act normal, okay?

           Memo looks at her. Nods. They head out...

           EXT. GENERAL STORE / BUS DEPOT - CONTINUOUS

           Mari and Memo walk through the crowd. Eyes locked ahead. They 
           quickly move along the front of the BUSES. 

           A HAND GRABS Memo’s collar. He looks up in horror. An OLDER 
           MAN stares down at him.

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Jose?...

           Memo shakes his head. Mistaken identity. Mari pulls him away.

           She turns. Sees Flaco QUESTIONING a DRIVER with the photo. 
           Mari pulls her hood up. Moves faster. 

           The movement draws Flaco’s attention. He catches a glimpse of 
           color as they pass. His eyes NARROW in suspicion.

           Mari and Memo speed past the other buses. Memo spots a CRUDE 
           21 painted on the front of one of the buses. He points.

                                 MEMO
                        There!

           They beeline for the BUS. Board.

           INT. BUS 21 - CONTINUOUS

           Mari and Memo are the first ones on. They run for the back. 
           The DRIVER, hardened, middle-aged, GRABS Memo as he passes.

                                 DRIVER
                        Hey!

           Mari turns. Realizes their mistake.

                                 MARI
                        Sorry. 

           She pulls out the TICKETS. He takes them with a grunt.

           They finally get to the back of the bus. Duck down low 
           between the last two seats. 
           Flaco BOARDS. Looks down the bus. Regards the driver. Holds 
           out the PHOTO. The driver inspects it.

           Mari fingers her father’s KEY. Whispers a prayer.

           The driver looks one minute more. Then shakes his head. Flaco 
           turns, annoyed, and exits. Mari looks to Memo in disbelief.

           Once Flaco’s gone, the driver stands. STARTS for the back. 

           The driver appears above them. Mari smiles widely.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Thank yo--

                                 DRIVER
                        Hundred dollars.

           Mari looks at his out-stretched HAND in confusion.

                                 MARI
                        What?

           The driver looks back over his shoulder to the front of the 
           bus. He repeats his demand.

                                 DRIVER
                        A hundred. Or I call him back.

           A stunned Mari looks to her brother. Memo shrugs softly. What 
           choice do they have? The driver moves his fingers, beckoning 
           her to hurry up.

           Mari angrily pulls SEVERAL TWENTIES. Puts them in his hand. 

           Other passengers start to board. The driver looks back to 
           them. Offers a matter-of-fact truth.

                                 DRIVER (CONT'D)
                        Better than the alternative, no?

           Mari responds with a glare. Her anger amuses the driver.

                                 DRIVER (CONT'D)
                        Stay down ‘til we get out of town.

           He heads back to the front. Mari and Memo remain in their 
           cramped hiding spot.
           EXT. BUS DEPOT - LATER

           Bus 21 pulls out of the lot. Flaco stands at the exit. 
           Scanning each bus as it leaves. He recognizes the driver from 
           their earlier encounter. Gives a NOD. The driver nods back.

           The bus EXITS and heads down the dirt road.

           INT. BUS 21 - NIGHT

           Mari’s asleep against a window. Memo propped against her, 
           also sleeping. It’s pitch black. The bus LURCHES to a halt. 
           Mari and Memo stir.

           She looks out the window. A dimly lit BUS STATION. 

           The driver exits. A NEW DRIVER boards. Behind him, a FEDERAL 
           POLICE OFFICER. He moves through the bus. Asks for IDs.

                                 MEMO
                        Where are we?

                                 MARI
                        A checkpoint. Must be Mexico.

           Some passengers slip FOLDS OF MONEY behind their IDs. Mari 
           clocks the officer wordlessly pocketing the bills.

           He surveys the back half of the bus. Spots Mari and Memo. 
           Bypasses the other passengers. Strides right to them.

           He looms. His BADGE identifies him: OFFICER GODINEZ.

                                 OFFICER GODINEZ
                        Come with me.

           Mari quickly pulls a $50-BILL. Holds it out. The officer 
           regards it. SMIRKS. But doesn’t reach for it.

                                 OFFICER GODINEZ (CONT'D)
                        Come.

           She pulls out another FIFTY. Extends it.

                                 MARI
                        Please. We have tickets. 

           The officer puts his hand on his GUN.

                                 OFFICER GODINEZ
                        Now.

           A nearby, MIDDLE-AGED PASSENGER hisses at them.
                                 PASSENGER
                        Just go. You’re going to make 
                        trouble for all of us.

           Mari shoots the woman daggers. A few others call for them to 
           go too. Mari looks to Memo with resignation. She motions for 
           him to pick up their BAG. They follow Godinez off the bus. 

           INT. BUS STATION - POLICE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Mari and Memo sit opposite the officer’s desk. The room is 
           dingy. Harsh fluorescents. Godinez pulls the BLINDS shut.

                                 OFFICER GODINEZ
                        Know why I flagged you?

           Mari protests...

                                 MARI
                        We’re going to see our parents.

           Officer Godinez eyes Mari. Snickers. Perches on the edge of 
           the desk facing them. Pulls out his PHONE. Brings up the 
           PHOTO of Mari. Shows her. 

           Mari’s face drops. He’s working with Barrio 18.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                             (pitiful)
                        Please...

                                 OFFICER GODINEZ
                        Should probably just turn you over. 
                        You’re a shitty liar. Won’t make it 
                        far.

           Mari thinks.

                                 MARI
                        Let my brother get on the bus. They 
                        don’t care about him.

                                 MEMO
                        No.

           Mari quiets him. Puts her hand on his arm. Godinez sees this.

                                 OFFICER GODINEZ
                        Touching.

           He stands. Puts a HAND on Memo’s SHOULDER.
                                 OFFICER GODINEZ (CONT'D)
                        Perhaps I should interrogate your 
                        brother. See what he knows. 

           Mari and Memo exchange a look. Not liking where this is 
           going. Godinez locks eyes with Mari.

                                 OFFICER GODINEZ (CONT'D)
                        Or I could turn you over and you’ll 
                        both be dead by morning.

           Mari says nothing.

                                 OFFICER GODINEZ (CONT'D)
                             (to Memo)
                        Come. The bus will wait for us.

           Memo rises. Starts to follow Godinez into an adjacent room. 
           He looks back at Mari, terrified. She watches on, helpless.

           Godinez pulls Memo into the ROOM. The DOOR closes. 

           Mari churns. Rises. Runs out of the office.

           INT. BUS STATION - ADJACENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A small, sparse room. Memo sits in the only chair. Godinez 
           stands over him. In front of the light. His face shadows.

                                 OFFICER GODINEZ
                        No need to be scared. I’m only 
                        going to ask you a few questions.

           Godinez PETS Memo’s head. Memo stares ahead, trembling.

                                 OFFICER GODINEZ (CONT'D)
                        You love your sister, right?
                             (off his nod)
                        You’d do anything for her?

           Memo looks up at him. Terrified of the implications.

                                 OFFICER GODINEZ (CONT'D)
                        I can make sure you pass safely. I 
                        can make it so no one else bothers 
                        you.

           Godinez crouches down. His face level with Memo’s. He puts a 
           HAND on his knee.

                                 OFFICER GODINEZ (CONT'D)
                        Would you like that?
           Memo eyes the large hand subtly squeezing his thigh. He looks 
           up to Godinez. Opens his mouth to answer. But COUGHS instead.

           Godinez starts to cough too. He looks to the door. SMOKE 
           streams in from underneath. He rises, angry. Throws open the 
           door to reveal...

           INT. BUS STATION - POLICE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           FLAMES consume the desk. Mari LIGHTS a piece of PAPER with a 
           MATCH. Adds it onto the already burning pyre. 

                                 OFFICER GODINEZ
                        What the fuck?

           He quickly grabs the EXTINGUISHER. Aims it at the fire.

           Mari seizes on the opportunity.

                                 MARI
                        Memo! Run!

           He sprints to her. They run out.

           EXT. BUS 21 - CONTINUOUS

           Mari and Memo quickly board the IDLING BUS. New Driver wastes 
           no time, speeding the bus out of the lot. Back onto the road.

           Mari slips him a wad of BILLS. She’s learning.

                                 MARI
                        Thank you.

           Memo looks back. The station and the danger within receding 
           in the distance.

           EXT. PUEBLA BUS STATION - DAY

           A new day. A new DEPOT. Much like the one they left from.

           INT. BUS 21 - SAME

           Driver pulls to a stop. Opens the door. People stream out. 

           Mari looks through their SMALL STACK OF TICKETS.

                                 MARI
                        I think we need a different bus. 
           They rise. 

           EXT. PUEBLA BUS DEPOT - TICKETING KIOSK - LATER

           Mari is mid-conversation with the FEMALE TICKETING AGENT.

                                 MARI
                        But we have the ticket.

                                 FEMALE AGENT
                        Bus won’t be fixed until tomorrow.

           Mari turns in frustration. They step away from the counter.

                                 MARI
                        We need to find somewhere to sleep.

           Memo holds his stomach.

                                 MEMO
                        I’m starving.

                                 MARI
                        Me too. Let’s find some food.

           EXT. PUEBLA CITY STREETS - LATER

           Mari and Memo exit the depot. The busy streets of Puebla 
           greet them. Their faces stretch in awe. They’ve never seen 
           anything like it.

           Wide streets. Big, bright BUILDINGS. Lots of CARS. Sidewalks 
           packed with people.  

           Mari grabs Memo’s arm. 

                                 MARI
                        Stay close.

           They move into the fray. Their SOILED FACES and CLOTHES tell 
           their story. Some ignore them completely. Others throw them 
           looks of disdain. Unkind faces assault from all directions. 

           Mari pulls Memo down a smaller street. 

           EXT. PUEBLA SIDE STREET - CONTINUOUS

           It’s quieter here. Less people. Memo points to a STREET 
           VENDOR cooking flat BALLS OF MASA on a LARGE PIECE OF METAL. 
                                 MEMO
                        There.

           They scurry to the vendor. She throws them a brief, 
           unfriendly look as they approach.

                                 MARI
                        Two, please. 

           The vendor reluctantly prepares the order.

           A BLUE TRUCK marked POLICIA ESTATAL turns onto the side 
           street. The STATE POLICE OFFICER behind the wheel slows as he 
           spots the pair. He CREEPS past.

           Mari pays the vendor. Takes the FOOD. Clocks the truck. 

           She averts her eyes from the menacing gaze. Grabs Memo’s arm. 
           Quickens her pace. Memo sees what’s scared her. 

                                 MEMO
                             (under his breath)
                        Not again...

                                 MARI
                        It’s okay. Just eat.

           Memo nibbles at the food. The truck lingers a beat longer. 
           Finally, it SPEEDS off.

           They stop. Watch it drive away. Relief on their faces.

           Memo points to a small alley in between two buildings.

                                 MEMO
                        Let’s eat over there.

           Mari nods. Memo’s learning.

           EXT. PUEBLA ALLEY - LATER

           They sit in the dirty alley. Memo greedily eats. Mari 
           consumes slowly, casting furtive glances at the pedestrians 
           crossing the mouth of the alley.

           Across the street, THREE KIDS play ‘La Migra’. Two of them 
           stop the third. Pretend to arrest him. Mari watches, uneasy.

           A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, spots Mari. Stops. Takes in the sad 
           tableau of the pair. Offers a sympathetic LOOK. Mari responds 
           with the defensive glare of a feral cat.

           The woman moves her gaze to the street. Walks on. Mari rises. 
                                 MARI
                        We should move further back.

           Memo nods. Follows her deeper into the alley. DEBRIS and 
           broken pallets obscure them a bit more.

           As they settle in, Mari looks through the backpack.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        I’m gonna get us more water. 

           She looks at Memo. He’s frozen. Transfixed by something 
           behind her.

           A shadow consumes her. A large MILITARY BOOT steps into view. 
           Mari cautiously turns to face this new threat. The State 
           Police Officer from the truck. Black tactical gear. Assault 
           rifle. Sunglasses. Name badge: CORTEZ.

                                 OFFICER CORTEZ
                        ID’s. Now.

           Mari looks to Memo. He can’t move.

                                 MARI
                        Okay. 

           Mari rifles through the backpack. She subtly MOUTHS something 
           to Memo. He furrows his brow in confusion. Cortez grows 
           impatient.

                                 OFFICER CORTEZ
                        Now.

           Mari repeats her voiceless command. Mouthing the word: RUN. 
           Followed by: NOW.

                                 MARI
                        Here they are.

           Mari turns and, in one swift motion, PUSHES the officer hard - 
           sending him TUMBLING to the ground.

           Memo books it for the entrance of the alley. Mari right 
           behind him.

           Cortez gets to his knees.

                                 OFFICER CORTEZ
                        Pinche...

           He pulls his GUN. Too many bystanders. He RISES. Gives CHASE.
           EXT. PUEBLA SIDE STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Mari and Memo exit the alley -- NEARLY-PLOWING into the 
           middle-aged woman from before. She clocks their SCARED FACES. 
           Sees Cortez, GUN in hand.

                                 MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
                        Come!

           She pulls them away down the street to a beat-up CAR. The 
           woman gets in. Motions for them to follow. Mari hesitates. 
           She turns to see Cortez rounding the bend. 

                                 MARI
                             (to Memo)
                        Get in!

           They jump in the BACKSEAT. Get low. Cortez catches up, just 
           as the woman pulls away.

           He RAISES his gun. Takes the car in through the SIGHT. Lowers 
           the gun. Watches them drive away. 

           INT. BEAT-UP CAR - SAME

           Mari looks out the back window. The car TURNS a corner. 
           Cortez disappears. She taps Memo. He rises. 

           They take in their savior. She turns another corner.

                                 MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
                        I think we lost him.

           Mari nods. The woman smiles back at her warmly.

                                 MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        I’m Irma. 

           Mari stares at her as she drives on.

           INT. IRMA’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           A simple, single-family home. Mari and Memo at the DINING 
           TABLE. The place is well-loved but a bit disheveled.

           Irma slides TWO PLATES onto the table. Chilaquiles and eggs. 

           Memo digs in, ravenous. Mari hesitates. Irma clocks this. Her 
           eyes squint in understanding. Irma shovels a BITE from Mari’s 
           plate into her mouth. She raises her eyebrows. Satisfied?

           Mari is. She eats. Irma smiles. She likes this kid.
           Irma disappears down the hall. Returns with a pair of mens 
           SNEAKERS. Tosses them to Memo...

                                 IRMA
                        These should fit.

                                 MEMO
                        I have shoes.

                                 IRMA
                        Only sell that brand in your 
                        country. Cops look for them.

           Memo nods, grateful. Irma sits. Watches them eat. Mari looks 
           up from her food.

                                 MARI
                        Thank you. We’ll leave after this.

                                 IRMA
                        No rush, mija. Have kids of my own. 
                        Hope someone would help if they 
                        needed it.

           Mari looks around. SEES SIGNS of teens in the house.

                                 MARI
                        Where are they? Your kids?

           Irma absorbs the question. Changes the subject.

                                 IRMA
                        You have a plan?
                             (off their look)
                        For getting over? Someone to help?

           Mari and Memo exchange a look. Mari SHAKES her head.

                                 MEMO
                        Gonna find someone at the border.

           Irma CHORTLES.

                                 IRMA
                        With the way things are now? Police 
                        are worse than ever. Without 
                        someone helping you, you won’t even 
                        make it to the border.

           Mari interjects defensively.

                                 MARI
                        We’ll be okay.
           Irma shakes her head.

                                 IRMA
                        You need to be careful. A lot of 
                        people will take advantage of two 
                        first-timers like you.

                                 MEMO
                        How can you tell it’s our first 
                        time?

           Irma raises her eyebrows at him. Does he really need to ask? 
           She notices his PLATE is EMPTY.

                                 IRMA
                        More?

           Memo NODS enthusiastically. Irma rises to get him another 
           serving. Mari follows Irma with her eyes.

           She returns. Sets the plate in front of Memo. Lets out a 
           heavy sigh.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        How much do you have? To get over?

           Mari is cautious.

                                 MARI
                        Enough.

                                 IRMA
                        I’m only trying to help.

           Mari visually confers with Memo. He NODS his assent.

                                 MARI
                        Little less than eight thousand.

           Irma lets out a low whistle.

                                 IRMA
                        That’s barely enough. If you’re 
                        lucky.

                                 MEMO
                        We had more, but we ran into cops.

                                 IRMA
                        Well, that’s part of it.
                             (off their look)
                        Bribes.
           Irma looks them over. They’re completely out of their depth. 
           She stands. Looks out the window. SIGHS heavily.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        Okay. I’ll take you.

           She turns. Faces them. Mari and Memo look up.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        I used to take people. Haven’t for 
                        a while. Too dangerous. But I’ll 
                        take you.

                                 MEMO
                        Really?

           Mari’s eyes squint in skepticism.

                                 MARI
                        Why would you take us?

                                 IRMA
                        It’s not charity. Let’s say three 
                        to get to the border. Another three 
                        once we cross. Leaves you with a 
                        couple grand to get on your feet. 

           Mari considers.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        No one will do it for less.

           Memo implores his sister to accept.

                                 MEMO
                        Mari...

           Mari thinks for another minute. Then, nods. 

                                 MARI
                        Okay. 

           Irma smiles.

                                 IRMA
                        Good. We’ll leave in the morning.

           INT. IRMA’S SON’S ROOM - NIGHT

           A SMALL, COZY ROOM. Memo lies in the BED. Evidence of a 
           teenage boy on the walls. TORN-OUT MAGAZINE PAGES display 
           favorite teams, bands, models.
           Memo lies in bed. Eyes alert. Energy restless. He gets up. 
           Starts inspecting the room.

           Pulling open a DRAWER, he finds a STACK of hastily-stashed 
           PHOTOS on top of some disturbed clothes.

           Memo reaches for the PHOTOS. The first is of a boy - about 
           Memo’s age - wearing a BEAT-UP LAKERS HAT. He stands with his 
           father. They look nice, normal, mundane. 

           As he flips to the next photo, the door CREAKS. He quickly 
           replaces the photos. Turns to see who’s there. 

           It’s Mari.

                                 MEMO
                        I can’t sleep.

           Memo closes the drawer.

                                 MARI
                        Me either. Get into bed. I’ll talk 
                        to you until you fall asleep.

           Memo nods. Moves to the bed. This is a familiar ritual. Mari 
           sits on the floor. Their faces level. Their voices hushed.

                                 MEMO
                        What’s it like in the U.S.? Will it 
                        be like mom said it would? Clean. 
                        Good schools. 
                             (then, pointedly)
                        Safe?

           Mari thinks. Fiddles with her father’s KEY. She nods.

                                 MARI
                        Yes, everything’s better there. And 
                        we’ll be safe.

                                 MEMO
                        Can I get an iPhone?

           Mari smiles.

                                 MARI
                        Sure.

           Memo gets lost in a dark thought.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        What is it?
                                 MEMO
                        It seems too good to be real.

           Mari considers that. Rejects any doubt in herself.

                                 MARI
                        It’s going to be better there. I 
                        promise.

           She rises. Pulls his BLANKETS up higher.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Besides, it’s the only choice we 
                        have.

                                 MEMO
                        At least we have Irma now. 

           Mari breaks eye contact. Nods. Memo reads her expression.

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        You don’t trust her.

                                 MARI
                        I don’t know.

           Memo FROWNS. Nervous. Mari clocks this.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Everything will be okay. Papa’s 
                        watching over us.

           She holds up the key. Memo SMILES sadly. Nods. Then adds...

                                 MEMO
                        And I’ll protect you. 

                                 MARI
                        That’s right. We’re safe as long as 
                        we’re together.

           Mari smiles. She KISSES Memo’s forehead. Rises.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Get some sleep.

           INT. IRMA’S DAUGHTER’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mari enters a YOUNG GIRL’S ROOM. Crawls into the SMALL BED. 
           She stares at the wall across from the bed. A CHILD’S DRAWING 
           of a family. Mother, father, son, daughter. 
           Mari’s mesmerized by the picture. Considers her own family 
           unit, now lost forever. She CLOSES her eyes. Waits for sleep.

           EXT. IRMA’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MORNING

           A back HATCH opens to reveal a DIRTY, CRAMPED TRUNK. Irma 
           stands over it. Indicates inside it.

                                 IRMA
                        Get in.

           Mari and Memo stare at the cavity. Unmoving.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        It’s just until we get past the 
                        checkpoint.

           They don’t move. Irma LAUGHS to herself.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        I can’t kill you yet. You haven’t 
                        paid me.

           She pulls a WATER BOTTLE from her bag. Holds it out.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        I’m kidding. Com’on. We’ve got a 
                        long drive ahead of us.

           Finally, Mari takes the water. Climbs in. Memo follows.

           INT. TRUNK - DAY

           Mari and Memo bounce along in silence. They feel the car 
           SLOW. Hear Irma’s MUFFLED VOICE outside.

           Her words are indistinct, but TWO GUARDS RESPOND. Mari puts 
           her finger over her lips - urging Memo to stay quiet. 

           The conversation continues. It feels like forever. Mari 
           touches the key. Irma lets out a LAUGH. The guards LAUGH too.

           Two brief TAPS on the trunk. The car starts moving again. 
           Mari and Memo breathe a sigh of relief.

           INT. TRUNK - LATER

           SWEAT covers Mari and Memo’s faces. Their SHIRTS soaked 
           through. Mari offers the last of the water to Memo. He slurps 
           the few drops eagerly. Then...
                                 MEMO
                        When are we stopping?

           He’s verbalizing something Mari’s been wondering herself. She 
           shakes her head softly. 

                                 MARI
                        I don’t know.

           As if on cue, the car turns. SLOWS to a STOP.

           The DOOR OPENS and then SLAMS shut. Irma’s FOOTSTEPS move 
           away from the car. 

                                 MEMO
                        Where’s she going?

           Mari HUSHES him. She’s trying to listen. 

           There are no other sounds. For a long time. Too long.

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        Mari...

           Panic starts to set in. Mari stays calm for another moment. 
           But there’s no explanation for the silence. 

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        Mari, what do we do?

           It’s hot. Getting hotter. 

           Mari turns to the lid of the trunk. Starts BANGING. Memo 
           follows suit. 

           Both BANG hard. But no one comes. They start to YELL.

           Suddenly, the TRUNK POPS open. Irma over them, annoyed.

                                 IRMA
                        What in the hell are you doing? Are 
                        you trying to get caught?

           Mari looks a little sheepish.

                                 MARI
                        We didn’t know where you went. 

           Irma helps them out. 
           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

           They get their bearings. A RAMSHACKLE GAS STATION PARKING 
           LOT. Irma indicates a structure beyond the cracked asphalt. A 
           SMALL CONVENIENCE STORE.

                                 IRMA
                        I was making sure there were no 
                        cops in there.

           She holds out TWO SWEATING WATER BOTTLES.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        And I got you these.

           Mari and Memo take the water. DRINK thirstily.

                                 MEMO
                        Thank you.

           Mari nods her thanks. Irma looks to Mari.

                                 IRMA
                        It’s going to be okay, child. No 
                        one’s going to hurt you anymore.

           Mari processes this. Irma smiles.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        You want to sit in the front?

           EXT. MONTEREY - DUSK

           Irma pulls the car to a stop in front of a SMALL ABANDONED 
           FACTORY in an industrial area. She turns, all business.

                                 IRMA
                        I’ll need the first three now.

           Mari and Memo scan the surroundings. It’s desolate.

                                 MARI
                        We should wait until we’re at the 
                        border.

           Irma shakes her head.

                                 IRMA
                        I need to pay some people off 
                        before we leave.

           Mari stares back at her. Still uneasy.
                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        The other option is the bus 
                        station, where you can take your 
                        chances with the cops. 

           Mari sighs. Gives Memo a short nod. She reaches under her 
           shirt and into the side of her BRA. Memo takes off his right 
           SHOE. They each pull out FIFTEEN $100-BILLS.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        Trust me. This is the way it always 
                        works.

           Irma collects the money. Then leans over Mari and POINTS to a 
           DOOR in a cinder block perimeter.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        That’s the place.

           Mari’s uneasy.

                                 MARI
                        You’re not coming.

                                 IRMA
                             (indicating the money)
                        I have to take care of this. I’ll 
                        be back soon.

                                 MEMO
                        Who do we talk to?

                                 IRMA
                        They know you’re coming. Go on. 
                        It’s getting dark.

           Memo slowly SLIDES out of the car. Waits for Mari.

                                 MARI
                        When will you be back?

                                 IRMA
                        Soon. Don’t worry.

           Mari exits.

           EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - CONTINUOUS

           Mari and Memo walk to the door Irma indicated. They’ve hardly 
           reached it when -- Irma SPEEDS OFF. 
           Mari FREEZES. Irma’s words about not killing them until she 
           has the money ring through her head. Everything suddenly 
           feels menacing.

           Mari grabs Memo’s arm.

                                 MARI
                        Wait.

           Memo stops. Looks back at her. More matter-of-fact than we’ve 
           seen him up to now.

                                 MEMO
                        What choice do we have? We’ll get 
                        picked up on the street.

                                 MARI
                        We don’t know what’s behind that 
                        door.

                                 MEMO
                        It’ll be okay. As long as we’re 
                        together. 

           He grabs her hand. She calms a bit. The sibling dynamic 
           momentarily reversed. They go to the door. 

           Memo KNOCKS. Nothing. He moves to knock again. A GRUFF VOICE 
           sounds from the other side.

                                 GRUFF MAN
                        Who is it?

                                 MEMO
                        Memo. And Mari.

           Silence.

                                 MARI
                        Irma sent us.

           Another beat. Finally, a latch clicks. The door swings open. 

           EXT. STASH HOUSE - FRONT COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Mari and Memo enter. MEN and WOMEN of varying ages pepper a 
           small walled off courtyard. Some with desperation in their 
           eyes. Others with danger. Beyond them, an ABANDONED FACTORY. 

           Gruff CLOSES the DOOR. Mari and Memo start to move past him.

                                 GRUFF MAN
                        Wait.
           He pulls them back. Opens their backpack.

                                 GRUFF MAN (CONT'D)

                        No weapons.

                                 MARI
                        We don’t have--

           Gruff pulls her closer. He PATS her down. It looks more like 
           groping. He takes his time around her womanly parts. 

           Mari looks away. Embarrassed. A MAN with a gleaming GOLD 
           TOOTH watches. Enjoying her shame. He smiles to himself and 
           ELBOWS his friend - a man in a COWBOY HAT - beside him.

           Cowboy Hat looks up. LOCKS his gaze on Mari. He’s got a good-
           looking face, but there’s something hard in his eyes.

           Finally, Gruff takes his hands off Mari. He NODS his head 
           approvingly as she steps away. Memo steps up for his pat 
           down. Gruff waves him off.

                                 GRUFF MAN
                             (pointing to the entrance)
                        Beds are in there.

           Mari and Memo move toward the door. Many of the men follow 
           them with their eyes. Mari can’t tell if they want to fuck 
           them or kill them. She grabs Memo’s hand. Speeds up.

           INT. STASH HOUSE - SLEEPING ROOM - LATER

           A RE-PURPOSED MANUFACTURING FLOOR now serves as the sleeping 
           quarters of this stash house. The siblings move through rows 
           of FILTHY MATS on the floor. Desperate, hungry people 
           seemingly fill all of them. 

           Mari spots an EMPTY MATTRESS. She points.

                                 MARI
                        There.

           Upon reaching it, she smells something. Mari lightly pushes 
           her foot on the mattress. It emits a wet SQUISH.

           They scan the debris around the room. Memo sees an old trash 
           bag. He grabs it. Gives it to her. Mari lays it out gently, 
           creating a plastic barrier. 

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        You take the bed. I’ll sleep next 
                        to you on the floor.
           Memo sits. Mari sets their bag in front of him. 

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        It’s only for one night.

           A WOMAN next to them lets out a cynical SNICKER. Mari regards 
           her. The woman smiles at Mari’s naïveté. Mari brushes it off.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Stay close to me.

           She surveys the others. Sees the despair in their eyes.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        And stay close to the bag.

           Memo eyes the woman next to them. He leans in closer to Mari. 

                                 MEMO
                             (low)
                        She’s coming back, right?

           Mari stares at him. Blinks.

                                 MARI
                        Of course.

           Her response drips with doubt.

           INT. STASH HOUSE - SLEEPING ROOM - NIGHT

           Darkness has descended. The room is alive. SOUNDS and 
           MOVEMENTS of uneasy souls in purgatory. Some sleep. Others 
           lie awake. Still others WEEP softly.

           Memo is among the sleeping. Mari among the awake. She hugs 
           their backpack tight.

           Pale MOONLIGHT illuminates the vast open room. Soft SCRATCHES 
           of rodents sound along the walls. Figures shuffle between the 
           makeshift beds. People in search of something in the night. 

           A MAN moves past the foot of the mattress. Mari studies him. 
           The moon glow highlights his dead, SUNKEN EYES.

           Mari turns. Trying to push the macabre surroundings away. She 
           closes her eyes. The SOUNDS of the room persist. 

           She sighs heavily. Sits up. The people moving through the 
           room have subsided for the moment.
           Mari STANDS. She stares at her sleeping brother - equal parts 
           envious of and happy for him. She tucks the backpack under 
           his arm. Memo stirs briefly but quickly falls back to sleep. 

           She makes her way toward the back door.

           EXT. STASH HOUSE - YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Mari steps out into a YARD. A few dilapidated picnic tables. 
           A modest area of dead grass. A long-forgotten break area. 

           She’s alone. It’s almost nice. She breathes in the fresh 
           night air. The MOON SHINES down. She ponders it. 

           The same moon as home, yet so much has changed.

           Something CREAKS. She snaps back. Alert. Surveys the 
           surroundings. Waits a moment.

           NOTHING.

           Maybe it was in her head. Maybe not. She hurries to the task 
           at hand. Walking briskly, she arrives at the far end of the 
           yard. Moves behind a HANGING SHEET.

           THREE FIVE-GALLON BUCKETS. She chooses the least full. 
           Squats. Starts to PEE.

           As she does, she hears the unmistakable sound of FOOTSTEPS on 
           the dead grass. She STOPS. The footsteps STOP.

           She hurriedly grabs a piece of nearby NEWSPAPER, wipes 
           herself. Pulls up her pants.

           Moving to the edge of the sheet, she peers out. Scans the 
           yard.

           No one’s there.

           Mari RUBS the key. Good luck. One more look around confirms 
           she’s alone. She STEPS out. Still nothing. 

           Mari moves quickly toward the back door of the stash house. 

           She’s practically sprinting. FIFTY FEET AWAY. TWENTY.

           She REACHES for the handle. Before she feels its metal, a 
           dirty HAND comes down hard over her mouth. 

           Her EYES go wide in terror. She tries to call for help but 
           the HAND muffles her CRIES. 

           An ARM locks itself around her waist.
           The unseen assailant PULLS her to a more secluded part of the 
           yard. The door gets further and further away.

           Mari’s SPUN around. Finds herself face-to-face with Cowboy 
           Hat.

           His eyes are emotionless. He brings his FACE close to hers.

                                 COWBOY HAT
                        I want to take my time with you.

           His detachment is chilling. TEARS roll down Mari’s face.

           He turns her around. Bends her over a half-wall. Pins her 
           against it with his pelvis. His free hand pulls out a KNIFE.

           He SLICES through her BELT. PULLS at her pants violently. 

           Mari STRUGGLES. Every ounce of her fighting him off. The full-
           grown man easily overpowers her. 

           He gets her pants down. The cool, night air hit her exposed 
           skin. She BUCKS even harder. His buckle jangles. 

           Mari SCREAMS as loud as she can through his hand.

           Suddenly, she feels something HOT and WET SPLASH across her 
           back. The movement stops. The hand over her mouth goes limp.

           Mari TURNS. Faces her assailant.

           His face, a mask of surprise. His neck, IMPALED with a large 
           PIECE OF SCRAP METAL. 

           He falls to one side, revealing IRMA. 

           Mari crumples into a ball. SOBS.

                                 IRMA
                        We need to get out of here.

           Irma pulls her to her feet. Shuffles the crying Mari away.

           INT. STASH HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

           A SMALL BEDROOM. Mari on the bed. Still covered in Cowboy 
           Hat’s BLOOD. Still reeling. Thumbing the key.

           The door FLIES open. She looks up with a start. It’s Irma. 
           Memo in tow. Irma closes the door behind them. Props a chair 
           under the knob.

           Memo gets a look at his sister.
                                 MEMO
                        Mari... Are you okay? 

           Before she can answer...

                                 IRMA
                        She’s fine.

           Irma looks at Mari again. She looks terrible.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        She’ll be fine.

           Irma rushes to a dresser. Grabs a RAG. Pours some WATER from 
           a plastic jug on it. Starts cleaning Mari up.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        You two sleep here tonight. We 
                        leave first thing in the morning.

           Irma wipes the blood from Mari. She STARES off, unmoving. 

                                 MEMO
                        Where were you? Where did you go?

           Irma indicates a couple JUGS OF WATER. A small cache of FOOD.

                                 IRMA
                        Getting us supplies. And paying 
                        people off so we don’t run into 
                        trouble.

           Memo walks over to his sister.

                                 MEMO
                             (softly)
                        Are you okay?

           Irma, still all business, replies for her again.

                                 IRMA
                        She’s fine.
                             (to Mari)
                        Tell him. He’s scared.

           Mari comes out of her dark reverie. Looks to her brother. She 
           musters a small NOD and half smile. A sign between siblings 
           she’s going to be okay. Memo sits next to her.

           Irma rifles through their backpack. Pulls out a SHIRT. Gently 
           hands it to Mari.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        Here, put this on.
           Mari takes it. Looks up at the sweet expression on Irma’s 
           face. Pure compassion.

                                 MARI
                        What happened to your kids?

           Irma blinks. Caught off-guard.

                                 IRMA
                        Let’s just get some sleep.

           She moves to the dresser. Washes red out of the rag in a 
           bucket.

                                 MARI
                        Please tell me. 

           Irma stops. Turns to face Mari. Sighs heavily.

                                 IRMA
                        I was in Arizona. Been there a few 
                        years. I was making good money. But 
                        I missed my family.

           She sets the rag down. Sits next to them on the bed. She 
           unconsciously strokes Memo’s head as she speaks.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        My husband and I decided it was 
                        time for him to come over with the 
                        kids. I told him who to pay. How to 
                        do it. But he went through someone 
                        his brother knew. He messaged me 
                        when they got to the border. Then 
                        nothing. For two months. I came 
                        back to find out what happened. But 
                        no one has heard from them. 

           She looks up to Mari and Memo.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        God put you in my path. Getting you 
                        two across is my penance. My 
                        salvation.

           A TEAR slips down Irma’s face. Mari puts her HAND on Irma’s. 
           Two women bonded in trauma.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        Now get some sleep. Morning will be 
                        here before you know it.

           Memo lies in the bed. Mari changes her shirt. She looks 
           around.
                                 MARI
                        Where will you sleep?

                                 IRMA
                        On the floor. I don’t mind. And you 
                        need your sleep.

           Mari nods her thanks. Curls up next to Memo on the bed.

           A CRUCIFIX on the wall catches Irma’s eye. She crosses 
           herself. Blows out the candle. The room goes DARK.

           INT. CUBE TRUCK - DAWN

           SWEATY BODIES packed shoulder-to-shoulder in the cargo hold 
           of a cube truck. Small holes permit a modicum of light. A 
           breath or two of air. 

           The group jostles and sways as the vehicle navigates the 
           rough terrain.

           Mari, Memo and Irma stand by one of the truck’s walls. 
           Through a HOLE, Mari watches the DESERT LANDSCAPE slide by. 
           It slows to a STOP.

           Metallic LATCHES sound. A false panel pulled back. Blinding 
           desert light consumes the group.

           A man impatiently beckons the group to exit. Standing next to 
           him is a young coyote, barely older than Mari. This is GALLO.

           People spill out into...

           EXT. OPEN DESERT - CONTINUOUS

           The group is a hodge podge. A MOTHER holds her DAUGHTER’s 
           hand. The girl not much older than five. A YOUNG MAN helps 
           his obviously PREGNANT WIFE down from the back of the truck.

           Irma helps Mari and Memo down.

           The group is assembled on the desert floor. Gallo gives the 
           SIGNAL to move out.

                                 GALLO
                        Com’on!

           He walks in the direction of a nearby low mountain range. 
           Irma pulls the two aside. 
                                 IRMA
                        Stay with me. If you fall behind, 
                        he’ll leave you. We need to stay 
                        together.

           Mari and Memo NOD. They turn. Follow the group.

           The man gets back in the truck. Drives off.

           The group wends through the vast, brutal desert.

           EXT. RIVER - DAY

           Gallo emerges from a patch of greenery into a clearing. The 
           rushing Rio Grande greets him. The group filters out of the 
           trees in drips and drabs. 

           It’s a relatively narrow strip of the river, but the WATER 
           flows at a DEADLY CLIP. The group sits. A rest in order 
           before this next perilous hurdle in the journey.

           Mari slides to the edge of the group. Sits faced away from 
           the river. Memo follows. Kneels beside her. Speaks in HUSHED 
           TONES.

           Irma clocks this. Approaches them. She catches a snippet of 
           their conversation.

                                 MEMO
                        It’ll be okay...

                                 IRMA
                        What’s wrong?

                                 MEMO
                             (protective)
                        She doesn’t like water.

           Irma regards Mari, concern in her eyes. 

                                 IRMA
                        There’s only one way across, mija.

           Mari puts on a brave face. Nods.

                                 MARI
                        I can do it.

           Irma nods. 

                                 IRMA
                        That’s my girl.
           Irma touches her head. Walks off. Memo watches Irma as she 
           moves away from them. She talks to Gallo as he pulls TWO 
           INNER TUBES from beneath nearby shrubs. 

                                 MEMO
                        Look, there are inner tubes. It’ll 
                        be easy. You can just float across.

           Mari looks up. Sees the inner tubes. Memo notices the 
           conversation Irma’s having with Gallo. Their faces close. 
           Their demeanor covert. He NODS, understanding.

           Gallo ties ROPES to the inner tubes. The other ends are 
           secured to STAKES. Once done, he turns to the group.

                                 GALLO
                        We’ll go two at a time.

           Everyone gathers at the river’s edge. Gallo holds up a bunch 
           of BLACK TRASH BAGS.

                                 GALLO (CONT'D)
                        Take your clothes off. Put them in 
                        here.

           He hands one inner tube to a man. The other goes to Irma. 

           Everyone strips to their underwear. Leaves their shoes on. 

           Irma starts to stuff her clothing and backpack into the 
           plastic bag. Mari watches on - visibly concerned. 

           Irma reaches in her bag. Pulls something out. Beckons Mari 
           over. Mari cautiously moves closer to the water. Irma holds 
           the item out. It’s a PILL.

                                 IRMA
                        Take it. 

           Mari looks at her, unsure. Irma smiles.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        You’ll feel like you can do 
                        anything.

           Mari eyes it for one moment more. Then POPS it into her mouth 
           and SWALLOWS it back. Irma nods, satisfied. She turns back to 
           the task at hand. 

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        Go next. Best to get it over with.

           Mari walks back to Memo. They both look on, as they do...
                                 MEMO
                        What was that?

           Mari shrugs.

                                 MARI
                        Something to help.

           Irma and the other man WADE out in the water. They’re in 
           control at first. Then the riverbed below them DROPS down 
           precipitously. No longer on firm land, the rope PULLS taught. 
           The CURRENT trying to push the two down river.

           They STRUGGLE to stay afloat. To make any forward progress. 
           Vigorously paddling. Frantically KICKING. They go on like 
           this for a minute or two.

           Finally, their feet catch land on the other side. They pull 
           themselves ashore. Irma and the man pant hard. Irma SMILES 
           across to Mari.

                                 IRMA
                             (yelling)
                        See no problem. 

           Hand over hand, Gallo pulls the inner tubes back. As they 
           return to the shore, Mari’s heart begins to beat hard. 

           Memo helps her put her clothes and their backpack in the 
           trash bag. He puts his own clothes in his bag.

           He looks up at Mari. She looks SWEATY, panicked.

                                 MEMO
                        Are you okay?

           She looks at him with wide, FRANTIC EYES and nods. She’s 
           TWEAKING hard on whatever Irma gave her. 

           Memo hands her the bag.

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        Be careful.

           Mari takes the bag. Gives an unnatural nod. Gallo hands her 
           the tube. Takes in her nearly-naked body.

           Mari barely notices. She grabs the tube. A middle-aged woman 
           takes the other one. They wade into the water. 

           Mari sets the tube in the water. Steps into it. Holding the 
           bag tight. She WALKS further out into the water. 
           The river gets DEEP. Mari YELPS as the tube rises. She tries 
           to keep her head over the tube. But the current keeps PULLING 
           her from below - nearly sucking her out of the tube.

           Struggling against the water, her FRANTIC HEARTBEAT and the 
           sound of the RUSHING WATER fills her ears. She kicks wildly, 
           seemingly making no forward movement at all. 

           She momentarily rises above the tube. Gets a GLIMPSE of her 
           path. Sees Irma on the other shore. The woman who waded out 
           with her is almost there. 

           The CURRENT pulls Mari back down and into...

           Complete DISORIENTATION. She panics. Breaths come short and 
           labored. Her feet FLAIL. To make progress. To find land.

           From the unknown space around her, she hears MEMO’S VOICE.

                                 MEMO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Move away from my voice. Just keep 
                        kicking away from my voice, Mari.

           Mari calms a bit. Tries to gather herself. Still unable to 
           see, she KICKS hard - away from her brother’s voice. 

                                 MEMO (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Good. Keep going.

           Reinforced by the movement, she keeps kicking. And kicking. 
           With the next kick, her FOOT hits LAND. She digs her toe in 
           hard. Pulls with all her might. 

           Mercifully, she RISES from the water. Scrambles quickly up 
           the bank. Her belongings hang from her side. Knuckles white 
           from her death grip on the bag. 

           Irma greets her.

                                 IRMA
                        That’s my girl.

           Mari collapses. The tubes return to the other side. She gasps 
           hard, trying to calm down, despite the uppers.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        Welcome to the United States.

           Mari shoots her an exhausted smile.

           Across the river, Memo ties his GLASSES to his head. He and 
           the Young Man with the pregnant woman step into their tubes.

           They wade into the water, side-by-side. 
           Instead of stepping into the tube, both men loop one arm onto 
           it and hang off the side. They start to PADDLE.

           Memo’s making his way across easily. Back on the shore, Gallo 
           watches him progress, slowly letting out slack on the rope. 

           Mari looks on, anxious.

           Memo’s at the ZENITH of the current. Suddenly, the rope goes 
           completely SLACK. Did it slip from Gallo’s hand? Did he 
           release it intentionally?

           Gallo REACHES for the rope, but it’s too late. Memo’s tube 
           shoots sharply down the river - COLLIDING with the other tube 
           just as Gallo gets a hold of the rope.

           Both Memo and Young Man are KNOCKED FREE from their tubes.

           Memo manages to GRAB onto the man’s tube. The man reaches 
           out. Tries to do the same. But the current is too strong. 
           It’s DRAGGING him away. 

           At the last minute, his HAND finds Memo’s trash bag. 

           The pregnant woman CRIES out. Memo struggles to hold onto the 
           tube. The current pulling hard. Threatening to pull both Memo 
           and the man from the tube. 

           The man STARES into Memo’s eyes.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Please. Please. Pull me in.

           Memo fights the current. He holds onto the tube with one hand 
           and the bag with the other.

                                 MEMO
                        I can’t!
                             (yelling to Gallo)
                        Pull us back!

           Gallo pulls hard, inching them slowly back to shore.

           Memo sees TENSION TEARS form in the bag. It’s going to give. 
           The man sees it too.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Please. I don’t want to die!

           The FEAR in the man’s eyes burns into Memo.

                                 MEMO
                             (yelling to shore)
                        Hurry!
           Another man joins Gallo. They start pulling them in faster.

           They’re nearly back to shore when... THE BAG GIVES, splitting 
           into pieces. Everything Memo owns - his clothes, his money - 
           spill into the Rio Grande. 

           The man is SUCKED AWAY in an instant. 

           Memo watches, powerless. The man STRUGGLES. Yells. He can’t 
           keep his head above the water. 

           He goes under. And doesn’t come back up.

           The yelling stops. Replaced by the rushing of the river. Memo 
           scans for any sign of the man. All that remains are ERRANT 
           BILLS.

           Memo steps back on shore.

           A piercing SCREAM startles him. The pregnant woman WAILS. 

                                 GALLO
                        Shut up.

           The woman carries on. Grief blotting out reason.

           Gallo runs over to her. Slaps her hard. 

                                 GALLO (CONT'D)
                        I said shut up.

           Her cries die down to a WHIMPER. Gallo takes in the dirty 
           looks from the others in the group.

                                 GALLO (CONT'D)
                        What?! You want la migra to come? 

           He walks back to Memo and angrily throws him the tube. 

                                 GALLO (CONT'D)
                        Go again.

           Memo glares at him. Not moving. Gallo turns.

                                 GALLO (CONT'D)
                        I said go again.

                                 MEMO
                        You did that on purpose. 

           Gallo stares at him, menacingly.

                                 GALLO
                        It slipped.
           He holds out the tube.

                                 GALLO (CONT'D)
                        Now go.

           Memo grabs the tube and hurries into the water. Unencumbered 
           by belongings. Driven by adrenaline and anger. He makes it to 
           the other side quickly.

           As he emerges from the water, Mari grabs him in a HUG. He 
           whispers low to her.

                                 MEMO
                        Our money...

                                 MARI
                        It’s okay. I still have mine.

           Irma appears behind Mari. Grabs Memo’s face in her hands.

                                 IRMA
                        Are you okay?

                                 MEMO
                        He did that on purpose.

           Irma looks across the river at Gallo. He glares in return.

                                 IRMA
                        Stay close. It’s easier for them 
                        with less people. Life is cheap out 
                        here.
                             (looking back to them)
                        But we’re safe if we’re together.

           Mari and Memo NOD.

           EXT. RIVER - LATER

           The group, now-dressed, start to move out. Irma, Mari and 
           Memo take up the rear. Memo now in SPARE CLOTHES. 

           Mari stops. Looks to the other shore.

           Pregnant Woman LIES PROSTRATE on the beach. Her eyes 
           lifeless, watching the water rush by. The water that took 
           away her lover. Her future.

           Mari’s transfixed. Irma notices.
                                 IRMA
                        Best to put it out of your mind. If 
                        you dwell on the dead out here, 
                        they’ll take you with them.

           She puts a hand on Mari’s shoulder. They turn. Walk away. 
           Leaving the broken woman on the beach to her fate.

           EXT. DESERT - DAY

           The BLARING SUN hangs high. Its unobscured heat assaults the 
           small band as they make their way through the desert. They’re 
           nearing an ominous wall of mountains.

           Mari, Memo and Irma still bring up the rear.

           REMNANTS of past groups line the path: a BACKPACK, an EMPTY 
           WATER BOTTLE, a DIRTY STUFFED ANIMAL. Items discarded out of 
           weariness, confusion or something more dire: hopelessness.

           Mari stares up at the sun. Her eyes STRUGGLE to focus. Heart 
           THUDDING loudly in her ears. She’s still feeling the effects 
           of the pill Irma gave her. 

           Memo squeezes her hand. Her bewildered eyes find him. He 
           holds out a gallon JUG - half full of water. 

           Mari brings the jug to her lips, greedily drinking. 

           Irma pulls them back. Watches the group continue on. The 
           trail leads them to a valley between two mountains. Irma 
           shakes her head.

                                 IRMA
                        That way is no good.

                                 MEMO
                        Why?

                                 IRMA
                        Border patrol waits in the 
                        lowlands. They ambush groups that 
                        move between the mountains. 

           She looks to a small TRAIL leading up the mountain.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        This way. It’ll take a little 
                        longer but we won’t get caught.

                                 MEMO
                        We should stay with the group. What 
                        if we get lost?
           Mari’s processing enough of the conversation to understand 
           what’s happening.

                                 MARI
                        Yeah--

           Irma becomes stern. 

                                 IRMA
                        Do you want to get caught?

           Memo shakes his head.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        Then you need to listen to me. I 
                        know these roads. You won’t get 
                        lost as long as you stay with me.

           She watches the group walk away.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        Besides. I think you’re right. We 
                        can’t trust Gallo.

           Irma turns toward the path.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        Come on. 

           Irma starts up the hill. Mari and Memo watch the group get 
           further and further away. Mari TURNS. Follows after Irma.

                                 MARI
                        She’s gotten us this far.

           Memo stares at the group for a moment more. The little girl 
           and her mother at the rear.

           The girl turns. Memo locks eyes with her. He sighs, resigned. 
           And follows his sister up the trail. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - AFTERNOON

           Three pairs of TENNIS SHOES trudge up the rough mountain 
           TERRAIN. 

           Irma leads. Her PHONE vibrates. She pulls it out. Reads the 
           MESSAGE. Shoots a quick response back. She looks back at 
           Memo. Sees him eyeing her. She offers a warm SMILE.

           Memo takes another step. He looks back. A PALE IMPRINT of his 
           shoe remains. He pulls his foot up. The bottom of his sole, 
           wet and slick. His shoes literally MELTING.
                                 MEMO
                        Mari.

           Mari looks back at him lazily. Her DAZED eyes catch Memo off-
           guard. She’s out of it. Her shirt soaked through with SWEAT. 
           The high has given way to dehydration. Memo’s concerned.

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        Irma.

           She turns back.

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        We need to stop.

           Irma plods over to them, impatiently.

                                 IRMA
                        What is it?

           We take in the over-blown, unfocused world from Mari’s POV. 
           Irma turns to her.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        What’s wrong with you, mija?

           Irma’s face moves in and out of focus. As it comes into focus 
           one last time, it takes on the form of a DEMON. Mari WINCES. 
           Turns away frightened. Doesn’t answer Irma.

           Irma sees she’s in a bad state. She looks at their 
           surroundings. Shakes her head.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        We can’t stop here. Too exposed. 
                        There’s a small group of trees at 
                        the base of this trail. We’ll stop 
                        there.

           Memo PROTESTS.

                                 MEMO
                        Look at her! She needs to rest.

           He points to the shrubs and small trees that line the trail.

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        This is plenty of shade.

           Memo grabs Mari’s hand. Leads her to a nearby BUSH.

           Irma watches on annoyed. Concerned. She looks up and down the 
           path, uneasy. Pulls out her phone. Sends off another TEXT. 
           Memo sits Mari in the shade. Catches Irma texting again. As 
           he pulls the water bottle from their backpack...

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        Who are you texting?

           Irma shoots a look at him.

                                 IRMA
                        Our contact. He’s going to pick us 
                        up at the highway.
                             (raising her eyebrows)
                        Unless you want to walk to Dallas.

           He turns back to his sister. Helps her take a SIP. He 
           assesses the WATER LEVEL.

                                 MEMO
                        Only a small one. We still have a 
                        long way to go.

           Mari leans her head back. Absorbs the relief from the heat. 
           She seems a bit more like herself again.

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        Feeling a little better?

           She nods. Looks at her brother, gratitude in her eyes.

                                 MARI
                        I think I need to pee.

           Memo laughs.

                                 MEMO
                        Okay. I’ll go too. 

           He helps her to her feet. Irma sees them. Becomes impatient.

                                 IRMA
                        Where are you going?

           Mari walks into the dense shrubbery. Memo starts off another 
           direction.

                                 MEMO
                        To pee.

           Irma’s concern turns to near-panic.

                                 IRMA
                        It’s not safe. We need to move.

           Memo’s already DISAPPEARED into the greenery.
                                 MEMO
                        We’ll be quick.

           Irma VIBRATES with agitation. 

           EXT. DESERT - ROCK OUTCROPPING - SAME

           Mari makes her way toward an ROCK OUTCROPPING. She nestles 
           under its pocket of SHADE.

           EXT. DESERT - CLEARING - SAME

           Memo finds a small clearing. He unzips his pants. Readies to 
           pee into a bush.

           Something in it catches his eye. A HAT. Slightly sun-
           bleached. TATTERED from exposure. He picks it up, curious. 

           He flips it over. There’s a HOLE through the LAKERS EMBLEM on 
           the front. Ringed dark. Memo FINGERS the hole. His heart 
           sinks.

           He turns. Trepidatious. SCANS the area for the owner of the 
           hat. His eyes go WIDE.

           Memo RUNS back toward the path.

           EXT. DESERT - ROCK OUTCROPPING - SAME

           Mari is still enjoying her momentary respite in the shade. 
           Memo’s voice chimes up from behind the bushes.

                                 MEMO (O.C.)
                             (harsh whisper)
                        Mari!

           Mari looks to the direction of the voice.

                                 MARI
                        Memo?

           He POKES his head out. Urgent...

                                 MEMO
                        Come. Quick.

           EXT. DESERT - CLEARING - MOMENTS LATER

           Mari and Memo are back at the clearing. They confront the 
           SIGHT that frightened Memo. 
           Mari processes the scene. 

                                 MEMO
                        It’s Irma’s family...

           Finally, we see the tableau: THREE BODIES laid out on the 
           desert floor. A MAN, a TEENAGE BOY, a GIRL. Their hands BOUND 
           behind their backs. Their skin LEATHERY. Dark and taut.

           A few DRY BUSHES cover them. Weighed down with ROCKS. A vain 
           attempt to conceal the bodies.

                                 MARI
                        You don’t know that. 

           Memo holds up the hat.

                                 MEMO
                        I saw a picture of her son. He was 
                        wearing this hat.

           Mari takes in that new information. 

                                 MARI
                        That doesn’t mean anything.

           She scours for clues. A BACKPACK’s pinned under one of the 
           bodies. She pulls at it. The body CRACKS unnaturally as the 
           bag is loosed. 

           Mari rifles through it. Finds a WALLET. Flips it open. Stops 
           at a PICTURE. Her face falls. She reels. 

           Memo approaches. 

                                 MEMO
                        What is it?

           Mari scans the area, near-frantic. She stops. A bit further 
           back, a WOMAN’S SHOE juts out from behind a rock. 

           Mari moves to it. Memo follows. As they get closer, the 
           wearer comes into view. 

           It’s a WOMAN. Her body bent over and rigid. Her pants, around 
           her knees. A BULLET HOLE in the sun-dried skin of her head.

           Memo’s confused.

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        Who?...

           Mari hands Memo the wallet.
                                 MARI
                        This isn’t Irma’s family.

           Memo looks at the photo in the wallet. It’s the same father 
           and son he saw in the picture at the house. 

           But now the family is complete. A young daughter. And a 
           SMILING MOTHER. A mother now dead in the desert. 

           A mother who is NOT Irma.

           Memo spins.

                                 MEMO
                        But we were in her house. This is 
                        the boy. The father. 

           The weight of their current predicament crashes down on Mari. 
           She shakes her head.

                                 MARI
                        That was this family’s house. Irma 
                        took us there because she knew it 
                        would be empty. 

           She gets close to Memo’s face. 

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        She knew because she’s the one who 
                        brought them out here. 

           Mari and Memo stare at the dead woman - process the 
           implications. Memo asks the obvious...

                                 MEMO
                        What do we do now?

           EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - SAME

           Irma waits impatiently. Her phone RINGS. She picks it up.

                                 IRMA
                        What?

           INT. POLICE TRUCK - SAME

           On the other end, OFFICER CORTEZ in his police truck.

                                 OFFICER CORTEZ
                        I want my cut for the two I 
                        corralled your way yesterday. 
           EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - INTERCUT

           Irma eyes the bushes.

                                 IRMA
                        You’ll get your cut when it’s done. 

                                 OFFICER CORTEZ (O.S.)
                        Don’t fuck me here.

           Irma grows annoyed.

                                 IRMA
                        You know I’m good for it. I have to 
                        go.

           She hangs up ABRUPTLY.

           Irma quickly replaces the phone as she hears the pair return.

           Mari and Memo emerge. Doing their best to look normal. Irma 
           senses the change in them.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        Everything okay?

           Memo is frozen. Mari sees this. Tries to cover.

                                 MARI
                        Memo had to poop.

           Memo offers a soft NOD to confirm that fact. Irma’s eyes 
           squint in skepticism. She turns back toward the trail.

                                 IRMA
                        Let’s go.

           The three re-embark on their journey. Irma takes the lead. 
           Mari and Memo trail behind. A cautious distance.

           Irma pulls her phone. Shoots off a quick text.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE TRAIL - LATER

           The sun has slipped a bit. But is no less oppressive. Irma 
           moves at a good clip. 

           Mari and Memo watch her. Who is this woman they’re with? How 
           do they get out of this desert alive? Irma feels their 
           stares. TURNS back to them.
                                 IRMA
                        You need to stay close. These 
                        trails are tricky.

           Mari and Memo NOD.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        Why don’t you take a quick rest? 
                        I’m going to make a call.

           The pair sit on a nearby rock. Irma continues up the path 
           another couple hundred feet to...

           EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE TRAIL - LEDGE - CONTINUOUS

           A PRECIPITOUS LEDGE. She pulls out her phone. DIALS.

           Memo speaks low to his sister.

                                 MEMO
                        Let’s push her.

           Mari eyes Irma. The ledge. The drop. She SHAKES her head.

                                 MARI
                        She could pull us over. Plus, we 
                        need the phone.
                             (off his confused look)
                        The map.

           The person on the other end of the line answers. Mari and 
           Memo watch. Too far to hear anything. 

           Irma eyes the two. Then moves around the bend for even more 
           privacy. 

           Mari motions for Memo to be quiet. She RISES. Noiselessly 
           creeps to the bend. Tries to stay out of sight.

           This close, she can make out SNIPPETS of Irma’s conversation.

                                 IRMA
                        ...they’re suspicious.
                        ...get the girl. Kill... 
                        ...okay, see you soon.

           She hangs up. Mari spins around. Darts back to Memo.

           Irma TURNS sharply. Did she hear Mari? 

           She waits for a moment, listening. It’s quiet. She sighs. 
           Equal parts annoyed and tired.
           She turns the bend. STOPS short. Mari and Memo are GONE.

           Irma’s guard goes up.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        Mari? ... Memo?

           She stops. Listens. Nothing. 

           Irma doesn’t like this. She shakes her head. Turns. Starts 
           RUNNING down the mountain. Pulls out her phone. 

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        Get up here. Quick.

           EXT. MOUTH OF MOUNTAIN TRAIL - SAME

           On the other end of the call, we find PANCHO, a mustached-man 
           in his forties. He dons a crisp western-style shirt and 
           cowboy boots. He angrily HANGS UP the call.

                                 PANCHO
                        Fuck.

           JAVI, a cartel soldier in equally dapper attire idles next to 
           a truck. He notices Pancho’s agitation. 

                                 JAVI
                        What is it?

           Pancho looks up into the hills.

                                 PANCHO
                        Something’s wrong.

           He pulls his PISTOL from its holster. Starts up the trail.

                                 PANCHO (CONT'D)
                        Come on.

           Javi grabs his ASSAULT RIFLE. Follows.

           EXT. BEND IN MOUNTAIN TRAIL - SAME

           Maria and Memo sneak around a bend of the trail. Mari stops 
           short. Pulls Memo down behind a rock.

                                 MARI
                        It’s them.

           Further down the mountain, Irma convenes with Pancho and 
           Javi.
           She pulls at his arm. Memo doesn’t budge.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        They have guns. Let’s go back.

                                 MEMO
                        They’ll follow us. We don’t know 
                        where we’re going. If they don’t 
                        kill us, the desert will.

           Mari sighs. He has a point. Something catches her eye.

                                 MARI
                        Look.

           She points to an OFFSHOOT TRAIL just beyond Irma and Pancho. 

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        If we get there, we can go around. 
                        Get to the bottom that way.

                                 MEMO
                        How do we get over there? 

           Mari and Memo watch as the group below splits up. Irma and 
           Pancho head up the hill. Javi lingers behind. 

           Mari has an idea. Grabbing her brother’s hand...

                                 MARI
                        Come on.

           EXT. WILD DESERT - CONTINUOUS

           She pulls him across the trail and into the WILD BUSHES.

                                 MARI
                        Stay low.

           They get on all fours and CRAWL along the desert floor, 
           obscured by the shrubbery. 

           On the trail, Irma and Pancho make their way up the hill. 
           They don’t notice as Mari and Memo slowly crawl past them.

           EXT. BEND IN MOUNTAIN TRAIL - SAME

           Irma and Pancho arrive at bend where she last saw Mari and 
           Memo. Irma slows.

                                 IRMA
                        This is the place.
           Pancho hands her a SMALL PISTOL from his boot.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        The girl has the money. Kill the 
                        boy. Try not to hurt her. We’ll get 
                        less for her if she’s beat up. 

           Pancho nods. Gets in front. Leads with his gun. They start 
           their search.

           EXT. WILD DESERT - CONTINUOUS

           Mari and Memo stop. Mari gets low. Looks between the foliage. 

           She can make out the ENTRANCE of the smaller trail. Only 
           about a hundred feet away. But they need to go across the 
           main trail, which will leave them briefly exposed.

           Mari whispers, low.

                                 MARI
                        Do you see the other one?

           They strain to see through the shrubs. Memo shakes his head.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Okay, let’s run for it. Stay low.

           Memo nods. They RISE to their feet - still bent over.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Ready?

           Memo looks nervous. But nods.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Go!

           They stay low. Make a BREAK for it. It’s an awkward sprint.

           The trail entrance sits invitingly ahead of them. Shrubs 
           still hiding them.

           Their target is close. FIFTY FEET. Then TWENTY FIVE. The only 
           distance left is crossing the exposed main trail. 

           Rather than slowing, Mari pushes harder. RUNS even faster. 
           Memo takes her cue. Follows suit. 

           They gun it for the entrance and...
           EXT. MAIN TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

           BURST onto the main trail - COLLIDING DIRECTLY INTO JAVI.

           All three tumble to the ground. Javi’s GUN lands nearby.

           Javi looks up at Mari and Memo. Realizes what he’s seeing. 
           His EYES move to his gun. Mari and Memo see it too. 

           Javi and Memo LUNGE for the gun.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE TRAIL - SAME

           Irma and Pancho continue their search. From the expanse, 
           comes the soft CRACK of two bullets.

           Pancho looks up, concerned. He pulls a WALKIE off his belt.

                                 PANCHO
                        Javi, what’s going on down there?

           EXT. MAIN TRAIL - SAME

           Mari, Memo and Javi stare at one another, stunned. Javi holds 
           his chest. BLOOD haloes his hand.

           Memo stares at the gun in his hand. A mix of awe and horror.

           Javi falls. FADES quickly. His walkie crackles to life.

                                 PANCHO (O.C.)
                             (via the walkie)
                        Did you get them?

           Mari grabs Memo’s hand. Snaps him out of it.

                                 MARI
                        Come on. We’ve got to move.

           She pulls him toward the smaller trail. Memo resists. He 
           points to the placement of the body. Then the trail.

                                 MEMO
                        When they see him here, they’ll 
                        know where we went.

           Mari stops.

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        We need to split up.
                                 MARI
                        No! We stay together.

                                 MEMO
                        We have to!
                             (re: the small trail)
                        You get down that way.
                             (pointing back at the 
                              shrubs)
                        I’ll go this way. Try to pull them 
                        away. I can lose them in the 
                        bushes.

           He looks out into the desert. Points to a TREE.

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        We’ll meet there. 

           Mari shakes her head. The walkie on Javi’s belt CRACKLES.

                                 PANCHO (O.C.)
                             (via the walkie)
                        We’re coming down.

                                 MARI
                        What if they get one of us?

                                 MEMO
                        Then the other one keeps going. 
                             (adding, sadly)
                        Better one than none.

           Mari doesn’t like this plan. But she can’t think of a better 
           one. 

                                 MARI
                        At least take the gun.

           Memo nods. Loops the RIFLE on one shoulder. The BACKPACK on 
           the other. They HUG. Then go their separate ways. 

           Mari momentary stops and watches her brother DISAPPEAR into 
           the shrubs. Is this the last time she’s going to see him? 

           Perhaps.

           She fingers her key. Turns. Moves out. 

           EXT. OFFSHOOT TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

           Mari makes her way down the treacherous terrain. The path 
           waxes and wanes. Seems to disappear at points. Fear keeps her 
           pace steady.
           EXT. MAIN TRAIL - SAME

           Pancho and Irma jog down the trail. Spot something up ahead: 
           Javi’s lifeless body.

           They reach him. See the wounds.

                                 IRMA
                        Dios...

           Irma PORES over the murder scene, analyzing. Pancho spots the 
           entrance to the smaller trail.

                                 PANCHO
                        Look.

           He starts for the path. Irma stops him with a wave of her 
           hand. She examines the footprints on the ground.

                                 IRMA
                        Clever little shits.
                             (re: the footprints)
                        They split up. I’ll go this way.  
                        You head that way.

           Irma takes the smaller path. Pancho heads into the shrubs.

           EXT. WILD DESERT - CONTINUOUS

           Pancho PLODS through the brush. GUN drawn.

           Memo hides deeper in the thicket of desert plants. He hears 
           Pancho. He’s close. Memo’s mind races with options.

           Pancho continues scouring. A BRANCH BREAKS to his right. 

           He stops. Moves over the area. Nothing. He looks around, 
           confused.

           Pancho’s quiet. He waits. Behind him, another BUSH is 
           disturbed.

           He runs over. His eyes search wildly. He stops. Bends down. 
           Rises. A LARGE ROCK in his hand. 

           Pancho looks around. He doesn’t appreciate being fucked with.

           EXT. OFFSHOOT TRAIL - LEDGE - SAME

           Mari continues at a good clip. Suddenly, the trail DEAD-ENDS. 
           A fifteen foot DROP. 
           She scans the area. Searching for any sign of a way down.

           Behind her, rocks tumble. Irma on the hunt. She can’t see 
           Mari yet. But it’s only a matter of seconds.

           There’s nowhere to hide. Mari takes a deep breath.

           EXT. OFFSHOOT TRAIL - SAME

           Irma makes her way around the bend. Arrives at the dead-end. 
           The steep drop. She looks for a way down

           A PEBBLE falls from the shelf of rock above her. She looks 
           up. Mari holds a SOFTBALL-SIZED ROCK.

                                 IRMA
                        You little cunt.

           Mari LOBS the rock at her head. Irma DUCKS. 

           The rock misses its target, GRAZING Irma’s shoulder instead.

           Irma takes a SHOT at Mari. She LUNGES to avoid it. Loses her 
           footing. SLIDES on the gravel. SLIPS down the hill. STOPS at 
           Irma’s feet. 

           Irma smirks. Points the gun. Mari grabs a handful of GRAVEL. 
           FLINGS it at Irma’s face. Irma DEFLECTS. Turns. 

           Mari jumps up. Throws herself on Irma. The two go down. The 
           gun FLIES out of Irma’s hand. Lands far from them.

           Mari sees the SOFTBALL-SIZED ROCK. REACHES to grab it. 

           Her fingers latch onto it. She brings it down HARD on the 
           side of Irma’s HEAD. 

           Irma CRIES out in pain. 

           In her struggle to grab the rock, Mari lost her leverage on 
           Irma’s body. Irma PUSHES her off. RISES. 

           She touches her head. BLOOD. She looks to Mari. Angry. 
           Annoyed.

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        I’m going to kill you for that.

           She CHARGES at Mari. BATS the rock away. Takes her down. 
           Starts beating her mercilessly.

           Mari’s no match for the large, angry woman. 
           The beating SUBDUES Mari. Irma rises. DRAGS Mari toward the 
           edge by her leg. 

           Mari FLAILS. They’re almost to the ledge. Mari KICKS the back 
           of Irma’s legs with her free foot. Irma’s knees GIVE out.  

           Mari’s hand find a ROCK. POUNCES on Irma. 

           The rock is high over her head. She brings it down on HARD 
           onto Irma’s face. She does it AGAIN. And AGAIN.

           Mari stops. Irma’s face, a PULPY MESS. An odd, creepy smile 
           forms. Irma’s out of it, but manages to say... 

                                 IRMA (CONT'D)
                        You’re already dead.

           She GURGLES. Chokes on her own BLOOD. 

           Mari BASHES the rock against Irma’s head again. She continues 
           until the only sound is the WET impact of the rock. 

           Finally, she stops. Takes in the gory mess of flesh and bone 
           that used to be Irma’s face.

           She rises. RETCHES. 

           Mari gathers herself. Pulls Irma’s phone from her pocket.

           Irma GASPS eerily. Could just be air escaping. 

           Mari’s not taking any chances. She rolls Irma’s body to the 
           ledge. PUSHES it over. 

           Irma’s dead weight THUDS against the desert floor.

           EXT. WILD DESERT - SAME

           Memo gets to the EDGE of the overgrowth. Beyond him, PANCHO’S 
           TRUCK. And flat desert. 

           No sign of Pancho. 

           Memo sees their meeting point in the distant. He rises. Scans 
           the area. Nothing. 

           He RUNS for it.

           He’s fast. The distant tree gets closer with each step. In 
           seconds, he’s past the truck. 

           A SHOT rings out. The bullet slices through his backpack and 
           into his arm. Pink mist EXPLODES from Memo’s shoulder.
           He cries out in pain. Falls. Grabs at the wound. His RIFLE 
           lands nearby.

           Pancho steps out from behind the truck.

           Memo reaches for the rifle. Pancho fires a SHOT into the 
           ground next to him.

                                 PANCHO
                        Don’t move.

           Memo FREEZES. 

           Pancho saunters over. KICKS the rifle away. LOOMS. Trains the 
           gun on Memo.

                                 PANCHO (CONT'D)
                        The other one?

           Memo stares back at him, defiant. Pancho nods, understanding.

                                 PANCHO (CONT'D)
                        That’s the way you want it...

           Memo closes his eyes. Readies himself for death.

           A pair of SHOTS ring out. Memo doesn’t feel anything. He 
           opens his eyes, confused.

           Pancho drops the gun. A red-rimmed EXIT WOUND mars his chest.

           Memo looks beyond Pancho. Mari’s there. IRMA’S GUN in hand.

                                 MARI
                        Come on!

           Pancho falls. Blood leaks from his mouth.

           Memo rises. Runs to Mari. She clocks his bloody arm.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Are you okay?

           He nods. They run into the expanse. Not looking back. 

           EXT. DESERT - TREE - AFTERNOON

           Mari and Memo COLLAPSE into the shade. 

           Memo pulls the backpack off. As he does, he notices with 
           alarm that it’s WET. He frantically opens it.
                                 MEMO
                        No, no.

           He pulls out the water jug. It’s been SHOT. There’s barely 
           any water left.

           Mari’s face melts in horror. She CRAWLS over. Takes the jug 
           from Memo. Examines it. 

           So little left. A jug full of the specter of death now.

           Memo jumps to his feet. Kicks the backpack. Lets out a 
           guttural YELL. The rage and frustration of the last few days 
           spill out. 

           Mari holds her head in her hands. Contemplating a thirsty 
           death in the desert.

           Rage expelled, Memo’s now on his knees. He stares off into 
           space. Despondent. Finally, puts it into words...

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        We’re gonna die out here.

           Mari knows they won’t survive if they lose hope. She tries to 
           pull herself together.

                                 MARI
                        We drink this now. And rest. Then 
                        we’ll move. As fast as we can. We 
                        can’t be that far. We’re already 
                        over the border.

           Memo looks at her, incredulous.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Memo, we don’t have a choice. Do 
                        you want to die out here? 

           Memo silently stares back at her.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Because I don’t. We’ll be fine. We 
                        just need to make it to a road. 

           Memo looks to his hands, still despondent. 

           Mari holds out the water. 

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Here. You drink first. 

           Memo SHAKES his head.
                                 MEMO
                        You first.

           She takes the jug, opens it. TIPS it to her mouth, avoiding 
           the bullet holes. Takes a small swig, about half. 

           Memo does the same. He takes in the empty, useless bottle. 
           Gives a sad sigh. Then TOSSES it into the desert.

           A hot wind takes it. Pushing the jug off into oblivion.

           EXT. DESERT LOWLANDS - LATE-AFTERNOON

           Mountains have given way to soft flat land. It’s barren. 
           Desolate. The low sun casts a SURREAL ORANGE HUE over the 
           landscape. It’s nightmarish.

           Mari and Memo look terrible. CHAPPED lips. PINK skin. Covered 
           in sweat, dirt, dry blood. The lack of water is taking its 
           toll. They’re woozy. Out of it.

           Memo’s in the lead. He pulls out the phone to check their 
           location. The screen is BLACK. An ERROR MESSAGE informs the 
           phone is too hot to use.

           Memo looks at it. Confused. He TRIPS on something. FALLS.

           Mari hurries - as much as she can in her state - to his side. 
           When she gets to him, he’s looking back to the spot where he 
           tripped. He STARES, mesmerized.

           Mari’s worried.

                                 MARI
                        Are you okay?

           Memo doesn’t respond. He just keeps staring.

           Mari turns. Sees what he’s looking at. She GASPS.

           Behind a rock is the CORPSE of a YOUNG WOMAN. Skin dry, 
           tight. Dark. One hand wrapped around her BELLY. Even in her 
           current state, it’s clear she was PREGNANT. 

           The area around her mouth is MUTILATED. The SAGUARO next to 
           her tells the rest of the tale. 

           Bloody BITE MARKS mar the trunk of the cactus. Signs of the 
           desperate woman’s attempts to get to the water she believed 
           to be inside.

           Mari TURNS her head away. Memo notices her reaction.
                                 MEMO
                        You see it too?

                                 MARI
                        Of course.

           Memo looks back to the sight.

                                 MEMO
                        I wasn’t sure if it was real.

           Mari stands. Reaches out her hand to her brother.

                                 MARI
                        Come on.

           Memo is still entranced. 

                                 MEMO
                        Do you think it’s worth it? 

                                 MARI
                             (confused)
                        What?

                                 MEMO
                        Anything. Do you think anything is 
                        worth this?

           Mari considers the question.

                                 MARI
                        Why would so many people go if it 
                        weren’t?

           Memo continues to stare at the woman, unconvinced. She 
           reaches her hand out again.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        Come on. Let’s find a place to rest 
                        until the sun goes down.

           Memo NODS. He takes her hand and gets up. 

           They begin their zombie-like trek again.

           EXT. DESERT HILL - NIGHT

           The sun is gone. But the desert still RADIATES heat. The land 
           has morphed yet again. The terrain HILLY, tree-filled.

           The pair continue their slog. Propelled by pure survival.
           They slowly push up a sandy hill. As they crest it, Mari sees 
           something in the distance. She stops moving. Memo does too.

                                 MEMO
                        What’s wrong?

           Mari starts to smile.

                                 MARI
                        Look.

           He does.

           Off in the distance, SMALL MOVING LIGHTS dot the horizon.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        A highway.

           Memo smiles. He plops down in the sand. Mari does the same.

           Memo stares at the highway happily. He chuckles.

                                 MEMO
                        We did it.

           Mari smiles. Nods.

                                 MARI
                        We did it.

           They hug.

           The two lie back on the soft sand. Resting before this last 
           jubilant leg of their journey. Memo pulls his GLASSES off. 
           Stares into the inky night.

           Mari sits up. Hears something. MUSIC. Classic rock wafting 
           through the desert air. Getting louder.

           Memo sits up too.

                                 MEMO
                        What is that?

           About a 100 yards away, a TRUCK turns out into view. Bright 
           lights. Big grill. Loud music.

           Mari and Memo SCRAMBLE to the cover of the bushes. Memo 
           forgetting his glasses in the hurry.

           The truck speeds over the terrain. Heads right for them. 

           Memo realizes. Touches his face.
                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        My glasses...

           The truck is close. Too risky to go back for them.

                                 MARI
                             (whispering)
                        Maybe they’ll pass.

           Memo shoots her a world-weary look.

                                 MEMO
                        They never pass, Mari.

           Memo’s right. The truck slows. Two people inside. BILL and 
           BOB (both late-30s). Bob is plump. Drives. Bill’s wiry frame 
           sits shotgun. Both men wear TACTICAL GEAR over civilian 
           clothes.

           Bill consults a DEVICE. He yells to Bob over the music.

                                 BILL
                        Stop, stop! It’s right here.

           Bob complies. Brings the truck to a HALT right in front of 
           Memo and Mari.

           Bill hops out excited. Starts searching the area.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        Sensor hit right around here.

           Bob stands on the ledge of the drivers side. Watches Bill 
           over the cab.

                                 BOB
                        I’m tellin’ you, it’s gonna be 
                        another jackrabbit.

                                 BILL
                        You don’t know that. Hit me with 
                        that light so I can see.

           Bob reaches over to the large LIGHT attached to the roof of 
           the cab. He flips it on. Spins it to face the search area.

           The bright lamp startles Mari and Memo. Light blasts the 
           bushes. Dappling their faces. They crouch even lower.

           Bill inspects. Steps on something. CRUNCH. Memo’s glasses. 

           Memo and Mari’s hearts sink.
                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        That’s no fucking jackrabbit. Bring 
                        me my gun.

           Bob reluctantly obeys. As he grabs the GUN from the cab...

                                 BOB
                        Probably already ran off.

           Bill takes the gun from Bob.

                                 BILL
                        May be. But, if they’re here, we’re 
                        gonna find ‘em.

           Mari and Memo can’t understand anything the pair say. But 
           seeing Bill examine their footprints and then asking for a 
           gun tells them everything they need to know. 

           Mari MOTIONS to Memo. She points back the way they came. 
           Advocating they make a run for it. Memo SHAKES his head.

                                 MEMO
                             (barely a whisper)
                        They’ll shoot.

           Bill addresses the surrounding bushes and trees.

                                 BILL
                        All right, amigos. If you’re out 
                        there, make yourselves known.

           Memo looks to Mari. Get any of that? Mari shrugs.

                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        Don’t make me do this the hard way.
                             (off the silence)
                        Okay, have it your way.

           Bill props the gun up on his hip. He SPRAYS a fan of BULLETS 
           into the trees and bushes. 

           Mari and Memo lay flat on the ground. BULLETS whizz by their 
           heads as the shooting path comes over them.

           He STOPS. Bob’s annoyed.

                                 BOB
                        You’re gonna kill someone.

                                 BILL
                        No better motivation to do the 
                        right thing than a bullet.
           Mari has seen enough. She SITS up. Grabs the backpack.

                                 MARI
                             (barely audible)
                        Come on.

           She starts to get to her feet. Memo pulls her sleeve. He 
           SHAKES his head. His face more serious than she’s ever seen.

                                 MARI (CONT'D)
                        We have to.

                                 MEMO
                        Stay.

           He starts to get up. Mari PANICS.

                                 MARI
                        What are you doing?

           Memo looks back to his sister.

                                 MEMO
                        I can’t see. We can’t outrun them.
                             (resigned)
                        Better one than none.

           Mari shakes her head furiously.

                                 MARI
                        No. No.

           She holds his arm tight.

           Beyond the trees, Bill issues a threat.

                                 BILL (O.C.)
                        Get ready for another round.
                             (heavily accented Spanish)
                        Otra. Vez.

           Memo puts a hand over his sister’s. NODS lovingly.

                                 MEMO
                        I wanted to protect you. Now I can. 
                        Make a good life. Then find me.

           Mari is CRYING. Shaking her head vigorously.

                                 MEMO (CONT'D)
                        I love you.

           And with that, he steps out. 
           Bill gets ready to fire again. Memo EMERGES. Hand shielding 
           his eyes.

           Bob’s eyebrows go up in surprise.

                                 BOB
                        Well, shit...

                                 BILL
                        What’d I tell you!

           He moves in to detain Memo.

           Mari covers her mouth. SOBS. WHITE KNUCKLES her key.

                                 BILL (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                        Come on, help me load him in the 
                        truck.

           Mari peers through the bushes. They ZIP-TIE Memo’s hands. 
           Lead him to the truck. Haul him into the back, facing out.

           Bill and Bob get in.

           Mari watches Memo. Shaking her head. Crying. Memo is stoic. A 
           far-cry from the little boy that left home. 

           He STARES at the bush hiding Mari. Memo can’t see her, but he 
           knows she’s there looking back at him. 

           The truck pulls away. Mari watches helpless as her brother is 
           taken from her. 

           Memo maintains his stare as the INKY NIGHT consumes him. 

           Finally alone, Mari SOBS OPENLY.

           EXT. ESCONDIDO MOTEL - NIGHT

           A SHITTY SINGLE-LEVEL MOTEL on the outskirts of civilization. 

           Beyond the glow of the hotel’s fluorescents, PITCH BLACK.

           Gradually, a figure comes into view from the darkness. It’s 
           Mari. She walks wearily to the building. Her eyes drift to a 
           point of interest.

           A bright VENDING MACHINE. She slips a dollar in. Examines the 
           options. COKE.

           She opens the can. Guzzles it down.
           Mari limps to the side of the building. RESTS her head 
           against the warm brick wall. 

           She’s exhausted in every way a human can be. Her eyes close. 
           She slips off to SLEEP.

           EXT. ESCONDIDO MOTEL - MORNING

           Mari sleeps, face still pressed against the building. The SUN 
           HIGH. Sounds of the motel’s normal operations fill the air. 

           Someone SHAKES her awake.

           Mari BLINKS her eyes open. Orienting to the space. Waking up 
           again to the nightmare that is her reality. She looks up to 
           the person rousing her.

           LUPE (30s) a rotund, kind-faced Mexican. Sporting a pink 
           MAID’S UNIFORM.

                                 LUPE
                        You okay, mija?

           Mari hurriedly grabs her backpack.

                                 MARI
                        I’m sorry. I fell asleep.

           She pushes to her feet. Casts a frightened look over her 
           shoulder as she walks away. Lupe takes in the sad sight. This 
           dirty, battered girl all alone.

                                 LUPE
                        Wait. 

           INT. ESCONDIDO MOTEL - ROOM - LATER

           Lupe sits on one of the TWIN BEDS in the DINGY MOTEL ROOM. 
           Mari emerges from the bathroom, freshly-showered.

                                 MARI
                        Thank you.
                             (indicating her clothes)
                        And for this.

                                 LUPE
                             (with a shrug)
                        Lost and found.

           She sits on the bed opposite Lupe.
                                 LUPE (CONT'D)
                        Do you have people here?

           Mari SHAKES her head.

                                 LUPE (CONT'D)
                        A place to stay?

           Mari shakes her head again.

                                 LUPE (CONT'D)
                        You’re gonna need a job. 

           She gets up. Mari looks up at her with inquiring eyes.

                                 LUPE (CONT'D)
                        I might know someone who can help.

           INT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           A stark, fluorescent-filled hallway. Through a glass picture 
           window, we see a cleaned up Mari talking to a WHITE MANAGER. 
           Her clothes are different. It’s unclear how much time has 
           passed.

           We can’t hear their conversation. But it ends with him 
           NODDING his head.

           The manager pulls out a white, folded UNIFORM. Mari takes it.

           They head for the door. Their conversation becomes audible as 
           they approach the hall.

                                 MANAGER
                        ...don’t have papers, so the pay is 
                        $7 and hour. Okay?

           He watches for signs of protest.

           She NODS her head, grateful.

                                 MANAGER (CONT'D)
                        Good. Get dressed.

           INT. SLAUGHTHOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER

           Mari closes the stall door. Locks it.

           She pulls out a CHEAP BURNER. Opens Facebook messenger to a 
           conversation with Memo. She scrolls through multiple messages 
           she’s sent to him.
           All still UNREAD.

           She sighs. Puts the phone back in her pocket. Starts to pull 
           the white uniform over her clothes.

           Int. SlAUGHTERHOUSE - killing floor - later

           The manager leads Mari, now in a white bunny suit, to the 
           killing floor. 

           It’s large. High ceilings. Concrete floors. Everything else 
           metal. METAL and covered in BLOOD.

           Large, stunned cows swing in upside down on a conveyer. A 
           worker stabs a large knife into the chest of the cow. 

           Blood spurts out. 

           Another worker moves in with a vat on wheels. Collects the 
           blood. It’s messy, ugly work.

           The manager calls to the worker who stuck the cow.

                                 MANAGER
                        Rodrigo!

           He beckons him over. RODRIGO (50s) complies. He’s a grizzled, 
           hardened veteran.

                                 MANAGER (CONT'D)
                        Need you to show... Maria?

           He looks to Mari. Questioning.

                                 MARI
                        Mari.

                                 MANAGER
                        Right. Show her around. I want her 
                        on blood collection.

           Rodrigo’s not enthusiastic about the task but responds...

                                 RODRIGO
                        No problem, boss.

                                 MANAGER
                        Great. Thanks.

           Manager leaves. Doesn’t regard Mari further.

           Rodrigo leads Mari to the main killing area. Another COW 
           comes around.
                                 RODRIGO
                             (re: the vats)
                        Go grab one. Have it ready.

           Mari does as she’s told. 

                                 RODRIGO (CONT'D)
                        When I stick it, wheel that in. 
                        Quicker the better. Blood is money. 
                        Then lid it and get another.

           Rodrigo readies the KNIFE.

                                 RODRIGO (CONT'D)
                        Ready?

           Mari NODS.

           He STICKS the cow. Mari moves in behind him. Blood SPURTS out 
           in rooster tails. Covers Mari. Her white uniform. 

           Rodrigo LAUGHS.

                                 RODRIGO (CONT'D)
                        Beats the processing line.

           He holds up his hands. THREE FINGERS MISSING.

           Mari notices her KEY is poking out. She tries to shove it 
           back inside her uniform. It’s hard with bloody fingers.

                                 RODRIGO (CONT'D)
                        What’s that a key to?

           Mari watches the blood collect. She sees her own red 
           reflection shimmering back at her. Thinks of all she lost. 

                                 MARI
                             (sad, weary)
                        Nothing.

           He recognizes the pain in her eyes. Nods. But there’s a job 
           to do...

                                 RODRIGO (O.C.)
                        All right, that one’s done. Grab 
                        the next.

           Mari considers BLOODY REFLECTION for one beat longer. Then 
           slams a lid on the vat. Casting her reflection -- and us --
           into DARKNESS.

                                 THE END
