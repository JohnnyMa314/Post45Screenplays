           EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY - YEAR 2000

           CU: Two little kids’ flushed faces.

           JILL (10) stands before her crush, COLIN (10) by the water 
           fountain (where it all goes DOOWN in the school yard). 

                                 JILL
                             (quietly)
                        Are you ready?

                                 COLIN
                        I think so...

           They lean in slowly until - their lips touch. 

           They pull away. Forever CHANGED.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        That was-

                                 JILL
                        AWESOME.

           INT. SHAW HOUSEHOLD - DAY

           Jill speeds in like a bat outta hell. Flying past her DAD and 
           skipping up the stairs two at a time.

           INT. ISABELLE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jill busts into her sister’s bedroom, throwing down her 
           backpack dramatically. ISABELLE (8) is in bed, connected to 
           her portable oxygen tank.

                                 JILL
                        I DID it.

                                 ISABELLE
                        HOLY SHIT.

                                 JILL
                        It was weird and awesome and wet 
                        and weird and... Awesome.

           Isabelle shakes her head in awe.

                                 ISABELLE
                        Start from the top.
           EXT. SCHOOL YARD - THE NEXT DAY

           Jill chats with her GIRLFRIENDS, dressed in their Catholic 
           school uniforms. Yards away- a group of BOYS, including 
           Colin, are huddled up, snickering and glancing over at Jill. 
           SMOOTH, boys. They bust up laughing. Jill looks over- 
           realizing they’re talkin’ smack.

                                 BOY
                        Jill tastes like corn!!!

           The boys fall into hysterics. Jill walks straight up to the 
           line of boys- the Girls behind her, arms folded. She squares 
           up to Colin. (They’re the same height.) A standoff. 

           Colin evades eye contact. Too cool for school. (Figuratively, 
           not literally. They are currently at school).

                                 JILL
                        So. I guess you told everyone how 
                        you begged me to suck face. Classy.

           OOooooooo.

                                 COLIN
                        I’m not going to be your boyfriend, 
                        Jill. Calm down.

           OOOOOOOOOooooooo.

                                 JILL
                        Don’t FUH-LATTER yourself Colin 
                        Corwin! You’re the worst kisser of 
                        my LIFE. I regretted it the SECOND 
                        your slimy slug lips touched mine.

           Ooooooo DAAAAAANG!!! Sick burn, Jill.

           She flips her hair and spins around. Head held high. (Fake it 
           ‘til you make it). 

           Colin struggles to recover as Jill struts away.

                                 COLIN
                             (calling out)
                        Hey Jill- Does your sister taste 
                        like corn, too? Or just cancer!

           The crowd GASPS. DAAANG. COLD, Colin Corwin.

           Jill turns slowly back around. 

           The crowd waits - on pins and needles. Her blood boils as she 
           wracks her brain for a worthy comeback. 
           Nope. Doesn’t exist.

           She rushes him - tackling him to the ground. 

           A Chucky-faced LITTLE GINGER GIRL with pigtails and freckles 
           appears-

                                 LITTLE GINGER GIRL
                        FIIIIIIIIIIGHT!!!

           Jill straddles Colin- punching him while he shields his face 
           and the kids cheer.

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - LATER

           Jill and Colin sit, side by side, a chair between them- 
           staring straight ahead in the PRINCIPAL’s office, waiting for 
           their parents. A blotchy faced Colin holds an ice pack to his 
           eye. Whimpering.

                                 COLIN
                             (whispering)
                        You’re go-gonna be in s-so much 
                        trouble-

                                 PRINCIPAL
                             (stern warning)
                        MR. CORWIN.

           He continues whimpering. Jill doesn’t flinch - still staring 
           straight ahead.

                                 JILL
                        You cry like a lil bitch.

           INT. ISABELLE’S ROOM - LATER

           Isabelle eavesdrops as Jill gets reprimanded by MOM 
           downstairs.

                                 JILL O.S.
                        YOU said self-defense is not 
                        violence!!! 

                                 MOM O.S.
                        Do you know what self-defense is?!
                                 JILL O.S.
                        Well I’d do it again!!! I’m not 
                        sorry!!!

           Jill stamps up to her room and slams the door.

           INT. JILL’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jill sulks on her bed. A light knock on the door.

           Isabelle enters, moving with her portable oxygen 
           concentrator.

                                 ISABELLE
                        What happened? What did he say?

                                 JILL
                        Just something stupid. 

                                 ISABELLE
                        I’ll kill him. 
                        What did he say, Jilly?

                                 JILL
                        That I...Tasted like corn.

           Isabelle makes a face.

                                 ISABELLE
                        You don’t even like corn.

           Jill rolls her eyes.

                                 JILL
                        Boys are SO underdeveloped. 

           Jill flips on her back. Gazing up at the ceiling.

                                 ISABELLE
                        That’s not it. What did he say?

                                 JILL
                        That’s it-

                                 ISABELLE
                        It’s about me, wasn’t it? 

                                 JILL
                        NO.

                                 ISABELLE
                        You are the worst liar. 
                                 JILL
                        He asked if you tasted like cancer. 

                                 ISABELLE
                        ...That’s all? Cancer’s very hot 
                        right now. I wish! I’d rather have 
                        cancer than cystic fibrosis! You 
                        got yourself suspended over that? 

                                 JILL
                        Worth it.

                                 ISABELLE
                        You keep runnin’ that mouth you’re 
                        gonna be suspended your whole life, 
                        Jill Shaw!

                                 JILL
                        I don’t care.

           Isabelle senses Jill’s hurt.

                                 ISABELLE
                        Did he cry?

           Jill grins, busting up in giggles. She sits up.

                                 JILL
                        OK- so i’m talking to Greta and 
                        Ava. Minding my own business-

           Jill hops to her feet. Isabelle gets comfortable - ready for 
           the recap. She watches intently as Jill acts out the whole 
           scene. 

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                             (Performance voice)
                        “What are those neanderthals 
                        laughing about?”

           Play by play. 

           OFF Isabelle grinning -  living through Jill’s eyes. 

           INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT - 2003

           Jill, 13, is slow dancing (to Usher’s “U Got It Bad”, 
           obviously) with a JUNIOR HIGH BOY. (Leaving enough room 
           between them for Jesus). 
                                 JUNIOR HIGH BOY
                        Uh...Jill?..I wanted to tell 
                        you...I think you’re really pretty 
                        and...uh-

           Over the loud speakers, the slow dance ends and in comes 
           Robyn: “Show Me Love.”

           Jill SHRIEKS!!!

                                 JILL
                        Oh my GOD! It’s Robyn!!!! Oh my GOD- 
                        could you hold that thought for one 
                        sec?

           She rushes over to the coat check, grabbing her clutch and 
           pulling out a huge ass cell phone. She dials - rushing back 
           towards the dance floor.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Izzy!!! Listen!!! It’s Robyn!!!

           She sticks the phone in the air as she rocks out alone-

           INT. ISABELLE'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Isabelle listens on the other end of the line - a smile 
           spreading on her face despite looking very sick. She bops her 
           head and sings along. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - 2006

           Jill (16) and a HIGH SCHOOL BOY are making out, dressed in 
           prom attire. She reaches her hand slowly over to his lap.

           He promptly climaxes. In his pants. Oh. She stares at his 
           lap.

                                 HIGH SCHOOL BOY
                        Sorry...

                                 JILL
                        Was...That it?

                                 HIGH SCHOOL BOY
                        I..think so. Sorry.

                                 JILL
                        Oh! Ok. Cool! 

           She gets up.
                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Well, thank you for the Godiva 
                        strawberries!

           She grabs her purse.

                                 HIGH SCHOOL BOY
                        Are you leaving?

                                 JILL
                        ..Yeah?

                                 HIGH SCHOOL BOY
                        You didn’t want to...

           He trails off.

                                 JILL
                        Oh! Like cuddle?

                                 HIGH SCHOOL BOY
                        Yeah?

                                 JILL
                        Did...You need to?

                                 HIGH SCHOOL BOY
                        I... guess not. You?

                                 JILL
                        Nah, I’m good, but thanks!

           She grabs her heels.

                                 HIGH SCHOOL BOY
                             (calling out)
                        Where are you going?

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Isabelle can’t stop laughing. They eat dumplings with 
           chopsticks in her hospital bed - Jill still dressed in her 
           prom gown. 

                                 ISABELLE
                        Well, good. You didn’t really want 
                        to lose your virginity to him 
                        anyway. It’s supposed to be like 
                        The Notebook.

                                 JILL
                        The Notebook... It was not.
                                 ISABELLE
                        Well you looked like Allie: 
                        Timeless.

                                 JILL
                        Awwww.

           She hugs her. 

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        If you’re a bird, I’m a bird.

           Meanwhile in the hallway...

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           A DOCTOR delivers serious news to Mom and Dad. 

           Mom nods, tears in her eyes. She peers into the hospital room 
           through a glass window.

           Jill puts on Isabelle’s concentration oxygen mask. She walks 
           in slow motion with her arms extended, like an astronaut 
           walking on the moon. Isabelle can’t breathe she’s laughing so 
           hard. Happy. Oblivious.

           Her Mom shakes her head, with a smile. Their bond- something 
           else.

           INT. CAR - LATE NIGHT - 2007

           Jill, 17, drives shittily down the road with her shiny new 
           driver’s permit, swerving slightly, slurping on a Baja Blast 
           Freeze. Taco Bell wrappers litter the car. Isabelle sticks 
           her body out of the sun roof. Robyn BLARING. Arms in the air.

                                 ISABELLE
                        WOOO!!! I’m the king of the 
                        world!!!!

           Jill grins. The soda in Isabelle’s hand spills on Jill’s 
           shoulder.

                                 JILL
                        Ahhh!!! IZZY!!!!

           INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Jill gets scolded in the kitchen by the parentals. 
                                 DAD
                        A permit is NOT a license. You 
                        could have killed somebody! 

           Jill nods her head, agreeably. Yes, she definitely could’ve.

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                        ...This is the part where you say 
                        you understand what you did and 
                        you’re sorry for putting everyone 
                        in danger?

                                 JILL
                        Not gonna lie to you, Dad...It was 
                        epic. And I proudly accept any and 
                        all punishment.

           Jill takes a bow. Isabelle bursts into laughter. 

                                 DAD
                        Don’t bow. Stop it.

           Isabelle cheers for Jill and all her irresponsibility.

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                        No. Bad. Stop.
                        You two...Go to your rooms.

                                 JILL
                        Yes, Padre.

           Isabelle slow claps her out, following after her. Mom hugs 
           Dad as he shakes his head, frustratedly. 

                                 DAD
                        Why didn’t we have boys?

           INT. JILL’S ROOM - NEW YEAR’S EVE 2008

           Jill, 18, does her makeup in the mirror. She is dolled up in 
           a glittery dress and heels.

                                 MOM
                        It’s your last New Years with us- 
                        do you NEED to go out? I’m sure 
                        Izzy-

                                 ISABELLE
                             (embarrassed)
                        Mom, stop-
                                 JILL
                        It’s my last New Years with my 
                        friends. Izzy doesn’t care - right?

           Jill turns to Isabelle who shakes her head sheepishly, “no.” 

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        See?

           Mom bites her tongue. Jill kisses them both goodbye. 

                                 MOM
                        Be safe.

                                 JILL
                        I will!

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT - NEW YEAR’S EVE 2008

           Jill, in a glittery cardboard crown that says “HAPPY NEW 
           YEAR!!!” sips on jungle juice out of a red solo cup while a 
           DRUNK GUY hangs on her.

                                 PARTY GUY
                        15 minutes, bitches!!!

           The room cheers.

                                 DRUNK GUY
                             (slurred)
                        I like your nose.

           He spits all over her as he talks. She squints- blinking out 
           the saliva attack. Jill looks around. Drunk kids making out. 
           Dancing on the sofa to Flo Rida. Trashing some rich parent’s 
           house. The DRUNK GUY goes in for the kill - Jill turns her 
           face. 

                                 JILL
                        I gotta go.

           As she steps away, the Drunk Guy loses his balance, 
           collapsing onto the floor.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Jill struggles to hail a cab in the frigid New York air.

                                 JILL
                        TAXI!!!
           It’s not happening. She looks around - thinking fast. She 
           clocks the street signs and starts RUNNING in her dress and 
           heels and coat. SPRINTING as the final minutes of the year 
           pass by.

           INT. JILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jill bursts through the front door, breathlessly. Her parents 
           and Izzy are on the couch cheering. The ball just dropped!

                                 MOM
                        Jilly!

                                 ISABELLE
                        What’re you doing here?

           Jill squeezes Isabelle, falling on the couch and covering her 
           face with kisses. She giggles.

                                 ISABELLE (CONT’D)
                        AHHH!!! Stage five clinger!!!

           EXT. CBS LOT - LOS ANGELES -  DAY - 2014

           Jill (23) rushes through the CBS studio lot past actor 
           trailers, golf carts and PA’s. She struggles to balance two 
           trays of coffee in her hands and the phone against her ear. 

                                 JILL
                        Izzy- I’m so sorry I’m missing 
                        Xmas. They won’t let me go and - PS 
                        it’s literally 100 degrees here - 
                        and I’ve figured out why- because I 
                        am in hell. 

           INT. ISABELLE'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Back home in New York, Isabelle puts down her cell. Bummed. 

           Suddenly - music in the air - growing in volume. Coming from 
           the hallway. 

           Jill BURSTS into the room- luggage in hand. Mom smiles in the 
           doorway.

                                 ISABELLE
                        HOLY SHIT!!!

           Jill’s iPhone bumps that Robyn. Jill mouths the words, 
           jumping on Isabelle’s bed. She pulls Izzy up, they dance and 
           hop on the bed like little girls. 
           Mom starts to protest. She gives up immediately. She knows 
           better than to interfere with a Robyn dance party. 

           EXT. BAR - NIGHT - TODAY

           Jill (28) is seated, sipping on a vodka soda. Nodding as her 
           date, SCOTT (20s) - talks work. She forces a smile, painfully 
           distracted. He’s great looking, except for one small detail: 
           his right EYE- half open, bloodshot and oozing a yellowy-
           milky discharge. She nods, struggling not to stare.

                                 SCOTT
                        You’re looking at my eye, huh?

                                 JILL
                             (innocently)
                        ...Your eye?

                                 SCOTT
                        I know...It looks gnarly- 

                                 JILL
                        No, no-

                                 SCOTT
                        I look like Sloth from Goonies.

           He chuckles. 

                                 JILL
                        I didn’t even notice until you 
                        brought it up... 

           Terrible lie. He wipes at his Sloth eye. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Don’t worry, it’s just pink eye. 

           He wipes his goopy hand on his pants.

                                 JILL
                        Umm. I’m pretty sure pink eye is, 
                        like, super contagious-

                                 SCOTT
                        Nah. That’s a common misconception.

                                 JILL
                        NO, really. I think-

                                 SCOTT
                        Nah- that’s something made up by 
                        big Pharma.
           He grins at her.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Your eyes, on the other hand- are 
                        super beautiful...

           His pink eye hand goes to brush the hair out of her face. 
           It’s like a slo-mo fever dream- 

           No, NO- 
           NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-

           INT. UBER - NIGHT

           Jill squirms in the backseat of an uber, covering her face in 
           hand sanitizer while leaving a message. 

                                 JILL
                        ISABELLE. He shows up with this 
                        oozy, Krusty the Klown eyeball- he 
                        has PINK EYE. And he’s rubbing it, 
                        getting the goop everywhere and 
                        then he rubbed butt particles on my 
                        face! My face is a butthole!!! 

           The uber DRIVER promptly rolls down the windows.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        I for SURE have pink eye- and now I 
                        only have one choice. I’m gonna 
                        have to off myself.  

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Isabelle listens to the voicemail in the dark. Just lit by 
           the glow of the phone screen. Giggling. 

                                 JILL V.O.
                        Goodbye cruel world! I love you. 
                        Call me tomorrow!

           Pull out to reveal - Isabelle is in a hospital bed in the 
           ICU. She smiles.

           INT. WRITER’S ROOM - DAY

           Jill passes out coffee to the room of MALE WRITERS at work. 
           Livin that glam Hollywood dream as a staff writer on a shitty 
           YA soap on the CW. A small tantrum is being thrown by the 
           showrunner- JAY (40s, white, skyrocketed to the top thanks to 
           a combination of talent, hard work and sacrifice. Haha Jk- 
           his Dad has an Oscar). 

                                 JAY
                        Nothing. Nobody has ANYTHING? 

           MARK - The Executive Producer and Jay’s right hand, pipes up.

                                 MARK
                        She could jump off an overpass?

                                 JAY
                        She would be hideous. Women don’t 
                        do that. They want to die 
                        beautiful. Everybody knows that. 
                        Come ON, people. 

           He crumples a Starbucks cup in his hand, throwing it at the 
           wastebasket. Missing by a mile.

           Mark shrinks. The room is silent.

           This is her chance. THIS IS IT. C’mon, Jill.

                                 JILL
                        Ummm. I’ve got an idea?

           Everyone in the room - 7 men - turn their heads and stare. 
           Her pits start sweating.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        What if... She didn’t kill herself 
                        because Lincoln left her? What if 
                        instead- she decides the best 
                        revenge is success so...She 
                        rebuilds. And in the process of 
                        trying to win him back - she 
                        realizes she doesn’t need him. 

           Their expressions - like she just revealed a small head 
           growing on her neck.
                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        You know- actually- nevermind. 
                        That’s not... I’ll just not say 
                        anything else-

           Jay lifts a finger, closing his eyes.

                                 JAY
                        No. Wait... I’m having... That 
                        actually gives me an idea...It’s 
                        coming... 

           He puts a finger to his lips.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        WHAT IF: instead of suicide- which 
                        is so... Shakespearean: old, 
                        boring, derivative - she DECIDES to 
                        be alone. SINGLE. And through 
                        standing on her own two feet, she 
                        is empowered. She is WHOLE. 

           The room erupts in nods, “YES”’s and “excellent”’s. 

                                 MALE WRITER
                        Feminism. #MeToo. #TimesUp. It’s 
                        very topical. Edgy.

           Jill stares as the room verbally jerks Jay off. 

                                 JILL PRE-LAP
                        I’m living in the Handmaids Tale. 

           INT. JILL’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Jill enters her small, Beachwood Canyon studio apartment - 
           chatting with Isabelle on her phone.

                                 ISABELLE
                        You are. They are going to tear 
                        that biracial child from your 
                        breast and give it new parents.

                                 JILL
                        Exactly.  

           Jill collapses on her bed.

           Intercut Phone Conversation
           INT. ISABELLE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Isabelle (20s) looks pale. Thin.

                                 ISABELLE
                        Stick to the plan, bucko! Move to 
                        Cali, grind like Shonda Rhimes, buy 
                        a big mansion that we can both live 
                        in, conquer the world.

                                 JILL
                        Ok, ok- I’m on it, bucko. You know 
                        what I’d kill for right now? Joe’s 
                        Shanghai! 

                                 ISABELLE
                        Mmmmm soup dumplings heal all.

                                 JILL
                        You can’t get them here. You have 
                        to drive an hour to a distant land 
                        called “Arcadia.”

                                 ISABELLE
                        Whack.

                                 JILL
                        Guess what? I’m going out with 
                        Personal Trainer Chad tomorrow!

                                 ISABELLE
                        Sick. The one that sends you 
                        unsolicited nudes from the gym 
                        bathroom?

                                 JILL
                        That’s called dating in LA. 

           Jill looks at the clock.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Oh crap. It’s 1am over there.

                                 ISABELLE
                        Yeah- I’m going. But... I gotta 
                        tell you somethin.
                        Don’t freak out. 

                                 JILL
                        WHAT.

                                 ISABELLE
                        Test results came back.
           Jill sits up.

                                 JILL
                        When?

                                 ISABELLE
                        Today.

                                 JILL
                        Why didn’t you call me?!

                                 ISABELLE
                        I did. Just now.

                                 JILL
                        Ok- Well...?

                                 ISABELLE
                        They’re gonna run some more 
                        tomorrow but...It’s- you know. It’s 
                        not good! It’s lookin pretty dire!

           Isabelle laughs darkly.

                                 JILL
                        Well we already know they don’t 
                        know what they’re talking about. 

           Isabelle nods. 

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        They’ve been wrong every step of 
                        the way and you’re fine because 
                        you’re a superhero. Have they still 
                        not figured that out?

           Isabelle smiles. Her eyes fill. She takes a second to swallow 
           it down.

                                 ISABELLE
                        I guess not.

           Jill can hear it in her voice. She can feel it.

                                 JILL
                        I’m coming home. I’ll check flights 
                        right now-

                                 ISABELLE
                        No, no-

                                 JILL
                        Not because of the tests. Because I 
                        miss you. Because I want to see you-
                                 ISABELLE
                        You just got this job. They aren’t 
                        going to let you leave right now. 
                        And you’ll be home in less than 
                        three weeks for Turkey-  

                                 JILL
                        I’ll just go for the weekend- 

                                 ISABELLE
                        I’m fine, stop. 
                        You’re not going to be Shonda by 
                        flying home every time the doctors 
                        give us shitty news. I’ll see you 
                        in three weeks.

                                 JILL
                        But-

                                 ISABELLE
                        Jill. You’re being so dramatic. I 
                        told you not to freak out. This is 
                        not A Walk to Remember. 

                                 JILL
                        Fine. Three weeks. Turkey.

                                 ISABELLE
                        Yep. Love you.

                                 JILL
                        Love you. Call me.

                                 ISABELLE
                        K. Night.

           Jill hangs up the phone. She curls into a ball and fights the 
           tears. 

           INT. BAR - THE FOLLOWING NIGHT

                                 CHAD
                        Quads – squats, lunges, one legged 
                        squats, box jumps.

           Jill sits across from CHAD (20s, deep like a kiddie pool, was 
           a contestant on The Bachelorette but never made it past the 
           first rose ceremony) at a trendy Hollywood bar. 

                                 CHAD (CONT’D)
                        Butt and Hamstrings – hip raises, 
                        deadlifts- Straight leg 
                        deadlifts...
           Jill nods, taking a huge gulp of her wine. She’s far too 
           sober for this.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Jill pulls out her phone - HOLY HELL. Isabelle is gonna love 
           this shit. 

           Her screen reveals: 3 missed calls. A voicemail from MOM.

           Jill’s face drops as she presses play. 

                                 MOM (V.O.)
                        Jill. You need to come home. Right 
                        now. Call me when you get this. 
                        It’s your sister-

           OFF Jill as all the blood drains from her face.

           INT. UBER - NIGHT

           Jill sits in the backseat of an uber - She dials and redials. 
           Freaking out. She speaks to the DRIVER-

                                 JILL
                        Yes - LAX - thank you. And if you 
                        could just- as soon as possible 
                        please, I’m sorry, it’s---- MOM?! 

           She listens carefully.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Ok. Ok. I’m on my way to the 
                        airport right now. I’ll get on a 
                        redeye. It’s ok. She’s going to be 
                        ok. No, no- she’s fine. Just tell 
                        her I’ll be there soon. ok? Tell 
                        her I’ll be right there. 

           INT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL - EARLY MORNING

           Jill rushes through the halls of a busy hospital- still in 
           her date dress. She spots her Mom down the hall. Ashen. 

                                 JILL
                        MOM! I’m here, I’m here. Where is 
                        she??
           Her Mom moves towards her, a look of shell shock. She hugs 
           her. 

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        What’s happening? How is she?

           Her Mom shakes her head.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Just tell me-  What are they 
                        saying, Mom? 
                        MOM. 

                                 MOM
                        She... Didn’t make it, honey. Izzy 
                        didn’t make it.

                                 JILL
                        What’re you talking about?
                        I’m here. Where is she?

           Mom’s face creases with concern. Jill steps away.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Mom. WHERE is she?

                                 MOM
                        Jill. Honey-

           Jill starts rushing through the hallway. Peering through each 
           doorway-

                                 JILL
                             (calling out)
                        Isabelle!

                                 MOM
                        Jill-

                                 JILL
                        Isabelle!!! I’m here-

           Her Mom reaches her - catching her as her legs weaken and her 
           breath is knocked out. The shock hitting her suddenly and 
           forcefully like a semi truck.

           INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

           Jill stands at a podium dressed in black. She looks like a 
           different person - the life sucked out. She clears her throat 
           loudly and crinkles pages.
                                 JILL
                        I have this image in my head of 
                        Izzy and I. We were those two kids 
                        in a trench coat, stacked on top of 
                        each other. I’m standing on her 
                        shoulders, we’re wobbling around in 
                        a fedora and sunglasses-- trying to 
                        pass for a grown up... Like in Hook- 
                        or Little Rascals.
                        She was the legs, and I was the 
                        eyes. I’d see everything and report 
                        back... 
                        But she never got to actually see 
                        anything for herself.   
                        Still- she never complained. Not 
                        about the machines, the 
                        homeschooling - all the pain and 
                        scary close calls. 
                        Izzy was the strong one. She was 
                        the brave one. She was like this 
                        tiny Yoda. She believed in the 
                        universe - and angels. “Helpers.” 
                        Really hippie dippy frou frou, 
                        Burning Man stuff. She believed in 
                        an order of things. I guess that’s 
                        how she made sense of all this crap 
                        that makes NO frickin sense. 

           She shakes her head. 

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Right now, I could poke all kinds 
                        of holes in the universe theory. I 
                        could talk some MAD smack on this 
                        “universe”. I want to.
                        But I’m not going to. Not today. 
                        TODAY - I’m gonna try to make 
                        lemonade. Like Izzy... And Beyoncé. 
                        So- here’s what I’ve got: Isabelle 
                        could have been alive at any time 
                        in history. A thousand years ago. 
                        Or a thousand years from now. And 
                        what are the chances- that in all 
                        of time and space and humanity--
                        She was alive...With us? With me. 
                        And not only did she and I MEET, 
                        but we got to have pancakes 
                        together and wiggle out our baby 
                        teeth and get in trouble for 
                        staying up late on school nights 
                        talking about JTT... We got to be 
                        sisters.
                        And EVEN if it was short. Even if 
                        it was nowhere NEAR enough time.... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        That’s LUCKY. That’s lemonade and 
                        limoncello and lemon cake and all 
                        the other good lemon things 
                        combined. 
                        SO in my little sister’s honor --- 
                        don’t try to stop me, Mom, I 
                        promised Izzy a long time ago I’d 
                        do this--- 
                        I’m going to perform one of her 
                        favorite movie scenes. Earmuffs, 
                        Gram.

           Before her Mom can protest- Jill steps away from the podium 
           and dives into a re-enactment of the poop scene from 
           Bridesmaids.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        No! No Megan! No! 
                        LOOK AWAY!!!! 
                        No Megan!!! LOOOOOK AWAYYY!!!

           NO ONE. Laughs.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        It’s coming out of me like LAVA!!!!

           Grandma stares in horror. Mom covers her face, mortified. Dad 
           shakes his head. Goddamnit, Jill.

           INT. SHAW HOUSEHOLD - DAY

           Time lapse as Jill hangs around Isabelle’s room like a ghost. 
           There is a light knock on the door.

                                 MOM
                        Turkey’s ready, honey.

                                 JILL
                        Not hungry, Mom.

           Jill stares at the snow falling on the window pane. 

           ANOTHER DAY... 

           Jill watches Scandal on the flatscreen.

           Her Mom and Dad enter, solemn-faced.

                                 MOM
                        Jill. It’s time to go. 
                                 JILL
                        Go where?

                                 MOM
                        Back to California. Back to your 
                        job. Your life.

                                 JILL
                        You’re kicking me out while I’m 
                        grieving? 

                                 MOM
                        No. Never. We’re just making you 
                        leave. Immediately. 

                                 DAD
                        Making you get your things and go. 
                        Now. Right now.

                                 JILL
                        How is that-

                                 MOM
                        Yes. We’re kicking you out. Because 
                        Isabelle would have weeks ago.

           Jill stares. 

                                 JILL
                        Damn. Cold. 

           EXT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY

           Dad pulls out Jill’s luggage from the trunk of the car, 
           handing it to her.

                                 JILL
                        Can’t I live in your basement and 
                        adopt 16 cats?

                                 DAD
                        Maybe in a couple years.

           Mom and Dad circle her in a hug. She nods and heads inside. 

           EXT. LOS ANGELES ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

           A shot of palm trees, the blue sky and the blazing sun.

           Super:                   January
           INT. JILL’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Jill arrives to her LA apartment. She drops her bags.

           Dead flowers and a pile of sympathy cards await her on the 
           kitchen counter. She climbs into bed with her phone. She 
           presses play on an old voicemail from Izzy.

                                 ISABELLE V.O.
                        Bucko! We miss you here on Whore 
                        Island! 

           INT. WRITER’S ROOM - DAY

           Jill’s boss welcomes Jill back, warmly.

                                 JAY
                        We’re glad to have you back, Jill.

           Jay leans in for a hug then-

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Ooops, NOPE, just kidding-

           He gives her an awkward handshake/high five thing.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t want to lose my career for 
                        touching you! We were sorry to hear 
                        about your sister. We can name a 
                        character after her! What was her 
                        name?

                                 JILL
                        Isabelle.

                                 JAY
                        Maybe the stripper with the heart 
                        of gold Or - OH- the secretary?

                                 JILL
                        The one sleeping her way to the 
                        top?

                                 JAY
                        She’s a career woman. Look 
                        everyone, Jill’s back!

           Everyone applauds. Jill smiles, thinly.

           -Jill sits in bumper to bumper LA traffic

           -Jill spaces out at work. The light in her eyes - dimmed. 

           -Jill swipes on Tinder: Guy with dog, guy with dog, guy with 
           dog, gym selfie, guy with dog...

           - Jill goes on a date with a guy with so much work done he 
           resembles Joan Rivers

           -Jill listens to old voicemails from Isabelle

           -Jill looks out at the LA night from her secret mountaintop 
           lookout point

           -Jill watches in horror as her (much older) date cuts up her 
           chicken into little pieces. He feeds her like a child - even

           -Jill eats Chinese takeout alone in bed

           -Jill watches Scandal

           to pay for it. Jill who? 

           -Jill scrolls through pics of her and Isabelle on her phone. 
           A text comes in from PERSONAL TRAINER CHAD. He wears a shirt

           INT. VERIZON STORE - NEW YORK - DAY

           Somewhere in uptown Manhattan...A commercial real estate 
           agent AUSTIN (30s, a panty dropper, could sell gluten to a 
           millennial) is handed a new iPhone. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Thanks a lot, man.

           INT. NEW YORK HIGH RISE - DAY

           Austin walks around a sleek office space. A group of all-
           business, intimidating, Japanese men in SUITS follow him as 
           well as his assistant, JESSA.
                                 AUSTIN
                        Postmodernist style tower with a 
                        granite curtain wall façade--

           The mechanical curtains open-

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        A view of Times Square, Central 
                        Park...

           The SUITS privately whisper to MR. SHIMOSAWA, who is clearly 
           the Mr. Moneybags decision-maker. He nods, stoic.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Centrally located and
                        around the corner from Columbus 
                        Circle. 

           Mr. Shimosawa scans the room, unimpressed. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                             (perfect pronunciation)
                        And, Mr. Shimosawa - anata to 
                        shigoto o suru koto wa meiyodesu.
                             (bows)
                        Go-kento o onegai shimasu.

           Suddenly, Mr. Shimosawa lights up.

                                 MR. SHIMOSAWA
                        Nihongo o hanasu shito! Watashi wa 
                        anata ga tenkei-dekina baka no 
                        amerikahitoda to omottaga, ima wa 
                        subete o torimodosu!

           Austin stares. Mr. Shimosawa belly laughs, patting him on the 
           back. Austin joins in, chuckling.

                                 MR. SHIMOSAWA (CONT’D)
                        Kono tatemono wa utsukushiku, 
                        watashi wa anata ga sukidesu. Sore 
                        ga keiyakuda. Arigatgozaimashita.

           Mr. Shimosawa bows, deeply. Austin returns the bow, 
           respectfully. They shake hands.

                                 AUSTIN
                        I’ll have Jessa send over 
                        paperwork!

           The group of suits beams. Exchanging celebratory bows and 
           handshakes. Austin grins. Jessa leans in.
                                 JESSA
                             (a whisper)
                        I didn’t know you spoke Japanese! 
                        What did he say?

                                 AUSTIN
                        No idea. I only memorized two 
                        sentences. 

           Jessa shakes her head. He turns this shit into an art form.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Jill is seated with Chad at a party. Yep, THAT Chad. Music 
           blares while ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE stare at each other and their 
           phones.

                                 CHAD
                        You sorta fell off the planet...

                                 JILL
                        Yeah...I know. My sister sorta... 
                        died. 

                                 CHAD
                        Oh dang!

                                 JILL
                        Yeah. Sorry, didn’t mean to kill 
                        the VIIIBE.

                                 CHAD
                        That’s sad.

                                 JILL
                        Thanks. So...How have you been?

           His face lights up.

                                 CHAD
                        GREAT. I’ve been AMAZING.

           Jill nods. Coool. 

           LATER...

           They make out - drunken and sloppy. F*** it. 

           He pulls away. Red lipstick all over their faces. 

                                 CHAD
                        So...I just want to be translucent-
                                 JILL
                        Transparent.

                                 CHAD
                        That too. I’m not looking for a 
                        serious girlfriend right now... I’m 
                        down to, like, hang...But not for 
                        anything intense. You know like- 
                        Dinner...or...Breakfast...

                                 JILL
                        Or lunch.

                                 CHAD
                        Or like...Phone calls...Texting 
                        complete sentences..

                                 JILL
                        Talking in general...

                                 CHAD
                        Right. But I AM down for...

                                 JILL
                        Penetration.

                                 CHAD
                        YES.

                                 JILL
                        You know, Chad - I think we are on 
                        EXACTLY the same page.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHAD’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Chad can’t stop checking himself out in the mirror while 
           penetrating Jill in various positions. He arches his back - 
           flexing and posing. He delivers his own low-rent version of 
           Blue Steel. Jill tries not to notice. Why does this feel like 
           a really grueling pilates class? 

           INT. UBER - LATE NIGHT

           Jill sits in the back of an uber. Hair a shit show- red 
           lipstick all over her face. She looks out the window, her 
           heels on the seat next to her. The UBER DRIVER (23) jams out 
           to Bollywood music. 
                                 JILL
                        Sorry - actually--- Can we make a 
                        stop?

           INT. NEW YORK RESTAURANT - NIGHT - MEANWHILE

           BRITTANI (20s, rail thin, model-y) passive aggressively sips 
           on her soda water in silence. Before her, Austin obliviously 
           drinks his beer while taking peeks at the football game.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Hungry?

                                 BRITTANI
                        No.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Oh right, you still starving 
                        yourself?

                                 BRITTANI
                        It’s called FASTING. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Ahh-

                                 BRITTANI
                        I’m DONE.

                                 AUSTIN
                        With your soda water?

                                 BRITTANI
                        With us. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        ...We just met.

                                 BRITTANI
                        We’ve been having sex for 6 months!

           He squints. That can’t be right. 

                                 BRITTANI (CONT’D)
                        You’re gorgeous, Austin, and you 
                        are GREAT in bed-

           He smiles proudly, aww shucks. 

                                 BRITTANI (CONT’D)
                        But you have the emotional maturity 
                        of a Seth Rogen character. 
                                 AUSTIN
                        I love Seth Rogen.

                                 BRITTANI
                        A Seth Rogen character. The ACTOR 
                        Seth Rogen has been with his WIFE 
                        for 15 years.

                                 AUSTIN
                        ...Really?

                                 BRITTANI
                        You’re a cliché, Austin. You chased 
                        me like I was Sophia Loren then the 
                        moment I stopped running, you began 
                        taking 6 hours to respond to my 
                        texts. I want a MAN not a man-
                        child!

                                 AUSTIN
                             (sincere)
                        And you deserve that.

                                 BRITTANI
                        Just ADMIT that you are emotionally 
                        inept and shouldn’t be dating.

                                 AUSTIN
                        I...Don’t think I’m emotionally 
                        inept-

                                 BRITTANI
                        Your eyes glaze over and you black 
                        out anytime I try to talk to you 
                        about anything REAL.

           He stares- eyes glazed over, blacked the F out.

                                 BRITTANI (CONT’D)
                        Austin!

                                 AUSTIN
                        Huh?

                                 BRITTANI
                        You are like a parody of a man. 
                        You’re like an alien sent to earth 
                        to mimic a human man, and doing a 
                        shitty job.
           EXT. LOS ANGELES OVERLOOK - NIGHT

           Jill stumbles out of the uber, still in her dress and heels,  
           holding a small, brown paper bag. 

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Ummm are you sure this is the right 
                        spot? 

                                 JILL
                        Yep - Thank you! 

           He looks around.

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        You might get murdered...

           He chuckles.

                                 JILL
                        Very possible! Peace be with you!

           She gives him a thumbs up.

           Jill seats herself on a rock. Overlooking the sparkling 
           lights of the city. She unscrews the bottle in the paper bag. 
           She takes a swig. Almost pukes. Yum.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Smooth.

           She looks out over the city. Vast. Full of tiny dogs and 
           vegans and Priuses. She pulls out her phone, a little tipsed. 
           She dials Isabelle.

           INT. NEW YORK RESTAURANT - NIGHT

                                 BRITTANI
                        I am ENOUGH!!! I deserve somebody 
                        who know how to LOVE-

           Austin nods as his phone buzzes. An unknown number. He stares 
           at it. His fingers inch towards it.

                                 BRITTANI (CONT’D)
                        DO NOT answer that-

                                 AUSTIN
                        I wasn’t going to...I just..I got a 
                        new number today...

           His fingers keep inching. Brittani grabs the phone and 
           declines the call.
           EXT. LOS ANGELES OVERLOOK - NIGHT

           BEEEEP.

                                 JILL
                             (slurry)
                        Heeeey.
                        So...I just left Personal Trainer 
                        Chad’s. I know you think he’s dumb 
                        but after tonight... I have come to 
                        the realization that he may be 
                        intellectually disabled. 
                        And I boned him! WOOO! Boom chicka 
                        WA WAAAA. Standards are for boring 
                        people.
                        Except- I’m not entirely sure he 
                        knew we were having sex. He 
                        basically used my body as a shake 
                        weight.

           She sighs. 

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        “Jill, is this a cry for help” - 
                        you ask? Ding ding ding!! YES. Yes, 
                        it is, bucko.
                             (tiny, Gollum voice)
                        “Help me! Heeeelp me, Isabelle!” 
                        That was my vagina talking.

           She takes another swig.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        I am sitting on a rock, drinking 6 
                        dollar whiskey out of a paper bag 
                        like a low life, looking out at the 
                        picturesque LA skyline and thinking 
                        - WOW this is a huge city full of 
                        very beautiful, very hungry people! 
                        And... I’m missing you. 

           Her eyes tear. Damnit. 

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        If only somebody in this city ate 
                        Chinese food! Or danced. At 
                        parties, everyone just stands 
                        around, staring at each other. It’s 
                        like fifth grade all over again... 

           She chuckles and wipes at her face.
                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        I love you, Izzy. You’re such a 
                        bitch for leaving before I could 
                        tell you that... 
                        Call me!

           She smiles slightly as she hangs up. SHIT- felt kinda good. 
           She takes another swig from her bottle.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET - LATER

           Austin finishes listening to the voicemail on the New York 
           street. He smiles. Laughing to himself. How embarrassing for 
           her. Brittani comes outside. She stares at him - eyes ablaze.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Hey. So...Back to my place?

           She storms off down the street. Guess not. 

           INT. WRITER’S ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Jill looks a hot mess: Head pounding, stomach turning, makeup-
           less, wearing a mumu. Hung the F over. 

                                 JAY
                        What do you think, Jill?

                                 JILL
                        Huh? What?

           Jill almost has a stroke. Did he just...Ask for her opinion?

                                 JAY
                        The secretary character. She’s not 
                        working. She’s...Missing something.

                                 MARK
                        I can’t quite put a finger on it...

           All the Men stare into the ether, wracking their brains. 

                                 JAY
                        What do you think she’s missing, 
                        Jill?

                                 JILL
                        Ummm- well- Maybe....A backstory. 
                        Or...a single, defining 
                        characteristic. Or like... You 
                        know.. A name...
           All the men stare.

                                 JAY
                        Interesting. You know what? Mark 
                        send the draft to Jill and have her 
                        punch up the secretary.

                                 MARK
                        I can handle that, actually-

                                 JAY
                        Have Jill do it. 

           His phone alarm goes off.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Alright- what’s for lunch?

           Mark tightens, biting his lip. Jill’s jaw is dropped.

           INT. CAFE - DAY

           Jill types on her laptop in a busy cafe. The WAITRESS opens 
           up her pad.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Hi, what can I get you?

                                 JILL
                        Hey -

           A lightbulb goes off in the Waitress’ head.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Oh my god.  You went on that awful 
                        date with that guy who cut up your 
                        chicken-

                                 JILL
                        WOW! You have a good memory!

                                 WAITRESS
                        What happened there?

                                 JILL
                        When I told him I just wanted to be 
                        friends he literally texted me- 
                        “You will never work in this town 
                        again.”

                                 WAITRESS
                        WOW. 
                                 JILL
                        Like a villain in a shitty B movie 
                        played by Michael Madsen. And 
                        believe it or not, he’s looking 
                        pretty good at this point. I may 
                        hit him up for a second date.

           Jill chuckles. The Waitress looks horrified. The GUY at the 
           table over smiles- trying not to eavesdrop.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        That was...a joke. I’ve pretty much 
                        sworn off men at this point. I’m on 
                        a dick cleanse. Giving lesbianism a 
                        try. But they tell me, you’ve kinda 
                        gotta be BORN that way, so it’s not 
                        looking too promising. I may just 
                        spend the rest of my life a 
                        closeted straight. Forever a 
                        bridesmaid with cats. Who needs 
                        romance? Overrated. I mean look 
                        outside, it’s sunny and beautiful 
                        ALWAYS and I’m alive and healthy 
                        and I’m here with you, and-

                                 WAITRESS
                        I’m married.

                                 JILL
                        Oh that’s... Good for you!

                                 WAITRESS
                        Did you know what you wanted?

                                 JILL
                        I’ll just have a mocha please, 
                        thanks.

           The waitress takes the menu and walks away like she just 
           witnessed a car crash.  

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        Ever been stood up?

           Jill turns- The guy at the table over, *British* and dreamy 
           AF, smiles. This is TYLER.

                                 JILL
                        What?

                                 TYLER
                        Overheard your conversation. So 
                        I’ll see your nightmare date and 
                        raise you- ever been stood up?  
                                 JILL
                        Not yet, actually! 
                        So I still have that to look 
                        forward to.

                                 TYLER
                        Well then, I have you beat.

                                 JILL
                        You got stood up?

                                 TYLER
                        I am CURRENTLY being stood up. 

                                 JILL
                        Oh NO. For a DAY date?  

                                 TYLER
                        Rough, right?

                                 JILL
                        Eeek. Did you call her?

                                 TYLER
                        Twice. Straight to voicemail.

                                 JILL
                        Maybe she’s running late and her 
                        phone’s dead. 

                                 TYLER
                        Forty minutes late?

                                 JILL
                        It’s LA! Maybe she doesn’t have a 
                        car charger?

                                 TYLER
                        Who doesn’t have a car charger? We 
                        live in our cars. 

                                 JILL
                        I’m tryin’, man...

                                 TYLER
                        I do appreciate it.

                                 JILL
                        Well, her loss.

           He smiles.

                                 TYLER
                        Would you maybe.. Wanna join me?
           Jill looks hesitant.  

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Please. I don’t think my self 
                        esteem could handle anymore 
                        rejection today.

           Jill smiles slightly, grabbing her purse and laptop. She sits 
           down across from him. Shit. He’s a smoke show. 

                                 JILL
                        Are we on a date? Did I just hijack 
                        this date?

                                 TYLER
                        I really hope so.

                                 JILL
                        Are you going to cut up my food and 
                        baby talk me?

                                 TYLER
                        Oh NO- That’s what he did?

                                 JILL
                        That was the part I liked.
                        It got weird when he asked to join 
                        me in the restroom to wipe me.

                                 TYLER
                        That’s weird?

           She smiles. The waitress drops off her mocha. 

                                 JILL
                        Thanks. What was your name?

                                 TYLER
                        Tyler Riordan. Yours?

                                 JILL
                        (British accent)
                        Jill Shaw. 

           They shake.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Tyler Riordan-
                        That name sounds familiar. You an 
                        actor?

                                 TYLER
                        God no.
                                 JILL
                        Porn star?

                                 TYLER
                        No such luck. 

                                 JILL
                        Self-help guru?

           He looks away. Chuckling.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        STOP. 

           He shifts.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Seriously?!

                                 TYLER
                        I don’t like the term, “Guru.”

                                 JILL
                        What term do you like?

                                 TYLER
                        I’m embarrassed to say at this 
                        point... The irony is palpable.

                                 JILL
                        ...Oh my God. 
                        Are you a dating coach?

           He gets serious. Jill busts up into laughter.

                                 TYLER
                        Cool, I’m just going to go kill 
                        myself now- 

                                 JILL
                        No, no- I’m sorry...I think I’ve 
                        heard of you! I’m impressed!

                                 TYLER
                        Even though I’ve been exposed as a 
                        fraud?

                                 JILL
                        Stop. Soo- what’re the cornerstones 
                        of your philosophy? Inquiring minds 
                        want to know.

                                 TYLER
                        Honesty. Integrity. Punctuality...
                                 JILL
                        Ooooooo, BURN.

           On cue- in walks Tyler’s sexy DATE (20s, thin, gorgeous - 
           probably recurring on Days of Our Lives or...your instagram 
           feed). 

                                 DATE (O.S.)
                        Oh My God-  Tyler! I am so sorry!

                           TYLER
           Heeeey!  You made it...
                                                      DATE (CONT'D)
                                              My phone died and I ended up 
                                              having to go to Santa Monica 
                                              for a meeting and the 10 was 
                                              a fucking nightmare, I 
                                              couldn’t find my car charger! 

                                 TYLER
                        No worries..I ran into a friend...

           His Date looks at Jill like she just noticed a pile of shit 
           in the middle of the floor. Jill smiles.

                                 JILL
                             (warmly)
                        Hi.

                                 DATE
                             (coldly)
                        Hi.

           Jill hops up.

                           JILL
           Please - have a seat-
                                                          TYLER
                                              No - no - we can get another 
                                              table-

                                 JILL
                        I was just finishing up-

           Jill awkwardly grabs her laptop, coffee and purse, dropping 
           cash and trying to move out of the way. His Date plops down 
           in the chair, immediately.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Nice to see you. 

                                 TYLER
                        You, too.

           The Date can barely force a half smile. Jill exits. Tyler 
           watches after her. 
                                 DATE
                        I am DYING for a celery juice-

                                 TYLER
                        Sorry-  would you excuse me for one 
                        second?

           EXT.  STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Jill is walking to her car when...

                                 TYLER (O.S.)
                        Jill!

           Tyler jogs over.

                                 JILL
                        Did I call it?

                                 TYLER
                        You called it-

                                 JILL
                        What’re you doing?

                                 TYLER
                        I figured I could let you leave and 
                        then I’d have to go home and get on 
                        craigslist and write a post on 
                        missed connections. Not very 
                        smooth. Or I’d have to go all 
                        Single White Female, searching for 
                        you on instagram or facebook- also 
                        not favorable. OR I could just run 
                        out of my date and chase you down 
                        the street and ask for your number. 
                        Which, now that I say it aloud... 
                        Doesn’t sound particularly 
                        favorable either...

                                 JILL
                        I’m swearing off men, remember?

                                 TYLER
                        Ahh. The dick cleanse...Right.

                                 JILL
                        And I’m guessing your date’s about 
                        to do the same.

           Through the window, his Date shoots them the look of death.
                                 TYLER
                        You’re probably right. Well, how 
                        about this-  Here’s my number. If 
                        the lesbian thing doesn’t work out, 
                        give me a call.  

           He gives her his card and starts heading back. He turns 
           around-

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Second thought, give me a call if 
                        the lesbian thing DOES work out...

           Jill laughs.  

                                 JILL
                        You wish.

                                 TYLER
                        Uh huh, talk to you tomorrow!

           She smiles.

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           Austin sits at his desk returning emails.

           His cell starts buzzing with a VM. He presses play.   

                                 JILL V.O.
                        Izzy...You’re not going to believe 
                        this. It was some..Notting 
                        Hill...Frickin...Love, Actually 
                        shit. Get ready: He was BRITISH... 
                        From... (British accent) 
                        Foggy London town! 

           Austin rolls his eyes and makes a face - Ooooo British. F*** 
           that guy.

                                 JILL V.O. (CONT’D)
                        I don’t actually know if he’s from 
                        London but I will pause so you can 
                        finish masturbating.

           He smiles as he listens. He opens up a text. Starts typing-

                             Sorry - you’ve got the wrong num

           KNOCK KNOCK! Jessa enters.

                                 JESSA
                        Hey- Jim needs to see you.
           Austin nods -  getting up. His incomplete text open on his 
           desk.

           INT. WRITER'S ROOM - DAY

           Jill passes out coffee to the Men as they brainstorm.

                                 MALE WRITER
                        Love is...
                        Knowing that she’ll always be 
                        there. No matter what.  

           Jill snorts. Everyone stares. Shit. Was that out loud?

                                 JAY
                        You sound like an auto insurance 
                        commercial. C’mon Jill. You love 
                        chick flicks, right? Give us a 
                        hand.  

           Oh shit. 

                                 JILL
                        Love? Ummm...LOVE. Ok. 
                        Love is like... 

           She takes a deep breath, closing her eyes for a second. She 
           slips into thought.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        You see them from across the room. 
                        You lock eyes and... It’s this 
                        instant feeling of certainty. This 
                        involuntary response- like 
                        goosebumps. And you know- in your 
                        bones - the way that birds know 
                        when a storm is brewing. Something 
                        big is coming. A game changer. And 
                        you don’t need to wait an hour to 
                        call or text back- you don’t need 
                        to play the game. You couldn’t play 
                        it cool if you tried- there’s 
                        nothing cool about what you’re 
                        feeling. It’s powerful and all-
                        consuming and exciting and it’s.. 
                        Scary. From the moment your eyes 
                        met. But you’re scared together.   

           The men stare. 

                                 JAY
                        I just grew a vagina. Write that 
                        down. 
           Jill nods and starts typing. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        The new draft doesn’t suck, by the 
                        way. I like the secretary more. 
                        She’s kinda funny, right? She’s 
                        like a guy.

           The room agrees. Except for Mark.

                                 JILL
                        Melodie.

                                 JAY
                        Huh?

                                 JILL
                        She has a name now. Melodie.

           Jay smiles. He studies her. She’s got spunk.

                                 JAY
                        Why don’t you take this next 
                        episode, Jill.

                           MARK

                                              You want ME-

                                 JAY
                        You can handle it, right?

                                 JILL
                        YES. Like...Not a revision? Like 
                        I’m writing the next episode?

                                 JAY
                        Correct.

           She swallows down an exclamation.

           EXT. CBS LOT - DAY

           Jill rushes through the studio lot- phone to her ear. 

                                 JILL
                        Izzy- I got an episode!!! I’m 
                        writing an episode!!! It’s bad for 
                        women, bad for Latinos- bad for 
                        everyone, really. But---YAY!

                        My first episode of terrible 
                        primetime TV!

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET - EVENING

           Austin listens to the voicemail while hustling down the busy 
           NY street. He smiles. Bravo, Jill.

           INT. THE PIKEY BRITISH PUB - NIGHT

           Jill and Tyler laugh over fish and chips. 

                                 JILL
                        So..How does one become a dating 
                        coach? What are the qualifications?

           He chuckles.

                                 TYLER
                        I’m quite unqualified. I just...I 
                        love the fairer sex. And I believe 
                        there’s a lack of sincerity in the 
                        dating game.

                                 JILL
                        Really? Things are going great for 
                        me. Haven’t gotten murdered yet!

                                 TYLER
                        Cheers to that!

           They cheers.

                        So you’re a TV writer...
                        Anything I would have seen?

                                 JILL
                        Not unless you’re a thirteen year 
                        old girl with terrible taste. I’m 
                        on a show called Pinewood Shores. 
                        The series premiere is next week, 
                        actually. 

                                 TYLER
                        Can’t wait to check it out! 

                                 JILL
                        Feel free not to! 
                                 TYLER
                        It’s happening. It’s already my 
                        favorite show.
                        Did you always want to be a writer? 
                        Where’d that come from?

                                 JILL
                        My sister was stuck in bed a lot as 
                        a kid. Sick. So we watched a TON of 
                        movies and tv. It was something we 
                        could experience for the first time 
                        together.

                                 TYLER
                        That’s sweet. Is she better now?

                                 JILL
                        She died. In November. She had 
                        cystic fibrosis. 

                                 TYLER
                        I’m so sorry. 

                                 JILL
                        That’s ok-

                                 TYLER
                        Sounds like you two were really 
                        close.

                                 JILL
                        That bitch was my soulmate! 

                                 TYLER
                        I’m sure she’s proud of you.

                                 JILL
                        Eh. I was much cooler as a kid. I 
                        think I peaked at like...12. I 
                        wanted to come home with epic 
                        stories so I’d do the craziest 
                        things to try to impress her. I 
                        would’ve tried crack if it would’ve 
                        made her laugh. Now everything 
                        scares me. 

                                 TYLER
                        What changed?

                                 JILL
                        I don’t know. I grew up? Came to 
                        LA? And now with her gone... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JILL (CONT'D)
                        I just feel like there’s not a lot 
                        of incentive to do the crazy thing, 
                        you know? 

                                 TYLER
                        I’m sure your sister still wants 
                        you to get out there and try crack. 

           Jill smiles.

                                 JILL
                        You’re a really good listener. Is 
                        there a chapter about that in your 
                        book?

                                 TYLER
                        No - that’s just- bloody hell. YES. 
                        Yes, there is.

                                 JILL
                        I need a copy of this book.

                                 TYLER
                        I’ll see what I can do.  

           The waiter takes their plates.

                                 JILL
                        So was the fish and chips a joke 
                        compared to home? 

                                 TYLER
                        Not bad, actually!

                                 JILL
                        Oh good! I haven’t spent much time 
                        in the UK.

                                 TYLER
                        Well. I’ll have to take you.

           She blushes. Oh shiiiiiiiit. 

           INT. JILL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jill and Tyler get hot and heavy in the bedroom. 

           As he kisses her neck she realizes- this is the point of no 
           return.

                                 JILL
                        You’ve gotta go.
           She wriggles out from under him in her bra and panties, 
           hurriedly gathering his clothes on the floor. 

                                 TYLER
                        ...Now?

           She throws his pants and shirt at him.

                                 JILL
                        Yep, bye!

           She pushes him through the studio and out the door before he 
           can protest. He stands, dumbfounded, in the hallway as the 
           door slams in his face.

           In the hallway, he smiles to himself. 

           Jill shakes it out, giggling as she dials Isabelle. 

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Izzy. It was close BUT- I did it! I 
                        did NOT have sex with him!!!

           She bows.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, thank you. My body is a 
                        wonderland, my vagina is a secret 
                        garden! 

           She’s really getting into it now.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        I am Jill: Resister of desires of 
                        the flesh!!! Almighty tamer of 
                        sexual demons-

           Suddenly she notices: Tyler at the center of the room - 
           FROZEN. Jill’s jaw drops.

                                 TYLER
                             (sheepishly)
                        I left my wallet...

           Jill SHRIEKS, running to her bed and hiding under the covers. 
           He smiles, making his way over to her.

           He pulls the sheet down, gently. She covers her face with her 
           hands.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        What was that about a secret 
                        garden?
           JESUS, that accent.

                                 JILL
                        Damnit.

           She pulls him back into bed.

           INT. AUSTIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                                 TYLER (V.O.)
                        I left my wallet...

           Austin’s eyes go wide as he listens to Tyler’s voice on the 
           other line- walking into the middle of the VM being left.

                                 AUSTIN
                        NO!!! NO, JILL!

           Jill shrieks audibly. Austin covers his face from secondhand 
           embarrassment.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t lock the door?! Lock 
                        your door, Jill!

           The VM ends. He sets the phone down. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                             (sotto)
                        They’re hooking up right now. 

           He nods. Pacing aimlessly.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Yep. They’re definitely hooking up.

           Uh oh. Is he getting...Jeally? He grabs a beer outta the 
           fridge. Downs it. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        He probably has terrible teeth. 

           He nods his head. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        For sure.

           Keep tellin’ yourself that, Austin.

           INT. JILL’S DOORWAY - THE NEXT MORNING

           Jill opens her front door. Butterflies in her stomach.
                                 JILL
                        Let’s try this again.

                                 TYLER
                        I had a lovely time.

                                 JILL
                        Me too.

                                 TYLER
                        I’ll hit you up later today. 

                                 JILL
                        K...

           He kisses her softly and steps out. She goes to shut the door 
           when-

                                 TYLER
                        Jill?

                                 JILL
                        Yeah?

                                 TYLER
                        This is exciting. 

           He gives her a boyish grin and walks off. She closes the 
           door, squealing silently. 

           INT. JILL'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Jill works through the day into the night. Writing. Pacing. 
           Writing. Deleting. Acting it out. It sucks. Banging her head 
           against the wall. Groaning frustratedly.

           ZERO texts have come in....?!?!

           She grabs her shit. Time for a change of scenery.

           INT. 101 COFFEE SHOP - VARIOUS

           Timelapse at 101 Coffee Shop - a classic 24 hour diner where 
           Swingers was shot. 

           Jill has set up shop at a corner booth like a homeless man- 
           bags. Notes. Cue cards. Books. Laptop. 

           She checks her phone. Still no text from Tyler. WTF?

           The CAFE WAITER stares at her - FED th F up. 
                                 CAFE WAITER
                             (sotto)
                        Bitch, go to Starbucks.

           INT. WRITER'S ROOM - DAY

           Jill sits in the writer’s room - tweaking, dark circles under 
           her eyes while Mark explains the difficulties of living with 
           large breasts. She types a text to Tyler.

                 Hey! So...My show premieres tonight, could use a drinking 
                                 buddy if you’re around 

           Jay’s phone alarm goes off.

                                 JAY
                        Alright. I think we’re good for the 
                        day-

           Everyone begins packing up.

                                 JILL
                        Oh --wait- Jay?
                        I just wanted to know what you 
                        thought...Of my first draft?

                                 JAY
                        Oh right! Yeah.
                        I’ll get you your notes. End of day 
                        Monday at the latest.

                                 JILL
                        Cool, cool. But overall...?

                        It’s wordy. WAY too much talky 
                        talky - bossy bossy. Cut down the

                                 JILL
                        Just the female characters.

                                 JAY
                        Correct.
                                 JILL
                        Cut down on the women’s dialogue. 
                        Got it.

                                 JAY
                        Anything else. Mark? Jill’s

                        Yeah...Lucia. In this episode she 
                        seems...What is it? 

                                 MALE WRITER
                        Complicated, right?

                                 JAY
                        COMPLEX.

                                 MARK
                        YES.

           The men all nod.

                                 JILL
                        In... a bad way?

                                 MARK
                        I didn’t understand her.

                                 JAY
                        Yeah - I didn’t get her.

                                 JILL
                        Ok. What didn’t you understand?

                                 MARK
                        The things she says, you know? 

                                 MALE WRITER 
                        RIGHT.

                                 JAY
                        So if she could just...Say less.
                        GREAT - thanks Jill. Alright!
                        Happy premiere day, everyone! And 
                        remember - the critics don’t 
                        matter. They’re a bunch of out of 
                        touch white middle aged losers who 
                        refuse to let joy into their lives.
                        UNLESS - they love it.

           Everybody chuckles in unison. Jill joins in with her best 
           rich white guy chuckle. Everyone silences.
           INT. AUSTIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Austin sits on his couch watching the terrible title sequence 
           for PINEWOOD SHORES. It’s like a somehow lower-rent version 
           of Passions. OUCH. 

           INT. JILL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jill checks her phone. Nothing.

           On her screen, an actor, over-dramatically delivers his 
           lines.

                                 CLIFF
                        When you deny your feelings for me, 
                        Lucia, you deny yourself.

           Jill buries her face and screams. This is HUMILIATING.

           Her phone buzzes. She checks it excitedly. 

           MOM. She declines it. She waits for the voicemail.

                                 MOM V.O.
                        Hi honey - I’m here with your Dad- 
                        We just watched your show! It was 
                        very...

           She can hear them whispering in the background.

                                 MOM V.O. (CONT’D)
                        It was...Yep. We watched it! We are 
                        so proud of you. Love you!

           Wow. Doesn’t get much worse than that.

           Jill opens up her laptop.

           She pulls up an article titled:

                Pinewood Shores Makes you Want to Punch Yourself in the Face

           Jill covers her eyes.

                                 JILL
                        Oh my GOD.

           She keeps masochistically scrolling through... The reviews 
           range from bad to... Heinous. 

           She gets in bed and plays one of Izzy’s old voicemails for 
           comfort. 
                                 ISABELLE V.O. 
                        Jilly - super important question: 
                        Would you rather be covered in 
                        honey and slowly eaten by rabid, 
                        sewer rats OR...Sleep with Bob 
                        Saget? Tough one, I know. 

           INT. AUSTIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The end credits roll. That was BLEAK.

           A credit reads:

                                  Staff Writer Jill Shaw

           He pulls out his laptop - Googling her.

           Pics of Jill come up on his screen. He smiles as he takes her 
           in. Wow. She’s cute. 

           He scrolls through...Seeing her ham it up. Laugh with 
           friends. He gazes at her. It’s impossible not to fall a 
           little in love.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Austin has happy hour oysters with his engaged best friends: 
           ANDY (30s, quirky, adorable, in touch with his feminine side) 
           and BREEDA (30s, a sharp-witted bombshell who wears the 
           pants). 

                                 BREEDA
                        Bring your Dad. I love your Dad. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        I’m not bringing my DAD as my plus 
                        one-

                                 ANDY
                        He’ll sleep with all the 
                        bridesmaids. 

                                 BREEDA
                        Ok fine but you’re not allowed to 
                        use your plus 1 on a bimbo whose 
                        name you don’t know.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Oh my GOD- I knew her name!

                                 BREEDA
                        You called her Harmony.
           He stares.

                                 BREEDA (CONT’D)
                        ...Her name was AERIENNE. You were 
                        WAY off.

                                 AUSTIN
                        That explains a lot.

           Austin’s cell vibrates. He lights up when he sees the number.

                                 BREEDA
                        Oh God. Who’s that?

                                 AUSTIN
                        It’s sort of a weird situation... 
                        This girl keeps leaving voicemails. 
                        For her sister. They’re kind of 
                        hilarious. I’ve been getting them 
                        since I got the new number. 

                                 ANDY
                        And you haven’t told her?

                                 BREEDA
                        How does she not know her sister 
                        changed her number? Text her-

                                 AUSTIN
                        I thought I had. 

           He sends the call to voicemail.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Maybe I’ll just... See what 
                        happened with the dating guru.

                                 ANDY
                        Dating guru?

           Austin gets up, heading outside.

                                 BREEDA
                        He’s invested.

                                 ANDY
                        Creeper.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES OVERLOOK - NIGHT

           Jill stares out at the LA lights. Sitting on the hood of her 
           car with her phone to her ear.
                                 JILL
                        Yoooo. 
                        So they do these outdoor movie 
                        screenings here in the cemetery! I 
                        know -it’s so weird! But guess what 
                        they’re playing? The Craft!!!    
                        “We are the weirdos, mister.” 
                        In other news...I’m being ghosted! 
                        By a Tony Robbins wannabe. I am 
                        officially LA. 

           She chuckles. 

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Ummm... So Izzy... 
                        I’m just wondering...How am I 
                        supposed to do this without you? 

           The question hangs in the air. Her eyes begin to water as her 
           heart splinters.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        You know I’m a stage five clinger. 
                        I’m single white female status 
                        obsessed with you. 
                        We were supposed to die together, 
                        remember? We made a deal. Like Noah 
                        and Allie in The Notebook. 

           She can’t force it down anymore. The lump grows in her 
           throat.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        You know - I don’t know if I’ve 
                        ever really known what it is to be 
                        lonely. 
                        And guess what? It doesn’t feel so 
                        good. It’s like that time I didn’t 
                        get invited to Lisa Pulizzano’s 
                        birthday party. Remember that? What 
                        a ho! So we had our own Robyn dance 
                        party. Dancing to “Dancing on my 
                        Own” on repeat.
                        Truth is --- I’ve never had to 
                        dance on my own. I always had you. 
                        (beat)
                        “I wish I knew how to quit you.” 
                        Ok, I’ll stop. 
                        You’re in a better place. Probably 
                        macking on Heath Ledger as we 
                        speak. 

           She smiles through her tears.
                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        I love you, Izzy. 
                        I miss you. Every minute. Every 
                        day. 
                        Call me!

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           INT. BAR ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

           Austin stands by the door: Eyes glazed over, phone to his 
           ear. The pieces falling into place.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Austin returns to the table with his friends. He sits down. 
           In a daze. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Isabelle’s dead. Her sister. They 
                        are voicemails for her dead sister. 

                                 ANDY
                        Whaaaaaat- 

                                 BREEDA
                        Oh my God. That’s...Heartbreaking.

                                 ANDY
                        You gotta tell her. Now you’re a 
                        SICKO!

                                 BREEDA
                        Don’t tell her! She’s healing! This 
                        is her way of healing!!!

           Austin gulps his beer. Guilt hitting him hard.

           INT. AUSTIN'S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

           Austin watches a Youtube video of Tyler preaching to a group 
           of WOMEN.

                                 TYLER (V.O.)
                        You tell him you no longer want to 
                        invest in something that isn’t 
                        going anywhere- 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Shut up.
           Austin’s boss, JIM (50s), knocks. Austin jerks up, silencing 
           the video immediately.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Hey Jim-

                                 JIM
                        Austin. Good work on Madison 
                        avenue.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Thank you-

                                 JIM
                        Close it up. We need you to take 
                        care of the Alphabet City listing.   

           He nods. Jim heads out.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Uh - sir?

                                 JIM
                        Yeah?

                                 AUSTIN
                        Is Frederick still handling Century 
                        City?

                                 JIM
                        He’s got some family stuff. We’re 
                        figuring it out-

                                 AUSTIN
                        I can do it! 

                                 JIM
                        You wanna go to LA? I was gonna 
                        have Jeremy-

                                 AUSTIN
                        I’d be happy to do it. I’ve got 
                        some stuff to..Take care of in LA.

                                 JIM
                        Ok. Great. I’ll have Fred fill you 
                        in. 

           Austin nods.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and uh...If you need to take 
                        care of business...Do it in the 
                        bathroom.
           Jim raises a playful brow at him. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Oh...I wasn’t...

                                 JIM
                        I know.

                                 AUSTIN
                        No, really, I wasn’t-

                                 JIM
                        I know.

           Jim gives him a knowing wink and heads out. 

           INT. AUSTIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Austin packs his suitcase in his Tribeca apartment. He picks 
           up his phone, looking at a pic of Jill. As he gazes at her - 
           JILL starts calling. 

           He panics- throwing the phone on the bed like a hot potato. 
           That was close.

           INT. JILL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jill paces in her apartment, phone to her ear. On the brink 
           of insanity.

                                 JILL
                        He goes- “Jill” and I go- “Yeah” 
                        and he goes “THIS IS EXCITING.” I 
                        SHIT you not, Isabelle, those were 
                        his final words to me before 
                        falling off the face of the earth! 
                        What is he, some kind of sociopath? 
                        WELL -our love guru is doing a book 
                        reading tomorrow night and I have a 
                        crazy idea... I’m glad you’re not 
                        here to tell me that when they go 
                        low, we go high...That’s for the 
                        classy people. 

           INT. AUSTIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                                 JILL V.O.
                        Let’s smoke some crack.

           Austin smiles. 
           INT. BAKERY - MORNING

           Austin shows Breeda and Andy a USB drive while third-wheeling 
           their wedding cake tasting.

                                 AUSTIN
                        After the douche’s book reading I 
                        will approach her and say: “I’m 
                        very sorry for your loss, here is a 
                        drive of all of your voicemails. 
                        Apologies for not telling you 
                        sooner. I didn’t listen to them..”

                                 BREEDA
                        She’ll know you listened to them.

                                 ANDY
                        Of course you listened to them- do 
                        NOT bring this. 

           He takes the drive out of his hand.

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        She doesn’t need an instant replay 
                        of herself talking to her dead 
                        sister.

                                 BREEDA
                        Why do you need to do it in person? 
                        (re: the cake)
                        Ooo- this is a good one.

                                 ANDY
                        How do you even know what she looks 
                        like?

           Austin takes a bite of Breeda’s slice.

                                 AUSTIN
                        I may have...Googled her. And 
                        looked through her instagram. And 
                        facebook. And...Saved some pics on 
                        my phone...

                                 ANDY
                        Oh, ok cool. Glad this hasn’t 
                        gotten weird.

                                 BREEDA
                        SHOW ME NOW.

           He pulls out his phone. 
                                 ANDY
                        THAT’S why you haven’t recorded a 
                        voice greeting. Because you’ll be 
                        found out!   

                                 AUSTIN
                        No. I just haven’t had time-

           Breeda takes a look at the photos of Jill.

                                 BREEDA
                        Holy crap! She’s beautiful!!!

           Andy takes a peek.

                                 ANDY
                        And that’s why you wanna do it in 
                        person! You are SO predictable. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        I’m doing it in person because it’s 
                        the right thing to do. I’m going to 
                        be in LA anyway...

                                 BREEDA
                        Awww- And you’ve caught feels!

                                 AUSTIN
                        What? I don’t even know her.

                                 ANDY
                        Actually, you know everything about 
                        her. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        I don’t know everything. Just that 
                        she’s funny. And that guys in LA 
                        are a joke and they don’t deserve 
                        her. And... she really, really 
                        loved her sister.

           They stare at him. He looks like a Looney Tunes character 
           with hearts popping out of his eyeballs.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        What?

           He takes a huge bite of cake. Shit. He’s in trouble. 

           INT. L.A. BARNES AND NOBLE BOOKSTORE - EVENING

           Dozens of WOMEN of all shapes, sizes and ages buzz with 
           excitement, trying to get a good seat. 
           On an easel, a cardboard blowup of the book: Proactive Dating 
           by Tyler Riordan. Austin enters the cult gathering. He scans 
           faces. She’s not there. The WOMEN STARE as he finds a seat. 
           Who let the MAN in?

           Then...Jill wanders in, trying to be incognito in a hat. 

           A beat as his heart stops. There she is - the woman with the 
           voice he knows so well. He can’t look away as she finds her 
           seat.

           Tyler enters with a megawatt smile- the room erupts in 
           applause. Jill’s face darkens. So does Austin’s.

                                 TYLER
                        How’s everyone doing? 

           The ladies cheer as he reaches the small stage.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Thank you all for being here. It’s 
                        great to see you! So..I’ll leave it 
                        up to you- what chapter should we 
                        read from, ladies?

           The women swoon. THAT Hugh Grant accent... 

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Any suggestions?

           A hand goes up in the audience.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        Yeah - In the back.

           The ladies turn as Jill stands. Tyler sharts his pants. 

                                 JILL
                        Hey, Tyler. Love the book. I’m a 
                        HUGE fan.

           He shifts, uncomfortably.

                                 TYLER
                        Thank you-

                                 JILL
                        My favorite is the chapter titled 
                        “Dating with Accountability”. But 
                        quick question: That’s only geared 
                        towards us lovelorn ladies, 
                        correct? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JILL (CONT'D)
                        I’m guessing guys get a free pass 
                        to, say, get you into bed, talk 
                        about taking you back to their home 
                        countries and then vanish out of 
                        thin air. No explanation. Not even 
                        a text saying - I am alive but NO 
                        THANK YOU.

           Every head in the audience turns back towards Tyler- begging 
           for a logical explanation. Austin stifles a smile. Daaaang.

                                 TYLER
                        Oh - emmm - this book is designed 
                        for women to - emm- navigate the 
                        reality of the dating world-

                                 JILL
                        Right - the dating world where in 
                        order to “get the guy”- women are 
                        expected to read self-help books 
                        written by men, send “cheeky” 
                        emojis when they receive a booty 
                        call text and respond “coyly and 
                        unemotionally” when a guy forgets 
                        plans that were made.   

           The room full of lovesick ladies stares - their loyalty 
           deteriorating before his very eyes. 

                                 TYLER
                        I’m...I-

                                 JILL
                        Well, thanks to your book - I am 
                        now an expert on accountability and 
                        a PRO at apologizing. 
                        So here we go: 
                        I’m sorry for falling for your poor- 
                        man’s-Hugh-Grant schtick. I’m sorry 
                        I spent 14 dollars buying sliced 
                        pineapple at Whole Foods to have in 
                        the fridge so you’d think I was a 
                        grown up. I’m sorry that women 
                        across the country will read your 
                        book and not realize the toxic 
                        dating culture its writer promotes. 
                        And most of all- I’m sorry that I’m 
                        still a hopeless romantic and 
                        fuckboys like you make me feel bad 
                        about it. Enjoy the 20 bucks. Buy 
                        some crumpets. 

           OooooOOO BURN, Jill.
           She tosses the book on her seat and starts making her way 
           through the aisle. The room watches her go then suddenly - 
           breaks into APPLAUSE. She cracks a smile as she struts out - 
           head held high. Boy, BYE.

           Austin watches after her - in awe. 

           EXT. VALET - NIGHT

           Jill catches her breath over at the valet.

                                 AUSTIN (O.S.)
                        That was...Awesome. 

           Jill turns. Their eyes meet - for the first time. A beat as 
           they take each other in. She hesitates for a second.

                                 JILL
                        Ah, thanks. I’m still shaking. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        I don’t really know what happened 
                        there but....He’s an idiot.

           She looks at him quizzically.

                                 JILL
                        You a fan of his?

                                 AUSTIN
                        No. NO-

                                 JILL
                        Just decided to check out a random 
                        book signing?

                                 AUSTIN
                        Uh. Yeah, well - I..Uh. I actually 
                        came here to talk to you.

                                 JILL
                        To me?

                                 AUSTIN
                        Yeah.

                                 JILL
                        Do I know you?

                                 AUSTIN
                        You don’t, actually. Not at all.
                                 JILL
                        Ok..

           He smiles. She waits. He can’t get over how crazy it is to be 
           face to face with her.

           He can’t do it. He can’t. Not like this.

                                 AUSTIN
                        I came to the valet to talk to 
                        you... After that. I’d like to - do 
                        the male species a solid and prove 
                        that we’re not all promoting a 
                        toxic dating culture. 

                                 JILL
                        Oh, man.

                                 AUSTIN
                        What?

                                 JILL
                        Seriously?

                                 AUSTIN
                        Not great timing, is it?

                                 JILL
                        Not great, no. I’m on a dick 
                        cleanse. This time, for real. Not 
                        that you’re a dick...Just that you 
                        HAVE one. Presumably. Or not. 
                        Either way- all fine by me. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        I do. Have one.

                                 JILL
                        Great, cool, awesome. Well now that 
                        we have established that you have a-

                                 AUSTIN
                        Can we start over?

                                 JILL
                        PLEASE.

                                 AUSTIN
                        How ‘bout dinner? I’m in town on 
                        business-

           The valet arrives with her Prius. She heads to her car.
                                 JILL
                        Thank you, but I’m not really-

                                 AUSTIN
                        You like Chinese food?

           Record scratch. She stops cold. Turning back around. HOLD UP.

           INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Austin and Jill get down on chow mein and orange chicken.

                                 AUSTIN
                        You’re a writer! Can you just write 
                        it for me?

                                 JILL
                        Hells no! They’re your two best 
                        friends! You beat the system. This 
                        has the potential to be the most 
                        epic best man speech of all time! I 
                        am LIVING for this OC, by the way. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        OC?

                                 JILL
                        Orange chicken.

                                 AUSTIN
                        You have abbreviations for Chinese 
                        food?

                                 JILL
                        Doesn’t everybody?

           He laughs.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Wait- Can you give me like..A first 
                        line? A prompt? Like when we did 
                        college essays?

                                 JILL
                        Ummm...Ok fine. Breeda and Andy?

           He nods. He gazes at her while she slips into deep thought.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        “Breeda and Andy.... 
                        You’ve made a believer out of me.”    
                                 AUSTIN
                        DAAAMN. That’s why they pay you the 
                        big bucks.

           She cackles.

                                 JILL
                        Or like...None of the bucks. But 
                        thank you. 
                        How do you like your job? Real 
                        estate’s cool, yeah?

                                 AUSTIN
                        Cool is a strong word. It’s good. 
                        It’s what my dad does.

                                 JILL
                        Dad! You guys close?

                                 AUSTIN
                        That’s...A loaded question. 

                                 JILL
                        Ah. How about Mom?

                                 AUSTIN
                        She died when I was little.

           Jill peers up at him- stunned. She’s not used to being on 
           this side of the fence. 

                                 JILL
                        I’m sorry..

                                 AUSTIN
                        I don’t have siblings, so it was 
                        always just me and my Dad. He’s a 
                        good guy. Even if he’s more like a 
                        brother than a father.

           She smiles. He tenses. Not sure how they got there...

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        So - JILL. I’ve been out here a 
                        million times but don’t feel like I 
                        really know LA, ya know?

                                 JILL
                        Oh, honey- no one knows LA. You can 
                        spend all night talking to her at a 
                        dinner party and the next day she 
                        won’t remember your name. 
                                 AUSTIN
                        Deep. 

                                 JILL
                        I have this theory - the reason 
                        there’s always traffic is because 
                        no one has real jobs or anywhere to 
                        be, so they’re just driving round 
                        and round in circles like The 
                        Truman Show.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Sounds like you might be the ONLY 
                        person that has LA figured 
                        out...And I could really use a tour 
                        guide. 

           She raises a brow. Contemplating. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I won’t even try to get you into 
                        bed. Scouts honor.

           He does the three finger salute.

                                 JILL
                        You SAYING that is you trying to 
                        get me into bed.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Dammnit. I thought the reverse 
                        psychology might work. 

                                 JILL
                        Clearly the scouts have no honor!

                                 AUSTIN
                        I really wouldn’t know. I wasn’t a 
                        boy scout. 

           She bursts into laughter. One of those hearty, belly laughs. 
           He grins. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Whattaya say?

           She eyes him, suspiciously.

                                 JILL
                        We should go to the bat cave.

                                 AUSTIN
                        What’s at the bat cave?
                                 JILL
                        Batman. Obviously.

           Quick Shots of Jill and Austin Touring LA:

           -Jill and Austin wear Hawaiian shirts while riding a 
           Hollywood tour van

           - Jill takes pics of Austin with the brightest stars on the 
           Walk of Fame: Kirstie Alley, Wesley Snipes and Lassie

           -They hike the Hollywood sign and take duck-face selfies

           -They ride the Ferris Wheel at the Santa Monica Pier. They 
           can’t keep their eyes off of each other. 

           -Jill freaks out, hopping up and down when she wins a stuffed 
           animal at the arcade

           - They drink shakes at 101 Coffee Shop, chatting and laughing

           - Jill takes him to the Bronson caves (aka the batcave). 
           Surprisingly, no Batman.

           EXT. LA LOOKOUT - NIGHT

           Jill is seated on her car. Overlooking the LA night. Austin 
           stands: 

                                 AUSTIN
                        And I know you’re going to be very 
                        happy together. Cheers to the new 
                        couple.

           Jill nods.

                                 JILL
                        Ok..Good start!

                                 AUSTIN
                        It sucks.

                                 JILL
                        No- it’s close! 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Help me, Coach Shaw.

                                 JILL
                        Just... Speak from the heart.

                                 AUSTIN
                        That’s not really...My strong suit. 
                                 JILL
                        You’ve gotta unlearn all the Mark 
                        Wahlberg stuff about men not having 
                        emotions or crying. It is MANLY to 
                        have emotions! Romance is manly! 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Romance is manly?

           She smiles and nods. He can’t hold out any longer. He leans 
           in, kissing her. For the first time. Under the stars and the 
           smog. It’s about as perfect a kiss as they come in LA- or 
           otherwise. 

           Continue Montage:

           - Jill passes out coffee at work, smiling to herself

           - Austin does a showing of the Century City listing

           - Jill gives Austin a tour of the CBS lot

           - They roam around the Urban Light installation at LACMA. 
           Checking each other out under the lights. Sparks flying

           INT. JILL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Onscreen, Elizabeth Berkley in her career-defining role in 
           SHOWGIRLS:

                                 NOMI MALONE 
                        I like having nice tits.

           Austin shakes his head, horrified, on the couch.

                                 AUSTIN
                        You don’t like this movie. You’re 
                        messing with me.

           On the couch next to him, Jill has dozed off. He smiles, 
           slightly- turning off the TV. He carefully picks her up, 
           taking her to bed. He gets her tucked in. 

           She stirs. Nuzzling into the sheets. He gazes at her while 
           she sleeps. Falling hard. 

           Sunrise...

           Jill’s eyes flutter open. She reaches her hand to the spot 
           next to her on the bed. Empty. She sits up.

           On the couch, Austin is sound asleep. She crawls out of bed, 
           tiptoeing over. She smiles - he looks so peaceful. 
           She nestles into him on the couch, pulling his arm around her 
           and closing her eyes.

           EXT. LAX - MORNING 

           Jill and Austin are awkward as he pulls his bag out of her 
           trunk.

                                 JILL
                        Well. Thank you for choosing Jill 
                        Shaw tours! 

           He smiles. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Let’s figure it out...How to keep 
                        doing this.

                                 JILL
                        Ok. Yeah.

           He gives her a kiss.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Safe flight. 

           She smiles as he walks off. He turns back around. DAMNIT. He 
           can’t leave without doing the thing. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Jill...I’ve gotta tell you 
                        something.

           Jill waits. Uh oh.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I...My...

           He looks at her face. So open-hearted. It’ll crush her. He 
           can’t do it. He can’t hurt her.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        ...My best friends are getting 
                        married.

                                 JILL
                        I am aware.

                                 AUSTIN
                        The wedding’s in a couple weeks. In 
                        New York. I know this is kinda 
                        crazy but... Would you wanna...Be 
                        my date?
           A smile spreads on Jill’s face.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I know I may be jumping the gun- 
                        but I need my coach. Just think 
                        about it?

                                 JILL
                        Ok.

           INT. JILL'S APARTMENT - LATER

           Jill falls on her bed. Giggly. She pulls out her phone.

                                 JILL
                        Izzy. I just took him to LAX which 
                        is like the equivalent of adopting 
                        a dog together. And...I don’t even 
                        know what to say. I feel it, Izzy. 
                        It feels like... I don’t know. 
                        Like...I tried to play it cool, 
                        but...I have a feeling. It’s weird. 
                        It’s just easy and...There’s 
                        just...I think it may be him. I 
                        think he may be it. That’s so crazy 
                        to say!!!

           She squeals, covering her face.

           INT. UBER - NIGHT

           Austin rides home in an uber. He sees the VM waiting from 
           Jill. He smiles as he listens to it... 

           As it plays...His face drops. His feet getting cold. 

           INT. WRITER'S ROOM - DAY

                                 MARK
                        Aching. Tightening. Like a sharp 
                        spear running through your lower 
                        abdomen and you’re begging for 
                        release. And you feel lethargic and 
                        deeply..Saddened. But it’s 
                        difficult to articulate why. 

           The whole room listens, intently.

                                 JAY
                        Yeah.
                                 MARK
                        And that’s what it’s like... To 
                        menstruate.

           Jill can’t and she never will can again.

           INT. CBS LOT COMMISSARY - LATER

           Jill dials Austin while eating lunch and writing on her 
           laptop.

           INT. AUSTIN'S OFFICE - DAY

           Austin sees Jill calling. He hesitates. Then picks up. 

           INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

                                 AUSTIN
                        Hey...

                                 JILL
                        Hey! How was the flight?

                                 AUSTIN
                        Good, good. How are you?

                                 JILL
                        Mansplaining Mark is really in his 
                        element today. I’m learning a lot 
                        about menstruation. 

           She chuckles. Austin is silent. Thinking.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        You ok?

                                 AUSTIN
                        Yeah. Yeah. It’s just..A busy day 
                        at work... 

                                 JILL
                        Oh - Ok! We can talk later.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Cool.
                        No. Wait. That’s not true. 
                        I...Jill. Please don’t take this 
                        the wrong way...
                        This feels really intense. And...I 
                        just...I like you a lot...But 
                        ...Could we maybe...Dial it back a 
                        little?
                                 JILL
                        Dial it back...To what? We live in 
                        different cities...

                                 AUSTIN
                        That’s true. I just..I don’t know. 
                        I feel like you...Might be moving 
                        faster than me.

                                 JILL
                        Why? Because I called you just now?

                                 AUSTIN
                        No! I... I don’t know. 

           Silence. Jill nods her head.

                                 JILL
                        Got it. Ok. Austin- maybe you 
                        should just figure out what it is 
                        that you want. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Jill.

                                 JILL
                        Yeah?

           He needs to say it. Say it, Austin. Moments pass. He can’t do 
           it. 

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Alright. I’m gonna go.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Ok.

                                 JILL
                        Ok.

           She hangs up and stares at her phone - confused. WTF was 
           THAT?

           An alert comes up on the screen. Software Update. She groans, 
           plugging it into her computer. 

           The apple logo comes up. Resetting. 

           Everything on her screen suddenly looks different. She goes 
           to her voicemails: EMPTY. 0 Voicemails.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god. No, no no- 
           INT. APPLE STORE - DAY

           Jill rushes through the busy Apple store and to the Genius 
           Bar. She interrupts a GENIUS who is talking to a FEMALE 
           CUSTOMER (40s). 

                                 JILL
                        I’m sorry--- Sorry. Excuse me- I 
                        did the update and all of my 
                        voicemails are gone- 

                                 FEMALE CUSTOMER
                        Girl - there’s a line-

                                 JILL
                        I know, I’m sorry! This is an 
                        emergency! My voicemails 
                        disappeared. And it’s very, VERY 
                        important that I get them back- 

                                 FEMALE CUSTOMER
                        Did I wake up in 2002? Who be 
                        leavin’ voicemails?

                                 JILL
                        I’m so sorry- I’m almost done. 
                        They’re all I have. They’re all I 
                        have of my sister. 

                                 FEMALE CUSTOMER
                        GIRL-

                                 JILL
                        She died.

           The Female Customer looks to the Genius.

                                 FEMALE CUSTOMER
                        She can go ahead.

           The Genius plugs in Jill’s phone. 

                                 GENIUS
                        Type in your apple ID and password. 

           He checks some stuff out.

                                 GENIUS (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t save them to the 
                        cloud... 

                                 JILL
                        I...I thought I did. 
                                 GENIUS
                        I’m sorry...It was probably a 
                        software update glitch...And if you 
                        didn’t save them to the 
                        cloud...There’s not much else I can 
                        do...

                                 JILL
                        You don’t understand...I NEED those 
                        voicemails.

           Jill starts to break down. A shady lookin genius nearby, 
           FELIX, overhears the commotion. 

                                 GENIUS
                        I’m sorry...

           Tears run down jill’s cheeks. In the middle of the Apple 
           store. In front of everyone.

                                 JILL
                        There’s nothing else---? Are you 
                        sure?... Nothing..? 

           Jill covers her face. The Female Customer hugs her. Hiding 
           Jill’s face in her bosomous chest.  

                                 FEMALE CUSTOMER
                        What ya’ll lookin’ at? This ain’t 
                        Judge Judy. Mind your business!

           The shady genius, FELIX, taps Jill on the shoulder. He looks 
           around the room like he’s about to do a drug deal.

                                 FELIX
                        Write down your info and the number 
                        the voicemails came from. I’ll see 
                        what I can do. 

           Jill takes the piece of paper in his hand. 

                                 FELIX (CONT’D)
                        We never spoke. 

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Austin sits with Breeda and Andy, cheersing.

                                 ANDY
                        To our last drinks as unweds.

           Breeda looks around the room.
                                 BREEDA
                        DANG- I need to find someone to 
                        have sex with tonight...

           She grins, nudging Andy playfully as he FAKE laughs.

                                 ANDY
                        We’re excited to meet Jill!

           Austin looks away.

                                 BREEDA
                        Oh NOOOO-

                                 ANDY
                        I KNEW IT. 

                                 BREEDA
                        What happened, Austin?

                                 AUSTIN
                        I heard her.. Talking about how she 
                        felt about me.

           Andy nods- his eyes full of sympathy. 

                                 ANDY
                        She thinks you’re vapid. And 
                        stupid.

           Austin stares, coldly. Breeda puts a hand over Andy’s mouth.

                                 BREEDA
                        Shhh! Go ahead.

                                 AUSTIN
                        She’s just...She’s so...I don’t 
                        know. Vulnerable. And...Her 
                        feelings are intense. And I don’t 
                        know that I’m there yet.

                                 BREEDA
                        Oh, Austin. You only like the first 
                        month of a relationship when it’s 
                        superficial and disposable. We’re 
                        not sixteen anymore!

                                 ANDY
                        Look - we understand that you are a 
                        product of your environment. You 
                        were a feral child raised by wolves 
                        in a wasteland.
                                 AUSTIN
                        ...I was raised by my Dad in New 
                        Jersey.

           Breeda and Andy nod their heads sympathetically. 

                                 ANDY
                        You’ve checked your phone every 
                        three minutes since you started 
                        getting these voicemails. Just 
                        think about that. 

                                 BREEDA
                        What would happen if...You let her 
                        see the Austin that we get to see?  

           Austin evades eye contact. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        I don’t know.

                                 BREEDA
                        Wait...How did you hear her talking 
                        about her feelings?

           Busted. Austin tenses.

                                 ANDY
                        OH MY GOD- 

                                 BREEDA
                        You didn’t tell her!!!

                                 AUSTIN
                        I’m going to!!!

                                 ANDY
                        LIAR!!! It’s like a sick, sick 
                        version of You’ve Got Mail!!!

                                 AUSTIN
                        Tom Hanks is America’s 
                        sweetheart!!!

                                 ANDY
                             (outraged)
                        YOU ARE NOT TOM HANKS!

                                 BREEDA
                        How did you even- What number did 
                        you give her?
                                 AUSTIN
                        I gave her a google number I 
                        forwarded to my phone. 

           Andy and Breeda GASP!

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I know, I know- this may have 
                        gotten...A little out of hand.

                                 ANDY
                        SHAAAAME.

                                 BREEDA
                        Austin. Tell her the truth.

                                 AUSTIN
                        I know. I’m going to do it. In 
                        person. 

           INT. JILL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A blocked number calling. Jill picks up.

                                 JILL
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

           INT. AUSTIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                                 AUSTIN
                        I can’t get up there without you.

           She smiles.

                                 JILL
                        Yes, you can.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Come with me. Please. Do you want 
                        me to humiliate myself?

           Jill thinks.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I deserve it if you do. But- 
                        I’ll make it up to you! With a 
                        grand tour of an exotic land 
                        called... NEW YORK CITY! 
           Jill smiles, slightly. He waits... 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Huh?! Spring in New York! Can’t 
                        beat it! 

           Austin sighs.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Please, Jill. 

           INT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY

           Jill makes her way through JFK. She spots Austin holding a 
           sign:

                                   Austin Vallone Tours

                                 JILL
                        WOoow. I think we need to dial it 
                        back a little bit...

           He pulls her in, kissing her.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Austin and Jill enter the busy rehearsal dinner. They make 
           their way over to Breeda and Andy. They exchange warm hugs 
           and kisses.  

           Later...

           Andy makes a speech:

                                 ANDY
                        She finally said yes. Sixth time’s 
                        a charm! 

           Everyone cheers. Under the table, Austin takes Jill’s hand, 
           interlocking fingers. 

                                 AUSTIN
                             (a whisper)
                        I’m glad you’re here. 

                                 JILL
                        Me too.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Your hands are cold.
           He pulls his suit jacket around her, warming her up. She 
           gazes at him. He looks happy. Childlike.  

                                 JILL
                        Gonna run to the restroom. 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Jill makes her way through the hallway. Smitten.

           She pulls her cell out of her clutch. Dialing Isabelle. Face 
           flushed.

           SUDDENLY- vibrating. A phone. Huh? 

           She hangs up her own cell. The vibrating stops.

           She calls one more time - That vibrating, again.

           She looks in Austin’s jacket pocket. She pulls out his phone.

           There on the screen:

                                           JILL

           She shakes her head, looking at the two phones - then at 
           Austin. He smiles at her from his seat - oblivious. He sees 
           her speed towards the exit. He gets up, rushing after her. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Jill-

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT 

           She spins around.

                                 JILL
                        Why is my sister’s number connected 
                        to your phone?

           He stops cold as she hands him his phone and jacket. His face 
           says it all. Jill backs away.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Wait - hold on-
                        Jill- it’s a crazy story. I... I 
                        inherited your sister’s phone 
                        number. After she died- I guess.

                                 JILL
                        She died in November.
           He looks away. Jill feels suddenly nauseous.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been listening to my 
                        voicemails.

           He nods.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        ...All this time?

                                 AUSTIN
                        I... I was going to tell you-

                                 JILL
                        Oh my GOD. 

           She covers her mouth.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Oh my GOD- I’m gonna die. That’s 
                        so...Invasive. Those were PRIVATE. 
                        Why didn’t you tell me that you 
                        were getting them?

                                 AUSTIN
                        I was going to. That was the plan. 
                        To come to LA and tell you.

                                 JILL
                        So you planned the whole..? Then 
                        what? Why did you just let me...

           It hits her.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        OH MY GOD... You let me talk about 
                        YOU- and my...

                                 AUSTIN
                        Wait.

           It sets in.

                                 JILL
                        Is that...? That’s why you pulled 
                        away...You heard me talk about my 
                        feelings.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Yes. And I got freaked out. For a 
                        minute. But I’m ok now!

           She nods and begins walking away down the street.
                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        No, no - don’t go-

                                 JILL
                        You LIED TO ME! About EVERYTHING-

                                 AUSTIN
                        Not everything- I-
                        Jill. I listened to those 
                        voicemails and..I couldn’t stop. I 
                        needed to be close to you. I’ve 
                        never been as close to anyone as 
                        you are to your sister. And I 
                        just... THIS freaked me out at 
                        first but...
                        ...You’re not alone. Not anymore. I 
                        want to be there. I realized - I 
                        want to do this.

           She stares at him. In disbelief.

                                 JILL
                        Those voicemails were not FOR YOU, 
                        Austin. This is not about YOU. 
                        Those voicemails weren’t a plea to 
                        the universe: Send me a man so that 
                        I’m not alone anymore!  

           She starts to tear. The truth is harder to verbalize when 
           there’s a human standing right in front of you. Her voice 
           cracks as she speaks-

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        I don’t need a boyfriend. 
                        What I NEED... 
                        Is my little sister back.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Jill...

           She’s gone. He stands. Alone on the New York street. 

           INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

           Jill looks out the small, plane window. Another piece of her, 
           chipping away. Another loss.

           INT. JILL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jill enters her apartment. She collapses onto her bed. 
           She picks up her phone. No vm’s. No one to call. She starts 
           to cry - curling into a ball. She stares at her phone.

           INT. PARENT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           ABBA BLARES. Mom jerks awake. Discombobulated. She grabs the 
           phone off her nightstand.

                                 MOM
                        It’s Jill! It’s Jill-

           She picks up.

                                 MOM (CONT’D)
                        Jill?! Jill- What’s wrong?

           INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

                                 JILL
                        Nothing Mom- you’re supposed to put 
                        your phone on silent at night- 

           Her Mom clutches her chest, catching her breath.

                                 MOM
                        Oh my GOD-

                                 JILL
                        Sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you up-

                                 MOM
                        Are you ok? Jill? 

           Silence on the other end as Jill’s eyes tear. She shakes her 
           head. No.

                                 JILL
                             (voice cracking)
                        Can you just... talk to me...For a 
                        little bit?

           For the first time, Jill shares her pain. Splitting it in 
           half to bear the load. Her Mom nods.

                                 MOM
                        Yes, honey. Yes. Always. 

                                 JILL
                        I’m not doing so well, Mom. 
                                 MOM
                        Honey...
                        I know you think Izzy was the legs 
                        of the operation... So sometimes 
                        you forget...You have legs of your 
                        own. You’ve always been so brave, 
                        too, my Jilly. 

           Jill closes her eyes. If only she could feel it. 

           INT. NEW YORK HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Austin helps Andy get ready in his tux.

                                 AUSTIN
                        You ready?

                                 ANDY
                             (nervously)
                        Yeah - I think so.

                                 AUSTIN
                        That was a rhetorical question- She 
                        is so out of your league I’m not 
                        totally convinced this isn’t a case 
                        of human trafficking. 

                                 ANDY
                        I know, right?

           They hug.

           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - LATER

           CLINK CLINK CLINK! Austin holds the mic. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Hey everyone, I’m Austin...The 
                        eternal bachelor friend. Andy and 
                        Breeda are the siblings I never 
                        had. SO- I tried to warn them that 
                        marriage is a terrible bet. The 
                        stats back me up. Shall we go over 
                        the divorce rate? 

           The crowd laughs and boos- (New Yorkers).

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Come find me at the bar, I’m happy 
                        to share.

           Andy shakes his head - this better improve soon.
                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        The cynical old man in me thinks 
                        that anyone that takes the plunge 
                        is out of their minds. 
                        But you guys...You guys would be 
                        out of your minds not to. I’m not 
                        much of a gambler... But I’d bet my 
                        life savings on you two. 

           He smiles at his two best friends in the world.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I’d bet my life on you two. 
                        You guys make me believe that maybe 
                        some things in life are rigged in 
                        our favor. 

           Andy smiles, looking at Breeda - getting a little choked up. 
           Austin raises his glass.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        To Breeda and Andy: You’ve made a 
                        believer out of me. 

           The room aaaaaw’s and applauds. Breeda and Andy kiss. Austin 
           smiles, proudly. He did it. 

           Slowly...His smile fades. The feeling of triumph- short-
           lived. If only Jill were here.

           INT. WRITER’S ROOM - DAY

           Jill gazes out the window. It’s sunny and warm outside on the 
           lot. All day, everyday. Like hell. 

                                 JAY
                        Right now it feels very...Cordial. 
                        Where are the claws? The cat fight. 
                        Jill- you hearing this?

           She nods. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Next pass- I need to see 
                        some...RAAAWWR. I need to see some 
                        blood between the women. I wanna 
                        see the red wedding. 

           She looks around the room at the nodding heads. 

           On her laptop screen: A pic of Isabelle and her as little 
           girls. Smiling in hideous matching outfits.

                             (softly)
                        No.

                                 JAY
                        What?

                                 JILL
                        I’m not writing another petty 
                        female feud. Get Mark to write it.

                                 JAY
                        This is your episode, Jill.

                                 JILL
                        Well not all female relationships 
                        are jealous and petty and I’m not 
                        going to be part of the 
                        proliferation of that stereotype. I 
                        did not leave my home and my family 
                        to write this crap for a future 
                        generation.

                                 JAY
                        They are literally rivals-

                                 JILL
                        Why? Why are they rivals? 
                        Because they’re both Latina women?

                                 JAY
                        Because they are both secretaries 
                        and this is television 
                        entertainment which requires 
                        ANTAGONISTS. 

                                 JILL
                        So make the boss the antagonist. 
                        Maybe the BOSS doesn’t know how 
                        female relationships work because 
                        he’s NOT A FEMALE. MAYBE he’s 
                        pitting his secretaries against one 
                        other! Maybe the BOSS is under-
                        qualified for his job but got ahead 
                        because of his whiteness and man-
                        ness and CONNECTEDNESS.

                                 JAY
                        Interesting. No one will buy that. 

                                 JILL
                        Cool. I quit. Thank you for 
                        allowing me to fill your vagina 
                        quota.

                                 JILL (CONT'D)
                        Feel free to name a 
                        hooker/stewardess character after 
                        me. 

                                 JAY
                        You’re under contract, Jill. 

                                 JILL
                        Then fire me because I cannot take 
                        another second of your unsolicited 
                        Ted talks on women’s mood swings, 
                        menopause, bras, MOTHERHOOD - THAT 
                        was fun- 

                                 JAY
                        Jill, I don’t know if you know this- 
                        but I have two daughters and happen 
                        to be MARRIED to a woman-

                                 JILL
                        JAY- I don’t know if YOU know this, 
                        but I happen to BE a woman- 
                        Don’t interrupt me.

                                 JAY
                        There’s more?

                                 JILL
                        Oh, I’m just getting started. The 
                        ratings are embarrassing. And how - 
                        HOW could that be, JAY? Hmmm...

           She sticks her finger to her lips.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        It’s coming to me... It’s coming to 
                        me....Because this show is an 
                        EXPLOSION IN A STUPID FACTORY! I 
                        wouldn’t watch it if you PAID me. 
                        Literally. You pay me to watch this 
                        show and I DO NOT watch it. 

           He nods, knowlingly- walks over, leaning in.

                                 JAY
                             (stage whisper)
                        Is it that time of the month?

           Jill leans in.
                                 JILL
                        You know, actually - Jay. It made 
                        me very uncomfortable when you 
                        commented on how curvaceous I 
                        looked after taco Tuesday...

           Jay’s blood runs cold. The #metoo demon has been awakened.

                                 JAY
                        You can work from home, no prob. 

           He opens up to the room.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Teamwork makes the dream work.

                                 JILL
                        I’ll finish writing this episode. 
                        And in this next draft- I’ll be 
                        making the BOSS the bad guy.  

                                 JAY
                        I think that could work.

                                 JILL
                        You’ll have it by the end of the 
                        week. And I won’t be taking any 
                        notes from Mansplaining Mark so 
                        don’t even bother forming opinions, 
                        Mark.

           Mark starts to protest. She shoots him the look of death.

           Jay’s phone alarm goes off - he rushes to silence it. 

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Well, whattaya know. TIME’S UP.

           Jill grabs the fruit bowl from the center of the table. She 
           starts to hustle out - stopping to take the banana out of a 
           Male Writer’s hand, throwing it in her bowl. 

           EXT. CBS LOT - AFTERNOON

           Jill struts through the lot with her fruit bowl, smile on her 
           face. R-E-S-P-E-C-T playing in her head. MAN, that felt good.

           INT. CULVER HOTEL - DAY

           Jill types like the wind while sipping on a latte. 
           To her right - a long table of LADIES, dressed up in pastel 
           dresses squeal and exchange kisses. A tea party bridal 
           shower. Jill puts on her headphones to drown out the noise 
           and continues her grind.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES OVERLOOK - NIGHT

           Jill eats Taco Bell - reading some of her dialogue aloud. A 
           car pulls up next to her... 

           Austin steps out. Jill’s jaw goes slack.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Hey.

                                 JILL
                        Holy shit...What are you doing 
                        here?

                                 AUSTIN
                        I... I had to see you. And tell 
                        you... 

           He takes a deep breath. He rehearsed this. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Jill...I... I’m really...Shit. I...

           He looks to her. Get it out, Austin. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I’m really sorry, Jill. 
                        I...I should’ve told you. Many 
                        times. And I didn’t. I chickened 
                        out. I was selfish.

           He can barely make eye contact. She feels his guilt.

                                 JILL
                        I forgive you. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Wait...Really?

                                 JILL
                        Yeah.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Great! Awesome. Ok! 

           He nods his head, sighing with relief. He looks at her face. 
           She looks deep in thought.
                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Can I...Kiss you?

           She steps back.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Ok. You need some time? That’s 
                        fine-

           She shakes her head, looking out at the city

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I can give you space? Or whatever 
                        you-

                                 JILL
                        I can’t, Austin. I can’t do this.
                        I do forgive you. I’ve kinda got a 
                        lot on my plate and...I don’t 
                        really have a whole lot of energy 
                        to hate anyone. Plus- at this 
                        point, I’m pretty used to 
                        humiliating myself, anyway.
                        But the truth is...All I do all day 
                        long is piece myself back together 
                        with tape and...Elmers glue. I’m 
                        like a Mr. Potato Head that keeps 
                        getting blown up over and over. And 
                        my nose is here, and my eyes are 
                        over here-

           She points at her butt and elbow.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        And I can’t do it anymore. This is 
                        going to sound pathetic and sad but 
                        since TMI is my middle name- I’m 
                        just going to say it: If I jump 
                        back into this-- all in - because 
                        that’s just who I AM... And you 
                        hurt me...Theres a good chance I 
                        don’t survive that. 

           She tenses. Fighting that ache beneath her eyes. She REALLY 
           doesn’t wanna cry. She’s sick of crying.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        And... I need to survive. 
                        It would be great if it could work 
                        out just like the movies... Plug in 
                        the guy and everything’s suddenly 
                        perfect! But it’s not like the 
                        movies. There’s a hole in me. 
                        Forever, I guess. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        And I don’t want any more men 
                        hanging out in that hole, for as 
                        long as it’s fun or easy or sexy or 
                        whatever...Until they decide to 
                        leave. 
                        I’m not referring to my vagina by 
                        the way... 

                                 AUSTIN
                        No, I got that. 

           She nods. Cool.

                                 JILL
                        I’ve gotta protect what’s left... 
                        Of me. 

           He nods. Wracking his brain for the words.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Jill, I...

           She waits. Wanting him to fight her. C’mon, Austin. 

           Instead - he hugs her. She closes her eyes. That was it.

           INT. AUSTIN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Austin looks out the window at the city. Millions of people. 
           No one concerned with his heartbreak. 

           He swipes on Tinder. Girl with dog, girl with dog, girl wine 
           tasting, girl with dog...

           He writes a message to a BEAUTY:

                                Hey, how’s your day, Kiki?

           He gets a message back.

                                 It’s good! How’s yours?

           He puts his phone down. Already exhausted.

           INT. WRITER’S ROOM - DAY 

           The team is gathered. 

                                 MARK
                        It’s a season’s worth of twists and 
                        reveals jammed into one episode! 
                                 JAY
                        That’s a fair assessment, 
                        Mansplaining Mark.

           Jill walks in. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Look- our staff writer decided to 
                        join us! We were just talking about 
                        your episode. 

                                 MARK
                        It’s a completely different show-

                                 JAY
                        You’re prepping it. 

                                 JILL
                        For real?

                                 JAY
                        Yep. Shoots in six weeks. 

           Jill smiles. Mansplaining Mark looks close to tears.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        You look nice today. I mean that in 
                        a very appropriate, consensual way.

           A Montage as Jill preps:

           -Jill preps the episode with the production team

           -Austin leads a tour of a new Brooklyn office space

           - Jill writes at 101 Coffee Shop - eating a burger

           -Austin goes on a date with another gorgeous MODEL type. He 
           struggles to pay attention

           -Jill laughs with her Mom on the phone

           -Austin gets a honeymoon postcard from Bali from Andy and 
           Breeda 

           -At the cafe, a CUTE GUY eyes Jill. She puts on her 
           headphones, focusing on her script. Not today, Satan

           And finally...
           INT. SOUNDSTAGE - LATE NIGHT 

           A hot set. It’s been a LONG day and the lead actor CLIFF 
           (60s, best known for the M*A*S*H knockoff your parents never 
           watched and his borderline racist rants captured by TMZ) is 
           having an issue on his first take of his first scene. As 
           usual.

                                 CLIFF
                        Why would Benicio say this? Benicio 
                        is an ALPHA. Am I wrong? Am I 
                        WRONG, Jerry? What the fuck do you 
                        know, you’re a cameraman.

           Cliff looks around at the frightened PA’s and grips. 

                                 CLIFF (CONT’D)
                        My character isn’t going to be 
                        pushed around by his secretaries. 
                        It’s inconsistent! I played Richard 
                        III. Did you know that? Where’s the 
                        writer?

           Jill is ushered over. She pulls the headphones off her ears, 
           nervously.

                                 JILL 
                        Hey, Cliff. What’s up?

           Cliff puts an arm around her shoulder. His hand, basically 
           cupping her boob. Her eyes peer down as she tries not to 
           notice. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Listen sweetheart- This would never 
                        happen.

                                 JILL
                        What wouldn’t?

                                 CLIFF
                        Anything in this episode. Benicio 
                        would never say this. 

                                 JILL
                        Well, he IS saying it- it’s there 
                        on the page so... 

           Cliff cackles. He looks down at her with a look of pity.

                                 CLIFF
                        I totally get it - this is probably 
                        your first time on a set. Maybe no 
                        one told you how this works. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLIFF (CONT'D)
                        Well, I have an EMMY. This is not 
                        my first ro-

                                 JILL
                             (under her breath)
                        A Daytime Emmy.

           The Cameraman stifles a laugh.

                                 CLIFF
                        Huh?

                                 JILL
                        I said you have a Daytime Emmy. You 
                        know what’s impressive about a 
                        Daytime Emmy?

                                 CLIFF
                        What?

                                 JILL
                        NOTHING. Who doesn’t have a Daytime 
                        Emmy? I think my uber driver 
                        yesterday had one. Now if you’re 
                        done jerking off to your fake Emmy - 
                        let’s talk about the scene.

                                 CLIFF
                        Is this a joke?

                                 JILL
                        Look- I know you liked your lines 
                        better when they were written by 
                        straight, white guys - I know they 
                        were easier for you to UNDERSTAND  - 
                        but NEWSFLASH--- this is the worst 
                        rated show on the worst rated  
                        network - so stop acting like 
                        you’re Daniel Day fucking Lewis and 
                        do your JOB because here’s a little 
                        insider info, SWEETHEART: the only 
                        reason you’re here is because Luke 
                        Perry wasn’t available. And now 
                        you’re holding up production AS 
                        USUAL so we can all tickle your 
                        testies but we are three hours 
                        behind schedule. Read the words on 
                        the page in a tone that somewhat 
                        resembles a living human being, 
                        collect your overgrown paycheck and 
                        GO HOME, Sugartits, cuz we’re all 
                        tired. 

           She spins around as Cliff seethes. 
                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        OH- and you can drop the community 
                        theatre British accent because we 
                        all know you’re from Baltimore.

                                 CLIFF
                        SOMEBODY GET ME JAY NOW. 

           Jill starts heading back to video village-

                                 CLIFF (CONT’D)
                        NO- YOU don’t go anywhere!!! NOBODY 
                        MOVE.

           Jay appears, rushing over. 

                                 JAY
                        What’s the problem, Cliff. 

           Cliff pulls him aside. Jay nods as Cliff has a full-blown 
           meltdown. Jill closes her eyes. This is bad. Very bad. Stella 
           got her groove back, but Stella is about to get FIRED. 
           Finally- Jay leans in to Cliff.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                             (a whisper)
                        She’s right. Just say the words. 

                                 CLIFF
                        Did you just hear what I said? Is 
                        everybody fucking HIGH on this 
                        set?!

           Jay puts a hand on his shoulder.

                                 JAY
                        CLIFF- Luke Perry is now available. 
                        We could switch you out mid-scene 
                        and no one would notice. Say the 
                        lines so we can all go home. 

           Jill stares wide-eyed as Jay storms past her, off set.

           EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Jay speed walks as Jill rushes to catch up. 

                                 JILL
                        Jay-

                                 JAY
                        Would you, PLEASE, stop trying to 
                        get fired?
                                 JILL
                        That time I honestly wasn’t- I 
                        don’t really know what possessed me-

                                 JAY
                        Well could you stop getting 
                        possessed by demons and do YOUR job 
                        because Luke Perry is not actually 
                        available.

                                 JILL
                        You’re not going to fire me?

                                 JAY
                        Not today.

                                 JILL
                        Why not?

                                 JAY
                        I hired you. Believe it or not- 
                        because I happen to think you’re 
                        good. You’re a royal pain in my ass 
                        - but you’re good.

           Jill looks away. Overcome.

                                 JILL
                        Thank you. For backing me up, Jay.

           He nods, softening.

                                 JAY
                        You’ve got balls, kid.

           She smiles- forcing a hug. Jay bristles. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Ok, ok. Get back to work, 
                        Sugartits.

           Jill puts her headphones on and marches back to set.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

           Identical shot of palm trees, the blue sky and the blazing 
           sun.

           Super:                    November
           INT. JILL’S KITCHEN - THANKSGIVING

           Jill heats water, making a cup of noodle while talking to Mom 
           on the phone. 

                                 MOM (V.O.)
                        You don’t wanna go to - what do 
                        they call it- a Friendsgiving?

                                 JILL
                        Nah- I’m tired. I’m gonna watch 
                        Showgirls.

           Her Mom has a look of worry on her face.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Don’t give me that look.

                                 MOM (V.O.)
                        What look? You can’t even see me.

                                 JILL
                        You know what look. I’m fine. 
                        I just...I can’t believe it’s been 
                        a year. It feels like...I aged 10 
                        years without her.

                                 MOM V.O. 
                        I know. 
                        (beat)
                        We love you, Jilly. Lots of people 
                        love you... And will love you. If 
                        you let them. Not just Izzy.

           Like a knife. 

                                 JILL
                        Love you, too. I’ll see you soon.

           Jill stands alone in her studio, cup of noodle in hand. 

           EXT. PIER - SUNSET 

           Cliff (as BENICIO) stands opposite LUCIA (20s, Colombiana, 
           busty and GORGEOUS, straight out of a telenovela).

                                 CLIFF
                        I saw you from across the room. And 
                        It was this instant feeling...Of 
                        certainty. This involuntary 
                        response- like goosebumps. And I 
                        felt it in my bones -  like how 
                        birds know when a storm is brewing. 
           DAMN. He’s actually pretty good. Might even be better than 
           Luke Perry. He’s gunnin’ for a REAL Emmy. The monologue plays 
           over...

           INT. JILL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jill watches the episode with FRIENDS- Friends she hasn’t 
           seen in forever. She glances over to clock their reactions, 
           nervously. They are entranced, munching on popcorn. 

                                 CLIFF (V.O.)
                        I knew something big was coming. 
                        And I couldn’t play it cool if I 
                        tried. 

           INT. SHAW HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT

           In New York...Mom and Dad watch. They clasp hands. Proud.

                                 CLIFF (V.O.)
                        There’s nothing cool about what I 
                        feel for you, Lucia. It’s powerful 
                        and all-consuming and desperate 
                        and... Scary. 

           INT. AUSTIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Austin watches. His heart - sinking. 

                                 CLIFF (V.O.)
                        Since the MOMENT I saw you. I 
                        didn’t stand a chance. You’re the 
                        perfect storm. 

           INT. JILL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           As it cuts to commercial break...Everyone CHEERS!!!! Wiping 
           at their faces, hugging Jill and exclaiming how randomly epic 
           that shit was.

           Later...

           Jill hugs the last remaining Friends.

                                 FRIEND
                        It’s so good to see you, Jill. 
                        We’ve missed you! 
                                 JILL
                        Missed you guys, too. You’ll be 
                        seeing more of me. I promise.

           They hug her and head out. She smiles and checks her phone.

           A text from Dad:

                                  Have you seen these?!

           He sends links:

                Pinewood Shores Did Not Make Me want to Punch Myself in the 
                                       Face Tonight

                       Pinewood Shores May Not Get Canned After All

           Jill smiles proudly. She DID IT.

           INT. WRITER'S ROOM - DAY

           Jill enters the office. Everyone applauds. Including 
           Mansplaining Mark. (?!?!) Jill takes an awkward bow.

           INT. CBS LOT -  COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Jill watches a youtube clip of Cliff on E! News on her iPhone 
           while at the condiment bar.

                                 CLIFF
                        I told the writers I wanted a more 
                        fleshed out character and they 
                        finally listened. When I played 
                        Richard III...

           She smiles, shaking her head. She goes to reach for the cream 
           and notices beside her, adding sugar to her coffee:

                           Shonda MOTHAF***IN Rhimes!!!!!!!!!!!!

           Jill freezes and stares- time standing still.

                                 JILL
                        Oh My GOD. You’re Shonda Rhimes...

                                 SHONDA
                        Hi-

                                 JILL
                        I’m...I’m ...I came to Hollywood to 
                        BE YOU.
                                 SHONDA
                        Oh, yeah?

                                 JILL
                        I’m Jill. I’m the staff writer on 
                        Pinewood Shores-

                                 SHONDA
                        It’s a sausage fest over there, 
                        huh? Oh, wait- you’re the one that 
                        told Cliff Jones he had a fake Emmy-

                                 JILL
                        Oh - I didn’t mean-

                                 SHONDA
                        It’s about time someone told him.

           Jill’s eyes go wide. 

                                 SHONDA (CONT’D)
                        And you wrote last week’s episode, 
                        right?

                                 JILL
                        I did!

                                 SHONDA
                        Good stuff. They’re lucky to have 
                        you in that room.

                                 JILL
                        Oh My God. I’m gonna cry. Or puke. 
                        Cry and puke all over you.

                                 SHONDA
                        Please don’t. 
                        You should come meet with my team. 
                        I’ll have my office set something 
                        up.

                                 JILL
                        HO-LY SHIT. 

                                 SHONDA
                        Nice to meet you, Jill. Happy 
                        Holidays.

                                 JILL
                        You too... Shonda Rhimes. 

           Shonda heads to the door. 
                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                             (under her breath)
                        You smell of vanilla and promise.

           EXT. CBS LOT - COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Shonda walks down the walkway when she hears Jill squeal from 
           the top of her lungs. A BARISTA spills all over himself. 
           Shonda smiles and keeps walking. LIKE A BOSS.

           INT. SHAW HOUSEHOLD - CHRISTMAS

           Jill struggles into the house carrying her luggage. Her 
           parents exclaim, rushing in and pulling her into a group hug.

           They decorate the tree. Hang up the stockings. Jill ties one 
           next to her own: In stitching it reads Isabelle. They bake 
           cookies. Open gifts. 

           INT. AUSTIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Austin looks out at the snowy New York street from his 
           Tribeca apartment. He stares at the cordless phone in his 
           hand. He dials. Hangs up. Dials again. He clears his throat. 

                                 JILL (V.O.)
                             (pre-recorded greeting)
                        You’ve reached Jill. Do the thing! 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Hey. Jill. It’s Austin. I’m calling 
                        you from my landline. Remember 
                        those? Haha. Ummm. So I checked out 
                        your episode. It was..AWESOME. You 
                        killed it... 

           He shifts. Why is this so hard?

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Umm...And I wanted to let you 
                        know... I got a new cell 
                        number...So you can continue to 
                        call Isabelle’s voicemail. I paid 
                        for it through next year. I can 
                        extend it longer, too. For as long 
                        as you want. No one will be 
                        listening. Just Isabelle. 

           He holds the receiver. He has more to say. He shouldn’t. He 
           opens his mouth...
                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        You probably have plans 
                        tonight...With your parents or 
                        friends but... Ummm..I was thinking 
                        I would...Just lay low...Probably 
                        grab some soup dumplings...But I’m 
                        sure you’ve...Got places to be 
                        so... I’m not even sure if you’re 
                        in town. But umm...Happy New Year, 
                        Jill. 
                        I...I hope you’re well.

           He hangs up. Going over the replay in his head. Unsettled.

           BANG BANG BANG!!! Austin perks up. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Coming!

           He opens the door. Standing before him - a VERY attractive, 
           VERY charming older man - GRAYSON (60s, a panty dropper 
           silver fox like Pierce Brosnan. Actually- Is Pierce Brosnan 
           available?)

                                 GRAYSON
                        C’mon Anne Frank - we are going 
                        out!

           Grayson pushes in past Austin with a rolling suitcase.

                                 AUSTIN
                        DAD- what are you - 

                                 GRAYSON
                        I heard you got your heart broken 
                        and no son of mine is staying home 
                        on New Year’s crying like he’s on 
                        his rag.

                                 AUSTIN
                        I have plans..I’m getting Chinese 
                        food tonight. Alone.

                                 GRAYSON
                        What are you - a fat divorcée from 
                        Ohio?  We‘re going to Breeda and 
                        Andy’s party. Go get in the shower. 

           INT. JILL’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jill plays Austin’s message on speaker for her parents. 
                                 AUSTIN (V.O.)
                        I...I hope you’re well.

                                 DAD
                        He paid for Isabelle’s line for the 
                        WHOLE YEAR?

                                 MOM
                        Forever, if you want...

                                 DAD
                        He’s lost his mind.

                                 JILL
                        It doesn’t matter. I’m spending New 
                        Years with you guys. Watching 
                        Showgirls. 

                                 DAD
                        I didn’t agree to that.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Gina Gershon is onscreen as the ICONIC Cristal Connors. Jill 
           sits between her parents mouthing every word. 

                                 CRISTAL CONNORS (O.S.)
                        Doggy chow. I used to lOVE Doggy 
                        chow.

                                 DAD
                        This is the worst movie I have ever 
                        seen.

                                 JILL AND MOM
                        SHHHH!!!!

           Jill’s phone dings with a voicemail - she gets up, stepping 
           away to listen.

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        Hi Jill - This is Fahrenheit 3000. 
                        AKA- Felix. From the Apple store. 
                        I’m sorry for the wait. Had a funny 
                        little run-in with the Feds.

           He chuckles. Jill makes a face- wait what?

                                 FELIX (V.O.)
                        ANYWAY...Unfortunately, I was only 
                        able to retrieve one of your 
                        voicemails from the number you gave 
                        me. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FELIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It was the only one left on the 
                        server. It’s an old one- but I hope 
                        it helps. I texted you the file. 
                        Happy New Year. 

           INT. ISABELLE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jill shuts her door for some privacy. She takes a deep breath 
           - pressing play on the m4a. 

                                 ISABELLE (V.O.)
                        Hello? Hello! Sorry I think this is 
                        the wrong number- 

           Izzy’s voice. Jill covers her mouth. She sits down, the air 
           knocked out of her. 

                                 ISABELLE (V.O.)
                        I was looking for my big sister 
                        Jill- maybe you’ve heard of her? My 
                        sister Jill who beat the crap out 
                        of Colin Corwin for talkin’ smack 
                        after their first kiss?

           Jill smiles, her eyes welling up. 

                                 ISABELLE V.O.
                        My sister Jill who wrote a play 
                        about her vagina called The 
                        Tribulations of a Curly Haired Girl 
                        named Gertrude! My sister Jill who 
                        moved cross country to be a big 
                        Hollywood heavyweight! My sister 
                        that is the smartest, funniest, 
                        baddest bitch on the block! 
                        (Shitty Mufasa/James Earl Jones 
                        voice)
                        “Simba, remember who you aaaare.” 
                        That was...not my best.

           Izzy giggles at herself. 

                                 ISABELLE V.O. (CONT’D)
                        When I grow up I wanna be just like 
                        my big sister Jilly. You’re gonna 
                        kill it today, bucko! Call me after 
                        your interview! Love you!

           Jill laughs through her tears. A flame behind her eyes. She 
           nods her head. She needed that.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jill rushes into the living room, pulling on her coat.

                                 JILL
                        You guys hungry?

           Mom takes the piece of pizza out of her mouth, throwing it 
           back into the full pizza box.

                                 MOM
                        Starving.

                                 DAD
                        I was thinking-

                            MOM
                                                      DAD (CONT'D)
           Soup dumplings.
                                              Soup dumplings.

                                 DAD (CONT’D)
                        Mind picking them up?

           He grabs his wallet and hands her a wad of cash. 

                                 JILL
                        Thanks Padre.

           INT. JOE’S SHANGHAI - NIGHT

           Jill bursts through the doors of the dumpling house. The 
           place is dead. No Austin. Her heart sinks. She takes off her 
           coat and has a seat at a table alone. 

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

           Austin sips champagne in the corner of the party. Across the 
           room, three TWENTY SOMETHINGS giggle and fawn over Grayson. 
           Grayson spots Austin sulking and excuses himself.

                                 GRAYSON
                        Oh my. This girl really did a 
                        number on you.

                                 AUSTIN
                        It’s my own doing, really. 

                                 GRAYSON
                        What was it about this one?

                                 AUSTIN
                        I don’t know... 
                        She had so much to say. About...

                                 AUSTIN (CONT'D)
                        everything. She was born without a 
                        filter. And she can’t lie to save 
                        her life. She gets so excited about 
                        the smallest, most random things. 
                        She loves terrible TV. She MAKES 
                        terrible TV. Her favorite movie is 
                        Showgirls- You seen that?

                                 GRAYSON
                        Horrible film.

                                 AUSTIN
                        SO BAD. But her laugh...It was..
                        Yeah. I blew it. 

           Grayson nods. Understanding.

                                 GRAYSON
                        How? 

                                 AUSTIN
                        I lied. And... She gave me an 
                        opening to save it and...I didn’t. 
                        I didn’t say anything. I AM 
                        emotionally inept. 

                                 GRAYSON
                        Well.. I hate to admit it, but you 
                        got that from me, kid. 

           That was a rare admission. Austin studies his Dad.

                                 AUSTIN
                        What was it.. About Mom? How did 
                        you know she was..It.

           Grayson throws back the champagne in his glass.

                                 GRAYSON
                        I knew...When I put the toilet seat 
                        down.

           Austin stares.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Sorry I asked.

           Grayson looks away. 

                                 GRAYSON
                        I wanted to change for her. I 
                        wanted to feel like... I deserved 
                        her. And... she deserved all of me. 
                        That woman deserved the best of me. 
           Grayson’s eyes get a little foggy. Austin doesn’t know what 
           to do.

                                 GRAYSON (CONT’D)
                        I’ll tell you one thing, son. If 
                        she were still here...I’d use EVERY 
                        word in the whole damn English 
                        language, til she understood how 
                        much I love her.

           Austin is shook. He’s NEVER heard his Dad talk like this.

                                 ANDY
                             (calling out)
                        30 minutes!

           Everyone cheers. Breeda and Andy make their way over with a 
           bottle of champagne.

                                 BREEDA
                        Let’s fill you up-

                                 AUSTIN
                        I’ve gotta go.

           Austin grabs his coat. Breeda and Andy exchange a look. IT’S 
           ABOUT DAMN TIME.

                                 BREEDA
                        Austin- if she’s there. What’re you 
                        going to say?

           He stops cold. 

                                 ANDY
                        Please for the love of GOD, don’t 
                        screw this up AGAIN-

                                 AUSTIN
                        Ok. I...Uh...I... 

                                 ANDY
                        Good start.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Jill. I...We...And...I...

           He struggles through. Breeda grabs Austin’s face like a 
           roided up NFL coach.

                                 BREEDA
                        Use your words. Your words, 
                        Austin!! Tell her the truth- tell 
                        her how you feel!!!
                                 ANDY
                        Google something from an obscure 
                        French film!

                                 BREEDA
                        You’ve got this.

           He nods. 

                                 GRAYSON
                        ...This is the part where you run, 
                        kid.

           Austin kisses Breeda - then Andy. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Happy New Year.

           He rushes out. 

                                 ANDY
                             (calling out)
                        Good luck! You’re doomed!

           Austin turns back around. Looking to Grayson.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Thanks, Dad. I...I love you.

           Grayson smiles.

                                 GRAYSON
                        I love you, too, son.

           They exchange an awkward, long overdue hug. Austin speeds 
           out. Andy and Breeda are misty eyed from what they witnessed.

                                 ANDY
                        I’m not drunk enough for this. 

                                 GRAYSON AND BREEDA
                        SHOTS.

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT

           Austin runs through the New York streets, in the snow. Past 
           the drunk tourists. Weaving through the cabs as they honk. 

           INT. JOE’S SHANGHAI - NIGHT

           The staff vacuums up around Jill. The restaurant is closed 
           and empty. It’s a pathetic sight. 
           The CHINESE WAITER slaps a check on the table and begins 
           forcefully taking her plates and silverware away-

                                 JILL
                        Wait, Ming-

           She grabs the last remaining dumpling. Stuffing it whole in 
           her mouth as everything on the table is removed.

           She grabs her wad of cash, paying the bill - she looks up as 
           the door JINGLES loudly- swinging open.

           Austin enters - covered in snow, sweaty and out of breath. 
           She’s here. He made it.

                                 WAITER
                        CLOSED!

                                 AUSTIN
                        Sorry- I’m here for her...

           He braces himself, making his way over. Jill is frozen. Her 
           cheeks full like a chipmunk. She tries to open her mouth to 
           say something-

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Wait. I...I have something to say.

           It’s game time, Austin. Now or never. He takes a deep breath. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I love you, Jill.
                        In a very un-dialed back, 
                        uncool...Desperate, all-consuming 
                        way. 
                        But it wasn’t from the moment I saw 
                        you. 
                        It was before then.

           Her eyes begin to fill.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        And...It’s scary. And....I’m 
                        Scared. 
                        But...You make me feel brave. You 
                        make me feel.. everything.   

           He feels naked. That was the truth.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        A lot of that was plagiarized. I 
                        stole part of that from my favorite 
                        writer.
           She tries to laugh. She struggles to swallow. She chews- 
           Finally-

                                 JILL
                        I love you, too. 
                        And... It’s scary. And I’m really 
                        scared.

                                 AUSTIN
                        At least we’re scared together. 
                        Right?

           She nods. Yeah. He leans in. Kissing her. She looks in his 
           eyes. Something is coming. Something big. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Mmmm... Soup dumpling.

                                 JILL
                        I’m your favorite writer?!

                                 AUSTIN
                        No- Mansplaining Mark is. Weren’t 
                        those his words?

           She cackles. The Chinese Waiter YELLS at them in Chinese to 
           get the FUCK OUT. They scurry off.

           INT. OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY

           Austin chats in his boss’ office.

                                 JIM
                        Century City is closed. Great 
                        quarter, Austin.

           Jim pats him on the back.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Jim- there wouldn’t happen to be 
                        any other... LA listings coming up?

           Jim grins.

                                 JIM
                        I was hoping you might say that.

           INT. CBS STUDIO OFFICES - DAY

           Jill is seated with Jay and the Executive Producers.
                                 JAY
                        You’ve done some great work here, 
                        Jill. But...We’re not going to be 
                        bringing you back next season.

           She nods her head - slightly disappointed.

                                 JILL
                        I understand. And I want thank you 
                        guys. You taught me a lot. And I’m 
                        grateful-

                                 JAY
                        If you would stop womansplaining 
                        for ONE second- 

           Jill stops cold.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        We’re not renewing your contract 
                        because you’re headed to 
                        Shondaland. Shonda wants to staff 
                        you on one of her-

                                 JILL
                        SHUT YOUR WHORE MOUTH YOU DIRTY 
                        BITCH!!!!!!!!!

           Jay shakes his head with a smile. He created a monster.

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Jill and Austin carry moving boxes into their new place. 

           They pop the champagne, spilling all over the floor.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

           That same goddamn shot of palm trees, the blue sky and the 
           blazing sun.

           Super:                  May

           EXT. THE HOLLYWOOD FOREVER CEMETERY - SUNSET

           The lawn of the Hollywood Forever Cemetery crawls with 
           hundreds of very trendy Angelenos. Everyone has their setup 
           for the outdoor movie screening: blankets, lawn chairs, wine, 
           cheese. A DJ spins and music blares from the speakers. Austin 
           and Jill get comfortable on their blanket. On the big screen:
                               Cinespia Presents: SHOWGIRLS 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Movie in the cemetery. This town is 
                        growing on me.

           He gives her a quick kiss. 

                                 JILL
                        Gonna grab napkins. BRB. 

           Once Jill is out of sight, Austin pulls out his phone. He 
           dials, nervously.

                                 ROBOT VOICEMAIL V.O.
                        You’ve reached 718-4569868 - please 
                        leave a message.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Hey... Isabelle. This is Austin. 
                        We have not met. But...I have heard 
                        A LOT about you. 
                        Ummm... I wanted to say...I love 
                        your sister. Thank you for leading 
                        me to her. 

           He takes a deep breath. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I wish I could do this in person 
                        but...Umm...I’d really love your 
                        blessing... Before I...Put a ring 
                        on it. That was a Beyoncé 
                        reference, HA!... I know I’m no 
                        replacement for you..But...I 
                        promise to watch your Shonda shows. 
                        And...I promise to always eat 
                        Chinese- even if I become an LA 
                        health nut. And I promise to 
                        partake in the Robyn dance 
                        parties... 
                        I’m sorry I never got to meet 
                        you... 
                        I always wanted a sister. 

           He nods.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        I’m not super familiar with this 
                        kind of thing so if you could just 
                        like... Give me a sign?...Something 
                        subtle- like a dove with a little 
                        note that says “YES AUSTIN”?
           Somewhere over by the vendors...

           Jill dials Isabelle.

                                 JILL
                        Izzy. 
                        Real quick. Gonna let you get back 
                        to margaritas with Grandpa and 
                        Elvis... 
                        This is...My last voicemail. 
                        Don’t worry about me, k? I’m ok. 
                        I’m gonna be ok. I think this 
                        Austin kid...I think he’s a bird. 
                        Like us.

           Jill gazes at him in the distance, talking on his cell.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        He can be stubborn. He does NOT get 
                        Grey’s or Scandal... And he acts 
                        like he’s too cool for school - but 
                        he’s not. He says he doesn’t dance 
                        but...I’m workin’ on it. 

           She smiles.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        I miss you, Bucko. I just needed to 
                        tell you... 

           A new song comes over the loud speakers. A strong BASS shakes 
           the earth.  

           “Dancing on My Own”

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God. 

           Jill’s eyes go wide.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        OH MY GOD!!! Izzy!!! It’s Robyn!!! 
                        It’s our song!!!!

           Jill sprints back towards the lawn.

           Speeding past Austin who is still leaving his message.

                                 AUSTIN
                             (into receiver)
                        Or like- the voice of God speaking 
                        into my ear---
                                 JILL
                        It’s ROBYN!!!!

                                 AUSTIN
                             (into the receiver)
                        Busted - gotta go!

           Jill grabs a giant, bearded stranger with a shirt that says - 
           JEWBACCA. Eyes tearing. 

                                 JILL
                        THIS IS ROBYN!!!!!

           The stranger stares- 

                                 JEWBACCA
                        WOO!!

           A WOMAN nearby munches on kettle corn.

                                 WOMAN
                        Bitch really loves Robyn...

           Jill reaches the center of the lawn. Bustin’ a move like 
           there’s no tomorrow. She lifts the phone in the air so 
           Isabelle can hear the song play.

           Everyone stares at the crazy dancing girl- slightly LA-
           judgey. Fuck it. She dances freely. Like no one is watching. 

           Austin peers up at the sky. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Well played.

           Jewbacca joins her. Dancing like a crazy ho. 

           THEN - A goddamn Christmas miracle.

           They start getting up. One by one. Group by group. The COOL 
           ANGELENOS!!! 

           Austin watches her: Goofy, singing all the words. Sparking a 
           spontaneous dance party. Tears in her eyes. A smile on her 
           face.

           He grins. She sees him watching her. She giggles, getting 
           into it. For once, completely un-self-conscious. Like a kid 
           again. As though Isabelle were here.

           She lifts the phone to her ear...This is it. 
                                 JILL
                             (softly)
                        I love you, Isabelle.

           Her hand drops to her side.

           Her finger- pressing the red call button - ending the call.

           Austin takes a deep breath. Here goes! He busts a move. 
           Uncool. Unrehearsed. Moving towards her- joining the dance 
           party with the strangers at the center of the cemetery. 

           She grins as he does the robot. She underestimated him. 

           She mouths every word... “I’m givin’ it my all but I’m not 
           the giiiiirl you’re taaaakin’ home...OOoohhhh... I keep 
           dancing on my oooown....”

           He takes her hand, spinning her and dipping her.   

           Eyes locked, Jill’s lips turn up into a smile. She can feel 
           it in her bones. She’s not alone. 

           Fade to black.
                                   For my little sister

                                    Who makes me brave
