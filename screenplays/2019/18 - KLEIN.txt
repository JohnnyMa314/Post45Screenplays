           OVER BLACK 

           Dull conversation hums. Video poker and slot machines ding. 

           INT. TROPICANA HOTEL & CASINO - DAY

           Big chandeliers hang above tacky carpet. Stale smoke lingers 
           in the air. 

           A cocktail waitress makes her way through the dimly lit 
           gambling hall, dropping off drinks to an uncivilized 
           clientele made up of mostly Las Vegas locals. 

           MIKE KLEIN stands behind a $5 blackjack table dealing to a 
           couple cowboys in ten gallon hats. 

                                 COWBOY 1
                        Better not have an ace under there. 

                                 MIKE
                        (shrugs) Sorry fellas. 

           He flips an ace, making his blackjack. He deals another hand.   

           Mike’s a good looking 22 year old kid, but could easily pass 
           for 18. He’s laid back, never without a smile on his face.

                                 COWBOY 1
                        Know what I like about you, Mike?

                                 MIKE
                        Tell me. 

                                 COWBOY 1
                        You got good energy. 

                                 COWBOY 2
                        Fuckin guy just cleaned us out. 

                                 COWBOY 1
                        Yeah but I still feel like we had a 
                        good time hangin out with him. 

                                 COWBOY 2
                        Fuck him and his good energy. 

           Mike laughs. An Asian dealer named LING shows up. 

                                 MIKE
                        Speaking of good energy. Ling’s got 
                        the best energy in the house. Ain’t 
                        that right, Ling?
           She smiles. Mike puts his arm around her and gives her a kiss 
           on the cheek before going on his break.

           Mike checks his phone. The home screen shows six missed calls 
           from “Ali.” He calls her back.  

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Hey babe. Sorry I missed your -- 
                        wait slow down. What happened?  

           Mike sprints across the casino floor almost colliding with a 
           cocktail waitress. He runs through the sports book, the keno 
           lounge, past banks of slot machines...

           ...and comes blasting through the double doors near the 
           reception desk.  

           Outside, a group of valet parkers trying to stay cool in the 
           hundred degree heat watch as Mike runs for his life and 
           disappears into the parking garage. 

           INT. / EXT. CAR (MOVING) - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike drives his old white Buick Riviera down The Strip as 
           fast as traffic will allow, but it’s bumper to bumper. 

           The hot Las Vegas sun bakes the asphalt. A digital 
           thermometer above The Excalibur reads 108.

           He punches the gas in an attempt to make a light, but gets 
           stuck at the intersection of Las Vegas Blvd and Tropicana. 

           Mike yanks the steering wheel and takes the car up over the 
           curb. Tourists are forced to jump out of the way as he speeds 
           down the sidewalk.  

           He takes back streets the rest of the way. 

           Eventually, he swings the car into an empty strip mall, gets 
           out and rushes over to his fiancé, ALI. 

           Ali stands next to her car. She is dishevelled. Her hair is 
           damp with sweat. Streaks of mascara run down her cheeks. 

                                 MIKE
                        (out of breath) Is he okay?

           Inside the car, their 16 month old son, VINNY, is strapped 
           into his car seat, screaming. Mike tries all four door 
           handles. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        How did this happen?
                                 ALI
                        (chewing her fingernails) I don’t 
                        know. I locked the keys in the car. 

                                 MIKE
                        It’s a hundred and ten fuckin 
                        degrees, Ali.

           No other options. Mike cocks his arm back, and smashes the 
           passenger side window with the point of his elbow.

           His white dress shirt rips and blood drips down his forearm. 
           He unlocks the back door and lifts his crying son from the 
           hot car.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        (soothing) It’s okay, baby. Daddy’s 
                        got you. You’re okay. 

           Mike cradles his son’s head in his hands. The whole time Ali 
           just stares at the ground. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        What were you even doing on this 
                        side of town? Ali, look at me.  

           She picks up her head to meet Mike’s gaze. Her eyes are 
           glazed over and bloodshot. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Are you high? 

           Mike studies her for a very long beat.  

           Then he grabs her purse off the hood of the car. Inside, he 
           finds a little baggie of white pills. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t believe this. 

           He throws the purse on the ground, and the pills spill out. 
           Ali drops to her knees to gather them up. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Look at you. 

                                 ALI
                        I only left him alone for five 
                        minutes.

           Mike pulls out his phone. 

                                 ALI (CONT’D)
                        Who are you calling?
                                 MIKE
                        The police. 

                                 ALI
                        Mike, please don’t. It was just 
                        five minutes. I’m sorry. 

           He dials 9-1-1. 

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        9-1-1. What’s your emergency? 
                        (beat) What’s your emergency? 

           But he just can’t bring himself to do it. He hangs up. 

                                 MIKE
                        Listen to me. I’m calling that 
                        place. You’re getting help. 

           Mike walks over to his car, straps Vinny into the car seat 
           and drives away without saying another word. 

           INT. MIKE AND ALI’S HOUSE - MIDNIGHT

           Mike sleeps alone in his bed. 

           In the kitchen, Ali is at the counter writing a note with one 
           hand and smoking a cigarette with the other. 

           She walks over to the baby’s room and takes one last look at 
           Vinny, sleeping soundly in his crib. Tears fill her eyes. 

           She crosses back into the kitchen, picks up a small suitcase 
           and walks out the door. 

           We hold on her goodbye note. It’s short and to the point:  

           “I can’t do this to you anymore. I’m sorry.” 

           On top of the note rests Ali’s engagement ring. 

           INT. MIKE AND ALI’S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

           Mike wakes to the sound of Vinny on the baby monitor. He 
           rolls out of bed, walks into Vinny’s room and lifts him out 
           of the crib. He sniffs his diaper, kisses him. 

                                 MIKE
                        There’s my little homie. Morning.
           Mike carries Vinny into the kitchen and sets him in a high 
           chair. As he’s grabbing a bottle from the fridge, something 
           catches his eye. Ali’s note.

           He picks it up and starts to read it. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

                                  SUPER: SIX YEARS LATER

           INT. MIKE AND ALI’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Just out of the shower, MIKE, now 28, gets ready for work. He 
           throws on a black vest over a white dress shirt and clips on 
           a bow-tie. He stares at himself in the mirror. 

           He’s traded in the short on the sides look for a nest of long 
           stringy hair that he tucks behind his ears. Still has the 
           baby face though, only now it’s hidden underneath a ratty 
           beard.  

           In the hallway, he sees VINNY, now 8, carrying a large alto 
           saxophone.   

                                 MIKE
                        Vin, what are you doing? 

                                 VINNY
                        I’m helping Uncle Frankie and Uncle 
                        Gus get ready for their gig. 

           Vinny continues into the kitchen and hands the saxophone over 
           to FRANKIE, a big black dude with a Kangol hat on his head 
           and a joint in his mouth. He takes a hit and passes it to...   

           ...GUS (short for Gustavo), a skinny Latino hipster who takes 
           a break from packing up his drum kit to hit the joint. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yo, Vinny. Uncle Frankie’s trying 
                        to get some big tiddies in his face 
                        tonight. (points to the Kangol) You 
                        thinkin hat or no hat? 

                                 GUS
                        Hat. No hat. Don’t matter. Your fat 
                        ass ain’t getting laid tonight. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        He tryin to say I’m too fat to get 
                        some big tiddies in my face?
                                 VINNY
                        Yeah, I think so. 

           Frankie plays a few licks on the saxophone. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Good thing I can play this thing 
                        like a mother fucker. Chicks dig 
                        musicians, Vin. Don’t forget that. 

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Yeah but do they dig fat musicians? 

           No one realized Mike was in the doorway. Gus laughs. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Is every mother fucker who lives in 
                        this house gonna dog me about my 
                        weight tonight?

                                 GUS
                        All we’re saying is that if some 
                        jazz groupie is looking to bang one 
                        of the dudes in the band tonight, 
                        it’s probably gonna be me, you 
                        know, the one who’s in shape. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Bro, you ain’t in shape. You’re 
                        just skinny. And nine out of ten 
                        bitches prefer fat and black over 
                        skinny and Mexican. Trust me. 

                                 GUS
                        Settle this for us, Vin. Who’s got 
                        a better shot at getting laid 
                        tonight? Your good lookin Uncle Gus 
                        with his 5% body fat? Or your big 
                        fat black Uncle Frankie with his 
                        stupid fuckin Kangol hat?

           Vinny studies them both, taking the question seriously. 

                                 VINNY
                        I like underdogs, so I’m gonna go 
                        with Uncle Frankie. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        My nigga. 

           He gives Vinny a pound, and passes the joint to Mike.  

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re working tonight?
                                 MIKE
                        (takes a hit) They just called me 
                        in last minute. Can you guys watch 
                        him tonight? Bring him to the show?

                                 FRANKIE
                        They ain’t gonna let him in. We’re 
                        playing the Double Down. 

                                 MIKE
                        Thought that was like a punk rock 
                        bar or some shit?

                                 FRANKIE
                        They’re doing jazz night every 
                        Tuesday now. (beat) Want me to call 
                        my mom, see if she can babysit?

                                 MIKE
                        Nah, fuck it. I’ll just bring him 
                        with me. (beat) Vinny, pack a bag. 

           Vinny rushes off into his room and grabs a set of pajamas, 
           some fresh underwear, his toothbrush. Stuffs it all into a 
           backpack. 

           INT. MIKE’S CAR (MOVING) - LATER

           Mike smokes a cigarette as he drives west on the I-15. Vinny 
           rides shotgun. In the distance, the Las Vegas Strip twinkles 
           against the dark desert sky. 

           They fly past all the casinos - Caesars, Bellagio, MGM - 
           until eventually arriving in a lesser known part of town. 
           Downtown Vegas. Fremont Street.

           INT. FOUR QUEENS HOTEL & CASINO - LATER

           Place is packed with low-lives gambling away their paychecks 
           and cheap prostitutes winding down after a night’s work.  

           A cocktail waitress makes the rounds, delivering drinks. 
           Eventually her tray has just one final beverage left on it. A 
           mug of hot chocolate, whipped cream, cherry on top. 

           She jogs up a tiny flight of stairs that leads to the...

           INT. COFFEE SHOP, FOUR QUEENS HOTEL & CASINO - CONTINUOUS

           Mike takes the last drag of his cigarette and lights a new 
           one off the old one.
           Vinny sits across from him doing his homework, reading from 
           his iPhone and taking notes. 

                                 MIKE
                        What are you working on?

                                 VINNY
                        Some homework assignment. They want 
                        us to research the origin of my 
                        last name. 

                                 MIKE
                        And?

                                 VINNY
                        It’s German for small. 

                                 MIKE
                        Seriously?

                                 VINNY
                        (reading from phone) “In Germany, 
                        Klein was a nickname for a person 
                        of small stature, which then came 
                        to be used as a surname.” 

           Just then, the cocktail waitress with the hot chocolate shows 
           up.

                                 COCKTAIL WAITRESS
                        Alright, Vinny. Here it comes. Your 
                        usual. With extra whipped cream. 

           She lays down a napkin and the mug of hot chocolate. As she’s 
           leaning over Vinny, her cleavage is just inches away from his 
           head.   

           Vinny gives his dad a big thumbs up and a wink. Mike smiles. 

                                 VINNY
                        Thanks, Kathleen. 

           She ruffles Vinny’s hair and leaves. Vinny looks back, making 
           sure she’s out of ear shot.  

                                 VINNY (CONT’D)
                        You see those things? They’re 
                        bigger than my head. 

                                 MIKE
                        They are pretty big aren’t they?
                                 VINNY
                        They’re like fluffy pillows, I just 
                        wanna go to sleep on them. 

                                 MIKE
                        Alright. Relax you little sicko. 

                                 VINNY
                        What happened with you guys, how 
                        come she stopped coming over?

                                 MIKE
                        Cocktail waitresses are crazy. 

                                 VINNY
                        Well, what about Olivia? She wasn’t 
                        a cocktail waitress. Neither was 
                        Brittany. What happened with them? 
                        Why’d they stop coming over?

                                 MIKE
                        The thing with women is. And you’ll 
                        learn this once you get older... 
                        they’re all fuckin crazy. 

                                 VINNY
                        All of them?

                                 MIKE
                        All of them. 

           Vinny thinks about this for a minute.  

                                 VINNY
                        You’re not gay are you dad?

                                 MIKE
                        (laughs) Sometimes I think it’d 
                        probably be easier if I was. 

           Mike snubs out his cigarette into the ash tray. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Come on, my shift’s about to start, 
                        let’s get you to bed. 

           Mike lays some money down on the table, and they leave. 

           INT. FOUR QUEENS HOTEL & CASINO - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike and Vinny walk through the casino and approach 
           reception. The OLD GUY behind the desk smiles.
                                 RECEPTION DESK GUY
                        Yo Vinny, you got my money?

                                 VINNY
                        What money?

                                 RECEPTION DESK GUY
                        You took the Celtics.

                                 VINNY
                        Yeah, the Celtics won. You owe ME 
                        money. 

                                 RECEPTION DESK GUY
                        Nice try. The line was six. You 
                        shoulda took the points. 

           Vinny looks to his dad for some support. 

                                 MIKE
                        What? You lost. Pay up. 

           Vinny pulls a wad of dollar bills from his pocket. Peels off 
           two singles, hands them over. 

                                 VINNY
                        Fine, here’s your two dollars. Hope 
                        you’re proud, taking money from an 
                        eight year old. 

           The reception guy laughs. As he’s pocketing Vinny’s money, he 
           slides Mike a key card. 

                                 RECEPTION DESK GUY
                        504 is open. 

           Mike nods. This feels routine, like they do it often. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike and Vinny ride the elevator. A BELL HOP, pushing a 
           luggage cart, gets on and says hello to the guys. 

                                 BELL HOP
                        How’s school, Vinny?

                                 VINNY
                        Sucks. 

                                 BELL HOP
                        (laughs) You got a girlfriend?
                                 VINNY
                        Nah. 

                                 BELL HOP
                        Why not?

                                 VINNY
                        Women are fuckin crazy. 

                                 BELL HOP
                        You’re god damn right they are. So 
                        you just gotta find the one that’s 
                        the least crazy. Marry that one. 
                        Your dad teach you about the big 
                        purse theory yet?

           Vinny shakes his head. Bell Hop whacks Mike on the shoulder. 

                                 BELL HOP (CONT’D)
                        Come on, dude. This is your son. 
                        He’s gotta know this shit. 

                                 VINNY
                        What’s the big purse theory dad?

                                 MIKE
                        Best way to tell if a girl is crazy 
                        is by looking at her purse. The 
                        crazier the girl, the bigger the 
                        purse. 

                                 BELL HOP
                        It’s legit. I happen to be married 
                        to the craziest broad in Vegas. You 
                        should see her fuckin purse. Giant. 

           The bell rings and Mike and Vinny get off the elevator.

           INT. FIFTH FLOOR, FOUR QUEENS HOTEL & CASINO - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike and Vinny get out of the elevator and line up like two 
           sprinters. Mike counts down - ready, set, go - and they race 
           down the long corridor. 

           Vinny wins and throws his hands up...  

           ...but Mike tackles him to the ground and starts tickling 
           him. Vinny laughs hysterically. 
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - LITTLE LATER

           Vinny comes out of the bathroom in little Superman pajamas. 
           Mike tucks him into bed. Vinny grabs the remote, powers on 
           the TV and finds a channel showing NHL hockey highlights.

           They watch for a moment. 

                                 VINNY
                        Dad, will you rub my legs?

                                 MIKE
                        They hurting again? 

           Vinny nods. Mike starts to massage his legs and Vinny winces 
           in pain. Mike tries to hide the worry on his face. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me, we’re gonna get this 
                        checked out soon as I’m full time 
                        again and the health benefits kick 
                        back in. I promise. 

           Mike sits with Vinny, rubbing his legs until the pain cools. 

                                 VINNY
                        Hey, dad. Was my mom crazy? Is that 
                        why she died? 

                                 MIKE
                        Your mom definitely wasn’t crazy. 
                        Know why? Cause she loved you. She 
                        loved you very much. 

                                 VINNY
                        What else did she love? 

                                 MIKE
                        Slurpees. 

                                 VINNY
                        (smiles) Really?

                                 VINNY (CONT’D)
                        She used to mix coke and blueberry. 
                        Drank em everyday.  

           He kisses Vinny on the forehead. 

                                 MIKE
                        Ok, I’ll be back to check on you 
                        later. Sleep good. I love you.
                                 VINNY
                        I love you too, dad. 

           INT. FOUR QUEENS HOTEL & CASINO - LATER

           Mike deals blackjack.  

           Later, when he goes on break, he spots his PIT BOSS, a Korean 
           American guy in an ill-fitting suit.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey boss, how’s it going? Listen. 
                        Graveyard’s no good for me. 

                                 PIT BOSS
                        You’re on the extra board. You come 
                        in when we need you. 

                                 MIKE
                        Any chance I can get my regular day 
                        shift back?

                                 PIT BOSS
                        You lost that shift when you got 
                        loaded at work.

                                 MIKE
                        I wasn’t technically at work. I was 
                        off the clock, remember?

                                 PIT BOSS
                        You were in your uniform drinking 
                        at the bar with your buddies. 
                        Employees aren’t allowed to do 
                        that. I shoulda fired you.  

                                 MIKE
                        I know. But that was like two 
                        months ago. I’ve learned my lesson. 
                        I got a kid and when I have to pay 
                        for overnight childcare the cost 
                        offsets the money I make here. May 
                        as well not even come to work.

                                 PIT BOSS
                        Good. Don’t come to work. I’ll 
                        replace your ass with one of the 
                        million chinks in this city that 
                        want to deal blackjack on the 
                        graveyard shift. And guess what? 
                        None of them chinks will complain 
                        about it. Know why? Cause they 
                        don’t speak any fuckin English. 
           The Pit Boss walks away.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NEXT MORNING

           An alarm rings at 6am. Vinny rolls out of bed.

           As he’s brushing his teeth he hears the mechanical unlocking 
           of the door. It’s Mike, just off his shift. 

           INT. CAR (MOVING) - LATER

           Mike and Vinny ride home on the empty freeway, admiring the 
           rising sun just peeking its head over Mount Charleston. 

           INT. THE HOUSE - LATER

           Vinny, dressed for school, is eating cereal on the couch next 
           to Mike. A girl moaning is heard from one of the bedrooms.

                                 MIKE
                        Five to two says that’s Uncle Gus. 

                                 VINNY
                        I’ll take that bet. 

           They shake on it. Mike gets up, rinses his bowl in the sink.

                                 MIKE
                        Grab your backpack, we gotta go.  

           Vinny groans and walks off down the hallway. 

           Just then, Frankie emerges from his room, out of breath and 
           completely naked except for that Kangol hat on his head. 

           Frankie and Vinny make eye contact. Frankie covers himself 
           with the Kangol.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Told you chicks dig musicians. 

                                 VINNY
                        Dad you owe me money! 

           EXT. LEWIS E. ROWE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER

           Mike drops Vinny off at school.
           INT. CAFETERIA, LEWIS E. ROWE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER

           Vinny carries his lunch tray and sits down at a table full of 
           kids. 

                                 KID
                        Sorry that seat is saved. 

                                 VINNY
                        For who?

                                 KID
                        Other people. 

                                 VINNY
                        What about those ones?

                                 KID
                        Those are saved too. 

           Vinny gets up, slowly walks up and down the rows of lunch 
           tables, trying to make eye contact with someone, with anyone 
           he might be able to sit with. But no one looks at him. 

           Eventually, he just sits alone at an empty table in the back.  

           INT. FOUR QUEENS HOTEL & CASINO - DAY

           Mike deals blackjack. 

           Later, he sits in the break room smoking a cigarette. His 
           phone buzzes. An unknown number. He picks it up and hears a 
           soft voice from the other end.  

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Mike?

           But this isn’t just any voice. It’s a voice Mike hasn’t heard 
           in many years, and it sends a chill through his body. 

                                 WOMAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Mike, hi, it’s -- 

                                 MIKE
                        Ali?

                                 ALI (O.S.)
                        I’m surprised you recognized my 
                        voice. It’s been a while.

                                 MIKE
                        What are you calling for? 
                                 ALI
                        I moved back to town and was 
                        wondering if you’d be willing to 
                        get together with me for coffee or 
                        something. I could meet you -- 

           Mike ends the call, hanging up on her mid-sentence. 

           EXT. THE HOUSE - LATER

           Mike pulls into the driveway where Frankie, Gus and Vinny are 
           in a heated game of street hockey. Mike gets out of the car. 

                                 MIKE
                        House meeting. Now. Vinny, I need 
                        to talk to your uncles about some 
                        grown up stuff. Hang out here for a 
                        little. 

           Frankie and Gus follow Mike into the house. 

           INT. THE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike has caught them up to speed. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        What do you mean she’s back? 

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t know, man. She said she 
                        moved back to town and asked if I 
                        would see her. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Fuck. What did you say?

                                 MIKE
                        I fuckin panicked and just hung up. 
                        (beat) This is fucked. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s not ideal. But we knew at some 
                        point the day was gonna come where 
                        you had to tell Vinny the truth. 

           Mike puts his head in his hands. 

                                 MIKE
                        Did I misplay this?

                                 GUS
                        Oh yeah, big time. 
           Frankie gives Gus a look like, shut the fuck up.

                                 GUS (CONT’D)
                        What? I’m just saying. Telling your 
                        son his mom’s dead when really 
                        she’s just a druggie who went off 
                        the deep end and left town? Not 
                        exactly the smartest move. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Just shut the fuck up, ok?

                                 GUS
                        I’m just stating facts. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Well stop stating fuckin facts! 

                                 MIKE
                        No, he’s right. How could I be so 
                        stupid?

                                 FRANKIE
                        You weren’t stupid. You were a kid 
                        left to raise a kid all by 
                        yourself. You did what you thought 
                        was right at the time. 

                                 GUS
                        (sotto) Just cause he was young 
                        doesn’t make it any less stupid. 

           Frankie smacks Gus in the head. 

           INT. MIKE’S BEDROOM - DAY 

           Mike lies on top of his bed staring up at the ceiling and 
           smoking. Thinking. 

           There’s a cardboard box next to him, filled with old 
           memories. Mike looks at a photo of him and Ali in the 
           hospital the day Vinny was born. He takes a deep breath. 

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           Mike sits across from Ali staring at her with no emotion. 
           Somehow in the 6 years she’s been gone, she aged well. Her 
           skin looks healthy. Her hair is in a tight pony tail.

                                 ALI
                        So. How are you?
                                 MIKE
                        I’m fine, Ali.  

                                 ALI
                        That’s good. You look different. 
                        Your hair is so long. 

                                 MIKE
                        Where have you been?

                                 ALI
                        I was in Arizona for a while. 
                        Couple years. Then Missouri. My mom 
                        moved there, so I was living with 
                        her for a little. But that didn’t 
                        last long. You know how she is. 
                        Then Utah. That’s where I’ve been 
                        for the past three years. 

                                 MIKE
                        And now you’re back in Vegas.

                                 ALI
                        Yeah. What about you? Tell me about- 

                                 MIKE
                        Why did you come back?

           Ali nervously fiddles with her coffee cup. She’s got a few 
           visible tattoos. She also wears one of those feather earrings 
           which gives her a new-agey kind of look.  

                                 ALI
                        My boyfriend took a job here. 

                                 MIKE
                        What does he do?

                                 ALI
                        He works at a hospital. He’s --  

                                 MIKE
                        You know what, fuck this. 

           Mike gets up to leave, but Ali grabs him by the arm. 

                                 ALI
                        Don’t go. Please. Just talk to me. 

                                 MIKE
                        You’re not even going to ask about 
                        your son? You know the one whose 
                        life you disappeared from? 
                                 ALI
                        Come on, Mike. Of course he’s the 
                        first thing I wanted to ask you 
                        about. But I guess I wanted to let 
                        it come up a little more naturally. 
                        I wanted to be respectful. 

                                 MIKE
                        And your way of doing that is 
                        sitting here bragging about your 
                        new life?

                                 ALI
                        I’m not bragging. You asked. Truth 
                        is, things got very bad for me. And 
                        now they’re better. I promised 
                        myself I would stay out of your 
                        lives until I trusted myself enough 
                        to come back. That took a long time 
                        and I’m sorry. So can we please 
                        catch up, you and me?

                                 MIKE
                        That’s not how this works. 

                                 ALI
                        Yes it is. When two people that 
                        haven’t seen each other in years 
                        see each other for the first time, 
                        they catch up. So please, tell me 
                        what you’ve been up to.

           Mike sits back down. 

                                 MIKE
                        I’ve just been working.

                                 ALI
                        Where?

                                 MIKE
                        I’m dealing at the Four Queens. 

                                 ALI
                        Were do you and Vinny live?

                                 MIKE
                        Same place. 

                                 ALI
                        You still live in our old house? 

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. With Frankie and Gus. 
                                 ALI
                        (confused) What do you mean? Like, 
                        you and Vinny are roommates with 
                        Frankie and Gus?

                                 MIKE
                        You moved out. Correction, you 
                        snuck out, and Frankie and Gus 
                        moved in. Someone had to step up 
                        and help me raise our son.

           Long pause. 

                                 ALI
                        When can I see him, Mike?

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t think I’m ready for that.

                                 ALI
                        Yeah, but maybe he’s ready for 
                        that.

           INT. LEWIS E. ROWE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           Mike waits outside an administrative office at Vinny’s 
           school. He stands up when the door opens and THE PRINCIPAL 
           steps out. 

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Mike. Sorry to keep you waiting. 

           They shake hands and Mike follows him into his office. 

                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for coming. Wanted to get 
                        you in here, in person, to talk 
                        about Vinny. He’s a great kid.

                                 MIKE
                        But... 

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        But he’s got ten unexcused absences 
                        this month alone. He’s in danger of 
                        being truant. If you don’t mind me 
                        asking, is everything okay at home?

                                 MIKE
                        (annoyed) I do mind you asking.

           The principal knows he struck a nerve, doesn’t want to push. 
                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Of course. Just thought I’d ask. 

                                 MIKE
                        Everything’s fine at home. Jesus. 

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Great. So we can work together to 
                        tackle this attendance issue. And 
                        once we do that, I suspect the 
                        other issues will clear up on their 
                        own. 

                                 MIKE
                        What other issues? What are you 
                        talking about?

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Vinny seems to be...having a hard 
                        time connecting with other kids. 

                                 MIKE
                        Like, he doesn’t have any friends?

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        He’s a bit of a loner. 

           Mike stands up. 

                                 MIKE
                        Okay. First of all, no he’s not. 
                        Second, I don’t have time for this, 
                        I have to work. Are we done here?   

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        We’re all done. Thanks for coming. 

           Mike turns to leave. 

                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Mike.

           All the sudden Mike gets agitated. He swings back around.  

                                 MIKE
                        What!?

           The principal is holding out an iPhone. 

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        I think you forgot your phone. 
           INT. SPORTS BOOK AT THE PALACE STATION CASINO - NIGHT

           The sports book. Fifty screens with everything from horse 
           racing to women’s college basketball.  

           Mike and Vinny are at the ATM. Mike checks his balance on the 
           BofA app: $317.65. He winces and withdraws three hundred. The 
           receipt shows his available funds at $15.65. 

           Mike and Vinny sit down with Frankie and Gus. At least 15 
           empty beer bottles are littered across the table. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Who you like tonight, Vin?

                                 VINNY
                        Ole Miss plus four. Baylor minus 
                        six and a half. And Notre Dame on 
                        the moneyline. 

                                 GUS
                        Notre Dame’s quarterback is a 
                        fuckin bum. 

                                 VINNY
                        Yeah, but he’s good on the road. 

           Mike hands Vinny one hundred dollars. 

                                 MIKE
                        Ok. This is it till I get paid. We 
                        lose, we’re fucked. You’re 
                        positive?

                                 VINNY
                        It’s basically free money, dad. 

                                 MIKE
                        Go with Uncle Gus and put it in. 

           Gus gets up, brings Vinny to the CLERK at the betting window. 

                                 GUS
                        Go ahead, Vin. Tell the gentleman 
                        what we want. 

                                 VINNY
                        Yeah, lemme do a hundred dollar 
                        three team parlay. Ole Miss, I’ll 
                        take the points. Baylor minus six 
                        and a half. Notre Dame. Moneyline. 

           The clerk laughs. 
                                 VINNY (CONT’D)
                        What’s so funny? You don’t like the 
                        Notre Dame bet?

           BACK OVER at the table with Mike and Frankie. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        How you feeling about the Ali shit?

                                 MIKE
                        Fine. It’s all good. 

           It’s obvious he doesn’t want to talk about it. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Yo, let me get that heat. I’m 
                        fading pretty hard. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yeah, cause you’re pulling 
                        graveyards and not sleeping. That 
                        shit ain’t healthy, bro. 

                                 MIKE
                        What are you, my fuckin mother? 
                        Gimme the coke. 

           Frankie goes into his pocket and slides a little baggie of 
           blow across the table. 

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike does a key bump in one of the stalls. He exits and 
           checks his nostrils in the mirror. 

           INT. SPORTS BOOK AT THE PALACE STATION CASINO - LATER

           Mike returns to the table with a basket of chicken fingers 
           for Vinny. Vinny pops one in his mouth. 

           Mike cranes his neck in order to check out a table of girls. 
           One of them catches his eye.  

                                 MIKE
                        Vinny, see the one in the middle? 
                        Wanna go talk to her for your old 
                        man?

           Without hesitation, Vinny gets up and approaches them. He 
           speaks directly to the girl in the middle, KATE. 
                                 VINNY
                        Hi. What’s your name?

           Kate looks over her shoulder, just to make sure this little 
           boy isn’t talking to someone else. 

                                 KATE
                        (smiling) Kate. What’s your name?

                                 VINNY
                        I’m Vinny. Pleasure to meet you 
                        ladies. I was wondering if you’d 
                        like to go on a date with my dad?

           Kate’s friends laugh. 

                                 KATE
                        Which one is your dad?

                                 VINNY
                        The fat black guy on the left.

           Vinny gives her a look.

                                 VINNY (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Kate. Which one do you 
                        think is my dad? 

                                 KATE
                        (laughs) Sorry, Vinny. He’s cute, 
                        but I have a boyfriend. 

           INT. SPORTS BOOK AT THE PALACE STATION CASINO - LATER

           Mike, Vinny, Frankie and Gus have their eyes glued to the 
           last few seconds of the game. 

                                 MIKE
                        (to Vinny) We win this game you 
                        don’t have to go to school 
                        tomorrow. 

           Quarterback drops back and throws a 50 yard TD as time 
           expires for the win. Frankie puts Vinny up on his shoulders. 

           The boys hit their parlay and they are going nuts. 

           From a distance, Kate watches their wild celebration. 
           INT. SPORTS BOOK AT THE PALACE STATION CASINO - LATER

           Mike approaches the betting window, hands the clerk his 
           ticket, and the guy slides him a little over six hundred 
           dollars. 

           As he’s counting the money, Kate approaches. 

                                 KATE
                        Whore’ing your son out to get you 
                        dates? That’s low. Also, shouldn’t 
                        he be asleep? It’s almost 11, what 
                        kind of dad are you? 

                                 MIKE
                        (smiling) That little guy’s my age. 
                        He has some kind of growth 
                        deficiency thing, that’s why he’s 
                        so short. 

                                 KATE
                        (smiling) So that’s not your son?

                                 MIKE
                        Nope. Old high school friend. It’s 
                        just a bit we do. 

                                 KATE
                        That’s a shame cause if that was 
                        your kid I was going to agree to go 
                        out with you. Single dad using his 
                        son to help him get a date? Now 
                        that’s fucking cute. But sending 
                        over your 30 year old friend who’s 
                        a midget? That’s just creepy, man. 

           Mike laughs. 

                                 MIKE
                        I thought you had a boyfriend? 

                                 KATE
                        Gimme your phone. 

           She grabs Mike’s phone an punches in her number. Mike watches 
           her walk away. 

           EXT. STREET - DAY 

           Mike and Vinny play street hockey, passing an orange puck 
           back and forth. 
                                 MIKE
                        Top left. 

           Vinny fires a wrist shot into the top left of the net. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Vin, I need to talk to you about 
                        something. It’s about your mom.

                                 VINNY
                        What about her?

           Mike takes a second, not sure the best way to go with this. 
           Vinny shoots another puck into the net. 

                                 MIKE
                        Well. Okay. See, this is very 
                        complicated. Adult shit. I can tell 
                        you more about it when you’re older 
                        maybe. I don’t know. 

           Sensing that his dad is fumbling... 

                                 VINNY
                        Dad, what is it?

                                 MIKE
                        Your mom isn’t dead. She’s alive. 
                        She wants to see you. Would that be 
                        okay with you?

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           Ali sits in a booth, sipping an iced tea and nervously 
           chewing on the straw. Mike and Vinny approach.  

                                 MIKE
                        Vinny. This is... Ali. 

           She gets up, unsure if she should hug Vinny, or kiss him, or 
           shake his hand. She settles with a meek... 

                                 ALI
                        Hi. 

           Then she hugs him, but Vinny doesn’t exactly hug her back. 

                                 ALI (CONT’D)
                        I know you probably don’t remember 
                        me very much. But I want you to 
                        know that I remember you. 

           Vinny offers an uncomfortable smile. They sit down. 
                                 ALI (CONT’D)
                        It’s really cool to see how much 
                        you’ve grown up. You must be in, 
                        what, fourth grade?

                                 VINNY
                        Third. 

                                 ALI
                        You go to the same school your dad 
                        and I went to, did you know that? 
                        (Vinny doesn’t answer) Do you like 
                        school?

                                 VINNY
                        It’s okay. 

           Ali looks down at her menu. Vinny watches her.   

                                 VINNY (CONT’D)
                        What am I supposed to call you?

                                 ALI
                        Whatever feels right for you. 

                                 VINNY
                        Well you don’t feel like my mom.

                                 ALI
                        I know. I’m hoping that will change 
                        though once we get to know each 
                        other a little better.

                                 VINNY
                        Where have you been?

                                 ALI
                        I lived a lot of different places. 

                                 VINNY
                        Why did you leave? 

                                 MIKE
                        Remember dude, it’s really 
                        complicated and you’re just a 
                        little too young -- 

                                 VINNY
                        Yeah, I know you said that. But it 
                        doesn’t make sense. Why am I too 
                        young to know why my mom’s not dead 
                        anymore?
           Ali makes eye contact with Mike, then reaches for Vinny’s 
           hand.

                                 ALI
                        I promise one day I’ll explain 
                        everything to you.

           Vinny pulls his hand away from her and holds Mike’s hand 
           instead. Mike senses his son’s discomfort.  

                                 MIKE
                        You wanna play some keno, bud?

           Vinny nods and grabs a keno ticket from the plastic box at 
           the table. 

                                 ALI
                        You play keno?

                                 VINNY
                        I know most people don’t like it 
                        but me and my dad do. Our numbers 
                        are two, four, and forty two. We’ve 
                        hit it a few times. Right dad?

                                 MIKE
                        Sure have. 

           Ali smiles watching Vinny fill out the ticket with the black 
           keno crayon, putting an X through 2, 4 and 42. 

           Just then, a Four Queens valet parker passes by the table. 

                                 VALET PARKER
                        (gives Vinny a pound) Sup Vinny. 

                                 VINNY
                        Hey Paulie. Good to see you. 

           Ali watches the guy as he walks through the restaurant. 

                                 ALI
                        Who was that?

                                 VINNY
                        Paulie. He’s a valet parker. But 
                        get this, he got a DUI so his 
                        driver’s license is suspended. So 
                        technically everyday he comes to 
                        work he’s breaking the law. He told 
                        me that in confidence, so keep it 
                        under your hat if you can help it. 
                                 ALI
                        (smiles) His secret’s safe with me. 

                                 VINNY
                        There’s another guy, Arvin. I think 
                        he’s from Pakistan or something. 
                        He’s got epilepsy. And he was 
                        parking a car one time. Had a 
                        seizure and side swiped some rich 
                        guy’s Mercedes. That’s why my dad 
                        says you should never valet your 
                        car in Vegas. Always self park. 
                        Right, dad? 

                                 MIKE
                        That’s right.

                                 ALI
                        You’re dad’s a pretty smart guy. 

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           INT. RESTAURANT - ONE HOUR LATER

           Lunch is finishing up, the waitress drops off the check. Ali 
           grabs it. 

                                 ALI
                        I got this. 

           Mike pulls the check from her hands. 

                                 MIKE
                        No you don’t. 

                                 VINNY
                        Dad, I’m gonna go to the bathroom. 

           Mike nods. Vinny gets up, and walks to the restroom. 

                                 ALI
                        You told him I’ve been dead all 
                        these years.

                                 MIKE
                        Would you rather I told him the 
                        truth? That you abandoned us. Let 
                        him grow up wondering whether or 
                        not it was his fault?

           She takes a short, shallow breath and when the air is 
           released from her lungs, it’s as if she’s trying to expel 
           years worth of guilt in one long exhale.
                                 ALI
                        I’m so ashamed that I put you in a 
                        position where you had to make that 
                        decision. I’m sorry.  

                                 MIKE
                        Whatever. It’s done. 

                                 ALI
                        Do you think maybe I can have a day 
                        alone with him this weekend?

                                 MIKE
                        No. 

                                 ALI
                        Please. Spending time with him. 
                        Getting to know him. It’s the only 
                        way I’m going to be able to make 
                        things right.  

                                 MIKE
                        Ali. You’re out of your fuckin mind 
                        if you think I’m gonna leave you 
                        alone with my son. 

           Mike gets up, lays a few bills on the table.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        That should cover me and Vinny.

           Ali watches Mike walk away. 

           INT. ALI’S CAR - LATER

           Ali’s car sits in the parking lot of an unassuming 
           Presbyterian church. Her makeup is messy from crying. She 
           takes a deep breath, gets out and approaches the church. 

           INT. MIKE’S CAR - LITTLE LATER

           Mike pulls into the driveway of their house and kills the 
           engine.  

                                 VINNY
                        Dad. Did my mom do something bad?

                                 MIKE
                        It’s a long story. Listen, I can’t 
                        imagine how hard that was for you. 
                        I’m sorry. I want you to know we 
                        don’t ever have to do that again. 
                                 VINNY
                        No, I’d like to see her again. 

                                 MIKE
                        Oh. Okay. Are you sure?

                                 VINNY
                        Yeah, she seemed nice. Maybe she 
                        can come over sometime and see 
                        where I live. 

           Mike doesn’t say anything. 

           INT. NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS MEETING - LATER

           Ali sits in a circle surrounded by fellow men and women in 
           recovery. We HOLD on Ali’s face as the group recites the 
           Serenity Prayer together.

                                 ALI
                        God grant me the serenity to accept 
                        the things I cannot change, the 
                        courage to change the things I can 
                        and the wisdom to know the 
                        difference.

           EXT. THE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Mike, Vinny, Frankie and Gus are in the midst of an intense 
           street hockey battle when an SUV pulls up. 

           Ali and her boyfriend BRIAN get out and watch for a moment. 
           Mike knocks Gus to the ground, passes the puck to Vinny who 
           scores. They celebrate like they won the Stanley Cup. 

           Eventually Mike notices Ali and Brian. He skates over. 

                                 MIKE
                        Time musta got away from us. Sorry. 

           Mike gives Brian the once over. He’s a pretty regular looking 
           dude. Receding hair line, probably in his early forties. 

                                 BRIAN
                        (very friendly) Mike. I’m Brian. 
                        Good to meet you. 

           Mike takes off his hockey glove, and they shake hands. 
           INT. VINNY’S ROOM - LATER

           Vinny gets dressed for dinner. Steps into a pair of khaki 
           pants. Puts on a little jacket and bow-tie. Combs his hair. 

           INT. THE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Everyone is milling about in the living room. Vinny enters, 
           holding a 7-11 Slurpee. 

                                 MIKE
                        Dude, what’re you wearing? That my 
                        bow-tie?

                                 VINNY
                        I wanted to dress up.

           Mike makes a face, thinks this is weird. 

                                 ALI
                        Aw Vinny, you look so cute. 

                                 VINNY
                        (re: Slurpee) My dad told me you   
                        used to drink Slurpees all the 
                        time. He said coke mixed with 
                        blueberry was your favorite, so... 

           He hands Ali the Slurpee and this simple gesture of accepting 
           a gift from the son she disappeared on immediately reminds 
           her of how horrible she is. 

           Tears of guilt well up. Ali starts to cry. 

                                 VINNY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry it’s a little melted.  

           Ali wipes the tears, regains composure. 

                                 ALI
                        That’s okay. We’ll pop it in the 
                        freezer and have it for dessert. 
                        They’re better frozen anyway.

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Everyone is at the table, eating Chinese take out. Vinny 
           looks at Ali’s plate.  

                                 VINNY
                        Ali, would you like more rice?
                                 ALI
                        That would be great. 

           He passes her the box of rice. 

                                 ALI (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, Vinny. (beat) So 
                        Frankie, you still playing music?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yeah. I got a full time thing at 
                        the Excalibur. And I put together a 
                        little quartet on the side. Pick up 
                        shows here and there. 

                                 GUS
                        No. WE put together a little 
                        quartet. I helped you start the 
                        fuckin band, remember? 

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s my band, you’re just in it. I 
                        write all the songs. It’s called 
                        The Frankie Williams Quartet. 

                                 GUS
                        Cause you’re an egomaniac and had 
                        to name the band after yourself. 
                        Dude does one semester at Berklee 
                        and thinks he’s the second coming. 

                                 ALI
                        (smiles) Glad to see you guys 
                        haven’t changed one bit. 

                                 BRIAN
                        The Berklee School of Music? In 
                        Boston? That’s impressive. 

                                 ALI
                        Yeah, it was a big deal our senior 
                        year when he got accepted. But 
                        wait, how come you didn’t finish? 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I didn’t like Boston. Too cold. 

                                 GUS
                        No, he realized he wasn’t as good 
                        at that horn as he thought he was, 
                        dropped out and came home with his 
                        tail between his legs.  
                                 FRANKIE
                        Enough about me. (to Ali and Brian) 
                        Where’d you guys meet?

                                 BRIAN
                        On the operating table. 

                                 ALI
                        I had to get re-constructive 
                        surgery on my leg, and Brian was on 
                        the team that operated on me. 

                                 BRIAN
                        I asked her out before the 
                        anesthesia had a chance to wear 
                        off. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Oh, so you’re a doctor? 

                                 BRIAN
                        I’m a nurse.  

                                 VINNY
                        My dad’s a blackjack dealer. 

                                 BRIAN
                        I heard. That’s a cool job.

                                 VINNY
                        Yeah. That’s what I’m gonna be when 
                        I grow up too. 

                                 MIKE
                        How’d you break your leg, Ali? 

                                 ALI
                        I got into a pretty bad car 
                        accident. 

                                 MIKE
                        Drunk driver?

                                 ALI
                        Yeah, something like that. 

           Mike, Frankie and Gus share a look. A long, awkward pause. 

                                 GUS
                        I’m gonna get a beer. 

           As Gus goes to the fridge, he sees Ali’s purse sitting on the 
           counter. He looks back to make sure no one is watching and 
           starts rifling through it. 
                                 FRANKIE
                        So Ali, what’re you doing for work 
                        now that you’re back?

                                 ALI
                        Nothing at the moment. Brian’s 
                        sister-in-law is head of HR at MGM 
                        corporate though and she’s gonna 
                        set me up with something when I’m 
                        ready. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        That’s a good hook up. Them Strip 
                        jobs are hard to come by these 
                        days. (points to Mike) Why you 
                        think this fool is still working at 
                        the Four Queens?

                                 MIKE
                        I like the Four Queens, that’s why. 
                        (to Ali) You want to go back to 
                        working at a casino? 

                                 ALI
                        I don’t know, I’m considering it. 
                        We’ll see what my NA group has to 
                        say about that. But I feel like 
                        being around all those sad people, 
                        drinking and gambling all day might 
                        actually help. Remind me what I 
                        don’t what to be, you know? 

           IN THE KITCHEN: Gus finds a sleeve of little white pills in 
           Ali’s purse. 

                                 GUS
                        Hey, Frankie. Come in here, help me 
                        out with something.

           Frankie gets up, walks over to Gus. 

                                 GUS (CONT’D)
                        (whispering) Sober my fuckin ass. 
                        Look what I found in her purse. I 
                        knew it. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        (whispering) Those are birth 
                        control pills you fuckin moron. Put 
                        them back. 

           BACK AT THE TABLE:
                                 BRIAN
                        Mike, I know you said you’re happy 
                        where you are. But if anything 
                        changes and you decide you want to 
                        look for something on the Strip, 
                        let me know and I’ll see if my 
                        sister-in-law can help.  

                                 MIKE
                        Appreciate that. 

           INT. FOUR QUEENS HOTEL & CASINO - NIGHT

           Mike and Vinny approach that same old guy at reception. He 
           slides Mike a room key. 

           Mike takes Vinny up to the room and puts him to bed. 

           Later, Mike deals blackjack. 

           On his break, Mike goes back up to the room and pops his head 
           in to check on Vinny. 

           Back downstairs on the casino floor, Mike’s Pit Boss calls 
           him over. 

                                 PIT BOSS
                        Hey, Mike. Walk with me.

           They walk through the casino. 

                                 PIT BOSS (CONT’D)
                        Look around, Mike. What do you see?

           Mike looks around. His Pit Boss stops walking and points to 
           an Asian dealer. 

                                 PIT BOSS (CONT’D)
                        Chinaman. (points to another Asian 
                        dealer) Chinaman. (and another) 
                        Chinaman. If it were up to me, all 
                        the dealers would be Asian. Know 
                        why? 

           Mike shrugs. 

                                 PIT BOSS (CONT’D)
                        Cause none of them bring their 
                        fuckin kids to work.

           Mike tries to hide it, but he knows he’s busted.  
                                 PIT BOSS (CONT’D)
                        You gotta be the dumbest mother 
                        fucker that I’ve ever met.   

                                 MIKE
                        I think there’s been a 
                        misunderstanding or something. 

                                 PIT BOSS
                        We got you on the cameras fucko. 
                        Seen you bringing him up to 402. 

                                 MIKE
                        Look, it was just a one time thing. 

                                 PIT BOSS
                        No. It’s been going on for a few 
                        months. I had security go through 
                        the archives. 

                                 MIKE
                        Please don’t fire me. 

                                 PIT BOSS
                        What’s going on, man? You okay?

                                 MIKE
                        Just some personal shit. 

                                 PIT BOSS
                        Look. I’m divorced and I got kids, 
                        so I can relate. I commend the 
                        ingenuity of sneaking your son into 
                        vacant hotel rooms. I do. But this 
                        ain’t a fuckin day care. 

                                 MIKE
                        I know. I’m sorry. After tonight, 
                        this will never happen again.

                                 PIT BOSS
                        You better get that kid out of that 
                        room in the next 15 minutes or 
                        you’re fired. That’s two strikes. 
                        Consider this your last favor. 

           INT. JAZZ CLUB - LITTLE LATER

           Frankie is on stage backed by his quartet. Gus on drums. A 
           stand up bass player. Dude on piano. 
           Frankie is completely in the pocket, really laying into his 
           horn. Despite the club being mostly empty, the music is 
           filling the place with an intense energy. 

           They finish the song to tepid applause. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        (into the mic) Thank you. We’re the 
                        Frankie Williams Quartet. Gonna 
                        take a quick break. 

           Frankie - out of breath - walks over to the bar, orders a 
           drink. His phone vibrates. It’s Mike calling from work. 

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Yo. 

                                 MIKE
                        Can you come grab Vinny?

                                 FRANKIE
                        I can’t, man. We still got another 
                        set to play. What happened?

                                 MIKE
                        Nothing. Don’t worry about it. 

           The call ends. Frankie leans on the bar, sipping his drink. 

           His face lights up when an old jazz guy in his late sixties 
           approaches. This is DOC WOODS. 

                                 DOC WOODS
                        Your sound is improving. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Doc Woods!? Holy shit. Been a 
                        while, man.  

           They embrace. 

                                 DOC WOODS
                        That’s cause you never come see me 
                        no more. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        You still teaching?

                                 DOC WOODS
                        Yeah, but I left Chaparrall. I’m 
                        teaching music theory at UNLV now. 
                                 FRANKIE
                        Nice. So you’re ramming Coltrane 
                        down college kid’s throats now 
                        instead of high school?

                                 DOC WOODS
                        You know you’re wasting your time 
                        playing here right?

                                 FRANKIE
                        You just said I sounded good. 

                                 DOC WOODS
                        You need to get out of Vegas. Hit 
                        the road. Tour. At real jazz clubs 
                        playing in front of people who care 
                        about jazz music, not these fools. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Vegas is the best music city in the 
                        world. All the greats come here to 
                        play. I happen to have been born 
                        here. Why would I leave?

                                 DOC WOODS
                        Lemme explain something to you. All 
                        the greats you’re talking about. 
                        They became great on the road. 
                        Playing the Blue Note. Playing the 
                        Vanguard. The Lighthouse. Not this 
                        shit hole.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’m making a good living working on 
                        the Strip, Doc. If I go on tour, 
                        I’ll be broke, eating peanut butter 
                        sandwiches in a van. No thanks.

                                 DOC WOODS
                        Where on the Strip you working?

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’m in the house band for one of 
                        the shows at the Excalibur. 

                                 DOC WOODS
                        Which one?

                                 FRANKIE
                        (embarrassed) Thunder Down Under. 

                                 DOC WOODS
                        The male stripper show? The one on 
                        all the billboards?
           Frankie doesn’t even have to answer the question. 

                                 DOC WOODS (CONT’D)
                        Well. You ever change your mind, 
                        call me. I’ll put you in touch with 
                        a friend. He books bands. 

           Doc Woods hands Frankie his business card. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mike waits while Vinny gets dressed. 

                                 MIKE
                        Are you sure you’re okay with this? 
                        Cause if you’re not, we’ll just go 
                        home right now.  

                                 VINNY
                        I’m okay with it, dad. 

                                 MIKE
                        You’re just going to sleep there 
                        tonight. I’m really, really sorry. 

                                 VINNY
                        Dad, I don’t mind. 

                                 MIKE
                        Come on, she’s waiting downstairs. 

           They walk out of the room. 

           EXT. FOUR QUEENS HOTEL & CASINO - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike loads Vinny into the front seat of Ali’s car. 

                                 MIKE
                        Okay, buddy. Put your seat belt on. 
                        I’ll see you first thing in the 
                        morning. I love you. 

           Mike shuts the door. Ali, still in her robe, approaches. 

                                 ALI
                        How often are you bringing him to 
                        work with you? Don’t you have a 
                        babysitter or something? 

           Mike grits his teeth.
                                 MIKE
                        Thanks for doing this. 

                                 ALI
                        Of course. 

           Mike watches Ali get in the car and drive away. 

           INT. ALI AND BRIAN’S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

           Vinny wakes up in the guest room and notices that there’s a 
           damp circle in the middle of the mattress and his underwear 
           are soaked. 

           Vinny hears a knock on the door, and quickly covers himself 
           with the blanket. Ali pops her head in. 

                                 ALI
                        Morning. Want to come down and have 
                        some breakfast? 

                                 VINNY
                        Ok. 

           She waits for Vinny to get out of bed, but he doesn’t move. 

                                 ALI
                        Is everything ok?

                                 VINNY
                        (embarrassed) I pee’d the bed.  

           Vinny slides the sheets down to show Ali what happened.

                                 VINNY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 ALI
                        There is nothing to be sorry about.  

           She helps Vinny out of bed, kneels down in front of him and 
           starts to remove his underwear. 

                                 ALI (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t a big deal. We’ll just 
                        get you out of these.

           Vinny stops her.

                                 VINNY
                        But I didn’t bring any clean 
                        clothes. 
                                 ALI
                        Oh yeah. Um... 

           Ali spots Vinny’s jeans on the dresser, grabs them.  

                                 ALI (CONT’D)
                        Guess you’ll have to go commando 
                        for a little bit. (smiles) Brian 
                        does that all the time. 

                                 VINNY
                        Ali. Can you not tell him about 
                        this?

                                 ALI
                        Won’t say a word.

           Ali gives Vinny some privacy to slip out of his underwear and 
           into his jeans, then she brings him downstairs. 

           Brian sits at the kitchen island reading the paper.

                                 BRIAN
                        There he is! How’d you sleep?

                                 VINNY
                        Pretty good.  

           Vinny sits down next to Brian and grabs the sports section. 
           He flips through, reading a few pages.  

                                 VINNY (CONT’D)
                        The sharks lost last night. That’s 
                        good for us. Means we got a shot at 
                        the playoffs. 

                                 ALI
                        Vinny, can I get you something to 
                        drink? Water? Orange juice?

                                 VINNY
                        Orange juice please. 

           Ali pours a cup, sets it in front of him, then watches as he 
           reads the newspaper, casually sipping his juice. 

                                 BRIAN
                        You like the Golden Knights, huh?

                                 VINNY
                        I love them. 
                                 BRIAN
                        Guy I work with at the hospital 
                        offered me free tickets for 
                        tonight’s game against The Blues. 
                        Would you like to go?

                                 VINNY
                        Seriously? Yes. 

                                 ALI
                        Text your dad, see if he’s okay 
                        with it. 

           Vinny starts typing out a text. 

           EXT. FREMONT STREET - LATER

           Mike and Kate are on their first date, going for a leisurely 
           stroll underneath the canopy on Fremont Street. 

                                 MIKE
                        Do you have a boyfriend?

                                 KATE
                        What? No. What kind of person do 
                        you think I am?

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, you’re the one that said you 
                        did.

                                 KATE
                        I use that line anytime children 
                        approach me at casinos asking if I 
                        want to go out with their dad. 

                                 MIKE
                        So you absolutely 100% don’t have a 
                        boyfriend?

                                 KATE
                        Fine. It’s complicated. 

                                 MIKE
                        See, I knew it. 

                                 KATE
                        We dated all four years of college. 
                        We were one of those couples that 
                        breaks up and gets back together a 
                        hundred times. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        It finally ended for good when I 
                        got accepted into the MFA program 
                        at UNLV and moved to Vegas. So I 
                        thought. He followed me out here 
                        and we’ve been on and off ever 
                        since. Currently, we’re off. 

                                 MIKE
                        Followed you out here? Wonder if 
                        he’s following us right now?

                                 KATE
                        Wouldn’t put it past him. Wait, 
                        there he is!  

           A bearded drunk homeless guy in a dress stumbles toward them. 

                                 MIKE
                        Rick! What’s up, man? How you been?

                                 KATE
                        (whispers) You know him?

                                 MIKE
                        He comes into the casino all the 
                        time. Rick, this is Kate.  

                                 HOMELESS GUY
                        Gimme some money. 

           Mike pulls out his wallet, hands the guy a five. 

                                 HOMELESS GUY (CONT’D)
                        That’s it?

                                 MIKE
                        That’s it. First date. Pretty sure 
                        I gotta pay for dinner tonight. 

                                 KATE
                        (nods) He does. 

                                 HOMELESS GUY
                        You gonna get some pussy?

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t ask me, ask her. 

                                 HOMELESS GUY
                        (to Kate) Is he???

                                 KATE
                        On the first date! Are you crazy? 
                                 HOMELESS GUY
                        Yes. 

                                 KATE
                        He’s not getting any tonight. 

                                 HOMELESS GUY
                        Why?

                                 KATE
                        Cause if I sleep with him tonight, 
                        he’d never call me again. That’s 
                        how it works. In order for me to 
                        keep him interested, I have to 
                        string him along for as long as 
                        possible.  

                                 MIKE
                        (nods) She does. 

           EXT. THE GOLD SPIKE - LITTLE LATER

           Mike and Kate are hanging out on the open air patio, drinking 
           beers and playing corn-hole.  

                                 MIKE
                        So what’s an MFA? 

                                 KATE
                        Master of Fine Arts. 

                                 MIKE
                        Sounds fancy. 

                                 KATE
                        It’s a three year creative writing 
                        program that UNLV offers. Not to 
                        brag or anything, but it’s pretty 
                        prestigious. They only let five 
                        writers in a year.  

           Kate tosses and misses three bean bags in a row.

                                 MIKE
                        Hopefully you’re a better writer 
                        than you are corn-hole player. What 
                        kind of stuff do you write? Like 
                        novels?

                                 KATE
                        Poetry actually?

           Mike holds up a bean bag. 
                                 MIKE
                        Okay. If I make this shot, you have 
                        to write me a poem.

           Kate nods, you got a deal. He shoots and sinks it. 

           EXT. T-MOBILE ARENA - CONTINUOUS

           Ali, Brian and Vinny are amongst the thousands of hockey fans 
           pouring into the shining golden oval shaped arena.  

                                 BRIAN
                        So, Vinny. Next time you can bring 
                        a friend if you want.

                                 VINNY
                        Cool. Maybe I’ll bring Uncle Gus. 

                                 BRIAN
                        Or a friend from school. Up to you. 

                                 VINNY
                        I don’t really have any friends at 
                        school. 

                                 ALI
                        What do you mean?

                                 VINNY
                        Kids don’t like me. 

                                 ALI
                        (concerned) What?

                                 VINNY
                        Don’t worry. I’m not getting 
                        bullied or anything like that. It’s 
                        more just like, I get treated like 
                        I don’t exist. 

                                 ALI
                        Vinny, that’s awful. 

                                 VINNY
                        Nah. It’s okay. Third graders are 
                        so boring anyway.  

                                 BRIAN
                        You play any sports? Being on a 
                        team is a great way to make 
                        friends. 
                                 VINNY
                        I really wanna play ice hockey but 
                        the equipment alone costs like a 
                        million dollars. My dad says it’s 
                        only for rich kids. 

           Ali and Brian share a look. 

           INT. T-MOBILE ARENA - LATER

           Vinny, Ali and Brian are in a box suite watching the game. 

                                 ALI
                        Wait. Why did the referee just blow 
                        the whistle?

                                 VINNY
                        They were off-sides. 

                                 ALI
                        What’s that?

                                 VINNY
                        The puck has to cross the blue line 
                        before the team on offense, or --

           Just then, the Golden Knights score, and the crowd goes nuts. 
           Vinny and his mom high five each other. 

           INT. / EXT. MIKE’S CAR (MOVING) - LATER

           Mike pulls up in front of Kate’s apartment. They both get 
           out. 

                                 KATE
                        Thanks for tonight. It was fun.  

           Mike leans in for a kiss, but she pulls away. 

                                 MIKE
                        Really?

           Kate laughs. 

                                 KATE
                        I told you, I’m gonna string you 
                        along for as long as possible. 

           She pulls out a pen and napkin from her purse and starts 
           writing something. She hands it to Mike. 
           “Roses are red. Violets are blue. Next time we hang out. I’ll 
           probably make out with you.” 

           Kate gives him a peck on the cheek and walks away.

           INT. ALI AND BRIAN’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Vinny is sitting on the couch in the living room, looking at 
           his phone. Ali pops her head in.

                                 ALI
                        Hey, your dad’s on his way. I know 
                        it’s not your birthday or anything, 
                        but I got you a present. 

           Vinny sees she’s holding a big box that’s been gift wrapped. 

                                 ALI (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead, open it. 

           She watches as Vinny tears into the package and opens up a 
           brand new pair of ice hockey skates. 

           Vinny can’t believe it. He smiles. 

           INT. MIKE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike pulls up to the curb and honks. A moment later, Vinny 
           exits Ali’s house and comes walking down the driveway 
           carrying a large box.   

                                 MIKE 
                        (sotto) The fuck is that? 

           Vinny gets in the car and shows Mike the hockey skates. 

                                 VINNY
                        Ali got these for me. 

                                 MIKE
                        She did? (beat) Hang here for just 
                        one second. I’ll be right back. 

           Mike storms up the driveway toward Ali’s house. 

           INT. ALI AND BRIAN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike and Ali are in an argument. 

                                 MIKE 
                        What do you think you’re doing? 
                                 ALI
                        He told me he wanted to play ice 
                        hockey. I thought this could be a 
                        good first step to making that 
                        happen.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, well it’s not your place to 
                        make things happen. You’ve already 
                        made enough happen, trust me. 

                                 ALI
                        Ok, but I just thought --  

                                 MIKE
                        He’s not playing hockey. I can’t 
                        afford it. And you never should’ve 
                        put it in his head that it could be 
                        a realistic possibility. 

                                 ALI
                        You’re right. I’m sorry. I 
                        shouldn’t have done that without 
                        asking you first. But what if Brian 
                        and I paid for everything?

                                 MIKE
                        (laughs) No. Fuck no. 

                                 ALI
                        Why not?

                                 MIKE
                        Cause you feel guilty and you’re 
                        trying to make up for it by buying 
                        his love. And in the process you’re 
                        making me look bad. 

                                 ALI
                        This isn’t about you or me. It’s 
                        about Vinny. I promise. Playing a 
                        sport will be good for him. 

                                 MIKE
                        What, you read that on some 
                        parenting blog?

                                 ALI
                        He said he doesn’t have a single 
                        friend in school. Did you know 
                        that? 

                                 MIKE
                        He’s just being dramatic. 
                                 ALI
                        Is he? He told me kids treat him 
                        like he’s invisible. 

                                 MIKE
                        I talked to the Principal. It’s 
                        fine. He’s just having a hard time 
                        connecting with kids his age. 

                                 ALI
                        Maybe that’s because he hangs out 
                        at casinos all night gambling with 
                        you and your buddies. You should’ve 
                        seen how happy he was when he told 
                        me you guys hit a three team parlay 
                        the other night. How’s he supposed 
                        to have any idea how to connect 
                        with a third grader when the 
                        majority of his relationships are 
                        with degenerate Las Vegas lifers at 
                        these casinos. 

                                 MIKE
                        Degenerate Las Vegas lifers? Listen 
                        to you. You hook up with some 
                        nurse. He dresses you up, throws a 
                        couple band-aids on your wounds and 
                        now YOU’RE fuckin calling ME a 
                        degenerate? 

                                 ALI
                        That’s not what I meant. 

                                 MIKE
                        You almost killed our son. 

                                 ALI
                        I know. 

                                 MIKE
                        That means you’re the loser. Not 
                        me. You fucking junkie. 

           This cuts her pretty good. 

                                 ALI
                        I’m not a junkie. 

                                 MIKE
                        Look. I don’t care what you are. 
                        All I know is that I’m not gonna 
                        sit here and take parenting advice 
                        from literally the worst mother of 
                        all time. 
           Ali gets tears in her eyes. 

                                 ALI
                        What else? If there’s anything else 
                        you’ve been waiting to say to me. 
                        Say it.  

                                 MIKE
                        You destroyed my fuckin life. 

           She let’s that hang for a moment. 

                                 ALI
                        Then maybe you should stop hiding 
                        behind your tragedy and do 
                        something about it. 

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, here we go. What, you do a 
                        couple sessions of therapy in rehab 
                        and now you’re gonna psycho-analyze 
                        my life? Hiding behind my tragedy?

                                 ALI
                        Yeah. Think about it. Your dad 
                        drank himself to death. Your mom 
                        killed herself. Then you start a 
                        family of your own and that 
                        disintegrates too. Your life has 
                        been decorated with one horrible 
                        tragedy after the next and you’re 
                        using it as evidence for why it’s 
                        ok to give up. 

                                 MIKE
                        (raising his voice) You don’t know 
                        what the fuck you’re talking about.

                                 ALI
                        Well, I know that you’re making 
                        your son sleep in abandoned Fremont 
                        Street hotel rooms while you deal 
                        blackjack.

           Mike wants to respond, but can’t seem to locate the words. 

           Just then, he notices Brian walking down the steps. Mike 
           points up at him.  

                                 MIKE
                        Go back in your fuckin room, or 
                        I’ll kick your fuckin ass. 
                                 ALI
                        Ok, I think it’s time for you to 
                        leave now. 

                                 MIKE
                        Good. Fuck this. 

           Mike walks out, slamming the door. 

           INT. SONNY’S SALOON - AFTERNOON

           Gus has an apron on and is wiping down the bar in this dark, 
           windowless locals only restaurant. 

           Mike and Frankie are playing the video poker machines that 
           are built into the bar. Gus pops open two beers and slides 
           them over. 

                                 MIKE
                        I’m good. 

           Mike slides his beer back. 

           Just then, Black Magic Woman comes on the jukebox. Frankie 
           slams his hand down, startling everyone in the bar.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Come on Gus! Fuckin Santana? 

                                 GUS
                        Just cause I’m a spic doesn’t mean 
                        I put on Santana. I don’t control 
                        the music. It’s a jukebox.  

           Frankie looks around, spots a Mexican guy silently drinking 
           alone at the end of the bar. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Rigoberto, you put this shit on? 
                        (shakes his head) Listen up 
                        everyone. Whoever put Santana on, 
                        don’t do that anymore. You wanna 
                        listen to Mexican butt rock, you 
                        can head over to Mandalay Bay. He’s 
                        got a residency there. I fuckin 
                        hate Santana! 

           This whole time Mike hasn’t really said a word. He’s just 
           sitting there smoking, thinking about something. 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get the fuck outta here, go 
                        shoot some dice. Gus when you off?
                                 GUS
                        I’m here all night. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Mike?

                                 MIKE
                        Can’t. I’m busy. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        What do you mean you’re busy? 

                                 MIKE
                        I’m hanging out with that chick.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Lemme get this straight. You’re 
                        passing on craps to hang out with 
                        some girl? (Mike nods) Wow. 

                                 MIKE
                        Can you grab Vinny from school? 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yeah, but I’m at the Excalibur 
                        tonight. 8 o’clock call time. 

                                 MIKE
                        You mind bringing him? (Frankie 
                        nods) Just keep him out of the 
                        front row. I don’t want any cocks 
                        hitting him in the face or 
                        anything. 

           EXT. UNIVERSITY OF LAS VEGAS NEVADA - NIGHT

           Mike walks through the dark, empty campus, and approaches an 
           auditorium. 

           INT. THEATRE, UNIVERSITY OF LAS VEGAS NEVADA - NIGHT

           Mike sits in a dimly lit theatre watching a male grad student 
           do spoken word poetry. He finishes and the MC takes the mic. 

                                 MC
                        Thank you Sean, that was beautiful. 
                        Our next poet is Kate McKinley. 

           Kate walks on stage, leans into the microphone. 
                                 KATE
                        I will be reading a poem entitled 
                        “Wanda.” 

           Kate clears her throat and begins reading from a piece of 
           paper. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        It’s not that I’m stupid. It’s not 
                        like I actually think I’m getting 
                        away with something. Sitting up 
                        here smoking cigarettes in the only 
                        bathroom in this tiny little house. 
                        The house where I raised one son 
                        and four daughters. The house that 
                        one of those daughters, the 42 year 
                        old one with three kids of her own, 
                        just moved back into. They all know 
                        I’m up here in the bathroom smoking 
                        cigarettes. How do they know? Cause 
                        they’re not stupid. They can smell 
                        the smoke. They think that I think 
                        I’m getting away with something, 
                        sitting up here smoking cigarettes 
                        in the only bathroom in this tiny 
                        little house. But I’m not stupid. I 
                        just don’t give a shit anymore. My 
                        husband left me, ran off with his 
                        secretary. My kids left me too. So 
                        I’ll smoke wherever the fuck I 
                        please. 

           Kate looks up from the page. Applause. 

           EXT. THEATRE, UNIVERSITY OF LAS VEGAS NEVADA - LATER

           Kate exits the theatre with a few other poets. She sees Mike 
           waiting beside a lamppost, smiling. 

                                 MIKE
                        I thought poems were supposed to 
                        rhyme?

                                 KATE
                        You didn’t like it?

                                 MIKE
                        I loved it. Oh, speaking of poems. 
                        Before I forget. 

           Mike goes into his pocket and pulls out the poem Kate wrote 
           for him. 
                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        You promised. 

                                 KATE
                        (smiles) If you play your cards 
                        right. 

           Mike leans in and kisses her. When Kate opens her eyes it’s 
           clear she hasn’t been kissed like that in a while. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Wow. That was nice. 

           She links her arm through Mike’s arm and they walk across the 
           dark UNLV campus. 

           INT. EXCALIBUR HOTEL & CASINO - LATER

           Frankie and Vinny walk through the casino. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Frankie Williams! I thought that 
                        was you!

           A good looking guy with long hair, tight jeans and a leather 
           jacket walks towards them. This is SERGE STANTON. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Holy shit, Serge? I haven’t seen 
                        you in a minute. 

           They hug. Frankie points to Vinny. 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Yo, this is Vinny. Mike’s kid. 

                                 SERGE
                        What?? (to Vinny) Dude, I met you 
                        when you were like two. 

           Serge gives Vinny a pound. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        What are you doing in town?

                                 SERGE
                        Got two shows before our Australia 
                        tour. Woulda hit you up, but I been 
                        away so much and needed to put in 
                        some QT with the wife and kids. 
                        They’re over there in the arcade. 
                                 FRANKIE
                        I saw you guys on Kimmel the other 
                        night. Pretty fuckin cool, man. You 
                        sounded great. 

                                 SERGE
                        You really think so?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Big time. 

                                 SERGE
                        Means a lot coming from the legend. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        The legend. Get outta here with 
                        that shit. 

                                 SERGE
                        Where you playing these days? 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I got a little four piece with Gus. 
                        We pick up shows here and there. 

           Serge motions to Frankie’s saxophone case. 

                                 SERGE
                        You guys playing in the lounge or 
                        something tonight?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Nah. 

                                 SERGE
                        Alright man, I gotta get back. Good 
                        seeing you. Let me know if you want 
                        to come to one of the shows. I’ll 
                        put you guys on the list. 

           INT. THE PINBALL HALL OF FAME - LATER

           Mike and Kate are playing neighboring pinball machines.  

                                 KATE
                        How old are you?

                                 MIKE
                        (laughs) Don’t be so transparent. 

                                 KATE
                        What’s that supposed to mean? 
                                 MIKE
                        I’m 28 and I know exactly why 
                        you’re wondering. 

                                 KATE
                        Oh yeah, why’s that?

                                 MIKE
                        You never thought you’d be on a 
                        date with a guy your age who has an 
                        eight year old son. 

                                 KATE
                        No. I never thought I’d be on a 
                        date at a pinball arcade with a guy 
                        my age. I just wanted to make sure 
                        you were over 18. 

                                 MIKE
                        Admit it. You’re a little freaked 
                        out that I have a kid. 

                                 KATE
                        I’m actually not. 

           Mike gives her a sideways glance like he doesn’t believe her. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Where is he tonight?

                                 MIKE
                        With his Uncle Frankie. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. THUNDER DOWN UNDER AT THE EXCALIBUR - CONTINUOUS

           Vinny is front row for Vegas’s most popular male strip show.  
           Off to the side, in the shadows, Frankie belts out a cabaret 
           number on his saxophone while 12 men gyrate their chiseled, 
           oiled-up bodies on stage. 

           INT. THE PINBALL HALL OF FAME - CONTINUOUS

           Back with Mike and Kate. 

                                 KATE
                        How many other siblings you have?

                                 MIKE
                        None. I’m an only child.  
                                 KATE
                        Oh, Uncle Frankie isn’t an uncle in 
                        the literal sense. 

                                 MIKE
                        No. Uncle in the sense that I’ve 
                        known him my entire life and he 
                        baby-sat Vinny a lot after me and 
                        Vinny’s mom split up. 

                                 KATE
                        You and your ex-wife on good terms?

                                 MIKE
                        We were never actually married. But 
                        things are ok with us, I guess. 

                                 KATE
                        That’s good. My dad cheated on my 
                        mom and in an attempt to get back 
                        at him, she told me every single 
                        detail about his affair. Like every 
                        detail. I was ten years old. 

                                 MIKE
                        Jesus. 

                                 KATE
                        Yeah. So it’s nice to know when 
                        some people have their kid’s best 
                        interest at heart and can separate 
                        like mature adults.

           Mike doesn’t say anything. 

           INT. FOUR QUEENS HOTEL & CASINO - NIGHT

           Mike stands behind the blackjack table with his arms behind 
           his back waiting for gamblers to play his table. 

           From out of nowhere, Ali shows up. 

                                 ALI
                        Hey. 

                                 MIKE
                        Hi. 

           Ali sits down at the empty table. 

                                 ALI
                        Sorry about the other day. 
                                 MIKE
                        I’m the one that should be sorry. 

                                 ALI
                        I thought a lot about what I said. 
                        And I realized I had no right to 
                        say any of it. I’m in no position 
                        to pass judgment on your life. 
                        You’re right, I never should’ve 
                        bought Vinny the skates. I think I 
                        just got ahead of myself. So I’m 
                        gonna take a step back and let you 
                        determine how this goes from here 
                        on out. I want to be in his life, 
                        but I also want to make sure it 
                        feels right for both of you. 

                                 MIKE
                        I’ve actually been thinking about 
                        what you said too. Playing a sport 
                        could be good for him.  

           Ali smiles, appreciative of the olive branch Mike just 
           extended. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I’m about to get off. You 
                        wanna get something to eat?

           INT. RESTAURANT - LATER

           Post dinner. Mike and Ali share a dessert. 

                                 MIKE
                        So “Nurse Brian.” 

                                 ALI
                        Why do you say it like that? You 
                        don’t like him?

                                 MIKE
                        Seems like a nice enough guy. He 
                        fixed you right up, huh?

                                 ALI
                        It was a compound fracture of the 
                        femur. They had to screw a metal 
                        pole into my bone. There was three 
                        surgeons. So, fixing me up was a 
                        team effort. 
                                 MIKE
                        No I just mean, like, it kind of 
                        seems like he swooped in and saved 
                        the day and helped you get sober. 

                                 ALI
                        I helped me get sober. 

                                 MIKE
                        How did you do it?

                                 ALI
                        I learned to love myself enough 
                        that I no longer needed to take 
                        drugs or drink. 

                                 MIKE
                        So how’s it work? You have a 
                        sponsor?

                                 ALI
                        I’m currently... in between 
                        sponsors.  

                                 MIKE
                        What happened to the old one?

                                 ALI
                        I started dating him. 

                                 MIKE
                        (surprised) Brian?

           Ali shrugs and makes a face like, it just kind of happened, 
           what do you want me to do?

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        What was he in for? Meth? 

           Ali smiles and rolls her eyes. 

           After a brief interval of silence, Ali leans down and pulls 
           up her pant leg, revealing a long scar down her thigh. 

                                 ALI
                        I can’t go through airport security 
                        without getting stopped. 

                                 MIKE
                        You know, I should’ve seen this 
                        coming.  

                                 ALI
                        What do you mean? 
                                 MIKE
                        You were unhappy and clearly self-
                        medicating for a while. I just 
                        thought it was a phase. I was too 
                        fucking stupid to see that you were 
                        begging for my help. 

                                 ALI
                        I was broken back then, Mike. 

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, and I should’ve been able to 
                        put you back together. 

           They sit in silence for a moment. 

                                 ALI
                        What about you? Any new scars since 
                        I’ve been gone?

           Mike lifts up both pant legs. 

                                 MIKE
                        I’ve been pretty careful. 

                                 ALI
                        No serious relationships?

                                 MIKE
                        Women aren’t exactly lining up to 
                        get together with a dude who has a 
                        kid you know? I’m damaged goods. 

                                 ALI
                        My bad. 

           Mike laughs. 

                                 MIKE
                        Tell you what. Come shoot craps 
                        with me and we’ll call it even. 

                                 ALI
                        I can’t gamble. 

                                 MIKE
                        How come?

                                 ALI
                        Just not supposed to. It has 
                        something to do with the high you 
                        get from it, I don’t know. 
                                 MIKE
                        So we can’t do any of the fun stuff 
                        we used to do together. Too bad. 

                                 ALI
                        You know what, fuck that. Let’s go 
                        shoot some dice.

           INT. CASINO - LATER

           Mike and Ali are huddled around a crowded craps table. 
           Everyone is making bets, tossing chips to the croupier.

                                 ALI
                        Let me get 22 on the inside. Five 
                        on hard eight. Five on hard four.

           The dice are slid to Ali. Before shooting, she begins an
           elaborately superstitious dice adjustment ritual.

           When she’s finally ready, she pinches the dice between her 
           thumb and index finger. She traces a circle on the felt and 
           in one fluid motion releases the dice in a perfect arc. 

                                 MIKE
                        Hard eight! 

           Ali does a little dance and high fives Mike. 

                                 ALI
                        (clapping her hands) Now we’re 
                        gambling! 

           More chips are tossed to the craps dealer and the dice are 
           slid back to Ali. She gets situated, ready for another roll.   

                                 MIKE
                        Ali. I need you to hit this point. 

           She winks at him, comin right up. 

           Ali sends the dice airborne. They ricochet off the bumper at 
           the other end of the table. Everyone explodes in celebration. 

           Mike screams. He lifts Ali up off the ground and spins her 
           around in a circle. 

           He sets her down, their faces just inches apart. It’s a 
           charged moment. Two people that used to be in love, staring 
           into each other’s eyes. 
           They start kissing. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - LITTLE LATER

           Ali digs her fingernails into Mike’s back as he fucks her on 
           the cheap hotel bed. 

           The headboard bangs against the wall. 

           Each thrust intensifies, culminating with one long groan of 
           exhaustion.

           Mike rolls off of Ali. She locates her underwear in the 
           tangle of sheets and slides them on. 

           They both lie there on their backs, out of breath and staring 
           up at the ceiling. 

           INT. DESERT SPRINGS MEDICAL CENTER - DAY

           Vinny lies on a physician’s table. Brian stands over him 
           pressing on specific areas of his legs, testing for pain. 

                                 BRIAN
                        What about now? (Vinny shakes his 
                        head, no) Good. Going to bend your 
                        ankle slightly, this one may hurt. 

           Mike sits in a nearby chair watching Brian slowly turn 
           Vinny’s ankle to the left, then the right. 

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        Any pain?

           Vinny shakes his head again, still nothing. 

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        Good.

           Just then, a woman in scrubs enters the room. 

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        Alright, Vinny. Samantha’s going to 
                        take you back and run a few quick x-
                        rays. Just take a minute. 

           Vinny hops off the table and follows her out of the room, 
           leaving Mike and Brian alone. 
                                 MIKE
                        Thanks for doing this. Been meaning 
                        to take him for a while, but --

                                 BRIAN
                        It’s my pleasure. No worries. He’s 
                        a good kid.  

                                 MIKE
                        Thanks. When you met Ali, did you 
                        know she had a son?

                                 BRIAN
                        Not at first. It took a long time 
                        before she opened up and told me 
                        about what happened. 

                                 MIKE
                        She told you everything? 

                                 BRIAN
                        Yeah, I know how bad it got. 

                                 MIKE
                        And Knowing all that didn’t scare 
                        you off?

                                 BRIAN
                        People make mistakes, you know? 
                        She’s a good person, Mike. You 
                        should get to know her again.

           Vinny and the woman return. She hands Brian the x-rays. 

           He looks them over for a moment. 

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        So, basically, what’s happening 
                        here is the growth rate of the 
                        bones in Vinny’s legs are exceeding 
                        the ability of the muscle-tendon 
                        unit to stretch sufficiently. This 
                        increases tension at the attachment 
                        site and triggers pain. It’s 
                        nothing to worry about. 

                                 MIKE
                        But he can barely walk some nights. 
                        He wakes up crying cause the pain 
                        is so bad. 

                                 BRIAN
                        I know. But they’re just growing 
                        pains. It’s totally normal. 
                                 MIKE
                        Growing pains? That’s it?

           Brian walks Mike and Vinny out of the examination room.

                                 BRIAN
                        That’s it. Next time those legs 
                        start to hurt, give him a few 
                        Tylenol. You could even throw a 
                        heating pad on it if you want. 
                        Otherwise... 

           He gives Vinny a high-five. 

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        ...you’re all good, dude. 

           Mike shakes Brian’s hand and thanks him again. Just before 
           he’s out the door, Mike stops. 

                                 MIKE
                        You mentioned you know someone that 
                        works in corporate at --- 

           Brian cuts him off, doesn’t even make Mike ask for the favor. 

                                 BRIAN
                        - at MGM. Yeah. Let me make a call. 

           INT. SUV - DAY

           Ali drives. Mike is in the passenger seat. Vinny in back. 

                                 ALI
                        Okay, Vinny you get three guesses. 

                                 VINNY
                        Uhh, Wet n’ Wild?

                                 MIKE
                        It’s February, dude. Water parks 
                        are closed till summer. Come on. 
                        Guess again. 

                                 VINNY
                        I hope it’s not the rollercoaster 
                        at New York New York, cause that 
                        thing is lame. 

                                 MIKE
                        Nope. Not that either. 
                                 VINNY
                        There’s a million different places 
                        you guys could be taking me. At 
                        least give me a hint. 

                                 MIKE
                        It’s something you’ve always wanted 
                        to do. 

           Before Vinny can answer Ali pulls the car into the parking 
           lot of a strip mall. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        (to Ali) You want to tell him, or 
                        should I?

           Ali nods, you do the honors.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Today is the day that you take your 
                        first step toward becoming the next 
                        Sidney Crosby. 

           Mike points to a sporting goods store.

           INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           Vinny, Mike and Ali enter and are greeted by a young guy 
           behind the counter. 

                                 EMPLOYEE 
                        Can I help you guys with anything?

                                 ALI
                        Our son starts playing hockey next 
                        week, but he doesn’t have any of 
                        the equipment he needs. 

                                 MIKE
                        Well, he’s got the skates. 

           Mike gives Ali a sideways glance. 

                                 ALI
                        He’s got skates, but nothing else. 
                        So, we were wondering if you could 
                        help him pick out everything.

                                 VINNY
                        What do you mean I start playing 
                        hockey next week? Is this a joke? 
                                 MIKE
                        Your mom and I signed you up. 
                        You’re on the Las Vegas Junior 
                        Golden Knights. Congratulations. 
                        You’re officially a hockey player. 

                                 VINNY
                        Are you guys kidding me?

                                 MIKE
                        Nope. But you better hurry up and 
                        figure out what you want cause you 
                        have your first ice skating lesson 
                        in an hour.

                                 VINNY
                        Ho-ly. Fuck. 

           Vinny rushes off with the employee. 

           INT. ICE RINK - LATER

           Mike and Ali sit next to each other in the bleachers watching 
           Vinny’s one-on-one skating lesson.  

           Mike looks over at Ali. 

                                 MIKE
                        The other night kind of got away 
                        from us, huh?

                                 ALI
                        That’s one way to put it. We should 
                        probably talk about that.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, probably. Felt like it kind 
                        of needed to happen. 

                                 ALI
                        I agree. But is it ok if we keep it 
                        as a secret one time thing we did? 

                                 MIKE
                        For sake of closure. 

                                 ALI
                        Exactly. Cause things are really 
                        good with me and Brian, and --
                                 MIKE
                        I know they are. (beat) I’m 
                        actually kind of seeing someone too 
                        by the way. 

                                 ALI
                        You are? I didn’t know that. 

                                 MIKE
                        Yep. 

                                 ALI
                        That’s great. Do you like her?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. She’s cool.

           INT. KATE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mike and Kate lie in bed. They’re clothed, but clearly post-
           coital. Mike lights a cigarette. 

                                 KATE
                        You smoke more than anyone I’ve 
                        ever met. 

                                 MIKE
                        Thanks. 

           Kate watches him take a deep drag then blow the smoke out of 
           his nostrils. 

                                 KATE
                        You’re lucky you look so fucking 
                        hot doing it. Otherwise I’d tell 
                        you, you should get a Juul or 
                        something. 

                                 MIKE
                        You want to be the girl having sex 
                        with a dude who smokes a Juul?

                                 KATE
                        Better than being the girl having 
                        sex with the dude with cancer. 

           Kate grabs the pack of cigarettes and lights her own.  

                                 MIKE
                        YOU should get a Juul. 

                                 KATE
                        I’ll get one if you get one. 
           Mike sets his cigarette down on the ash tray, then crawls on 
           top of Kate. He kisses her neck, but Kate pretends to be 
           uninterested.  

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Not until you promise to get a 
                        Juul. 

           Before Mike can answer, his phone buzzes. He gets out of bed, 
           and checks it. It’s a Facetime from Vinny. He answers. 

                                 MIKE
                        Hey bud. What’s up?

                                 VINNY (ON SCREEN)
                        I just beat Uncle Frankie and Uncle 
                        Gus at Monopoly. 

           Vinny flips the screen around, so Mike can see Frankie and 
           Gus sitting around a Monopoly board.  

                                 MIKE
                        Nice job, pal. Did Uncle Gus try to 
                        cheat?

                                 VINNY (ON SCREEN)
                        Yeah, a little. He kept pretending 
                        his chance and community chest 
                        cards were good when really they 
                        were bad. But I caught him. 

           Kate smiles, watching Mike talk to Vinny. 

                                 MIKE
                        What’d you have for dinner?

                                 VINNY (ON SCREEN)
                        Pizza. 

                                 MIKE
                        Nice. Homework?

                                 VINNY (ON SCREEN)
                        Finished it. What are you doing?

                                 MIKE
                        Nothing. Just hanging out. Say 
                        hello to Kate. 

           Mike flips the screen around so Vinny can see Kate. She 
           waves.  
           INT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Kate has been invited over for Monopoly night with Mike and 
           the guys. Classic rock is coming from the speakers. Couple 
           pizza boxes and empty beers cans are everywhere. 

           Kate rolls the dice, and moves her piece along the board. 

                                 VINNY
                        I hate to do it, Kate. But 
                        Mississippi Avenue is mine. With a 
                        hotel. That’ll be $850. 

           Kate hands Vinny the Monopoly money. 

                                 GUS
                        I don’t want Vinny being the banker 
                        anymore.  

                                 MIKE
                        What do you care who the banker is?

                                 GUS
                        Cause he’s cheating, I know it. 
                        Look, the little slum lord owns the 
                        whole fuckin board. I got nothing 
                        except Baltic and Mediterranean. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Don’t blame the eight year old 
                        cause you still haven’t figured out 
                        how to play this game. 

                                 GUS
                        I got just as many wins as you do, 
                        don’t I? You fuck boy. 

                                 MIKE
                        No you don’t. 

           Mike points to a chalkboard on the wall with years worth of 
           Monopoly tallies. Gus is clearly in last place. 

                                 KATE
                        You guys weren’t kidding when you 
                        said you took Monopoly seriously. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s no joke. You’re the first 
                        outsider to ever be let into the 
                        game, Kate. 

                                 KATE
                        Well, I’m honored. 
                                 VINNY
                        Hey Kate. Can I ask you a question?

                                 KATE
                        You can ask me anything, Vinny.

                                 VINNY
                        How big is your purse?

                                 MIKE
                        You don’t have to answer that. 
                        Vinny, knock it off.

                                 KATE
                        My purse?

           Kate tires to show the dimensions of her purse with her 
           hands. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Like this big. Normal size. 

           Vinny gives Mike a big thumbs up. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Oh! That reminds me. Ok, I know 
                        your birthday’s not until next 
                        month but... 

           She opens her purse and hands Mike a brand new Juul. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        ...consider it an early gift. 

           Mike smiles and rolls his eyes. Frankie and Gus laugh. 

                                 VINNY
                        What is that?

                                 KATE
                        It’s gonna help your dad not smoke 
                        so much.

                                 VINNY
                        Cool. 

           Frankie gets up and walks over to the turntable and a shelf 
           of vinyl. He thumbs through records. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Any requests?

           Mike whispers something into Kate’s ear. 
                                 KATE
                        Frankie, do you have any Santana?

           Frankie looks back, with an angry look on his face, then 
           realizes that Mike put her up to that. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        That shit’s not funny, Kate. I 
                        woulda had to kick your ass outta 
                        here if you were serious. This is a 
                        strictly no Santana household. 

                                 KATE
                        What’s wrong with Santana? 

                                 MIKE
                        He’s got some vendetta against him 
                        for no reason. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Not true. I got my reasons.

                                 KATE
                        Well what are they?

           Frankie sits down.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Alright, look. Only reason I’m 
                        gonna tell you all this is cause 
                        Kate’s here and I like her and I 
                        don’t want her thinking I go around 
                        hating on people for no reason. 
                        (beat) Now, I never told no one 
                        this before, but remember when my 
                        grandma died, and we all had to 
                        help box up her house? Most of the 
                        shit went to Goodwill, but I kept 
                        this one box for myself. So one 
                        night, this is probably like our 
                        senior year, I’m kinda missing 
                        Grandma and I start going through 
                        the box, and I come across this 
                        little journal with my mom’s name 
                        on it. It felt too weird to read 
                        personal shit about my mom, so I 
                        tossed the book back in the box. 
                        But it just so happened to land 
                        open and I see a concert ticket 
                        taped to one of the pages. I look 
                        and it’s from a Santana show from 
                        like 74 or some shit. So now I’m 
                        intrigued and I start reading her 
                        little journal entry. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        (beat) So after the show, my mom 
                        and her friends ended up backstage, 
                        hanging out with the band and... 

           Frankie is quiet for a long beat.  

                                 MIKE
                        What? And what???

                                 FRANKIE
                        Nevermind, I can’t say it. It’s too 
                        fucked up.  

                                 KATE
                        You can’t back out of this story 
                        now. And what???

                                 FRANKIE
                        And... my mom fucked Carlos 
                        Santana. On his tour bus. And a 
                        bunch of other places that night.

                                 MIKE & GUS
                        What!?

                                 FRANKIE
                        And she wrote down every last nasty 
                        ass detail in that little journal. 
                        And I read every word. (beat) That 
                        nigga Santana is a freak! I never 
                        could look at my mom the same 
                        again. 

                                 MIKE
                        How have you never told us about 
                        this?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Now you know why I get heated every 
                        time Europa comes on. 

           Mike and Gus laugh.

           Gus walks over and sits down at the wooden piano in the 
           living room. He starts playing Santana’s “Smooth” featuring 
           Rob Thomas. Frankie runs over and puts him in a head lock. 

                                 GUS
                        Sorry, I had to. 

           Gus changes it up and plays the opening chords of “Whipping 
           Post” by The Allman Brothers. 
                                 MIKE
                        Yes! 

           Frankie puts down his beer, picks up his saxophone and joins 
           in, playing the melody. 

                                 GUS
                        (singing) “I’ve been run down. I’ve 
                        been lied to. And I don’t know why, 
                        I let that mean woman make me a 
                        fool.”

           Mike and Vinny sit down next to Gus at the piano and join in.

                                 MIKE & VINNY & GUS
                        (singing) “She took all my money!”

           Kate sits down on the couch for a front row seat of the 
           impromptu jam session. 

                                 MIKE & VINNY & GUS (CONT’D)
                        (singing) “Wrecked my new car. Now 
                        she’s with one of my good time 
                        buddies. They’re drinking in some 
                        crosstown bar. Sometimes I feel.” 

           Now Frankie is really laying into it, playing the song’s 
           guitar solo but on the saxophone. 

                                 MIKE & VINNY & GUS (CONT’D)
                        (singing) “SOMETIMES I FEEL.” 

           Mike puts his arm around Vinny. 

                                 MIKE & VINNY & GUS (CONT’D)
                        (singing) “Like I been tied to the 
                        whipping post. Tied to the whipping 
                        post. Tied to the whipping post. 
                        Good lord I feel like I’m dying.” 

           To Kate it looks like they’re having the best night of their 
           lives, and her heart melts a little. 

           INT. / EXT. MIKE’S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

           Mike drives. Frankie is shotgun. Vinny and Gus are in the 
           backseat. He pulls into parking lot of the Fiesta Casino.

           Everyone gets out except Vinny. 

                                 MIKE
                        What’s wrong, bud?
                                 VINNY
                        I don’t want to play anymore, dad. 
                        Let’s just forget this whole thing 
                        and go home.

                                 MIKE
                        Dude, this is your first real 
                        hockey practice. You’ve been 
                        waiting for this day your entire 
                        life. 

                                 VINNY
                        What if I suck?

                                 MIKE
                        You’re not gonna suck. 

                                 VINNY
                        But what if I do and all the other 
                        kids think I’m a joke?

           Mike sits down in the backseat next to Vinny. Puts his arm 
           around him. 

                                 MIKE
                        You know it took your Uncle Frankie 
                        two years before he could even kind 
                        of play the saxophone? Ask him. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s true, bro. I was the worst. 

                                 MIKE
                        Point is, if you suck, then you’ll 
                        practice really hard until you 
                        don’t suck. Or, you can quit, pick 
                        a new sport.

           Vinny gets out of the car feeling better about everything. 

                                 GUS
                        Yo Vinny. Don’t take any shit from 
                        anyone on the ice, okay? 

           Vinny smiles. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        He’s right. You’re a hockey player 
                        now, so you’re allowed to put a 
                        beat down on anyone you want. Kids. 
                        Coaches. Parents. If they fuck with 
                        you, you take off those little 
                        gloves, and whoop their ass. 
           Gus hands Vinny his hockey bag and hockey stick. They walk 
           through the parking lot.  

           INT. FIESTA HOTEL & CASINO - CONTINUOUS

           The guys cut through a bank of video poker machines and make 
           their way into the ice rink that’s attached to the casino. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER

           With his hockey bag slung over his shoulder, Vinny enters to 
           find a room full of kids his age. 

           He looks for a spot on the bench, but there’s no room. 

           Then, a KID slides down, makes space for Vinny.   

                                 HOCKEY KID
                        You can sit here. I’m Mikey 
                        Respoli.  

           He extends his hand to Vinny. They shake. 

                                 VINNY
                        I’m Vinny. 

           Vinny sits down and starts getting ready for practice. 

           INT. MGM CORPORATE OFFICES - WEEK LATER

           Mike - in a pair of khakis and a button down - is being 
           interviewed by a guy in a suit. 

           The interview is just coming to an end. 

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Alright, well it was good meeting 
                        you, Mike. As I said earlier, your 
                        resume was at the top of the stack. 
                        Clearly you got the right people in 
                        your corner, so this was just a 
                        preliminary thing really. A 
                        formality. Normally I’d be able to 
                        fit you in at one of our casinos, 
                        no problem. You’d have a job in the 
                        next week or so. Unfortunately, I 
                        don’t have any dealer positions 
                        available at the moment. 

                                 MIKE
                        Oh. 
                                 INTERVIEWER 
                        But. We are actually looking to 
                        fill an opening in guest services 
                        and client relations at our 
                        Bellagio location. It would be much 
                        more interpersonal than what you’re 
                        doing now. It’s more on the 
                        hospitality side of the business. 
                        But there’s potential for upward 
                        mobility. The hours are steady and 
                        you’d be on salary, so the pay is 
                        better. Two weeks paid vacation. 
                        That kind of thing. What do you 
                        think?

                                 MIKE
                        I think that sounds great. 

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Cool. I will say, however, that 
                        it’s a considerable more amount of 
                        work than dealing blackjack. We 
                        need someone who is accountable and 
                        dependable and willing to go the 
                        extra step for clients. So, if you 
                        still think you’re up for it...  

                                 MIKE
                        Yes. I’m totally up for it. 

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Okay, great. Let  me do my thing 
                        and someone will contact you to 
                        schedule a time to do the next 
                        round of meetings. They’ll be a 
                        little more intense than this one 
                        was. There will be a background 
                        check. You’ll have to pass a drug 
                        test of course. 

           Mike shifts in his seat a little. 

                                 INTERVIEWER (CONT’D)
                        But yeah, I think you’d be great 
                        for the position. Thanks for coming 
                        in.  

           They stand up and shake hands. 

           EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

           A pre-season hockey banquet is underway. Mike and Ali stand 
           around the pool, mingling with other parents. 
           Vinny sits in a circle with the rest of his teammates, while 
           the COACH hands out hockey jerseys to each player. 

                                 COACH
                        And last but not least, number 99. 
                        Vinny Klein. 

           Everyone claps as Vinny gets up and accepts his jersey. 

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        So, that’s it. First game is just a 
                        couple weeks away. Appreciate 
                        everyone coming out for this nice 
                        little team bonding session. (holds 
                        up his beer) Here’s to a great 
                        season. 

           LITTLE LATER: the music’s going and the coach is on the 
           grill, flipping hotdogs and hamburgers. 

           Vinny is in the pool on the shoulders of one of his
           teammates, playing chicken against two other boys.

           Mike and Ali are nearby, standing underneath the patio.

                                 ALI
                        How’s everything going with your
                        girlfriend?

                                 MIKE
                        She’s not my girlfriend. 

                                 ALI
                        (smiles) Has Vinny met her?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, a few times. 

                                 ALI
                        And?

                                 MIKE
                        He likes her. But don’t read into 
                        that. He likes everyone. 

           They watch Vinny splashing around in the pool. Ali smiles. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I’m proud of us. 

                                 ALI
                        Me too. 

           Mike holds Ali’s hand.
                                 ALI (CONT’D)
                        This is kind of awkward so I’m just 
                        going to come out and say it. 

           Mike looks at her. 

                                 ALI (CONT’D)
                        I’m pregnant. 

                                 MIKE
                        (eyes wide) From... 

                                 ALI
                        No. I’m eight weeks pregnant. 

           Mike does the math in his head. 

                                 MIKE
                        Wait. So you... did you know when 
                        we...?

                                 ALI
                        No. (beat) I don’t know. Maybe.

                                 MIKE
                        Maybe? And you fucked me?

                                 ALI
                        I’m sorry. I suspected it, but I 
                        was too scared to find out for 
                        sure, so I didn’t take the test 
                        until a few days ago.

           A couple of the other parents start to sense that something 
           is wrong. Ali takes this as a cue, and cuts through the back 
           gate to the front yard. Mike follows her out. 

                                 MIKE
                        So you knew you were pregnant. And 
                        you still fucked me? What the fuck 
                        is wrong with you?

                                 ALI
                        I don’t know. Every time I look at 
                        you. And every time I look at Vinny 
                        I’m reminded about what I did. 

           Ali sits down on the curb and puts her head in her hands. 

           INT. SPORTS BOOK AT THE PALACE STATION CASINO - DAY

           Mike, Frankie and Gus are watching a basketball game. A 
           cocktail waitress comes over, hands Mike a shot and a beer. 
           Mike downs the shot and slugs the beer. 

                                 MIKE
                        Yo, on my way here I saw Serge 
                        Stanton’s band on a billboard. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yeah, I ran into him. They got a 
                        couple shows in Vegas coming up. He 
                        invited us. 

                                 MIKE
                        You wanna go?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Nah. Fuck that. 

           Gus gets up and walks over to the window to place a bet. 

           Mike lights a cigarette, he stands up, approaches Frankie. 

                                 MIKE
                        Yo, lemme get that bag. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        That’s a joke right? You’re trying 
                        to be funny? 

                                 MIKE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Don’t you have that job interview 
                        coming up?  

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, so?

                                 FRANKIE
                        What are you fuckin stupid? They’re 
                        gonna drug test you. 

                                 MIKE
                        The interview is in like five days. 
                        Just gimme the fuckin coke. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        No. Fuck outta here. 

                                 MIKE
                        I’m serious. Give it to me.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’m not giving it to you. 
                                 MIKE
                        I don’t need you fuckin monitoring 
                        me like you’re my dad or something. 
                        (forceful) Give it to me.

           Mike holds out his hand. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Fine. Here. (under his breath) 
                        Fuckin loser.  

                                 MIKE
                        What was that?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Nothing. 

           Frankie throws the bag of coke on the ground. Mike bends down 
           to pick it up. 

                                 MIKE
                        Oh, I’m the loser?

                                 FRANKIE
                        You sure look like one to me. 

                                 MIKE
                        What about you? You’re the 
                        definition of loser. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Oh yeah? Define it for me then, big 
                        guy. Can’t wait to hear this one. 

                                 MIKE
                        Someone who’s too scared to go to 
                        an old friend’s concert because 
                        their band is famous.

                                 FRANKIE
                        There you go. Flip it. Turn it on 
                        me, so you don’t have to examine 
                        your own life.  

           Mike taunts Frankie by dumping a little mound of coke on the 
           back of his hand and quickly snorting it up his nose. 

           Frankie gives Mike a thumbs up. 

           When Mike turns to leave, a SECURITY GUARD is standing there. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Mike. Come on man, what the fuck. 
                                 MIKE
                        What? You think I’m the only one in 
                        here doing coke? Please. 

           Mike points to the room full of gamblers, watching baseball 
           and screaming at horse races.  

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Look at all these losers. Go bother 
                        them. Leave me alone. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I gotta kick you out. You can’t do 
                        that shit in here. Sorry.  

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not leaving.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        You have to. 

                                 MIKE
                        Make me, you fuckin rent-a-cop.  

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        (into walkie talkie) I got a 212 
                        and a disorderly perp in the sports 
                        book.  

           Mike turns to leave. Gus returns just as Mike is seeing 
           himself out. Gus makes a face and Frankie just shrugs. 

           INT. KATE’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Mike and Kate are lying in bed. Kate has her head on Mike’s 
           shoulder. 

                                 KATE
                        I haven’t felt this comfortable in 
                        a long time. 

                                 MIKE
                        If you think my boney ass shoulder 
                        is comfortable, you should try a 
                        pillow. 

                                 KATE
                        You know what I mean. This. Us... 
                        feels really good. 

           She kisses him. 
                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        You’re not seeing anyone else are 
                        you?

                                 MIKE
                        No.

                                 KATE
                        Just wanted to make sure. Cause I’m 
                        not either. 

           Mike says nothing.  

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        You got quiet. Mike? Do you plan on 
                        seeing anyone else? 

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t know. 

                                 KATE
                        You don’t know?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, I don’t know. 

                                 KATE
                        Can you try to think about it? It’s 
                        kind of a serious question. 

                                 MIKE
                        Actually it’s kind of an insane 
                        question.

                                 KATE
                        Insane?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. Asking me if I plan on seeing 
                        other people? When? Like a year 
                        from now? Two years? I don’t know, 
                        yeah sure. I’ll probably see 
                        someone other than you at some 
                        point in my life. 

                                 KATE
                        I’m so confused. 

                                 MIKE
                        Why, because I’m being honest?

                                 KATE
                        No. Because I thought there was 
                        something special going on here.
                                 MIKE
                        So what if there is? Then what? 
                        Were you expecting to fall in love 
                        and get married and live happily 
                        ever after? Waking up in the 
                        mornings, making Vinny breakfast 
                        and dropping him off at school? 

                                 KATE
                        I don’t know what I was expecting. 
                        All I was saying was that I want to 
                        give this a shot and that I’m open 
                        to letting it go wherever it goes. 

                                 MIKE
                        This whole time, I thought you were 
                        normal. But it turns out you’re 
                        crazy just like the rest of them.

                                 KATE
                        Fuck you. At least I’m not a pussy. 

                                 MIKE
                        Get the fuck out of here. 

                                 KATE
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that. 

                                 MIKE
                        Go. I’m serious.

                                 KATE
                        (angry) No, I’m not leaving until 
                        you tell me what’s going on.

                                 MIKE
                        You want to know what’s going on? 
                        This whole thing is bullshit. 

                                 KATE
                        No it’s not. 

           She grabs Mike’s arm, but he pulls away. 

                                 MIKE
                        Yes it fuckin is! You’re using me. 
                        And that’s bullshit. 

                                 KATE
                        How am I using you?
                                 MIKE
                        You think I’m stupid? You think I 
                        don’t know you’re just killing time 
                        with me, waiting for your little on 
                        again off again boyfriend to decide 
                        he’s ready to settle down? Please. 
                        Just do us both a favor and leave. 

           Kate says nothing. The tears are coming. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Just go.

           Mike just sits there, watching her cry and put on her 
           clothes.  

           INT. THE HOUSE - LATER 

           Mike lies on his bed smoking a cigarette. 

           In the living room, Frankie and Gus are on the couch watching 
           TV. 

           There’s a knock on the door. Gus answers, it’s Ali. 

                                 ALI
                        Is Mike here? He was supposed to 
                        drop Vinny off so I can take him to 
                        practice.  

           Just then, Mike comes out from his bedroom.

                                 MIKE
                        He’s not going. He’s sick.

                                 ALI
                        Are you sure? Cause I was literally 
                        just texting with him and --

                                 MIKE
                        He’s not going, ok! This is over. 

                                 ALI
                        What’s over?

                                 MIKE
                        This whole co-parenting thing. It’s 
                        not working for me anymore. 

           This gets Frankie and Gus’s attention. 
                                 ALI
                        Can we talk about this later 
                        tonight? After practice? He’s gonna 
                        be late. Vinny? Honey? Let’s go. 

           Vinny comes out from his room. 

                                 VINNY
                        But my dad said practice got 
                        cancelled. 

                                 ALI
                        It didn’t. Go grab your bag, so 
                        we’re not late. 

                                 VINNY
                        Cool. 

           Vinny runs off into the garage. Re-appears with his hockey 
           bag and stick. 

                                 MIKE
                        Hey Vinny. Lemme ask you something. 
                        Do you trust your mom?

                                 VINNY
                        (confused) Yeah. 

                                 MIKE
                        You sure about that? Oh wait. 
                        That’s right. She never told you 
                        about what happened when you were 
                        just a little baby, did she?

           Vinny looks at his dad. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        Stay out of this, Frank. I want to 
                        make sure my son knows how 
                        dangerous it could be to get in the 
                        car with his mom. 

           Ali looks at Mike with pleading eyes. 

                                 ALI
                        Mike, please. Don’t. 

                                 MIKE
                        Go ahead. Tell him what happened.

           Frankie gets up from the couch. 
                                 FRANKIE
                        Don’t do this, bro. 

                                 MIKE
                        No. He needs to know. Tell our son 
                        why you left, Ali. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Vinny, go with your mom. You’re 
                        gonna be late for practice.

           Frankie gets in Mike’s face. Mike shoves him. 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m fuckin warning you. Stop this.

                                 MIKE
                        Fine, I’ll tell him. Vinny, your 
                        mom --  

           Boom. Frankie throws all his weight into Mike and takes him 
           to the ground. 

           Mike thrashes. Elbows Frankie in the jaw. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Get the fuck off me. 

           Ali and Gus are frozen, watching the tangled up mess of arms 
           and legs rolling around on the ground. 

           In the chaos, no one notices Vinny run out of the house until 
           the front door slams behind him. 

           From the window, Ali sees Vinny get behind the wheel of 
           Mike’s car. He fires up the engine and awkwardly backs it out 
           of the driveway, taking out the mailbox in his path.  

                                 ALI
                        Vinny! 

           Ali runs out of the house, but doesn’t get there in time.

           Mike comes flying out of the house just as Vinny straightens 
           the car out and goes speeding away toward the busy 
           intersection at the end of the street.

                                 MIKE
                        Vinny!

           He takes off running after the car. 
           INT. MIKE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Vinny can’t see over the steering wheel, but he watches the 
           speedometer as it climbs to 15, 20, 25 miles per hour. 

           He presses down on the gas a little harder and sends the car 
           barreling through the intersection. 

           Honking cars skid out of the way, somehow avoiding a head on 
           collision. 

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Mike runs down the sidewalk. 

           As he approaches the top of the street, he watches as Vinny 
           just narrowly makes it through the intersection, before the 
           car careens into a ditch. 

           Mike’s vision blurs and his heart sinks into his stomach. 

           He sprints across the street. 

           He approaches the car. It’s gone head first into the ditch. 
           Smoke wafts out from the hood.

           Mike inches closer to the car and sees Vinny sitting, totally 
           still, in the drivers seat.

                                 MIKE
                        Vinny. 

           No response. 

           Mike starts to panic. He tries the handle, but the door is 
           locked. He tries them all, but they’re all locked.  

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Vinny!

           Finally, Vinny turns his head and makes eye contact with his 
           dad. Miraculously, he’s totally fine.

                                 VINNY
                        Leave me alone! 

                                 MIKE
                        Vinny, tell me you’re okay. Unlock 
                        the doors.  

           Vinny cups the palms of his hands over his ears. 
                                 VINNY
                        I don’t want to hear anything bad 
                        about my mom. I don’t want to hear 
                        anything bad about my mom. 

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not going to say anything bad 
                        about your mom. I promise. Please, 
                        just come out of the car. 

                                 VINNY
                        No. 

                                 MIKE
                        I really need you to unlock the 
                        doors, bud. I just want to make 
                        sure you’re not hurt. 

                                 VINNY
                        Go away! I hate you!

           Just then, Ali arrives, out of breath. She looks at Mike. 

                                 MIKE
                        He’s okay. But he won’t come out. 

           Ali approaches the car. 

                                 ALI
                        Honey. Can you do us a favor and 
                        please come out? 

           She places the palm of her hand on the window and smiles. 

           Vinny unlocks the doors and gets out of the car. 

           Ali hugs him tighter than she’s ever hugged anyone in her 
           life.

           INT. THE HOUSE - LATER

           Mike lies in his bed, staring up at the ceiling. 

           Later, he showers. He wipes the steam from the glass. Looks 
           at himself. 

           He gets ready for work. 
           INT. MIKE’S CAR - LATER

           Mike sits in his car smoking. All of a sudden he snaps. He 
           punches the steering wheel repeatedly until his knuckles are 
           raw and he’s out of breath. 

           INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - LITTLE LATER

           Mike knocks on Kate’s door. He waits, standing there in his 
           work clothes, but no one answers. 

           He knocks again. Eventually a GUY in mesh shorts and a tank 
           top answers. Mike knows right away this is Kate’s ex. 

                                 KATE’S EX BOYFRIEND
                        Dude. Stop calling and stop texting 
                        her. She doesn’t want to fucking 
                        see you, okay? 

           Mike turns around and walks away. 

           INT. MIKE’S CAR (MOVING) - LATER

           Mike drives the freeway, windows down, wind blowing in his 
           hair. 

           INT. FOUR QUEENS HOTEL & CASINO - LATER

           Mike deals blackjack. 

           He is relieved by an incoming dealer, and on his way to the 
           break room, he sees Frankie waiting for him. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Hey.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey. Sorry about earlier. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yeah, me too. 

           INT. FOUR QUEENS HOTEL & CASINO - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike and Frankie are sitting on two of the leather seats in 
           the keno lounge. 
                                 FRANKIE
                        Yo. Been meaning to ask you. What’s 
                        up with you and Kate? Where she 
                        been?

                                 MIKE
                        We’re done. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        What you mean?

                                 MIKE
                        We broke up. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Fuck. That sucks, bro. I’m sorry. 
                        What happened?

                                 MIKE
                        She got back with her ex or 
                        something. Whatever, I’m not 
                        worried about it. It’s all good.

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s all good? You liked her, 
                        didn’t you? (Mike nods) So how the 
                        fuck is that all good?

                                 MIKE
                        You know what I mean. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yeah. Unfortunately I do know what 
                        you mean. 

           Long beat. Frankie stares at Mike. 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        The week after your mom died. It 
                        was the night you were moving in 
                        with me and my mom. I remember you 
                        were in my room, unpacking. I came 
                        in while you were putting your 
                        clothes in those two little drawers 
                        I gave you at the bottom of my 
                        dresser. And I asked how you were 
                        doing. You looked at me. And do you 
                        remember what you said?

                                 MIKE
                        No. 
                                 FRANKIE
                        You said it’s all good. I’ll never 
                        forget that. Your mom wasn’t dead 
                        two minutes. You were officially an 
                        orphan, all alone in the world. And 
                        you had no tears. You weren’t mad. 
                        You weren’t sad. It was just all 
                        good. You said the same thing to me 
                        and Gus that day we came over after 
                        Ali left. You spent your entire 
                        life telling yourself it was all 
                        good. And it finally caught up to 
                        you. It ain’t all good, bro. It’s 
                        never been all good. So stop 
                        pretending like it is. 

                                 MIKE
                        I know. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        If you know, then fix shit with 
                        Kate. I’m serious. Go get in your 
                        car right now and drive over to her 
                        house and tell her you’re sorry. 
                        That’s what you should do.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah I should do a lot of things. I 
                        should probably quit smoking too. I 
                        should stop gambling. I should get 
                        a girlfriend. I know I should do 
                        all that.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Then why aren’t you doing it?

                                 MIKE
                        Cause shit always winds up the same 
                        for me. So there’s no point.

                                 FRANKIE
                        You know what the point is. Your 
                        son. Vinny. That’s the fuckin 
                        point.  

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, Vinny’s always come first, 
                        and look where that got me. It was 
                        me and him against the world. 
                        Nothing could ever break us apart, 
                        right? Wrong. She comes waltzing 
                        back in and the whole thing comes 
                        crashing down, turns to shit, just 
                        like it always does. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MIKE (CONT'D)
                        Now I’m the bad guy. He told me he 
                        hated me. He’s my best friend. And 
                        he told me he hated me. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Maybe he doesn’t need a best friend 
                        anymore. Maybe it’s about time he 
                        got a father. 

           Mike gets quiet. Let’s that sink in. 

           INT. ALI AND BRIAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Vinny is on the couch alone watching a hockey game. Ali comes 
           into the living room, sits next to him. 

                                 ALI
                        Are you doing okay, honey? (Vinny 
                        nods) Today scared you, didn’t it?

           Vinny thinks for a moment. He nods. 

                                 ALI (CONT’D)
                        You’re not used to seeing your dad 
                        act that way, and that was 
                        confusing. Sometimes, when you get 
                        confused, it’s scary. So what you 
                        were feeling was normal, I want you 
                        to know that. I also want you to 
                        know that your dad has been going 
                        through a lot lately. And he never 
                        meant for you to see any of that 
                        stuff. He loves you very much.

                                 VINNY
                        What happened between you and my 
                        dad?

                                 ALI
                        When I was younger the world was a 
                        very confusing place for me. I 
                        didn’t have parents who knew how to 
                        help me through that. So I always 
                        felt like I was alone and that 
                        scared me. 

                                 VINNY
                        You left because you were scared?

                                 ALI
                        Yes. But I always knew I would be 
                        back. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALI (CONT'D)
                        And I knew that while I was gone, 
                        you would always be okay with your 
                        dad because he’s the strongest and 
                        best man I’ve ever met. You’re very 
                        lucky to have him as your father. 

                                 VINNY
                        I know. 

           Vinny hugs Ali. 

           INT. FOUR QUEENS HOTEL & CASINO - NIGHT

           Mike is behind the blackjack table, dealing to two women who 
           don’t really know how to play. 

           He deals the first woman an ace and a king.

                                 WOMAN 1
                        Blackjack! 

           She high fives her friend. The other woman has an ace and a 
           six. She stares at her cards for a long beat. 

                                 MIKE
                        Soft seventeen. What do you wanna 
                        do?

                                 WOMAN 2
                        Soft what? Sorry this is my first 
                        time. 

                                 MIKE
                        (smiles) That’s okay. The ace can 
                        either be an eleven or a one. So 
                        since your hand can be seen as 
                        having seventeen or seven, we call 
                        that a soft seventeen. 

                                 WOMAN 2
                        Got it. So what should I do?

                                 MIKE
                        Well I’m showing an eight and you 
                        always assume the dealer’s card you 
                        can’t see is a ten. In which case, 
                        I’d have 18 and your hand would be 
                        smaller than mine and you’d lose. 

                                 WOMAN 2
                        But what if you don’t have a ten 
                        under there and my seventeen could 
                        win? 
                                 MIKE
                        That’s why the choice of whether or 
                        not to hit or stay is difficult. 

                                 WOMAN 2
                        Shit. Okay, so I can stay small. Or 
                        take a chance for a bigger hand? 

                                 MIKE
                        That’s right. 

                                 WOMAN 2
                        What would you do if you were me?

                                 MIKE
                        I’d hit. 

           The woman gives her friend a look, smiles. 

                                 WOMAN 2
                        Okay. Hit me! 

           Mike pulls a card from the shoe and flips it over. It’s a 
           four.

                                 WOMAN 2 (CONT’D)
                        Twenty one! I did it. 

           Mike flips his card, and just like he said, he has 18. He 
           pays the woman.

           EXT. FOUR QUEENS HOTEL & CASINO - NEXT MORNING

           Mike gets off work and drives to Ali’s house. 

           EXT. ALI AND BRIAN’S HOUSE - LATER

           Mike pulls into the driveway and waits for Vinny. Instead, 
           Ali comes out and approaches Mike’s car.  

                                 ALI
                        Vinny and Brian ran to the store. 
                        They’ll be back any minute. You 
                        want to come in and wait for them? 
                        I just made coffee.

           INT. ALI AND BRIAN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ali pours Mike a cup of coffee. He notices a picture of Ali’s 
           ultrasound on the kitchen island. He picks it up. 
                                 MIKE
                        Congratulations. 

                                 ALI
                        Hopefully I can get it right this 
                        time around.   

                                 MIKE
                        You will. I’m happy for you, Ali.  

                                 ALI
                        How could you be? After everything 
                        I’ve put you through. 

                                 MIKE
                        For some bizarre reason, I used to 
                        think I had my shit together. But 
                        it took you coming back into my 
                        life in order for me to realize I 
                        didn’t. You helped me realize 
                        people can change. 

                                 ALI
                        Mike, I still have so far to go. 

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, you do. But you’re not the 
                        same person that walked out on us. 
                        And that’s the person I was 
                        comparing myself to. I told myself, 
                        I just had to make sure I was doing 
                        a better job than you, the mother 
                        who locked her son in the car that 
                        day. I set the bar so low that I 
                        never had to examine whether or not 
                        I was doing a good job as a parent. 
                        As long as I wasn’t almost killing 
                        Vinny, I was doing ok. But then you 
                        showed up and it forced me to look 
                        at what I had become. 

           A beat. Ali studies Mike.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not a good father. 

           Mike’s eyes start to shine with tears. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I thought I was, but I’m not. 

           The dam bursts, and all the sadness that Mike has been 
           holding back - a lifetime’s worth of sorrow - is released. 
                                 ALI
                        I’m so sorry. 

           Ali hugs him. 

           INT. MIKE’S CAR - LATER

           Mike is about to pull out of Ali’s driveway. Vinny is in the 
           passenger seat. 

                                 MIKE
                        You mad at me? It’s okay if you 
                        are. 

                                 VINNY
                        I was. But now I’m not anymore. 

                                 MIKE
                        You wanna come with me to get a 
                        haircut?

                                 VINNY
                        Sure. 

           Mike backs out. 

           INT. BARBER SHOP - LATER

           Clippers buzz. Clumps of hair fall to the floor. Mike and 
           Vinny sit side by side, getting their hair cut. 

           Mike’s long stringy hair has been chopped off, reduced to a 
           stylish short on the sides look. 

                                 VINNY
                        Hey dad, one of my friends on my 
                        team. Mikey Respoli. He told me his 
                        older brother plays hockey at some 
                        fancy boarding school in 
                        Connecticut and he just found out 
                        that he got a scholarship to a 
                        college. Do you know what a 
                        scholarship is?

                                 MIKE
                        (laughs) Yes. 

                                 VINNY
                        It’s when you don’t have to pay for 
                        college because you’re so good at a 
                        sport. I’m gonna get a scholarship 
                        one day.
           Mike smiles at Vinny. The barber hands Mike the mirror to 
           check out the back. He nods, happy with what he sees. 

                                 BARBER
                        What about the beard?

           Mike looks at his face in the mirror. 

           INT. MIKE’S CAR - LATER

           Mike and vinny get in. Mike looks like a totally different 
           person with short hair and no beard.  

                                 VINNY
                        You look younger than me. 

           Mike checks himself out in the rearview.

                                 MIKE
                        I know. Weird. 

                                 VINNY
                        Oh, dad. That kid Mikey Respoli I 
                        was telling you about. With the 
                        brother. He’s having a bunch of 
                        kids from the team sleep over his 
                        house tonight. Can I go?

                                 MIKE
                        Of course. 

           Mike puts the key in the ignition, but doesn’t turn it on.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Vinny. You’re going to be moving in 
                        with your mom and Brian for a 
                        little bit. 

                                 VINNY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 MIKE
                        Your mom and I talked this morning 
                        and decided it’s what’s best for 
                        you.

                                 VINNY
                        I don’t want to live with them. I 
                        want to live with you. And Uncle 
                        Frankie and Uncle Gus.  
                                 MIKE
                        I know you do. And I want you to 
                        live with us too. It’s just not a 
                        normal thing. To be 8 years old 
                        living with your dad and his high 
                        school buddies. 

                                 VINNY
                        Yes it is. 

                                 MIKE
                        No it isn’t. 

                                 VINNY
                        Please don’t make me. I want to 
                        stay with you. 

           Vinny looks like he might cry. 

                                 MIKE
                        This isn’t permanent. It’s not 
                        gonna be forever. Just until I can 
                        get my shit together a little bit. 
                        We’ll still see each other all the 
                        time, I promise. This is for the 
                        best. I love you and I want to be a 
                        better dad for you. 

                                 VINNY
                        But you don’t need to be a better 
                        dad. 

           Mike leans over and hugs Vinny.  

           EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

           Mike is going for a jog through the neighborhood. Earphones 
           in. Shirt is soaked with sweat. 

           As he approaches his house, he sprints as fast as his body 
           will allow. 

           INT. THE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike enters the house out of breath after his run to find 
           Frankie and Gus waiting for him. They have a present wrapped 
           up, bow on top. 

                                 GUS
                        You thought we forgot, didn’t you?
                                 FRANKIE
                        Happy birthday, bro. Open it up. 

           Mike unwraps the gift and looks down into the box. His brow 
           furrows. 

                                 MIKE
                        The fuck am I supposed to do with 
                        this thing?

           Mike pulls out a small colostomy bag attached to a catheter.

                                 GUS
                        You’re supposed fill that up with 
                        clean piss, strap it to your body 
                        and smuggle it into your interview 
                        today. 

           Mike laughs. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        You go in there and fail the drug 
                        test, technically I’d be 
                        responsible. I can’t have that on 
                        my conscience. 

           Mike thinks for a moment. 

                                 MIKE
                        Thanks. But where am I supposed to 
                        get the clean urine? Not from 
                        either of you two fucks that’s for 
                        sure.  

           Gus walks over to the fridge and pulls out a plastic 
           laboratory cup filled with amber liquid. 

                                 GUS
                        Happy birthday. 

                                 MIKE
                        Where the fuck did you get this?

           Frankie motions to the window. Outside Vinny is skating 
           around on his rollerblades, playing street hockey. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        We told him all the kids on his 
                        hockey team are required to take a 
                        piss test to make sure no one’s 
                        using performance enhancements. 

                                 GUS
                        And he bought it. Fuckin idiot. 
                                 MIKE
                        You guys are insane. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Happy 29, bro.

           Frankie gives Mike a hug. 

                                 GUS
                        There’s something else we want to 
                        talk to you about. (off Mike’s 
                        look) Frankie?

                                 FRANKIE
                        We’re hitting the road. 

                                 MIKE
                        What do you mean?

                                 FRANKIE
                        I just got off the phone with a 
                        booking agent. He heard some of my 
                        stuff --

                                 GUS
                        Our stuff. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        He’s gonna book us in a bunch of 
                        clubs all over the west coast. 

                                 MIKE
                        No shit?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yep. Then we’re gonna work our way 
                        east and end in New York. Just a 
                        little three month tour. Nothing 
                        too serious. See what happens from 
                        there. 

                                 MIKE 
                        Wow. I’m proud of you guys. 

                                                              FADE OUT:

           INT. / EXT. THE HOUSE - MONTH LATER

           Mike enters the house. It’s been completely cleared out 
           except for one cardboard box. He picks it up and surveys the 
           house he’s lived in for the past eight years. 
           He loads the box into a moving truck parked in the driveway. 
           Vinny’s in the back.

                                 MIKE
                        Last one. 

           Vinny uses all his weight to slide the box all the way to the 
           back, then hops out of the truck. 

           Next to the moving truck is a long, navy blue church van. 
           Frankie and Gus are packing it up with everything they’ll 
           need on tour.  

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Alright. That’s everything. 

           Gus tosses Frankie the keys. Frankie tosses them back.  

                                 FRANKIE
                        Fuck that. You’re driving. 

                                 GUS
                        No, I’m drinking. 

           Gus reaches into the van, grabs a can of Budweiser.

                                 GUS (CONT’D)
                        And if things go according to plan 
                        I’ll be blacked out by the time we 
                        get to Barstow. 

           He cracks the beer, foam spills down the side. He takes a 
           sip. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        So this is it. 

           The guys stand in a line, staring at the house, collectively 
           taking stock of the many memories shared. 

                                 MIKE
                        End of an era. 

           Frankie bends down and gives Vinny a hug. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’m gonna miss you, Vin. 

                                 VINNY
                        I love you Uncle Frankie.   

                                 FRANKIE
                        I love you too. 
           Gus gets a little choked up watching this. He bends down and 
           hugs Vinny. 

                                 GUS
                        See you in a couple months.

                                 VINNY
                        You’ll be back for playoffs right?

                                 GUS
                        We wouldn’t miss it. 

           Frankie and Gus hop in the van. 

                                 MIKE
                        Good luck, fellas. 

           Mike and Vinny wave, watching the van pull away. 

           They hop in the uHaul and drive to Mike’s new apartment. 

           QUICK SHOTS of Mike and Vinny setting up his new place. 

           INT. BELLAGIO HOTEL & CASINO - DAY

           Mike - in a suit and tie - finishes up a shift at his new 
           job.

           INT. MIKE’S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

           Mike pulls into Ali’s driveway, honks the horn. Ali walks 
           down the driveway, her stomach shows the first signs of 
           pregnancy.

           Vinny runs out of the house and hops in the car. Ali leans 
           into the window. 

                                 ALI
                        Nice suit. How’s work going?

                                 MIKE
                        Beats dealing blackjack. 

                                 ALI
                        You’re off on Tuesday and Wednesday 
                        next week, right? (Mike nods) Me 
                        and Brian have to go to Utah to 
                        visit his parents. Vinny can stay 
                        with you?

                                 MIKE
                        Of course. 
           They say their good-byes and Mike pulls out of the driveway. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        You hungry? 

           Vinny nods.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Me too. We gotta make a quick stop 
                        first though. 

           INT. MIKE’S CAR - LATER

           Vinny looks at Mike. 

                                 MIKE
                        You got this?

           Vinny nods and gets out of the car. He approaches the door of 
           an apartment and knocks. After a moment, Kate answers the 
           door. She smiles when she sees Vinny. 

                                 VINNY
                        Would you be interested in going on 
                        a date with my dad?

           Kate looks over Vinny’s shoulder and sees Mike, clean cut and 
           in a suit, leaning on the hood of his car. 

           Mike pulls out his Juul and takes a puff. 

           THE END
