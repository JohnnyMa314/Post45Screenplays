           The Black List was compiled from the suggestions of over 250 film executives, each of whom contributed 
           the names of up to ten favorite scripts that were written in, or are somehow uniquely associated with, 2019 
           and will not have begun principal photography during this calendar year.

           This year, scripts had to receive at least six mentions to be included on the Black List.

           All reasonable effort has been made to confirm the information contained herein.

           The Black List apologizes for all misspellings, misattributions, incorrect representation identification, and 
           questionable 2019 affiliations.

           It has been said many times, but it’s worth repeating:

           The Black List is not a “best of” list. It is, at best, a “most liked” list.

                                                             Ken Kobayashi

           Teddy thinks he’s the only living person left in a world where humanity is frozen in time... until his ex-girlfriend,

           in the process, confront the issues that plagued their relationship before it’s too late.
