                                    Among whom we all once lived in the passions of 
                                    our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body 
                                      and the mind, and were by nature children of 
                                                 wrath, like the rest of mankind

           CREDITS

           MUSIC UP: FREDERIC CHOPIN - NOCTURNE IN E-FLAT MAJOR OP. 9 
           No. 2 (No sound under music - images float with dreamlike weight)

           POROUS TEXTURE. LIGHT BEIGE. TAUT.

           HANDS IN BLUE LATEX GLOVES swipe over it in a blur - leaving 
           behind a layer of rich, dark paste.

           POROUS TEXTURE. LIGHT BEIGE. MORE CONTOURED.

           Hands apply paste again - it smooths and blends to find its 
           balance and unique color like paint mixing on a palette.

           POROUS TEXTURE. LIGHT BEIGE. SINEWY.

           It is clear now. This is skin. These are MUSCLES. 

           Hands applying BRONZER. Evenly painting the canvas - ensuring 
           nothing is left of its natural pale complexion.

           PULL BACK ON TRAPEZIUS - broad back of a man. Expands and 
           contracts with sharp breaths. Hands work with purpose and 
           attention. Not a massage. This is sport. War paint.

           A TRAINER removes gloves. Steps back. Admires. Masterpiece.

           Head to toe: BODYBUILDER. SPEEDO CLAD BRONZE BEHEMOTH. 

           Crammed inside... 

           INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sweaty. Drab. Mirrors line the room. Bodybuilders drift in 
           and out. Pose. Get in a last minute pump. Trainers fan them 
           with towels. One bodybuilder smooths out a final layer of 
           bronzer with a small paint roller. Another applies oil. A 
           room brimming with TESTOSTERONE. NARCISSISM. 

           A STAGEHAND leans in the doorway - gives the go sign. 
           Bodybuilders shake out their muscles. Stride into...

           INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Bodybuilders walk in lockstep. A factory line of All American 
           Muscle. The narrow hall making the men appear even larger.

           FLUORESCENT LIGHTS above scan muscles like a copy machine. 
           Illuminating each before they dip back into the shadows.
           INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Packed house. Raucous. Fans on their feet. Envying. Cheering. 
           Banner above the stage: “MR. VENICE BEACH 1985”

           PHOTOGRAPHERS climb over each other - camera flashes strobe. 
           JUDGES take note of the marble sculptures strutting out. 
           ROWDY TEENS hang from a light fixture. Human zoo enclosure. 

           The bodybuilders line up - strike poses. Each stretch and 
           condense new muscles - exposing hidden striations.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - ENTRANCE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           The tunnel doorway swings open - light spills into the hall. 
           Dust motes float hypnotically around a messy head of hair. A 
           silhouetted man steps in close enough to start sizing him up.

           CALEB COLE. 28. Five ten. Hundred sixty pounds. Handsome with 
           hibernating inner demons. Short life of hard days stripping 
           the treads of youth. Wiry physique. Hair an untamed mullet. 
           Fading shiner under one of his hungry eyes. Unblinking. 
           Paranoid. Intense. He wears all denim. Very worn. Not a 
           fashion statement. Neglect. Duffle bag in hand. Rucksack on 
           shoulder. Just off a bus or just homeless. Hard to tell.

           Caleb hands a ticket stub to the TICKET RIPPER. Never takes 
           his eyes off the end of the tunnel - primal energy in the 
           auditorium. He glides down the tunnel - a man possessed. 
           Finally, he can see it. Stage. Lights. Muscle. Glory.

           CALEB’S EYES full of worship. Loneliness. A self-aware, caged 
           animal ready to break free. Alchemy for a blunt reaction.

           TITLE: APEX

           The final note of Chopin’s Nocturne pings gently on the 
           piano. Then, like an extra note attacking...

                                                             SMASH CUT:

           ROARING WAVE crashes on wet sand. Frothing on impact.

           END CREDITS

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - MORNING

           ANGLE. Back of Caleb’s head. Motionless. Asleep on a nasty 
           blanket covered with sand. Items from his rucksack out and 
           scattered. Food wrappers. Muscle magazines. A seagull squawks 
           as it picks around the blanket. A shadow casts over Caleb.
           A sneaker presses into Caleb’s shoulder. Caleb stirs. He 
           rolls over. Eyelids dry and crusted. Rubs them. Looks up. 

           Sun glares over an LAPD BIKE COP. Beach patrol. Fitted navy 
           blue shorts. Nike sneakers. High white socks. Smug attitude.

                                 LAPD BIKE COP #1
                        Get up. Come on, let’s go!

                                 CALEB
                        Uh-huh... give me a second.

           Caleb sits up. Leaning on one arm. Fuzzy.

                                 LAPD BIKE COP #1
                        Check out this spread. You out here 
                        all night? Must have been.

                                 CALEB
                        No, sir. Uh, no, I--

                                 LAPD BIKE COP #1
                        You can’t sleep on the beach. 
                        Venice Beach Park regulations.

                                 CALEB
                        I wasn’t. I was laying out.

                                 LAPD BIKE COP #1
                             (scoffs)
                        Laying out?

                                 CALEB
                             (stubbornly)
                        Yes, sir. I was getting some sun. 
                        Is getting sun a crime, officer?

           The cop kicks and prods at Caleb’s items on the blanket.

                                 LAPD BIKE COP #1
                        Not gonna prick my foot, am I?

           Caleb adjusts his posture. Insulted. Keeping cool.

                                 CALEB
                        You... think I’m a junkie? You 
                        think I’m a bum? I’m not a bum.

           Nothing shakes loose. The officer backs off.

                                 LAPD BIKE COP #1
                        Find a fucking box. Pieces of shit 
                        always ruining the view.
                                 CALEB
                        I’m not a bum!

           He mounts his bicycle. Pedals away. Caleb lowers his mask. A 
           visible disdain. A cold stare. Then, at a safe distance...

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                             (sotto)
                        ... sand pig.

           Caleb stands to reveal the VENICE BOARDWALK. Already decent 
           foot traffic. Caleb stretches his back, watches people go by.

           SUPER: VENICE BEACH, CALIFORNIA. 1985.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - MOMENTS LATER

           *STREET ARTISTS arrange items for sale on folding tables.

           *BREAK DANCERS lay out flattened boxes to set their stage.

           *ROLLER SKATERS weave around like a traveling party.

           *SUNGLASS WEARING PIT BULL waddles by with his owner.

           A constantly evolving circus - can drive a certain mind mad.

           Caleb walks through the crowd. His gait far less free in 
           comparison. Same clothes as last night. Except now a pair of 
           cheap gas station sunglasses shield his eyes. Looking like an 
           alien trying to fit in. Hard to do along this strip.

           He carries a muscle magazine, rolled to a specific page. 
           Guiding him. TWO PUNKS walk through Caleb. Shoulder him. He 
           stumbles. Drops his magazine. Caleb controls his balance. 
           Then his temper. Picks up the magazine and turns onto...

           EXT. VENICE BOULEVARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Ocean views quickly turn to concrete walls. Smell of sea salt 
           tainted by exhaust pipe fumes. Caleb slows as he approaches 
           an inconspicuous building. A sign in rusty bold typeface 
           hangs above tinted glass doors:

                                     FLEXION FITNESS

           Caleb unrolls the magazine to look at the creased page. An 
           article features this exact building. That sign. An image he 
           has looked at countless times now becoming real. Caleb lowers 
           his sunglasses. He has arrived. He is about to step toward 
           the door when he hears a woman SCREAM. 
           Caleb rears his head. Cars wipe by. More screams. Less 
           frightened this time. Not frightened at all actually... 

           EXT. GRASS LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Across the street. A woman screams and laughs as an enormous 
           bodybuilder lifts and twirls her mid-air. He wears a fat gold 
           chain that compliments his gold muscles and yellow speedo. 
           Pure confidence. He is Ukrainian NAZAR KOZEL. 20. 

           He commands our attention. He’ll get more of it later. 
           Bodybuilders and bikini models lay out on the grass. Grazing 
           land between workouts. Caleb absorbs how they socialize.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb enters. A cowboy in a new saloon. Gets a good look. A 
           few bodybuilders shoot a glance but really no one gives a 
           shit. Everyone busy pumping and checking themselves out. 

           Shafts of natural light blast in from high windows. Chalk, 
           dust and sweat swirl in the air. Flecking off bodies. Modest 
           space. Relic of the sixties bodybuilding era. For devoted 
           lifters. Caleb notes the images of legendary bodybuilders 
           hanging on the wall before he heads to the front desk.

           DONNA. 30. Receptionist. Strong presence. Big hair. Bigger 
           muscles. Headphones on. Casette player out. Reads a 
           physiology book. Never looks up. Never impressed.

                                 CALEB
                        Excuse me, I’d like to lift.

                                 DONNA
                             (taps headphones)
                        Speak up.

                                 CALEB
                             (firmly)
                        I’d like to lift. Workout.

                                 DONNA
                        Ten to join. Five for the first 
                        month. Cash for iron.

                                 CALEB
                        I, uh, don’t have much money at the 
                        moment. I will soon. Can I start 
                        lifting and pay later?

                                 DONNA
                        Muscle ain’t free.
           Ugly pause. Caleb stares at Donna. Thinking. 

                                 CALEB
                        If... uh, if you work at the gym do 
                        you get to lift, no fees?

                                 DONNA
                        You do, yeah.

                                 CALEB
                        I’d like to apply for a job.

                                 DONNA
                        No openings.

                                 CALEB
                        Are you in charge of hiring?

           Donna finally raises her eyes to see this buzzing pest.

                                 DONNA
                        Incline bench. Tell him I told you.

           Caleb walks through the labyrinth of workout equipment. He 
           finds a man mid-set on incline: BARRY YATES. 62. 

           Sturdy. Hardened. Skin like rhino hide from a lifetime of 
           California sun and a stubborn opposition to sunscreen.

                                 BARRY
                             (motivational exhaling)
                        Up. Again. Up. You. Mother. Fuck.

           Barry racks the bar and sits forward to see the much less 
           muscular Caleb blocking the mirror. Caleb recognizes him.

                                 CALEB
                        You’re Barry ‘Iron Gate’ Yates.

                                 BARRY
                        Move.

           Caleb steps aside. Barry checks his pecs in the mirror 
           between sets. Caleb eyes the gear in the gym. Impressed.

                                 CALEB
                        You built most this gear, right?

                                 BARRY
                        This is my gym.

                                 CALEB
                        My name is Caleb Cole, sir. It is 
                        great to meet you. Really.
           Caleb extends his hand. Barry looks down. Nope. Busy. He lays 
           back on the bench and starts another set.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        I want to lift here but I can’t 
                        afford a membership.

                                 BARRY
                        Tough break. Used to cut slack for 
                        new guys but between rising rent 
                        and these mega gyms cropping up 
                        you’re fuck outta luck, bud.

                                 CALEB
                        I’m interested in a job at the gym.

                                 BARRY
                        Good for you. Donna, at the desk, 
                        she tell you--
                             (to Donna; shouting)
                        Yo, Donna! Did you--

                                 CALEB
                             (quickly)
                        She did. No openings. Yes. But you 
                        don’t need to pay me. I’ll work to 
                        lift. Free labor. Great for you. 
                        Great for the gym. I can make ends 
                        meet other ways but this is the 
                        only place I’ll train.

                                 BARRY
                        Why?

                                 CALEB
                        I read Flexion Fitness in Venice 
                        Beach, California is where beasts 
                        are built. I want that. I want to 
                        build myself into something else.

           Barry laughs. Racks the bar. Sits up.

                                 BARRY
                        You want to be a bodybuilder? 

                                 CALEB
                        Yes, sir. I think I’m meant to be.

                                 BARRY
                        Meant to? The fuck does that even-- 
                        You’re small. You know that, right?

                                 CALEB
                        I’m lean. I have a good frame.

                        Anyone-- Almost anyone can join 
                        Flexion but I build the beasts. I 
                        built the gear. I build the beasts 
                        and I don’t train every fool who 
                        walks through the front door and 
                        asks nice. I decide. Iron Gate.

                                 CALEB
                        I’ll do whatever it takes, sir. 
                        I’ve been reading every muscle 
                        magazine I can get my hands on. 
                        Studying poses. All the greats. 
                        Reg. Arnold. Zane. Luca.

                                 BARRY
                        Who’s your guy? Your favorite?

                                 CALEB
                        Luca Leone. No question.

           Caleb holds up the old beaten muscle magazine he has and 
           turns to an image of LUCA LEONE - perfect, classic body.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Love all his movies too.
                             (desperately)
                        I don’t do well doing nothing and 
                        right now that’s all I’ve got so 
                        I’ll do anything for this.

           Barry admires the passion. Stands. Sizes Caleb. Analyzing.

                                 BARRY
                        You trouble, Caleb?

                                 CALEB
                        No, sir.

                                 BARRY
                        You been in any trouble?

                                 CALEB
                        Not real trouble, sir.

                                 BARRY
                        You say sir a whole goddamn lot. 
                        Army brat? Serve or something?

                                 CALEB
                        Oh, I wish. Tried to join up but 
                        got turned away. I have nystagmus.
                                 BARRY
                        Sounds contagious. What do ya have 
                        to fuck to get that?

           Caleb forces a smile. A polite response.

                                 CALEB
                        Neurological. Means my eyes shake 
                        when I look left and right and up 
                        and down. Had it my whole life. 
                        Don’t really notice it except, of 
                        course, when I close one eye to 
                        look through a rifle sight.

                                 BARRY
                        Last job?

                                 CALEB
                        Feedlot in Nebraska.

                                 BARRY
                        That where you from?

                                 CALEB
                        No. I, uh, just spent some time 
                        there but people always think I 
                        sound like I’m from the Midwest.

           Caleb proud of this weird fact. Unable to be pinned down.

                                 BARRY
                        Feedlot, you said?

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah, you know, for livestock. Make 
                        sure all them gets fed. Stays put. 
                        Cattle. Pigs. Sheep. Also cleaned. 
                        Took care of repairs. I’ll get my 
                        hands dirty. No problem.

           Barry locks eyes with Caleb. Caleb doesn’t look away. Barry 
           scratches the scruff on his chin. Considering.

                                 BARRY
                        You’re small.

                                 CALEB
                        Well... isn’t that the point, sir? 
                        To get big?

           Barry smirks. He recognizes that fire burning in Caleb.
                                 BARRY
                        Come back tomorrow morning and make 
                        sure you fucking smell better. Just 
                        cause you worked with animals don’t 
                        mean you get to stink like one. At 
                        least not until after you train.

           Barry walks away. Bad hip. Bad knees. Still has swagger. 
           Caleb brings his shirt toward his nose to take a whiff.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - PULL UP BARS - LATER

           Caleb and other men do pull ups on a long metal bar on the 
           beach. Sun bounces off it. The metal even sweats. Men bob up 
           and down on both sides at varying speeds like firing pistons. 

           Caleb struggles. Arms give out. Falls to the sand. Spent.

           He plops down next to his rucksack. Pulls out a pack of 
           smokes and a fifth of whiskey. Removes a single cigarette. 
           Takes a goodbye sip of whiskey and pours the rest out on the 
           other cigarettes. Booze pools and curdles in the hot sand. He 
           enjoys one last drag of the only cigarette left before he 
           puts it out in the sand. Caleb gets up and back on the bar.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - MOMENTS LATER

           ENERGY HEALERS in white jumpsuits hold their palms out on 
           tourists’ foreheads. Their eyes closed. At ease. Healing.

           Caleb watches. Trying not to sneer. Not buying it. One of the 
           healers offers him a seat to experience it rather than judge 
           it. Caleb, amused, sits and lets the healer try to work her 
           magic. Caleb closes his eyes. His expression slowly drops. 
           Long tense beat. Caleb disappears into himself. 

           The healer is bullshit but the situation having an effect. 
           Caleb smirks again. Pulls his head back and opens his eyes. 
           In need of healing but not prepared to accept any.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb steps up to a hot dog stand. He counts change. Signals 
           for one hot dog. Caleb’s attention shifts while he waits.

           MUSIC UP: RUN DMC - DARRYL AND JOE (KRUSH-GROOVE 3)

           Skaters whirl in circles - roller dancing to music blasting 
           from their BOOMBOX. They go by faster and faster and like 
           viewing an image in a zoetrope, Caleb notices something 
           through the flickering, dancing bodies...
           A JUNKIE hunched over under a palm tree. His skin blistered. 
           He shoots up. Overdoses. The music bumping. Louder. His body 
           curls into itself. Louder. Twitching. Drooling. Louder.

           Caleb disgusted. No one looking but him. The hot dog vendor 
           hands him his hot dog. Caleb snaps out of it and leaves.

           EXT. MUSCLE BEACH - WEIGHT PEN - DUSK

           Caleb scarfs down his hot dog. He approaches a crowd watching 
           bodybuilders clang and bang just off the beach in the famous 
           lifting destination. The pen enclosed by a chain link fence. 

           Caleb stalks along the fence like a tiger in tall grass. He 
           finds a vantage point on the far side. Alone. Caleb stares at 
           the bodybuilders - how the crowd reacts. All of it reflecting 
           in the soulless black lenses of his sunglasses. The beach a 
           hallucinatory orange from the setting fireball sun as we...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                                         HOLD IN BLACK.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - MORNING

           *HAND PUSHING DOWN A METAL HANDLE. 

           *WATER SPUTTERING FROM A SHOWER HEAD.

           Caleb in white briefs, showers in public. Stragglers pass, 
           garbage men empty trash. Boardwalk waking with the sun.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - LATER

           Caleb wipes down machines and watches bodybuilders lift. He 
           focuses on their grips - spacing and position of hands as 
           they wrap the bar. Breathing rhythms as they push through a 
           difficult rep. More technical and delicate than brutish. 

           A bodybuilder scribbles in a NOTEBOOK. He tosses it down near 
           Caleb. A training log: exercises, weights, reps, sets, diet. 
           Even motivational phrases. Caleb processing it all until...

           BANG! Weights crash to the ground. Caleb whips to find one 
           massive man stumbling as another approaches fast. Foreheads 
           press together like elk locking horns. Muscles flare. They 
           grunt insults. Fellow bodybuilders step in and pry them 
           apart, including the lifter with the training log.
           Caleb uses the diversion to snatch the notebook. He quickly 
           tucks it into his waistband and pulls his shirt over it. His 
           notebook now. Not done studying its contents. 

           Barry strolls up behind Caleb. Ignores the scuffle.

                                 BARRY
                        Runt. Follow me.

           Caleb recalibrates. Tosses the rag in a bucket and hustles 
           after Barry as he weaves through machines toward the back.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        I’m not gonna tell you when to work 
                        and when to workout. Long as you 
                        keep up with wiping down machines, 
                        mopping floors and making sure the 
                        showers and sauna don’t get swampy 
                        then your schedule is your own.

                                 CALEB
                        Got it.

                                 BARRY
                        Grand. Because if I don’t see you 
                        lifting weights or cleaning ‘em 
                        I’ll assume you don’t give a shit 
                        and I’ll head over to Home Depot 
                        like I usually do and throw a no 
                        fuss Mexican fella a few bucks. 
                        Don’t ask Donna to help you out 
                        with those chores either.

           Donna at her post. Barry blows a kiss. Donna flips him off.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Anything this side of that desk and 
                        Donna won’t do it. Donna don’t do 
                        shit. Not unless Donna is supposed 
                        to. She’s earned it. She keeps this 
                        place running. The only time she 
                        comes out from back there is when 
                        someone crosses the line.

                                 CALEB
                        What’s the line?

                                 BARRY
                        Well, we’re a bodybuilder gym, not 
                        Bel-Air Country Club so it takes a 
                        special kind of asshole and--

                                 DONNA
                        I decide when they’re special!
           Barry and Caleb turn into...

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

                                 BARRY
                        Too many guys for me to train ya 
                        right out the gate. So don’t bug 
                        me, alright? Prove you deserve the 
                        attention, you’ll fucking get it. 
                        Don’t and you fucking won’t.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Barry flicks on a light to reveal a back room full of old 
           weight lifting gear and supplies. A mess of stuff that has 
           been accumulating over the years.

                                 BARRY
                        Last but not least. This shit pile. 
                        Building your body takes time. So 
                        will cleaning out this disaster. 
                        Start chipping away at both.

           Barry claps Caleb on the shoulder and lumbers away. Caleb 
           makes sure Barry is gone. He goes to the hatch window in the 
           back of the room. Climbs up. Pushes it open. Sticks his head 
           out to see where it leads. Grabs a loose bolt from the ledge 
           and places it between the window and the latch to keep it 
           slightly propped open. He hops back down.

           Caleb goes to move a broken piece of gear and more iron 
           shrapnel falls around him. This fucking blows.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - LATER

           SLOW MOTION - TRACKING ALONG 

           Dumbbell rack - a long strip of iron. Heavy end with massive 
           weights over a hundred pounds each. Bodybuilders grab weights 
           - curl, row, shoulder press in the mirror. Dumbbell weights 
           rack and drop repeatedly. Men grunt.

           CLICK-CLANK. CLICK-CLANK. ARRRRGH. CLICK-CLANK. CLICK-CLANK.

           As weight sizes diminish, so do the men. Smaller weights. 
           Smaller muscles. Caleb at the light end performing seated 
           dumbbell curls. Beginning of the musclehead evolutionary 
           chart. He stares in the mirror with determination and 
           frustration as he lifts over and over and over.

           CLICK-CLANK. CLICK-CLANK. CLICK...
           EXT. FLEXION FITNESS/GRASS LOT - NIGHT

           CLANK. Barry locks up and leaves for the night. Caleb watches 
           Barry go from across the street. Out of view.

           EXT. FLEXION FITNESS - ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb walks down a back alley - he gets to the dumpsters and 
           finds a small window - the hatch window for the storage room. 
           He pulls over a crate to stand on and props open the window.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb lowers himself into the room and closes the window 
           slowly to avoid making any loud sounds - just in case.

           The glow of street lights throw enough for him to see. Caleb 
           pulls an old gym mat under the window - lays a blanket over 
           it. Sleeping quarters. Caleb finds a bin - lost and found 
           items. Shorts. T-shirts. Hand wraps. Useful gear. Claimed.

           Caleb sits in his new sleeping area. He takes out the 
           notebook he stole earlier. Flips through it. Fascinated. 
           Pages full of gym rat details. Some function more as journal 
           entries - recording mental state before and after workouts. 

           Caleb turns to a clean page. No one else to talk to. Writes.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        Day 1. I will keep a training log. 
                        A journal. Hold myself accountable 
                        for once. Mind and body.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - LATER

           Caleb walks through the now empty, closed gym. The moonlight 
           spills in - the space a light blue haze.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        I have always felt stuck out of 
                        place. Defined as little as my 
                        muscles are now.

           Caleb slowly slides his hands along the machines. Getting 
           familiar with them. Taming them.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        Lifting weights and welcoming pain 
                        so in return I can grow makes sense 
                        to me. More than anything else has.
           Caleb poses in the mirror. He strikes various bodybuilder 
           poses. Side chest. Biceps. He raises his shirt. Flexes.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        An honest exchange.

           Caleb’s eyes well up. An almost religious moment for him. He 
           stares at himself with critical appraisal of what he must do 
           to become more than his reflection.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - NIGHT

           GOD’S EYE VIEW high above the sleeping beach community. 
           Deliberate flight. Ominous. Rows of apartments and bungalows 
           like veins leading to the boardwalk. Boardwalk connecting to 
           the sand. Sand into the dark ocean. During flight...

                                 CALEB (V.O.)

           Lingering over the ocean from above. Black. Silent. Lonely.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - STORAGE ROOM - LATER

           Still dark. Caleb half asleep. Balled up T-shirt under his 
           head as a pillow. A light in the hall flicks on. Caleb turns 
           when he hears footsteps. A shadow passes the opaque glass 
           slat on the door - deep voice sings out of key: Barry.

           Caleb checks the clock on the wall: 4am. Barry opens early. 
           Caleb hides his belongings. Undoes the sleeping quarters. 
           Throws on sneakers and stealthily climbs out the window.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb jogs the streets. Each streetlight and neon sign in a 
           storefront window gives a brief reprieve from the consuming 
           darkness. He passes a nocturnal lunatic ranting at ghosts...
                                 LUNATIC
                        The ground shakes angry like a 
                        rattlesnake! We have been warned!

           Caleb dodges drunks as they stumble aimlessly...

                                 DRUNK
                        M-- My man! You got change, my man?

           A prostitute fishes for headlights floating down the street 
           with no luck. She tosses Caleb a line...

                                 PROSTITUTE
                        Slow down, honey...

           Caleb jogs past - eyes forward.

                                 PROSTITUTE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, really!? Cocksucker!

           Caleb turns onto the boardwalk. Shadows in dark corners dig 
           into overflowing trash cans. Lost souls. The daytime oasis a 
           bleak purgatory at night. Caleb’s feet churn faster. 

           He sprints on the sand. Caleb stares emotionless into the 
           middle distance. His body working separate from his mind.

           Caleb slows to a stop - resting up against a palm tree. His 
           breathing heavy but he won’t let himself pant like a dog. He 
           stands upright and wrestles his lungs into submission.

           He looks at the row of BEACH HOUSES lining a portion of the 
           boardwalk like tropical snow globes.

           All are quiet until his eyes dart - a light turns on in the 
           second story of the house at the end. Bodies stumble toward 
           the window. Undressing in plain sight. They strip off their 
           clothes and press against the glass as they fuck - not 
           concerned with the outside world. Caleb watches.

           The woman faces the window - staring at the ocean. Her eyes 
           lower and meet Caleb’s. Not clear if she sees him. Caleb does 
           not look away. Unflinching. The most intimate moment he has 
           shared with someone and he is not directly involved. His eyes 
           drift to the man. He too staring at Caleb. Or through him.

           Caleb steps out from the palm tree to make himself more 
           visible. They don’t look away. He takes another step and 
           stands hauntingly in plain sight. He wants to be seen. They 
           still don’t look away. They might not care he is there or 
           simply can’t see him in the dark. Caleb tilts his head 
           curiously. Either way, he is invisible to them.

           PRE-LAP. STATIC. DIAL TONE. DIALING. RINGING...
           EXT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - PHONE BOOTH - LATER

           Caleb secure inside the metal and glass phone booth on a side 
           street off the boardwalk. Ocean waves crash in the distance. 

           RINGING-- CLICK.

                                 SEX HOTLINE OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Hey, stud. Having trouble sleeping?

                                 CALEB
                        I don’t want to talk... if you 
                        could just... say everything...

                                 SEX HOTLINE OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Whatever you want...

           She begins talking. Moaning. Crackling sensual breaths. Caleb 
           listens. Nothing else. Not allowing himself that pleasure. 

           Caleb sees himself in the reflection of the metal housing of 
           the phone. Deformed from the imperfections of the metal and 
           the seedy glow of the flickering street lamp above.

           Caleb removes the phone from his ear as the breathing gets 
           more intense. Ashamed. Suddenly, he hits himself over the 
           head with the phone receiver. 

           THWACK. CRACK. CRACK. Lesson learned. Caleb hangs up.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - DAY

           Caleb bench presses - eyes looking up at a faint WATER STAIN 
           in the ceiling near the fluorescent lights like a target. He 
           strains and fights but it seems euphoric for him. Improving.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        The gym opens early. Earlier than I 
                        realized. Can’t risk Barry finding 
                        me. I will get up beforehand and 
                        run. It is only temporary.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Caleb does back rows - he’s in a rhythm. Dripping sweat.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        I have trouble sleeping anyway. 
                        Never good sleep. Not without help.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Caleb lays on a mat doing leg raises - face clenched.
                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        Workouts will be twice daily. 
                        Necessary for me to catch up.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Caleb mops. Head down. Eyes up. Watches lifter do a superset.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        Time spent cleaning the gym is a 
                        chance for me to observe...

                                                                CUT TO:

           Caleb now performs the exact workout he was just studying.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        Adopt...

                                                                CUT TO:

           *CALEB’S HANDS grip iron - knuckles turn white. 

           *CALEB’S JAWLINE beneath ear - subtly throbbing.

           *CALEB’S PUPILS dilating - adrenaline release.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - LOCKER ROOM - LATER

           Caleb ties off a garbage bag in the corner. JUICEHEADS enter 
           on the other side of the locker room. Caleb can see them 
           around the lockers but they don’t realize he’s there.

                                 JUICEHEAD #1
                        Cycling?

                                 JUICEHEAD #2
                        Shot four hundred mill of deca last 
                        week. Feelin’ mighty. Got any dbol, 
                        though? I’d pop a couple of those.

           Juicehead #1 reaches into his locker. Grabs a pill container 
           and tosses it to his friend. He opens it and shakes out a few 
           pink, pentagonal pills. Downs them dry. Juicehead #1 grabs a 
           small vile and a syringe. Preps it.

                                 JUICEHEAD #1
                        Help me out, brother - hate doing 
                        this shit myself.

           Juicehead #2 takes the syringe. Juicehead #1 pulls down his 
           shorts, exposing his ass cheek. Casual.
                                 JUICEHEAD #2
                        Big cat afraid of a tiny mouse.

                                 JUICEHEAD #1
                        Shut up and shoot.

           Juicehead #2 struggles to pierce the skin - pushing the 
           needle into solid muscle with no success.

                                 JUICEHEAD #2
                        Jesus, your ass is a rock. Needle’s 
                        gonna snap in half.

           Needle bends and gives. Wince inducing. It finally pierces 
           the skin and injects the liquid. Juicehead #2 removes the 
           needle and tosses it back into the locker.

                                 JUICEHEAD #1
                        Let’s get it!

           The two men exit - medicated and excited for their workout.

           Caleb walks over to the bench where the juicehead’s locker is 
           and reaches down to collect the empty vile he left behind. He 
           holds it up to the light - the liquid trails on the side of 
           the container and collects at the bottom. Caleb looks 
           revolted by it before tossing it in the trash bag.

           EXT. MALIBU - CONSTRUCTION SITE - MORNING

           A beach house being gutted and rebuilt. Workers buzz around 
           the property removing trash. Loading in supplies.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        The rich love spending money near 
                        the ocean. New houses go up fast as 
                        old ones get torn down. Not hard to 
                        get work on short notice.

           Caleb in demolition mode. He takes a sledge hammer to a 
           rotting wall. He wails on it. Hard. Again. Harder. Again.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        The heat is relentless but I get a 
                        nice natural tan. The job a decent 
                        workout. Helps callus weak thoughts 
                        that creep in away from the gym.

           MIGRANT WORKERS eat bagged lunches. Caleb sits near them but 
           not with them. Eating alone.
                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        The workers are illegals. Don’t 
                        speak English. Don’t matter. They 
                        work hard for what they get. For 
                        simple... real things.

           YUPPIE DOUCHEBAG and TROPHY WIFE stumble through the property 
           in their ill-advised, Rodeo Drive bought clothing. He shows 
           off the lot - explaining the views. The migrant workers laugh 
           and ridicule them in Spanish.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        They see the muck. The sick vanity. 
                        We all just want to get paid. Take 
                        some of their money.

           CONTRACTOR counts off bills - pays workers. Caleb last, 
           collects his cut. Counts it back distrustfully.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - DAY

           Caleb sits in the hot sand in his small gym shorts. His body 
           slumped over his knees. His posture petulant - he lets sand 
           trickle through his hands. People swing and flip on the beach 
           gymnastic rings. A crowd sunbathes. Two women in bikinis walk 
           by. Caleb smiles meekly. They giggle. Ignore. Keep moving.

                                 CALEB (V.O)
                        When the sun is out this place is 
                        like a postcard. Everything shines 
                        at the edges. Vibrates in the heat.

           Caleb walks into the dense layer of sunbathing families, 
           girls, couples, umbrellas, coolers and beach balls.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        Only the artificially thirsty can 
                        keep seeing this mirage as fact.

           Caleb high steps into the break. Dives under a wave.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb wades in the ocean - head half above water.

           CALEB’S POV - people relax on the beach. Blissfully ignorant.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        I have a pure goal. I do not want 
                        to taint it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CALEB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It would be easy to fall prey to 
                        the tight, smooth skin that wraps 
                        around and disguises the ugliness 
                        here. It is convincing.

           A wave rolls up behind Caleb. Deep breath. Submerges.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - DAY

           Caleb’s head rises into frame like he has emerged from the 
           wave. He exhales. Raising dumbbells onto each thigh. He jolts 
           his legs and pulls each weight up. He stabilizes and starts 
           getting in some serious military press reps. Caleb goes to 
           failure. Drops weights. Good set.

           CHAUNCEY ATLAS. 38. A bodybuilder with muscle development 
           that tells the story of his experience. He loads weights on 
           the flat chest press bar. Not a young gun but still in it. 
           About to lift enough to make you cry.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Rotate ‘em inward toward your chest 
                        on the way down.

           Caleb nods - reluctant to listen or interact. He hoists the 
           weights up and on the way down turns them inward. Unsure.

                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT’D)
                        Start turning gradually on the way 
                        down until your wrists invert right 
                        at the end. Squeeze. There you go.

           Caleb gets the motion down - performs a few reps and his 
           shoulders quit on him. Difficult.

                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT’D)
                        Gives the chest something to do. 
                        Mixes it up. Let me get a spot.

           Chauncey mounts the bench and lays back. Caleb gets behind 
           the bar at the ready. He raises his hands to the bar.

                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT’D)
                        All set going up. You’ll know.

           Chauncey inhales big. Exhales hard. He shoots the bar off the 
           rack. In a smooth rhythm he does eight reps. On nine the bar 
           gets a little unsteady. He stalls and Caleb helps lift the 
           bar. Chauncey finishes the final rep successfully. Racks.

           Chauncey reaches his hand up for a fist bump. Caleb 
           reciprocates awkwardly. He keeps to himself too much.
                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT’D)
                        Chauncey.

                                 CALEB
                        Caleb.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        New?

           Defensive pause. Caleb processing.

                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT’D)
                        Best part is right where you are. 

                                 CALEB
                        How so?

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Gaining beats the hell out of 
                        maintaining. What you got left?

                                 CALEB
                        Two sets on press. Abs. Not much.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Find me when you’re done. Lunch on 
                        me. I’ll tell you the mistakes I 
                        made coming up so you can avoid the 
                        same empty reps and I can redeem 
                        some of my wasted sweat.

           Chauncey walks off. Caleb does his new shoulder workout.

           EXT. RAE’S RESTAURANT - LATER

           1950s diner with 1980s cars out front. The bold aqua-marine 
           paint vibrant. The neon sign off but still shines. Chauncey 
           and Caleb pull up in Chauncey’s WHITE PONTIAC FIERO.

           INT. RAE’S RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           LINE COOKS flip steaks and crack eggs. A WAITRESS walks down 
           the row of booths toward Caleb and Chauncey with food.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Gyms. Training methods. Nutrition. 
                        Drugs. Musculature. Nothing’s like 
                        it was even a year ago. Not since 
                        American muscle became such an 
                        enterprise. Inject it with greed 
                        and it’ll transform quick. Size is 
                        king. More is more is more.
           Chauncey polishes off his first steak in time to swap it out 
           for a second. Another steak at the table for Caleb as well.

                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT’D)
                        What do you do other than weights? 
                        What else to shock the muscles?

                                 CALEB
                        I run at night. On the beach.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Good. Lengthens your calves. What 
                        about muscle control? Posing?

                                 CALEB
                        I... I guess I practice posing--

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        No. Finish a set. Hit a pose. All 
                        day. Visualize your goal. Mold each 
                        muscle precisely. Competitions can 
                        be close. Every pose, every micro-
                        adjustment is crucial. Ah, here. 
                        Wish I’d done this early on...

           Chauncey grabs a napkin - leans across to the other booth and 
           takes the pen off a paid check. He scribbles on the napkin. 
           Slides it to Caleb. An address.

                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT’D)
                        Ballet studio. Beginner classes. 
                        Cheap. No sign up. Just show up.

                                 CALEB
                        I’m not a little girl or like, 
                        uh... a fag--

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Don’t be stupid. Former Mr. Olympia 
                        winners took ballet. Trust me. Your 
                        body is all fucking dried out for 
                        competition. You’re flexing for 
                        minutes on end. You want to be a 
                        champ or chump that can’t hold a 
                        pose? Gut hanging. Back all soft.

           Caleb still working on his first portion. He tepidly looks at 
           the second plate. Chauncey is quick to pick up on that.

                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT’D)
                        You’re falling behind...

                                 CALEB
                        Oh, I’m pretty full.
                                 CHAUNCEY
                        What do you weigh? One fifty five?

                                 CALEB
                             (quickly correcting)
                        One sixty.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Fine. One sixty. You need to take 
                        down twice that number in grams of 
                        protein each day to bulk. Plan on 
                        giving yourself a boost?

           Chauncey stabs his steak with his fork and presses the top 
           like an injection needle.

                                 CALEB
                        Can’t cheat.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        No rule against. A lot of guys do. 
                        Not saying you should. It’s a tool. 
                        If you can control it and use in 
                        moderation. Helps ratchet up the 
                        muscle and give people a show. 
                        After all, that’s what everyone 
                        wants. Shock and awe. A body so 
                        ripped first thing they think is 
                        wow not how.
                             (beat; reinforcing)
                        Been to a magic show? If a magician 
                        literally sawed someone in half, 
                        crowd would still cheer first 
                        before they knew to scream.

                                 CALEB
                        Can’t cheat. I need to know.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        What do you mean?

                                 CALEB
                        I need to know what I’m capable of. 
                        That I earn it.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Well, eat up, eat often and eat 
                        clean then. Fuck your appetite.

           Chauncey pushes Caleb’s second steak in front of him and then 
           rips into his new steak. Blood dripping from it.

                                 CALEB
                        Did you used to compete?
                                 CHAUNCEY
                        I was on the stage from time to 
                        time but never in the spotlight.

                                 CALEB
                        What happened? If you don’t mind...

           Chauncey smiles. Not stung. A healthy outlook.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Had the body. Never had the edge. 
                        Winners. The real elite. They got 
                        something special bubbling beneath 
                        the muscles that sweats through. 
                        Can’t see it but you feel it. They 
                        unlock a part of themselves. An 
                        attitude. A mind-set. Their bones 
                        carry the muscle differently and 
                        when they present it, audiences and 
                        judges have a primal reaction.

           On cue the door to Rae’s JINGLES and in walks Nazar Kozel. 
           The gold chained behemoth from outside Flexion. A few friends 
           following. Caleb clocks him instantly. Stares.

                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT’D)
                        I still go hard but I’m not trying 
                        to kill myself. Not anymore. I’m a 
                        personal trainer at Iron Max Gym. 
                        Figuring out the business side. 
                        Helping people get the body they 
                        want. Quit obsessing over my own.

           Chauncey feels Caleb’s attention has shifted. He turns.

                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT’D)
                        Nazar Kozel. Next decade of 
                        bodybuilding. The evolution.

                                 CALEB
                        I saw him once... outside Flexion.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Yeah, he drops by all the gyms in 
                        Venice and Santa Monica. Trains at 
                        each one. Never enough for anyone 
                        to see his full regimen. All in 
                        service of his legend, I guess.

                                 CALEB
                        Legend?
                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Nazar Kozel: The Ukrainian demigod 
                        orphan of Kachalka.

           Caleb looks at Chauncey blankly. Chauncey surprised he hasn’t 
           been briefed on Nazar Kozel. Caleb’s eyes fix back on Nazar.

                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT’D)
                        There is a gym, middle of the woods 
                        in the Ukraine called Kachalka. 
                        Eastern European muscle beach. Sort 
                        of. Depends on the time of year...

                                                             SMASH CUT:

           EXT. UKRAINE - VENETSIANSKY ISLAND - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

           Winter. Snow dusted field. Pale blue and yellow scrap metal 
           scattered amongst dead trees. Weight lifting machines.

           SUPER: KACHALKA GYM - VENETSIANSKY ISLAND, UKRAINE

           The gym empty aside from SERGIY. 68. Silver-haired old man. 
           He lifts. His MUTT at his side. Patiently supportive.

                                 CHAUNCEY (V.O.)
                        That’s where he was found. Alone. 
                        Abandoned. No one knows where he 
                        came from. How long he was there.

           The car part yellow weight plates smash into snow. Sergiy 
           bundles up. Workout complete. His dog turns. Sergiy whistles 
           to get his attention. No luck. He’s investigating a scent. 

                                 CHAUNCEY (V.O.)
                        Should’ve froze to death.

           Sergiy hears metal on metal. He follows the dog. They move 
           past a cluster of scrap metal machines. A child. In tattered 
           clothes not fit for the cold. Six years old. Young Nazar.

                                 CHAUNCEY (V.O.)
                        Instead, the little bastard was 
                        doing chain curls to keep warm.

           Sergiy looks in all directions. He must be with someone. 
           There is no one else. Sergiy watches the boy lift heavy 
           chains easily. Ripped. Tough. Development years ahead.

                                 CHAUNCEY (V.O.)
                        The man that took him in was Sergiy 
                        Kozel. Former Ukrainian gymnast. 
                        Accomplished athlete in his time.
           Sergiy offers a thermos of hot stew. Nazar hesitant at first. 
           Then hunger takes over. Survival. He grabs the thermos. Eats. 

                                 CHAUNCEY (V.O.)
                        Neither of them had anyone else. 
                        They had Kachalka and they never 
                        missed a training day.

           EXT. KACHALKA GYM - DAWN (FLASHBACK)

           Spring. Snow melted. Trees blossom. Weeds grow through the 
           machines. More people lift. No shirts. No shoes. Resembling a 
           more rugged muscle beach. Nazar trains. Does strength tricks. 
           Sergiy coaches. Nazar stronger. Already turning heads.

                                 CHAUNCEY (V.O.)
                        His strength was freakish. His body 
                        generated muscle tissue faster than 
                        gluttons gain fat.

           EXT. KACHALKA GYM - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Nazar. Fifteen. Benching. A grown man next to him benches the 
           same weight. A bet. Men huddle - wave money - count the reps 
           in Ukrainian. Cheering. Waiting to see who will win.

                                 CHAUNCEY (V.O.)
                        Nazar loved to hurt. Converted pain 
                        into fuel when other guys were 
                        emptying the tank.

           The other man folds. Bar drops to his chest - so heavy three 
           men help lift it off him. Nazar keeps pumping. Not slowing. 
           Grimacing and smiling all at once. Incredible. Sergiy proud.

                                 CHAUNCEY (V.O.)
                        And the pain he felt when Sergiy 
                        died all went into the weights.  

           INT. COMPETITION STAGES (FLASHBACK)

           Nazar competing. Bestowed medals. Holding trophies.

                                 CHAUNCEY (V.O.)
                        Such a heavy past sitting on his 
                        shoulders and he’d walk on stage 
                        light as a feather. No stress in 
                        his flex. Unstoppable.
           EXT. KACHALKA GYM - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

           Winter. The empty gym. Like before. The sound of metal. Nazar 
           now looks exactly the age we know him. Lifting in solitude in 
           the woods. We drift away until it’s a sea of dead trees.

                                 CHAUNCEY (V.O.)
                        A force of nature.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. RAE’S RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS (PRESENT)

           Caleb still staring at Nazar. Legend in the flesh.

                                 CALEB
                        That all true?

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Shit, I don’t know. Sounds good 
                        though, don’t it?

           EXT. VENICE BOULEVARD - LATER

           Palm trees whiz past. Car engine shouts. Chauncey races his 
           fiero down the block. Stops outside...

           EXT. FLEXION FITNESS - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb gets out - walks around the front of the car. Chauncey 
           rolls down his window. Stops him. 

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Caleb. Swing by Iron Max. I’ll hook 
                        you up with a free pass. Change of 
                        scenery helps breaks up the grind. 
                        If Flexion is a temple... Iron Max 
                        is a social club.

           Chauncey speeds off. Caleb idle. Flexion looming over him.

           INT./EXT. STAIRWELL - DAY

           ANGLE. Mouth of stairwell reaching down to the sidewalk. 
           Pedestrians pass. Caleb appears. Stops at the bottom of the 
           stairs. Checks for an address. Caleb heads upstairs. Girls in 
           ballet outfits playfully run down the stairs past him.
           INT. BALLET STUDIO - REHEARSAL SPACE - LATER

           BALLET INSTRUCTOR. 40s. She’s taught this so many times. No 
           enthusiasm left. Children plie, releve and saute. The 
           instructor goes down the line. Gets to Caleb.

                                 BALLET INSTRUCTOR
                        Feel the music. Respond to it. 
                        Arch. No rounded shoulders.

           Caleb struggles to follow instruction at the end of the row 
           of dancers. The teacher adjusts his stance.

                                 BALLET INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Chin up. Create nice long lines 
                        with your arms. Reach. Not bad.

           Her tone the same as she would use with a child. Caleb 
           strains to focus on the pose. Not her tone.

                                 BALLET INSTRUCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Again...

           INT. BALLET STUDIO - WAITING AREA - LATER

           Caleb sips from the water fountain. He sees a ballerina. 
           IRENE. 24. She dances alone - untouched - in a rehearsal 
           space. He cannot hear the music. Her flowing dance alone 
           fills the void. There is a glow about her. A perceived one, 
           perhaps. He moves closer to the viewing glass. Infatuated.

           INT. BALLET STUDIO - REHEARSAL SPACE - CONTINUOUS

           Music audible now. Irene lost in the song. Hangs on each step 
           and every pointed toe. Spins repeatedly. Each rotation she 
           notices more clearly a blurred figure watching her from 
           outside the window. Constant. Caleb.

           Irene does not stop until the song ends. When it does she 
           turns to get a look at her admirer. Caleb already leaving - 
           only his back visible as he exits. Irene restarts the song.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - DAY

           Caleb raises a barbell from behind his head and straight up 
           with his triceps. Soaked in sweat. Pushing.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        French Press. Barbell. 60 pounds.
           CLOSE ON pages flipping between fingers. Workout stats. Block 
           letters. His thoughts scribbled around them. Caleb turns to a 
           new page. Writes. Lead crumbles off the pencil’s tip...

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        3 sets of 10 reps. 2 sets of 8 
                        reps. Up ten pounds...
                             (beat; writes with care)
                        I can’t stop thinking about her...

           Caleb stares at himself in the mirror between sets. Flashes 
           of Irene’s day intercut with his workout:

           TELEPHOTO LENS. Voyeuristic. Irene leaves the ballet studio. 
           Gets coffee and reads at a local cafe. Enters her apartment. 
           At night she dances in the window. Sealed inside. A jewelry 
           box ballerina. Away from the seediness of the boardwalk.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        She moves free of small problems 
                        that drag on most. Clean. Better.

           Caleb stretches next to a bench between sets. A much bigger 
           guy slides in on his bench. BUCK STEWART. 32. Seizes it. Poor 
           etiquette. Caleb seething at the transgression.

                                 CALEB
                        Excuse me...
                             (beat; ignored)
                        Hey, man...
                             (beat; ignored)
                        I’m... I’m on this.

                                 BUCK
                        You’re done. Fuck off.

                                 CALEB
                        If you want to work in--

           Buck begins his set. Caleb shuffles in place. Considering 
           moving on. He doesn’t. He can’t let it go. Moves in.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Get up.

           No response. Caleb pushes the weight mid-rep. Buck loses 
           balance. Drops the weights. Shoots to his feet. Caleb does 
           not back down. Buck grins.

                                 BUCK
                             (derisively)
                        All yours.
           Buck concedes. Caleb moves past him. Buck spins and shoves 
           Caleb. He falls over the bench. Lands on his ass. Table-
           topped. His head bounces off a machine. Blood trickles from 
           his forehead. Buck snickers and pushes Caleb’s legs off the 
           bench and sits back down to continue the workout.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        What you gonna do!? Nothing. ‘Cause 
                        you’re nothing. Little bitch.

           Caleb fuming. Rises. Takes a charging step. Buck picks up a 
           dumbbell and hurls it at Caleb’s head. Caleb ducks it. The 
           weight smashes into the wall. Punches a hole in the plaster. 
           Hangs in place. Donna rips off her headphones. Rolls her 
           eyes. Buck about to swing. Donna steps in. Grabs Buck by the 
           balls. Long nails like a spiked jail cell. He freezes.

                                 DONNA
                        Time out, motherfucker.

           She walks Buck to the door by the nuts. Not much he can do.

                                 DONNA (CONT’D)
                        You’re pale. Go pump that up and 
                        think about what you did.

           She shoves Buck out the door. Nobody fucks with Donna. Donna 
           back to her desk. Points at Caleb. Then the wall.

                                 DONNA (CONT’D)
                        Fix it. Tell him I told you.

           A bodybuilder looks for a second dumbbell to make a matching 
           set. Spots it lodged in the wall. No reaction. Simply pulls 
           it out and starts curling.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb sweeps debris from the broken wall. He preps a bucket 
           with spackle. Barry is going off on people, having gotten 
           wind of what happened and running the floor like a general.

           Caleb applies spackle to the hole in the wall with a joint 
           knife. Smoothing it. Scraping it. Unnerving. Akin to nails on 
           a chalk board. Continuing over...

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - SAUNA - LATER

           Caleb. Towel covering lower half. Still. Full body sweats. 
           Skin red from the heat. Thoughts festering behind his eyes. 
           The sound of scraping spackle onto plaster never leaves.
           Hold on Caleb. An uncomfortably long time. Until we feel hot. 
           Until we need out. Caleb like a burning coal. Taking in the 
           heat. Retaining it. He will burst. A matter of time.

           INT. BALLET STUDIO - MORNING

           Caleb enters for another class. He looks for Irene in her 
           practice space. Empty. He turns and enters...

           INT. BALLET STUDIO - REHEARSAL SPACE - CONTINUOUS

           And there she is. Talking in front of the class. Caleb stops. 
           Surprised. Irene looks. Their eyes meet. Caleb smiles. She 
           waits. Awkward beat.

                                 IRENE
                        Can... I help you?

                                 CALEB
                        Uh, I think... this-- Beginners?

                                 IRENE
                        Oh, yes. Come in. You’re in the 
                        right place.

           Irene waves him in. He puts down his bag. Runs to his spot. 
           Irene leads stretches. Caleb tries not to stare. The effort 
           ultimately makes it more obvious. She notices. Doesn’t mind.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Class over. Students gather their things near the door. Irene 
           says goodbye to some of the students. Caleb waits.

                                 CALEB
                             (eagerly)
                        Hi, I’m Caleb Cole.

                                 IRENE
                        Nice to meet you, Caleb Cole. 

                                 CALEB
                        I didn’t catch yours. Your, uh, 
                        name. I was late coming in.

                                 IRENE
                        Irene.

                                 CALEB
                        Will you be teaching more of these?
                                 IRENE
                        Oh, no. I was covering to help. I 
                        don’t normally teach--

           Pause. Students file out between them.

                                 CALEB
                        Irene. Pretty name. Well, Irene, 
                        that’s too bad. 

                                 IRENE
                        What is?

                                 CALEB
                        You not teaching. I feel like I 
                        learned a lot today with you. I’m 
                        no dancer and it... I-- I hope I’m 
                        not being too forward when I say 
                        this... I saw you dancing the other 
                        day and it said a lot about you. It 
                        gave me a good sense of the type of 
                        person you are and the way you 
                        taught class reinforced that.

                                 IRENE
                        What kind of person am I? From the 
                        dancing, what did it tell you?

                                 CALEB
                        You made it look very easy and now 
                        that I’ve taken a couple classes I 
                        know it’s not. Not at all. It is 
                        hard to do even the basic moves 
                        well and so I figure someone that 
                        can make something that hard look 
                        special must be a special kind of 
                        person. Real. No fake.

                                 IRENE
                        Thanks but I’m not that good. There 
                        are people much more talented.

                                 CALEB
                        Not to me.

           She smirks. His immaturity cute. Endearing.

                                 IRENE
                        Are you trying to ask me out?

                                 CALEB
                        Would you want me to?
                                 IRENE
                        Maybe I would.

                                 CALEB
                        What are you doing?

                                 IRENE
                        You mean-- Right now? Oh, I can’t. 
                        I have an assignment due, I really 
                        need to work on.

                                 CALEB
                        Assignment? For... dance?

                                 IRENE
                        Oh, no. No, dance is a hobby. Art 
                        history major. I have to go to the 
                        Getty Villa to finish a paper.

                                 CALEB
                        What’s that?

                                 IRENE
                        Getty Villa? It’s an art museum. 
                        You’ve never been?

                                 CALEB
                        Show me. I’ll come with you. Keep 
                        you company while you finish your 
                        assignment, learn about some art.

           She hesitates. Caught off guard. Caleb nudges.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        I’ll keep quiet. Promise. Won’t 
                        know I’m there unless you want to 
                        know and if you need a break then 
                        you got someone to spend it with. 
                        Better than going all by yourself.

           Irene considers. His charm working slowly.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        What do you say?

                                 IRENE
                        Sure... okay.

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah?
                                 IRENE
                        Yes! Yeah, I have to go home to 
                        change and get my books. See you 
                        there, let’s say... two hours?

                                 CALEB
                        Two hours. Getty Villa.

           Irene nods. Caleb smiles. Exits.

                                 IRENE
                        Shoes are required!

           Caleb scurries back in - so entranced he left without his 
           sneakers. He grabs them and forces them on as he leaves. 
           Irene laughs. Shakes her head.

           INT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - CLOTHING STORE - LATER

           Caleb shops for new clothes. A nicer shirt. Not gym attire. 
           He holds up options, none match particularly well but he 
           looks satisfied in the mirror. To him, an upgrade.

           INT. CITY BUS - LATER

           Bus half full with tired passengers. Zombies en route. Except 
           Caleb. A change in his mood. He wears his new outfit. A well-
           intentioned, misguided improvement. Resembles a tourist more 
           than a local. He sits alone in the back. Head resting on the 
           glass window - ocean scrolling past. Childish anticipation.

           EXT. GETTY VILLA - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb paces nervously outside the entrance. Patrons pass. 
           Couples. Families. Anxiety building. Irene comes running up. 
           Caleb stops. Straightens posture. Puts on a new face. Soft.

                                 IRENE
                        Sorry! Neighbor blocked me in. You 
                        weren’t waiting long, were you?

                                 CALEB
                             (not a problem)
                        You’re here... You’re here.

                                 IRENE
                             (smiling)
                        Yeah, come on...
           INT./EXT. GETTY VILLA - CONTINUOUS

           MUSIC UP: ENNIO MORRICONE - LA BAMBOLA (VERSION THREE)

           ANGLE. Foyer. Glass windows. Sunlight reflecting on the 
           floor. Ethereal. Irene enters frame. Caleb following.

           Irene walks the halls in an almost ceremonial pace. She 
           analyzes the many ancient Greek and Roman busts. Pristine 
           marble. Faces and bodies frozen in time. She takes notes. 
           Ideas as they come to her. An excitement. An empathy. A 
           sophisticated, thoughtful being.

           Caleb strolls behind. He does his best not to distract Irene 
           but still near enough to feel part of the experience. Caleb 
           mostly admires her. Not the art. A discomfort with how the 
           busts stare back at him after looking too deeply.

           The two walk along the symmetric garden exhibit. Lined with 
           perfectly manicured bushes. A long opal blue fountain pool. 
           Their reflections look back at them, a quick smile shared.

           They stand closer now. Opposite a towering marble statue. A 
           body of its time to be marveled. A DEER appears in the garden 
           past the statue. Stops. Its ears twitch up. Irene grabs 
           Caleb’s arm to show him. Everything serene. Peaceful.

           EXT. GETTY VILLA - GARDEN COURTYARD - LATER

           Caleb and Irene sit on a bench in the center of a square 
           courtyard. Dense pillars surround the courtyard. Enclose 
           them. Alone together. Irene puts down her pen. A reprieve.

                                 IRENE
                        Sometimes I’ll sit out here and 
                        pretend I’m on extended travel 
                        abroad. No plans to return...
                             (beat; curiously)
                        Anything jump out at you?

                                 CALEB
                        Don’t know what to look for like 
                        you. But I like this place. It’s 
                        nice. Real nice.

                                 IRENE
                        You don’t have to know for it to 
                        say something to you. Hmm...

           Irene points to one of the statues in the garden - small man 
           hunched over. Walking carefully. Eyes wide.
                                 IRENE (CONT’D)
                        There. That one. Instinct. First 
                        thing that strikes you...

           Caleb smiles nervously - not enjoying being put on the spot. 
           A thought crosses his mind but he shakes it off. Stupid.

                                 IRENE (CONT’D)
                        Can’t be wrong. It’s yours to feel.

                                 CALEB
                             (if I have to)
                        Uh, he... looks like he’s... 
                        looking for something.

           Irene waits for more. Caleb shrugs. Nothing. She can’t get a 
           read on him. A strong feeling but an opaque one. 

                                 IRENE
                        Could be. He does look determined. 
                        Maybe looking. Maybe... hiding in 
                        plain sight... ?

           EXT. GETTY VILLA - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb walks Irene to her car. Awkward pause. She gets in. 
           Drives away. Caleb chases down the car and knocks on her 
           window. She stops, a bit startled. Rolls down her window.

                                 CALEB
                        Come out with me tonight? Let’s go 
                        out and do something fun. Not that 
                        this wasn’t-- This was great.

                                 IRENE
                        Haven’t had enough of me yet?

                                 CALEB
                        I haven’t had a day like this with 
                        someone in a long time. Have you?
                             (doesn’t matter; quickly)
                        Come out with me.

           Caleb opens up enough that it surprises Irene. Holds her 
           interest. She writes out her number on his hand. Smiles and 
           drives down the hill. Caleb looks at his hand. Thrilled.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - LATER

           Caleb trains. His mind elsewhere. Thinking of her.

           PRE-LAP. DIALING. RINGING...
           EXT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - PHONE BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Same booth as before. In the daylight. Caleb talks excitedly. 
           We don’t hear him over the sounds of the boardwalk. The call 
           goes well to his surprise. He smiles.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - TACO STAND - NIGHT

           Caleb and Irene sit next to each other eating tacos.

                                 IRENE
                        Like... 
                             (exaggerated flex)
                        RRRRRRR!

                                 CALEB
                        Exactly like that. Dance class is 
                        to help with the posing.

           Irene laughs. Then realizes Caleb is serious.

                                 IRENE
                        Wow. Okay. I would not have guessed 
                        that. You don’t look like one.

                                 CALEB
                        At the moment, no. Takes a lot of 
                        days in the gym before you look 
                        like what people expect. Doesn’t 
                        mean I’m not a bodybuilder.

                                 IRENE
                        Was that rude, I didn’t mean--

                                 CALEB
                        You’re fine.

           Awkward beat.

                                 IRENE
                        Serious question. Should you... be 
                        eating tacos? Am I a bad influence?

                                 CALEB
                        Not the worst. I’m bulking.

           Caleb acts like he’s stealing one of Irene’s tacos. She 
           laughs. Swats him away.

                                 IRENE
                        How much bigger do you plan on 
                        building yourself, if I might ask?
                                 CALEB
                        I guess, depends on how it looks. 
                        Different muscles need different 
                        amounts to find a balance. Not as 
                        simple as get big everywhere. For 
                        some guys it is. Not me.

                                 IRENE
                        Sculptor and the block of stone.

           They share a sweet smile. She’s not letting him off the hook.

                                 IRENE (CONT’D)
                        Come on, pick a number. How much 
                        bigger? How many pounds?

                                 CALEB
                        Long term... Forty. Fifty. Muscle.

                                 IRENE
                        That’s... a lot. You’ll be like a 
                        different person entirely.

                                 CALEB
                        That’s the goal.

           INT. VENICE BEACH - ARCADE - LATER

           Caleb and Irene play pinball. Caleb gets tense when the guys 
           next to them get excited playing their game and bump into 
           him. Paranoid - thinking it is on purpose.

           INT. VENICE BEACH - BAR - LATER

           Irene dances with Caleb. He’s stiff and self-conscious. 

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - LATER

           Caleb and Irene walk. A bum panhandles at them. Caleb keeps 
           moving. Recoils. He doesn’t realize Irene stopped to give 
           money. She is better. She rejoins Caleb. He abruptly kisses 
           her. Irene initially pulls away but then kisses him back.

                                 IRENE
                        Do you live close?

                                 CALEB
                        Uh, yeah... well, I’m in between 
                        places. Moving in with a friend 
                        soon. So... I have a room at a 
                        motel. Up that way a few blocks.
           She nods. They keep walking. Caleb will figure this out as he 
           goes. Not about to bail on whatever this is.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - MOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb leads Irene up to the second floor. Stops outside of a 
           room. Pats down his pants. Selling it.

                                 IRENE
                        Key?

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah, let me run down and get 
                        another one. Right back...

           Caleb heads downstairs to the front desk.

           INT. VENICE BEACH - MOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb approaches the MOTEL CLERK.

                                 CALEB
                        I need a room. Tonight only.

                                 MOTEL CLERK
                        Eight bucks.

           Caleb turns out his pockets. This day stretching him thin. He 
           picks out some money. Counts it up.

                                 CALEB
                        I can give you six. That’s all I 
                        have on me, man. Six and change.

                                 MOTEL CLERK
                        It’s eight.

                                 CALEB
                        Almost midnight. You’re passing on 
                        six? Take the six. Take the change. 

           The clerk reluctantly slides a key to a first floor unit.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Any on the second floor?

           Caleb leans back - checks the room number Irene waits by.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Like... 204?

           The clerk slides him a different key for 206. That will do.
           EXT. VENICE BEACH - MOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb hustles back up to Irene. Walks past her to 206.

                                 CALEB
                        This one...

           INT. VENICE BEACH - MOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The door opens to the room. Basic. An eight dollar room. 
           Irene realizes it’s empty. No belongings.

                                 IRENE
                        Where’s your stuff?

                                 CALEB
                        I keep it all at the gym. Shower 
                        and change there. Use this to 
                        sleep. That’s about it--

           Irene kisses him. Escalates. Moves to the bed. They strip off 
           their clothes. Irene at a level of intimacy impossible for 
           Caleb. Making him uncomfortable. The ease that this is 
           happening conflicting. He can’t get hard. He keeps trying. 
           Nothing. She tries to help. Kissing him. Staying close.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Can you-- stop touching me for a 
                        second, okay? Give me...

           She keeps going. He keeps trying. Nothing. Pulls away.

                                 IRENE
                        It’s okay. Let’s sleep.

           She reassures him. Holds him. It only makes it worse.

                                 IRENE (CONT’D)
                        Really, it’s okay.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Caleb and Irene lay next to each other. Irene asleep. 
           Cuddling. Caleb awake. Ashamed of himself. He gets up.

           INT. VENICE BEACH - MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb stands in the dark at the sink and mirror. He can’t let 
           it go. He continues to try to get hard. Angrily. Even though 
           the moment has long passed. Doesn’t matter. He still can’t.
           He stops. Rests his head against the mirror. RAMS it. Cracks. 
           Jabs. Elbows. Shatters. Caleb grabs the frame of the mirror. 
           Rips it clear off the wall and throws it into the bathtub.

           INT. VENICE BEACH - MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Irene awake. Sitting up. Concerned.

                                 IRENE
                        Caleb...

           He comes out of the bathroom. He looks down at his hand where 
           her number used to be - now it is smeared in blood.

                                 IRENE (CONT’D)
                        What happened? Are you--

                                 CALEB
                        Leave.

                                 IRENE
                        What?

                                 CALEB
                        This should have-- This was 
                        supposed to-- You’re not... you 
                        don’t know me. Why are you here?

                           IRENE
           Because I want to--
                                                          CALEB
                                              You don’t know me.

                                 IRENE
                        I decide how much I know or need to 
                        know someone. If this is about--

                                 CALEB
                        What do you know then!? Huh!?

                                 IRENE
                        I know this isn’t actually where 
                        you’re staying. I also don’t care.

                                 CALEB
                        Leave.

                                 IRENE
                        It’s the middle of the night.

           Caleb grabs her clothes and tosses them at her. She doesn’t 
           move. He won’t look at her. Eyes something awful. Unhinged. 
           Now she’s scared. She gets dressed. Slips past him. No need 
           to say anything. She wants to leave. We follow her out...
           EXT. VENICE BEACH - MOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           She hurries along the outdoor hall and downstairs. Things 
           crash and break from inside the motel room. Caleb really 
           letting it fly. She passes the motel clerk, visibly upset. 
           The clerk already on the move to check on the noise.

           INT. VENICE BEACH - MOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb sits on the bed. Room trashed. He stares out the 
           window. Neon glow leaking in. Despondent. 

           The clerk enters. Sees the mess.

                                 MOTEL CLERK
                        Trashing the place costs extra.

           Caleb begins putting on his clothes to leave.

                                 MOTEL CLERK (CONT’D)
                        You’re not going anywhere. Already 
                        know you don’t have more money.

           The clerk picks up the phone. Dials the police.

           Caleb rushes him. Pins him. Rips the phone out of the wall. 
           Caleb gut punches the clerk to give himself time to run.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - STORAGE ROOM - LATER

           Caleb lays in his corner. Tossing. Turning. Replaying every 
           moment with Irene. A resentment for trying - for tricking 
           himself into thinking it could be something that went his 
           way. Never. He tries hard to sleep. There is a rustling 
           coming from the locker room. Caleb listens closely. Not 
           Barry. Not that time yet. Weird.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb enters the locker room. He hears flapping. Cooing. He 
           turns past a row of lockers and sees the source of the noise. 

           PIGEON. Confused. Flying around the locker room or trying. 
           Struggling. It looks injured. In a state of disarray. 

           Caleb checks the ceiling - trying to find how it came in. 
           Doesn’t matter. It’s here. Caleb kneels next to the bird and 
           cradles it in his hands. The pigeon flaps nervously.
           A disgusting street bird. Some of its feathers loose on what 
           was the clean floor. Caleb looks at it, deciding what to do. 
           He feels its tiny heart beating in his palm. BA-DUM. BA-DUM.

           In an extremely easy manner, like opening a soda can, he 
           SNAPS the bird’s neck. Flapping and cooing stop. Caleb 
           stands. The bird hanging limp in his hand. Caleb tosses it 
           out in the trash. Goes back to bed.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - DAY

           MUSIC FADES IN - PLODDING - UNEASY

           Caleb does curls furiously. He gasses out. Disappointed with 
           the effort. He tosses the weights to the ground. Reeling.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        My gains are slow. Too slow.

           Caleb does squats. Wobbly on the first set. Instead of taking 
           a break he loads it with more weight. Looks like a mistake 
           even before he attempts it. Barry sees this from across the 
           gym. Doesn’t interfere. Needs to learn.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        No more fool’s errands. No more 
                        distractions.

           Caleb’s legs buckle under the weight. Pushing it too hard. 
           Being stupid and wild. Hurting himself. Caleb crashes down. 
           Bar drops. Weights slide off and slam to the ground unevenly. 
           One lands on Caleb’s ankle. It gets the gym’s attention. 
           Barry approaches. Caleb on the ground.

                                 BARRY
                        What in the fuck kind of kamikaze 
                        rep did I just witness? Lifting to 
                        fail is different than lifting to 
                        failure. Your mind tells your body 
                        how to lift the weight and if it 
                        can. That bar had you beat up top 
                        before you took it off the rack. 
                        Find a new approach or you’ll get 
                        buried again and again. Stand up. 
                        Don’t want ‘em smelling blood.

           Barry flicks his head toward the other lifters. A point to 
           not look weak. Barry moves on. Does not help Caleb up. Not 
           how he teaches. Caleb kicks the weight plate off his foot in 
           frustration. He stands and cleans up the rest of his mess.
           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - DAY

           A lifter sweats buckets. Caleb sops it up with a rag. Another 
           lifter racks weights. Blood on the grips from open blisters. 
           Caleb lines up the blood stained weights. Sprays and wipes.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        Not a bodily fluid I don’t clean up 
                        regularly in the gym. That and all 
                        the dead skin, hair, nails...

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - SHOWERS - DAY

           Caleb mops - getting rid of the grime. He exits the showers 
           as a bodybuilder shows in a woman. Caleb watches as they 
           undress, disappearing into the showers he just cleaned.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)

                        destructible people are. Always 
                        trying to hold themselves together. 
                        Even the well kept ones. The 
                        fitness freaks.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - DAY

           Caleb comes out of a grocery store and turns the corner. A 
           strung out HOMELESS SURFER DUDE takes a piss on the side of a 
           building. He almost falls in it. He chases tourists with his 
           pants down laughing. Caleb veers around him.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)

           Caleb on a mission to clear out the old gear. Hauls broken 
           parts away. Cuts his arm on one of the jagged edges. Nothing 
           serious. Another annoyance that eats at him. Works him up.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        I need my own place. Some privacy.

           INT./EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

           An OLD LANDLORD shows Caleb the grounds. The lush palm trees 
           outside deceptive. Street traffic obnoxious. 
           The pool at the center full but not with water any human 
           should jump into. Cockroaches skitter everywhere.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        Rent is not the problem now that I 
                        have some cash. Problem is never 
                        enough room to breathe. Hell is 
                        other people too close.

           Caleb walks a tight circle inside a jail cell sized studio. 
           Paint with mold patches. Stained carpet. Makeshift kitchen.

           FOOTSTEPS trample above. Caleb looks up. ARGUMENTS travel 
           through walls next-door. SIRENS pass outside. Neighbors 
           already being nosey, looking in. A nightmare.

           Caleb lifts in the mirror. His head looks like it could pop 
           off from the weight. Arms tremble. Each rep the plates on 
           either side rotate little by little. Grinding. Slipping.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

           Caleb closes his notebook. Sits for a moment. Trapped.
           EXT. VENICE BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           Another night run. Caleb’s stride haggard. Lack of sleep 
           chipping at him insidiously. He runs past a woman walking her 
           dog. The dog BARKS at Caleb. Sensing something off. The woman 
           looks nervous and keeps walking.

           Caleb runs the beach. A discarded SYRINGE sticks out of the 
           sand. Caleb in a trance. Never sees it. With his full weight 
           he steps on the needle. It punches through his sneaker.

           MUSIC CEASES - SHARP CUTOFF

           He crumbles. Screams. Only briefly. He grabs his foot. Needle 
           clear through. He carefully removes it and as he does...

           CLOSE ON top of sneaker - dirty white mesh becomes flush with 
           blood - like a gauss pad on a cut.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - FISHING PIER - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb limps down the beach. Syringe in hand. Looking for a 
           punching bag. He sees the homeless surfer under the condemned 
           pier. It stands fractured. Reminder of 1983 El Nino storm. A 
           small dystopia. The man sets up camp. Rambles incoherently.

           Caleb grabs him and pushes him to the ground. Puts the 
           syringe up to his eyeball. The man is plugged into a 
           different reality. Mumbling. Eyes rolling. Not home.

                                 CALEB
                        This yours!? Open your eyes! Open 
                        them! You hear me!? Is this yours!? 

           The man laughs. Caleb covers his mouth.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Shut up. Shut. Up.

           He bites Caleb. Struggles. Caleb takes the syringe and stabs 
           it into the man’s thigh. Normally, a needle sends this man on 
           a high but this time it is sobering. The intent with which 
           Caleb thrusts it into him making him lucid. Scared.

           The man screams - Caleb muffles it. Caleb removes the syringe 
           and stabs him again. The man rolls - pushes - tries to fight 
           Caleb off. Caleb keeps stabbing.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        You fucking pockmark! You shit 
                        caked parasite! You waste!
           Caleb kneels on the man’s chest. Presses his face into the 
           wet sand. Waves roll in. The man gags. Caleb starts punching 
           wildly into the water as a wave submerges the man’s face. The 
           smack of the water more startling than seeing punches land. 

           Each time his face surfaces it’s worse. Closer to death. For 
           a moment, Caleb sees his own bloody face on the man’s body 
           until another wave washes over it and reveals the man is 
           dead. Water spills from his lifeless mouth. Shock creeps in. 
           Blood speckles Caleb’s face - clothes soaked, blood-stained. 
           The man’s body floats out in the wake under the pier.

           Caleb hears someone. He’s fucked. He looks. More junkies and 
           homeless scavenge the dead man’s camp. Vultures. They don’t 
           care about Caleb. Caleb about to flee. Wait. The syringe. 
           Finds it and hurls it out into the ocean. Staggers away.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - STORAGE ROOM/HALLWAY - LATER

           Caleb’s wet clothes clumped across the floor like a trail. 
           Socks. Shirt. Shorts. Shoes. Then wet footsteps. Into the 
           hall. Then the weight room...

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb stands in the mirror. Completely naked. Still dripping 
           wet. Mind in overdrive. He looks at the blood spread on his 
           face like freckles. His fingernails clogged with sand and 
           dried blood. Arms red from the struggle.

           Caleb breathes quick breaths. Puts his hand on his heart. 
           Pounding. He lowers his arms to his side and makes a fist. 
           Caleb feels this rush coursing through his veins.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Caleb’s bloody, cold face rising and lowering into frame. 
           He’s doing... pushups. Chest coming within an inch of the 
           floor. The muscles in his arms and back ripple as he does 
           push up after push up. He starts going faster.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Caleb does lateral pull downs. Weights crashing down with 
           every rep. He pulls ferociously on the metal bar.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Caleb deadlifts. He uses everything in him to lift it. 
           Impressive stack. His eyes something terrifying.

                                                                CUT TO:
           Empty gym. Quiet until Caleb prowls into frame. Then out of 
           frame. He paces back and forth in the mirror. Each time he 
           exits and reappears an uneasiness grows. Until, finally...

           Caleb stops. Collapses. Worked to muscle failure. He crawls 
           up to the mirror and rests his head against it. Looks into 
           his own eyes for a beat. Blank.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Red water spirals down the drain. Going against stream we 
           follow the trail of blood along Caleb’s foot. Then up his 
           leg. The water less red as we continue up until there’s no 
           blood at all. Caleb clean again.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - LATER

           Caleb sprays every machine and spot he touched with cleaner. 
           He scrubs meticulously. He mops the floor. He gathers his wet 
           clothes. Bags them with other trash. The gym spotless. 

           Caleb takes a final look before he turns off the lights and 
           exits. The empty gym rests easy in the dark. The hum of an 
           air conditioner soothing. Rage gone. Long beat.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - STORAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb lays in his makeshift quarters in the storage room. His 
           eyes close and he falls asleep. Drifts off. This is the most 
           at rest we have seen him. 

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - STORAGE ROOM - LATER

           Caleb wakes. Hears flapping again. Another pigeon? Damn. 
           Caleb gets up to take care of it.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb enters the main lifting area. It falls silent. No more 
           flapping. Not a pigeon. His mind playing tricks. He thinks he 
           sees someone in the back corner behind a machine. A shadow.

                                 CALEB
                        Hello... ?

           Caleb flicks on the lights. No one back there. He flicks the 
           lights off. Walks further into the gym. Suddenly, the whole 
           gym shakes. Earthquake. Caleb’s reflection in the mirror goes 
           out of focus from the vibration. He braces. Shaking stops.
           The mirror stops vibrating. As the reflection comes back into 
           focus we also see someone creepily standing behind Caleb in 
           the center of the room. A giant, posed, muscular figure. Ten 
           feet tall. Caleb spots it in the mirror and spins around.

           Not a person but a STATUE. Marble. Unmoving. It towers over 
           Caleb. Strong pose. Grimacing face. Caleb hears scratching. 
           He puts his ear up against its stomach. The statue begins to 
           crack. Little pieces chip off and fall to the floor. Hitting 
           the ground and turning to dust.

           Caleb steps back. Something is burrowing out from the inside 
           of the statue. The cracks turn to holes and through the holes 
           fingers claw. Blood red fingers. Hands. More than from a 
           single person. The thigh. The biceps. The torso. The calves. 
           The head. Bloody hands rip through each part of the statue 
           like birds hatching from eggs. 

           Then, over the heart, a mouth bites through the surface. 
           Teeth bloody. Jagged. The mouth gasps for air. Caleb can’t 
           look away. Suddenly, Caleb’s skin crawls. Quite literally. 
           Hands pushing out from inside him. Fingerprints. Skin 
           stretching from the pressure. Whole body flexing and 
           twitching. He is not alarmed. An enlightening visage.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - STORAGE ROOM - MORNING

           The sun shines through the hatch window. For the first time 
           this room feels vibrant, not like a dungeon. A new day. A 
           soft glow. Caleb wakes. Not startled or in a sweat.

           The suppressed sound of weights hitting the floor vibrates 
           into the storage room. Caleb looks rested. His eyes clear. 

           Then he realizes he slept in and jolts up. His body moving 
           before his brain even knows what to do. No one must have 
           noticed he was there since... he is still in there. Caleb 
           carefully opens the door to the storage room.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Hall clear. Caleb steps out. He walks into the gym area, not 
           sure if he will be greeted by cops or an enraged Barry. 
           Instead, he gets out there and it’s like any other day.

           The gym in full swing. Donna at her desk. Was last night just 
           a twisted nightmare? He goes to exit with his head down. 
           Barry spots him as he passes...

                        After you.

                                 BARRY
                        Caleb.

           Caleb stops. He turns, afraid Barry knows something.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Gym looks great. Keep it up.

           Caleb nods. Slides out the front entrance. As he exits a 
           bodybuilder enters in a NEON PINK AND BLACK STRIPE SPANDEX 
           UNITARD. The front low cut. Below his belly button. Barry 
           sees this and can’t ignore it. Not in his gym.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Nope. The fuck out.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - FISHING PIER - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb turns a corner onto the boardwalk when he sees it full 
           view... a bustling crime scene. His crime scene.

           Detectives comb the beach beneath the pier. Area taped off. 
           The body being photographed and bagged. People in bathing 
           suits look on. Not a hundred yards away there’s families 
           enjoying the sun. Not stopping their beach day. 

           Caleb keeps a steady pace as he walks by. He disappears into 
           an alleyway between bungalows.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - DAY

           Caleb does a set of cleans - hoisting the bar weight from the 
           ground up to his chest in one quick motion. His form 
           improved. His lifts tight and sharp.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        Male. Name... unknown. Five feet. 
                        Seven inches. One hundred thirty-- 
                        forty pounds. Approximately. He was 
                        weak. I should feel bad. I don’t.

           He finishes the set. Writes the results in the journal.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        I feel... good.

                                                                CUT TO:
           Caleb on bench press. Rips through the set - focused on the 
           ceiling stain as he has done before. The stain POP FLASHING 
           to bloody images of the man he killed. It propels Caleb.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        My muscles do not tire as fast. My 
                        appetite has improved.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - DAY

           Caleb sits perched atop a cement wall along the bike path. 
           Cyclists and runners float past below. Skateboarders do 
           tricks across the way next to the boardwalk. Caleb 
           appreciates the boardwalk for a change.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        A noticeable effect. Like I have 
                        shed old skin.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - SUBURBS - DAY

           A classic California bungalow on a sleepy street tucked in 
           the suburbs, off the beach. Paint faded. Aged but lyrically. 
           Detached garage in the back. Safe.

           Caleb approaches the front door. He knocks. Beat. No answer. 
           He walks off the deck and gets a better look at the detached 
           garage. Scopes it out.

           A pale yellow 1977 CHEVETTE SANDPIPER pulls off the street 
           and into the driveway. Caleb steps off to the side and lets 
           the car pull in. The car comes to a stop. The door opens and 
           AUBREY exits. 45. Long dark hair. No makeup. Serene. Not 
           easily intimidated.

           She sees Caleb standing there awkwardly - goes to her trunk 
           and pops it open. Grabs groceries. In no rush.

                                 AUBREY
                        Yes?

                                 CALEB
                        Hello, ma’am--

                                 AUBREY
                        Aubrey.

                                 CALEB
                        I’m here to look at the room for 
                        rent. Uh, this address was in the 
                        paper, advertising an apartment. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CALEB (CONT'D)
                        I was hoping to take a look. If 
                        this is... this is the right 
                        address?

           Aubrey letting him go on to see when he shuts up. She slowly 
           makes her way up her front steps and onto her deck.

                                 AUBREY
                        It’s around back. Above the garage. 
                        Meet you there...

           She enters the front door and closes it. Beat. Caleb heads 
           along the house toward the garage. He looks in the windows as 
           he goes to try and get a feel for the house. Can’t see much. 
           Very minimal. Very functional. Unassuming. He sees Aubrey 
           passing a window doing the same - an eye on Caleb.

           Caleb stands in driveway near the garage. She exits the back 
           of the house. Lights a joint. Offers to Caleb. He declines.

                                 CALEB
                        The paper didn’t say how much?

                                 AUBREY
                        I decide the price based on the 
                        person asking.
                             (beat)
                        A hand, please...

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb and Aubrey lift the garage door. The first level is a 
           standard garage. Boxes. Some tools. Some paint cans. Caleb 
           follows Aubrey up the stairwell to the second floor.

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - GARAGE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           A small tube television. A folding table and chair - Aubrey 
           sits down and puffs her joint out the small window framing a 
           single palm tree. Caleb makes a pass through the place. A 
           bathroom no bigger than one on an airplane. No kitchen. No 
           other amenities. A place to sleep and shit in.

           But it’s quiet. It is nice and quiet. Caleb looks out the 
           window. Walks through the space. Comfortable.

                                 AUBREY
                        How long have you lived in 
                        California?

                                 CALEB
                        Couple months.
                                 AUBREY
                        Like it?

                                 CALEB
                        Yes, ma’am. Can’t complain.

                                 AUBREY
                             (correcting)
                        Aubrey. 
                             (then)
                        Don’t do that with me.

           Beat. Caleb can’t tell if she means call her ma’am or lie.

                                 AUBREY (CONT’D)
                        So... ?

                                 CALEB
                        I don’t have much.

                                 AUBREY
                        What do you do?

                                 CALEB
                        Bodybuilder.

                                 AUBREY
                        What do you do to make money?

                                 CALEB
                        Construction. Whatever I can find.

           Aubrey takes a nice long drag. Feels a kinship.

                                 AUBREY
                        If you don’t have a bed, you can 
                        use that air mattress rolled up in 
                        the corner. Hot plate, mini-fridge. 
                        I don’t use either. They’re boxed 
                        up in the garage. You’re also 
                        welcome to use the kitchen in the 
                        house. I leave the door off the 
                        porch open. Pay me what you can 
                        once a month. What’s fair relative 
                        to what you make. How’s that?

                                 CALEB
                        That... will work.

                                 AUBREY
                        Move in when it’s convenient.

           She walks back down the stairs. Caleb isn’t used to being in 
           this position. Controlled. She has him on his heels.
           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

           Caleb packs up his rucksack. Wasting no time to move into his 
           new place. Takes a look at the storage room. Clean. A neat 
           pile of parts that can be reused.

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - GARAGE APARTMENT - DAY

           ANGLE. Tube television. An old peplum - sword-and-sandals 
           film. Battle scene. The muscular hero - MILIUS THE MIGHTY - 
           played by a young LUCA LEONE. He fights his enemies with a 
           sword in one hand and a torch in the other.

           Caleb watches as he tears pages from muscle magazines and 
           tapes them to the walls like a teenager would. Overlapping. 
           Crooked. He unrolls a bigger poster and centers it among the 
           rest on the wall. A print of Luca Leone. His idol.

           Aside from the window, mirror and tube television every inch 
           is covered in images of muscular bodies. Caleb poses in the 
           center of the room. Another body in the collage.

           The film continues on the television - Luca’s character 
           defeats his foe. Raises its head. His enemies retreat.

                                 LUCA LEONE
                             (as Milius the Mighty)
                        Send your most wicked creature. 
                        Send ten! It would not matter. No 
                        man! No abomination! Can strike me 
                        down! For the gods owe me a debt!

           His soldiers cheer and chant. Big heroic score builds. Caleb 
           raises the volume. Smiles and checks his pose in the mirror. 
           Relishing the cheers and fervor as if it were his own.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - MORNING

           Caleb does pull ups. Then push ups in the sand. Caleb hangs 
           upside down and does crunches. He goes to failure. Collapses. 
           Sweating. Tries to go for more but he can’t. Body gives out. 
           He looks at the other men circuit training on the beach.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        It started fading this past week. 
                        Lasted almost a month. Chewed the 
                        memory to the bone.
           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - DAY

           Buck crosses in front of Caleb. Caleb’s eyes follow him in 
           the mirror. Buck posts up with weights spread at his feet.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        He does not remember picking a 
                        fight with me. Why would he?

           Buck works his arms. Biceps and triceps.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        Too focused on his arms. His pride 
                        lives there. Everything else about 
                        him underdeveloped.

           Buck chats with another bodybuilder. Caleb trains close by.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        Can learn more than a person’s 
                        workout habits when they don’t 
                        think anyone is listening. Where 
                        they live. What drugs they take. 
                        Who they fuck. Where they party.

           DEEP FOCUS Buck’s face in the foreground - lifting. Caleb in 
           the background - does cable pull-downs while watching Buck. 

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        Buck Stewart. Six foot one. One 
                        hundred eighty pounds plus. His 
                        muscles are big. So is his ego. I 
                        want to know how hard they are to 
                        break. What they feel like when 
                        they finally do...

           Eyes devilish. Craving the kill. Soon. This helps Caleb’s 
           workout. Thought of a hunt floods his muscles with blood.

           EXT. FLEXION FITNESS - LATER

           Caleb tanning at the grass lot across the street. He watches 
           the gym closely. Buck exits. Walks up the block and gets in 
           his car. Pulls away. Caleb lays back. Eerily calm.

           EXT. TECHNO LUDOVICO - DANCE CLUB - NIGHT

           Buck parks across the street from the club. Walks up with a 
           gorgeous blonde under his arm. Caleb staked out nearby. He 
           approaches the bar after a cautious pause.
           INT. TECHNO LUDOVICO - DANCE CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb enters the night club. Brightly dressed, sweaty bodies 
           bop around to BLONDIE - ATOMIC playing on the club speakers. 
           Caleb walks through the club. No sign of Buck. Caleb finds a 
           good corner to wait and hunt from.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MUSIC UP: SIMONETTI-PIGNATELLI-MORANTE - TENEBRE

           Dancing. Twisting and turning bodies. Lights. Legs. Hair. 
           Caleb still in his corner. Eyes fixed through the crowd. 

           Buck brings his girl a drink. Caleb’s view gets blocked.

           He gets up and circles. Watching. Buck is belligerent. In the 
           girl’s face. He chugs his drink and heads to the bathroom. 
           Caleb moves through the dance floor in pursuit.

           INT. TECHNO LUDOVICO - DANCE CLUB - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb enters. Music still audible. A couple drunks at the 
           urinals. Caleb washes his hands. Looks in the mirror. Sees 
           feet in one of the stalls. Buck. His pants down around his 
           ankles. The men at the urinals leave. Caleb uses a mop to jam 
           the door shut. He goes into the stall next to Buck. Climbs 
           and looks over the divider to make sure it’s him.

           FROM ABOVE. Buck snorts coke off his hand while he takes a 
           shit. Caleb climbs down. Squares off in front of the stall 
           door. Breathing heavier. Heavier. Then...

           THOOM. Kicks in the stall door. Buck looks up. Sees Caleb.

           Caleb pounces before Buck can register it all. Fists flying 
           everywhere. Caleb headbutts him. Buck already in trouble. But 
           he’s a big guy, coked up. Hello, second wind. He grabs Caleb. 
           Smashes him against the stall walls. Caleb ribs him. Catches 
           him with an elbow to the mouth. Caleb gets behind him. 
           Attacks the point of weakness he assessed earlier. He puts 
           Buck in a choke hold. Buck flails. Mobility limited.

                                 CALEB
                             (sotto; belabored)
                        All. You had... to do. Was... ask 
                        to work in with me.

           He swings at Caleb trying to get him loose. Caleb takes each 
           scrappy shot in stride. Buck kicks his feet. The door to the 
           stall swinging open and closed.
           Caleb sees himself strangling Buck in the mirror. His choke 
           hold angled and squeezing like a side biceps pose. He admires 
           it. It makes him pull even harder, the muscle engorged. Just 
           about to break Buck. Not until...

                                 BUCK
                             (raspy; helpless)
                        P-- Please. Please.

           He begs. The satisfaction. Now Caleb finishes him. Buck goes 
           limp. Caleb takes a blissful breath. Drops the body. He looks 
           at himself in the mirror. Hits that side biceps pose without 
           Buck’s head now. Good form. Beat. 

           Caleb jerks Buck up and carries his body to the window. He 
           fishes Buck’s car keys from his pocket. Caleb looks out the 
           window. Clear. Tosses the body outside. There’s knocking on 
           the bathroom door. Caleb goes to the sink and fixes his hair 
           and shirt in the mirror. Knocking grows. Caleb washes his 
           face. Dabs it calmly with a paper towel. Only then does he 
           head for the door.

                                 CALEB
                        Coming.

           He removes the mop. Places it back in the corner and opens 
           the door. He exits past the waiting patrons with no sign of 
           the violence that just occurred.

           EXT. TECHNO LUDOVICO - DANCE CLUB - ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb drives down the back alley in Buck’s car. He stops next 
           to the body, lumped in with trash bags. Caleb checks, no one 
           around. He lifts the body into the trunk. Drives away.

           INT. BUCK’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb drives along the pacific coast highway. Hair blowing in 
           the wind. Body stiff in the trunk. Feeling good. Ah, summer.

           He cranks the radio: QUEEN - BODY LANGUAGE.

           EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Buck’s car races south down the pacific coast highway. The 
           car enters a tunnel as the lyrics of the song echo eerily:

           GIVE ME. 

           YOUR BODY.
           GIVE ME.

           YOUR BODY.

           EXT. DOCKWEILER BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           The car stops on the side of the road - above the beach. 
           Caleb turns off the engine - radio cuts out on beat.

           Not a soul around. He gets out. Opens the trunk, pulls the 
           body out. Rolls it down the hill and follows after it. He 
           drags the body by the feet all the way onto the beach.

           He gets it to one of the fire pits. Tosses it in. Covers the 
           body with a blanket. There’s some left over wood. He stacks 
           it on top. Lights it. A big bonfire.

           The smoke black at first. The smell off-putting. But soon it 
           burns and burns cleaner. Orange glow now. The body charred. 
           You wouldn’t be able to tell through the wood what it was.

           Caleb stands over it. Long beat as he watches the fire burn. 
           A group of teenagers come walking up the beach toward Caleb. 
           Blankets. Guitar. Beers. Marshmallows.

                                 TEENAGER #1
                        Mind if we join?

           Caleb breathes in the smell of the fire, enjoying it like a 
           barbecue. Savoring the aroma. So he can remember.

                                 CALEB
                        All yours.

                                 TEENAGER #2
                        You sure, dude? Have a beer.

                                 CALEB
                             (politely declining)
                        Strict diet.

                                 TEENAGER #1
                             (re: fire smell)
                        Oh, man. That’s harsh.

           Caleb walks back to his car. In the background the teens 
           enjoy his bonfire. Playing music. Roasting marshmallows. 
           Oblivious to the human sack of meat for fire starter. 
           EXT. TECHNO LUDOVICO - DANCE CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb parks Buck’s car in the same spot Buck left it. Tosses 
           the keys into someone’s yard and heads back inside the club.

           INT. TECHNO LUDOVICO - DANCE CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb finds Buck’s blonde date. She sits at the bar. 
           Disinterested in advances coming her way in Buck’s absence. 
           Caleb goes right for her. Still on his kill high. Gets nose 
           to nose. Says nothing. Intense pause. She stares back. Feels 
           the energy coming off him. They dance. Shortly--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TECHNO LUDOVICO - DANCE CLUB - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb and the woman fuck in the same stall he murdered Buck. 
           This is purely animal for Caleb. Not registering the blonde. 
           While fucking he notices a couple of Buck’s teeth on the 
           ground. Must have knocked out during the brawl. Caleb smiles. 
           Fixated on the teeth. Speeding up his tempo...

           Finishes. The blonde pulls down her dress. Exits. Caleb picks 
           up the teeth. Wipes away the small amount of blood on the 
           ground with toilet paper and then flushes it all.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - LATER

           Place closed. Caleb trains in the dark. Had his fun - now he 
           is using it all in the gym. Pre-workout boost helping him 
           lift. He is crushing it.

           EXT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - LATER

           Streets empty. Caleb walks up the driveway to Aubrey’s house. 
           He gets halfway up when a motion detector light flicks on. 
           Caleb stops. Reflex. Holds his arm out to block the light. 
           Arm shaking and heavy from all the work it put in. 

           Caleb takes in the night air. He feels something on his ear - 
           swipes at it with his finger. Blood. His from a hit he took 
           or some of Buck’s. He rubs it between his hands like dirt and 
           heads into the garage apartment.

           When the motion light flicks off and the glare leaves the 
           windows of the house we can see Aubrey. She watches at the 
           window from inside. In the dark. A deep curiosity.
           EXT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - DAY

           Sly smile fixed on Caleb as he stands in the center of the 
           boardwalk. People move around him to keep with the flow of 
           traffic. Passing him like always.

           The food chain shifted. Caleb knows he has done something 
           these people have not and likely could not do. Above them. 
           More definably not them. This feeds Caleb. He leans his head 
           back and soaks in the sun. A new kick. A new strength.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb walks up to a couple LAPD BIKE COPS. The cops busy 
           flirting with a couple girls. Grossly checking them out 
           through their aviator glasses. Caleb stops and looks at the 
           cops instead. They notice him lingering. Side eye him.

                                 CALEB
                        Officers.

           The cops don’t respond. Figure it would only provoke. They 
           must deal with weirdos all the time on the boardwalk. Caleb 
           amused. They don’t suspect him at all.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Should I be concerned?

           The cop goes to say something to one of the girls and Caleb 
           cuts in - stepping all over them.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        I heard about the man killed by the 
                        pier a few weeks ago and now this 
                        other body they found down the 
                        coast. I run at night...

           Eyes on the girls. They barely glance at Caleb.

                                 LAPD BIKE COP #2
                        Be careful and if you see something 
                        suspicious let us know.

                                 CALEB
                        I will. Oh, one more thing... how 
                        many speeds does your bicycle have? 
                        I might add riding to my cardio--

                                 LAPD BIKE COP #2
                        Get the fuck out of here, this 
                        isn’t a bike shop.
           Caleb throws on his sunglasses and raises his hands. He gets 
           it. Time to move along. 

                                 CALEB
                        Stay vigilant.

           He backs away and disappears into the crowd. The cops back to 
           their uninterrupted flirting.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - NIGHT

           Last of the gym rats finish up before closing. Caleb lifts 
           something nuts. More than usual. Smile still there. Losing 
           track of time. Buck’s body going limp in his hands fresh on 
           his mind. He channels it. Barry watches and drifts closer. 
           Impressed with Caleb’s intensity. An eye on him now - what 
           could be a trainable new beast. Caleb nears the end of a set.

                                 BARRY
                        How many more you got?

           Barry almost taunting him. Caleb completes a rep.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        How many? Three?

           Caleb does another rep. That one was a lot harder.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, wow, maybe not. Maybe one? Good 
                        form if we’re lucky? Elbows tucked. 
                        Back straight. Do it right.

           Caleb’s arms shake. He focuses to steady them.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        Here we go. UP!

           Caleb fights through. Completes the rep.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        One more. UP!

           Caleb digs in. Completes the rep.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        I lied. UP!

           Caleb is about to give out - looks Barry right in the eyes 
           and pushes through the rep and finishes strong.

                                 CALEB
                        One more...
           To prove his hunger he decides to get in an extra rep. Drops 
           the weights. Doesn’t hunch. Fights all signs of weakness. 
           Barry pumps his fist. Encouragement.

           EXT. IRON MAX GYM - MORNING

           A giant glass and steel building. A fairly new construction. 
           The mega gym. Muscle hopped up on capitalist gain. Based on 
           the beautiful people coming and going, business is good.

           INT. IRON MAX GYM - CONTINUOUS

           MUSIC UP: ENNIO MORRICONE - GUERRA E PACE, POLLO E BRACE

           SLOW MOTION as Caleb explores Iron Max and the capitalist 
           eighties boom of fitness for the first time. Twenty foot high 
           ceilings. Mirrors lining every wall. A second floor with 
           cardio machines. A workout room full of women in spandex 
           doing aerobics. Spa in the back. Juice bar.

           Buff guys and girls roaming everywhere. Three times as many 
           as Flexion. He navigates the floor. Sensory overload. Prowls 
           the gym. Watches people lift. Honing in on the finer muscle 
           details. It can’t help but feel like pigs to the slaughter. 

           As he scans the floor some of the gym members skin is gone. 
           Only bleeding muscle and bones. Still working out. Then more 
           of them skinned. Until Caleb looks around and every body is 
           without skin - their inner workings on full display. 

           All the tempting bodies. Cuts of meat at a butcher shop. 
           Different physical attributes make certain bodies appealing 
           targets. The bigger and more built the better.

                                 CHAUNCEY (O.S.)
                        Caleb! You made it.

           Caleb’s vision gone. The gym back to normal. Chauncey helps a 
           client finish their set - gives them instructions for the 
           next and jogs over to Caleb.

                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT’D)
                        You look good, man. You’re doing 
                        something right.

                                 CALEB
                        I think I, uh, recently found that 
                        edge you told me about.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        What’s your secret?
                                 CALEB
                        Hard to explain. Added a new sort 
                        of exercise into my routine that 
                        jump-starts my system. Keeps me 
                        fresh for weeks.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Alright, well, hey if it’s working. 
                        You’re gonna tell me what it is at 
                        some point though. Gotta finish a 
                        client session. Get in a pump.
                             (checks watch)
                        Got time before it starts.

                                 CALEB
                        Time before... ?

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Special surprise. You’ll see.
                             (to front desk attendant)
                        He’s good, let him do his thing.

           Chauncey heads back to his client. Caleb finds a machine and 
           drops his bag. Sits down and starts lifting.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Caleb sips water from a fountain between sets. Suddenly, 
           there’s a commotion at the entrance. Chauncey waves Caleb 
           down excitedly. The surprise.

                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT’D)
                        Here we go!

           Nazar Kozel and his crew enter - people in the gym 
           immediately freak. He’s a bonafide rock star here.

           Nazar prepares to lift. There are a number of photographers 
           and a videographer. Managers and agents. A full team. A full 
           moneymaking machine. An electricity in the place. Chauncey 
           and Caleb find a prime spot to watch from.

                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT’D)
                        Full press workout. First time he’s 
                        doing this. Front row, baby.

           Nazar takes off his shirt - puts on his back support belt. 
           Chalks his hands and gets to it. Flash bulbs go off. People 
           clap when he finishes a set. When he strikes a pose. Nazar 
           lets a couple ladies grab on his chest and arms. Caleb feet 
           away. Equally awestruck. Envious. He knows he has a lot of 
           work to do. Caleb notices the suits with Nazar.
                                 CALEB
                        What’s with these guys?

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        The money. They set stuff like this 
                        up for exposure. Paid the way for 
                        him to come over. Put him up in a 
                        house in Topanga Canyon. Outdoor 
                        gym in the yard to make it feel 
                        like home. Keep him cozy. Hard for 
                        those brand deals and movie roles. 
                        He climbs to the top, so do they. 
                        Big gains for everyone involved.

           The management guys lean over to the photographers to make 
           sure the proper shots get taken. One gives Nazar a look and 
           he knows to move on to another setup. Caleb looks on like he 
           feels a higher force that keeps driving the two men together. 
           A test. Fate in some way. A trophy he wants to possess.

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - GARAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Television on a nature channel. Caleb does pushups. There’s a 
           stinging WHISTLE that cuts through. Caleb goes to the window. 
           Aubrey is down in the yard. She’s looking up at Caleb.

                                 AUBREY
                        I made dinner. Come down.

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb sits as Aubrey puts food out on the table. He is 
           nervous. Something already extremely intimate about the 
           casual meal. An energy fills the space in her presence. 
           Aubrey pours him milk without asking. He accepts.

                                 AUBREY
                             (checking the table)
                        Alright...

           Looks good. Aubrey takes a seat opposite Caleb.

                                 AUBREY (CONT’D)
                        Are you religious?

                                 CALEB
                        Why?

                                 AUBREY
                             (obviously)
                        Your name.

                                 AUBREY (CONT'D)
                             (and)
                        Not sure if you like saying grace.

           Caleb embarrassed - clearly not thinking about the origin of 
           his name. Clearly not all that religious. Shakes his head no.

                                 CALEB
                        I was raised to be.

           Caleb starts to eat. So does Aubrey.

                                 AUBREY
                        Didn’t take?

                                 CALEB
                        Mostly, no. Never felt like I 
                        needed that sort of thing.

                                 AUBREY
                        What do you mean?

                                 CALEB
                        Religious people aren’t better for 
                        it. They don’t act good all the 
                        time. They just feel more guilt. So 
                        they need a mechanism for 
                        forgiveness.

                                 AUBREY
                        Don’t we all, in different ways?

           Caleb silent. Unwilling to play along.

                                 AUBREY (CONT’D)
                        Any family out here? 

                                 CALEB
                        No family.

                                 AUBREY
                        No one... at all? Father? Mother?

                                 CALEB
                        I don’t have a mother. A woman gave 
                        birth to me. I don’t have a mother. 
                        Why are you being so nice to me? 
                        The apartment? The food?

                                 AUBREY
                        A good feeling. Like we were always 
                        going to meet at this time and have 
                        this conversation. 
                             (beat; leaning in)

                        Because you came looking for a 
                        place to stay but you could use a 
                        home. Doesn’t hurt to know more 
                        about the person living on my 
                        property too. Not the version he 
                        likes to show people.

           Caleb defensive. He tries not to respond rudely or at all. 
           Tries to eat. He can’t. Her last comment invasive.

                                 CALEB
                        Who are you? You religious? Where 
                        is your family? Why are you alone?

           Aubrey grins.

                                 AUBREY
                        My full legal name is Ethel Aubrey 
                        Hayes. Ethel as in Merman. She was 
                        a famous singer and actress. Mom 
                        adored her voice. Gusto and poise, 
                        she would say. Fine traits for a 
                        young girl. Only child. Red diaper 
                        baby. Do you know what this is? 
                             (beat; no response)
                        My parents were part of the United 
                        States Communist Party. I’m not 
                        religious. Fatalist, if anything. 
                        But I know what it is to be born 
                        into a family with faith in what 
                        they view as righteous. I was an 
                        offspring and a new party member. 
                        When I was old enough I thought I 
                        would also find my purpose in 
                        activism. Spent my twenties blindly 
                        passionate. Angry. Early thirties 
                        confused. Curious. Until I figured 
                        out what it was that fulfilled me. 
                        Made me feel secure. Wasn't being a 
                        pawn in a greater chess match I had 
                        no control over. It was having 
                        control. A small corner of the 
                        board I knew was mine. Quiet. 
                        Tucked away. To be myself. So here 
                        I am. In my corner. Alone. Far from 
                        lonely. Now, you could have enjoyed 
                        learning all this over the course 
                        of the meal in conversation but you 
                        don’t like pacing yourself.

                                 CALEB
                        I don’t like talking about myself. 
                        I don’t see the point.
                                 AUBREY
                        I might.

           Caleb stuffs a few bites of food into his mouth and stands.

                                 CALEB
                        Thank you for dinner.

           He exits. Aubrey sits back. Watches him go to the garage.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - MORNING

           A vacant machine - pads ripped from usage. Sweat stains on 
           the floor. Caleb throws one leg over and sits down. Grabs 
           hold of the metal handles and gets to work.

           *BOARDWALK: Jogger turns on a quiet street. Caleb tracks him

           leave frame... 40... 45... 50... 55... 

           *PATRIOT FITNESS: Caleb explores a new gym. New prey. He

           *FLEXION FITNESS SAUNA: Caleb closes off the entrance to the 
           sauna. Out of Order. So no one enters. He mops up blood 
           inside. Heaves the body into a laundry cart.
           *IRON MAX GYM: Caleb tans. Wears a small bright colored eye 
           protectors and speedo. He glows in the neon tanning bed.

           *BLUFF: Caleb breathes heavy. A run? A murder? Fireworks go 
           off in the distance. They flash and glow on his sweaty face 
           in a haunting manner. His body silhouetted by the fireworks.

           The music fades away. All that is left is Caleb’s breathing. 
           Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Accompanied by the friction 
           of metal weights in motion. All of which continue over...

           *TWO MUSCULAR BODIES FLOAT FACE DOWN IN A HOT TUB.

           *DEAD MAN’S FACE AND BROKEN FINGERS WITH A RING STICKING OUT 
           OF THE SAND. MAN WITH A METAL DETECTOR SICK AT HIS FIND.

           *CALEB TOSSES GARBAGE BAGS IN THE DUMPSTER BEHIND FLEXION.

           *BULLDOZERS PUSH SAND ON THE BEACH. BUILDING BERMS TO PROTECT 
           AGAINST STORMS. DUMPING SAND. THE OPERATOR SEES A DEAD BODY 
           MIXED IN AS IT GOES TUMBLING OUT.

           *BLUFF: Back to Caleb and the fireworks. He focuses as he 
           would before another set at the gym. Then he reaches toward 
           the ground. Grabs hold of something. Someone. Limp arms raise 
           into frame. He drags a body. Tosses it into a ditch. The 
           falling body eclipsing frame sending it to BLACK.

           Inhale. Exhale. Metal grinding. Colliding.

           Then the darkness rises up. Light seeps in. Sunny. Blurry. 
           Then the black lowers again. Blinking? No. The metal sounds 
           match the movement of the plunging darkness. It rises again. 
           A blurred figure lifts in the background. We are behind a 
           WEIGHT STACK on a BACK ROW MACHINE.

           ONE CONTINUOUS SHOT tracking from behind the weight stack 
           around it as the dark metal weight block goes up and down - 
           along a tight cable attached to metal hand grips - calloused 
           hands strangle them - along these hands to the arms - big, 
           ripped arms - along the shoulders - wide, defined muscles - 
           up to the face... Caleb? It takes a second. Caleb.

           Bigger. All muscle. Twenty pounds plus. No scruff on his 
           face. Clean shaven. Hair cut in a neat crew cut. The fade and 
           length creates appealing, clean lines like his muscles do. He 
           is tanned to a crisp perfection. His workout clothes more 
           fashionable. Every part of him is refined. Months of hard 
           work and multiple murders later, he is unrecognizable. 

           He is also lifting outside in the famous...
           EXT. MUSCLE BEACH - WEIGHT PEN - DAY

           He finishes the last, to failure, rep and drops the grips. 
           The metal block shoots down and clangs loud. The breathing 
           that carried us over the results of his violence stops.

           Caleb stands. A nice sweat going. His posture different. A 
           fresh swagger as he walks off the last set. People watch at 
           the perimeter fence. Not the biggest guy out there but he 
           exudes an intensity that shows he belongs.

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - GARAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT

           NIGHTLY NEWS plays on Caleb’s television. Half static. He 
           adjusts the antenna and finds the image. Caleb eats. The 
           field reporter is out reporting from the boardwalk.

                                 FIELD REPORTER
                        Authorities are actively searching 
                        for the serial killer residents of 
                        this colorful coastal community are 
                        calling the Venice Beach Butcher. 
                        Over several months this individual 
                        is responsible for four murders...

                                 CALEB
                             (insulted)
                        Four?

           The field reporter interviews LOCALS. Local #1 is a bartender 
           at a restaurant on the boardwalk.

                                 FIELD REPORTER
                        Are you concerned with what is 
                        going on? Do you feel safe?

           Caleb finishes off a hunk of meat and some veggies.

                                 VENICE LOCAL #1
                        I’m concerned. I also feel safe. 
                        Always something going down.

           Caleb cleans his dish. Local #2 is a spacey street artist.

                                 FIELD REPORTER
                        Do you stay off the boardwalk at 
                        night because of the murders?

                                 VENICE LOCAL #2
                        Murders?
           Caleb goes to the mini-fridge for milk. Local #3 is a wacky 
           old man in a suit jacket and bathing suit holding up a 
           cardboard cutout of RONALD REAGAN.

                                 VENICE LOCAL #3
                        Uncle Ronnie and I think it’s a 
                        symptom of trickle down genetics. 

                                 FIELD REPORTER
                        Trickle down... genetics?

                                 VENICE LOCAL #3
                        He got psycho DNA. 

           ON SCREEN: Police sketch of a suspect. It looks a lot like 
           Caleb back from one of his first kills.

                                 FIELD REPORTER
                        This is a new rendering made after 
                        an eye witness came forward with 
                        information about a man they saw 
                        the night of the first murder...

           Caleb looks nothing like the sketch now. His upgraded body 
           and attitude reflecting in the screen over the sketch.

                                 FIELD REPORTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        White male. Five foot nine. Thin. 
                        One hundred sixty five pounds.

           Caleb doesn’t recognize himself. He shakes his head then the 
           carton. All out. He drinks the last couple drops on the 
           unfolded lip of the carton.

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb enters the kitchen quietly through the back door. He 
           goes to the fridge. Finds a glass jug of milk. He gulps down 
           some of it. Wipes his mouth. Places the milk back in the 
           fridge. As he closes the door he hears something.

           Beat. A muffled moan. Maybe a scream. Coming from... above 
           him? Caleb follows the muffled outbursts of pain. 

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - STAIRWELL/UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

           He walks up the dark stairwell and to the second floor. A 
           door at the end of the landing is cracked open just barely. 

           A sharp line of light escaping the opening. Caleb approaches. 
           With each step the moans and screams grow. Aubrey in trouble? 
           No. It is the sound of a MAN in pain. Caleb gets to the door 
           and looks through the slim opening.

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The room looks empty. He adjusts his vantage point and then 
           he sees it. A man BALL GAGGED in the middle of the room. His 
           arms and feet bound with ROPE. He looks like he is in pain 
           but excited by this. Fear and lack of control arousing him.

           Aubrey crosses the frame. She circles the man. She is wearing 
           a BLACK LEATHER OUTFIT. Not revealing though. Not in the way 
           you would expect. Not meant to be. That would be too easy for 
           her submissive counterpart. Caleb backs off the door slightly 
           so he is not seen. Staying in the shadows. From behind, 
           Aubrey grabs the man by his throat. Grip tightening at a 
           calculated rate. Caleb watches. Rapt.

                                 AUBREY
                        Pathetic.

           The man shakes his head. Grunts. Aubrey leans in.

                                 AUBREY (CONT’D)
                        Shut up. You pitiful fuck. Not a 
                        sound. Not... a... sound.

           The man huffs - struggling to breathe under her tight hold. 
           Eyes watering. Face red. Loving it. Aubrey releases her grip. 
           Circles him. Caleb leans in - never having seen anything like 
           this. Not expecting this was how she spent her time with the 
           men he saw coming in and out of the house at night.

           Aubrey stops again. Her hand lowers slowly between his legs - 
           grabs hold. The man reels. This really hurts. Caleb realizes 
           Aubrey is looking at him. She feels him there. Caleb knows. 
           The bound man climaxes.

           EXT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - GARAGE APARTMENT - MORNING

           ANGLE. Caleb asleep from foot of the bed. A hand holding a 
           burning joint lowers into frame in the foreground. It raises 
           out of frame and we hear the drag. Caleb stirs. He looks. 
           Aubrey sits there staring at him, smoking her joint.

                                 AUBREY
                        Good morning.

           Long pause. Caleb caught off guard. She definitely saw him 
           last night. She doesn’t seem to mind. Maybe even a little 
           glad. Anticipating it.
                                 AUBREY (CONT’D)
                        Enjoy yourself, darling?

                                 CALEB

                                 AUBREY
                        I’d have told you all about it but 
                        you seemed preferential to privacy 
                        over knowledge. Men that see me... 
                        you’d be surprised the positions of 
                        power and respect some hold, since 
                        you’ve seen the positions they pay 
                        to be put in. Strip away that man, 
                        whatever he is at work, at home, 
                        with friends. Provider. Punisher. 
                        Protector. Tied down. Gagged. They 
                        become helpless, little perverts. I 
                        try on their power and make sure 
                        they hurt the right way. Not one 
                        the same. I get off. They get off. 
                        Everyone gets a spoonful of sugar.

           Aubrey slides closer on the bed - entering Caleb’s space.

                                 AUBREY (CONT’D)
                        Since you know what I do at night, 
                        do I get to hear how you spend some 
                        of yours? No? I see it. Resting 
                        their in the back of your sad blue 
                        eyes. Rage. All of it. Waiting to 
                        lash out. I know you.

           She takes a drag. Playing with him. Does she know? Caleb 
           gives her nothing. Blank. Aubrey grins. Enough for now. 

                                 AUBREY (CONT’D)
                        Okay. It’s early. You’re still 
                        waking up...

           Nothing with her means only what is said on face value. She 
           stands and leaves. Caleb flustered. A match. A superior.

           EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

           1984 FORMULA THUNDERBIRD 272 cuts through the ocean chop. 

           EXT. CHAUNCEY’S BOAT - CONTINUOUS

           ANGLE. Back of Caleb’s head as it jostles about. Caleb deep 
           in thought. His interaction with Aubrey affecting him. 
           Chauncey at the wheel. Oblivious. Having a blast. 
           EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER

           They drop anchor. Chauncey dives off the back of the boat. 
           Caleb follows in. The shore way off in the distance.

                                 CALEB
                        Why do they bulldoze the sand into 
                        mounds on the beach in the winter?

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        The berms? Since El Nino in ‘83 
                        almost sunk the place. They make 
                        barriers in case of a surge.

                                 CALEB
                        Stacking sand... Maybe it should go 
                        under. Flush out the excess.

           Chauncey changes the subject. Something brighter.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Got some news. I’m opening up my 
                        own spot. Gonna run my own gym. 
                        Saved up. Found a partner. Already 
                        scouting buildings in Santa Monica.

           Chauncey expecting a warm reaction. Caleb staring off - not 
           listening to Chauncey. His eyes dark. Distant.

                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT’D)
                        You hear me? Gonna have my own gym.

           Caleb looks. Switches moods and appears more engaged. It’s a 
           little unsettling and Chauncey can see it.

                                 CALEB
                        That’s amazing. Congratulations.

           Chauncey can’t ignore Caleb’s demeanor. Something he has 
           noticed before and needs to speak on.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        You know, you never told me what 
                        you’ve been doing. What you added 
                        to the routine. I know you wanted 
                        to do it clean...
                             (beat; leading)
                        You could tell me if you were on 
                        something. You know that, right? 
                        Shit’s dangerous if you don’t know 
                        what you’re doing. You don’t seem 
                        like yourself and as a friend I 
                        want to make sure you’re being 
                        smart. Thinking the long run.
           Caleb drinks in his surroundings. No one close. No one to 
           hear him or see his actions. Another chance to confess his 
           sins. An environment without risk.

                                 CALEB
                        You ever killed anything?

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Fine, you don’t want to tell me.

                                 CALEB
                        I used to work with animals. At a 
                        feedlot. Had to get them real big. 
                        Big as we could. Fed them non-stop. 
                        Even kept them from moving so they 
                        would grow faster. Ripe for the 
                        slaughterhouse. With that many 
                        crammed in cages some would get 
                        sick, you know? Hurt real bad. Had 
                        to put them down. Never felt a 
                        thing when it came to the animals. 
                        Killing a person... now that fills 
                        me. Each one makes me stronger. 
                        More able. I’ve been doing that.

           Chauncey disturbed but thinks Caleb is puffing his chest.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Yeah, alright.

                                 CALEB
                        I could kill you in this very 
                        moment. Wouldn't stand a chance. 
                        Pull you under. Maul you. Leave you 
                        as chum while I fish off the side 
                        of your stupid fucking boat.

           Chauncey takes pause. Gives Caleb a good hard stare. He sees 
           something raging inside Caleb but refuses to believe what he 
           is saying. Thinking it hyperbolic Neanderthal shit.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                             (pushing back)
                        Whoa, big man. A real killer, huh? 
                        Feel tough? You done?
                             (beat; concerned)
                        Whatever macho bullshit you’re on. 
                        Whatever you’re taking to keep you 
                        pushing this hard for results. I 
                        get it. I’m sure it feels good. I’m 
                        not gonna tell you to stop. But you 
                        better keep it in check. It’ll ruin 
                        you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT'D)
                        Seen plenty of guys go way too far 
                        and before they even knew they 
                        cracked, they crumbled.

           Chauncey turns his back on Caleb as he treads water. He lays 
           his head back and floats. Eyes closed. Caleb looking down at 
           him. How easy it would be to crush him from here.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHAUNCEY’S BOAT - LATER

           Caleb sits on the edge of the boat. Alone. A fishing rod in 
           hand. He stares out at the ocean. Long beat. Long enough for 
           us to think he did crush Chauncey.

           Then, Chauncey emerges from the cabin beneath the front of 
           the boat with a cigar. Safe and sound. He grabs his fishing 
           rod and sits down next to Caleb.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        He was lucky I didn’t have the 
                        urge. For that... I was rewarded.

           EXT. NAZAR KOZEL’S HOUSE - DUSK

           HEADLIGHTS guide our path as we roll up a long dirt driveway 
           to an amazing rustic house in the hills of Topanga Canyon. 
           Chauncey parks his car. Caleb and Chauncey get out - both 
           dressed nicer than usual. Eager for different reasons.

                                 CALEB
                        He lives here?

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Ukrainian bastard’s doing alright. 

           Some of the most amazing bodies - male and female - enter and 
           exit the house. The fitness scene. After hours.

                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT’D)
                        Damn. Doing everything right.

           INT. NAZAR KOZEL’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The house an open floor plan. Late seventies decor. Not 
           updated yet to fit its year. Filled with people partying.

                                 ROGER (O.S.)
                        Chauncey fucking Atlas!
           ROGER. 50. The least fit there but dressed the sharpest. 
           Somehow, the nice clothes still hang cheaply off his body. 
           Holding on tight as he can to looking young. Clear he has 
           money and spends it. Coke energy to spare.

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        There he is!

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Roger, how we doing?

           Roger gives him an enthusiastic hug and kiss on the cheek. 
           Chauncey takes in the house and party.

                                 CHAUNCEY (CONT’D)
                             (impressed)
                        This is...

                                 ROGER
                        I know. I know. I want to fucking 
                        kill myself. Immigrant story. Boy 
                        from nothing. Now he’s got this 
                        house and those muscles. Inspiring 
                        stuff. Kill me. Try not to think 
                        about it. That’s clearly what I’m 
                        not doing though.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Rog, meet Caleb. Young bodybuilder. 
                        Close to hitting the circuit.

                                 ROGER
                        Good to meet you, man.

                             (to Caleb)
                        He’s the partner I mentioned going 
                        in on the gym with me.

                                 ROGER
                        Gym? It’s not just a gym. This guy, 
                        he has ideas. We’re doing more than 
                        a fucking gym I hope.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        One step at a time. Roger is good 
                        friends with Kozel’s team.

                                 ROGER
                        I wear many hats. Friend. Investor. 
                        Parasite. Whatever snorts your 
                        coke. I’m here to be part of the 
                        muscle revolution and barely move a 
                        muscle.

                        This way. You gotta see this. C’mon 
                        you’ll love it. I sound like his

           EXT. NAZAR KOZEL’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           They head through super wide glass doors into the backyard. A 
           kidney shaped pool - lit up in the night. Filled with people. 
           His outdoor gym behind it. The yard full with big badass 
           weight lifting machines. His own Kachalka in California.

                        Not the fucking pool. Look...

           He steers Chauncey and Caleb toward a JAGUAR. Not the car. 
           The big, scary cat. The actual predator feline in a cage in 
           the yard. It walks in a circle - staring out at the party 
           guests. Someone throws in a raw steak for it to chew on.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        He’s got a... cheetah?

                                 CALEB
                        Jaguar.

                                 ROGER
                        Bingo.

           Caleb looks around the palatial yard while Roger and Chauncey 
           get sucked into another conversation. Caleb here for Nazar. 
           This could be Caleb’s chance to kill him but with this many 
           people it will be next to impossible to strike and get away 
           with it. Caleb wanders off. Observes party. Drugs everywhere.

           Caleb hears a burst of energy in the yard. He goes to take a 
           look. Nazar is in the middle of a STONE LIFTING contest. He 
           and another man stand on platforms lifting enormous stones. 
           People place bets. Many beers are involved. Nazar wins. Puts 
           down a mug of beer to hydrate. So many people all around him. 
           Caleb won’t have a shot at him now.

           INT. NAZAR KOZEL’S HOUSE - HALLWAY/BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb gets away from the party and the noise. He goes down 
           different halls of the house. He finds Nazar’s room. A wall 
           of trophies. He checks out each one. Envious.
           He takes a piss in Nazar’s toilet. He lays in Nazar’s bed. 
           Getting a feel for what his life is like in basic ways.

           Caleb feels increasingly like a pariah at this party when he 
           should want to fit in. Incapable. Too far gone into his 
           obsession. Not belonging.

           EXT. NAZAR KOZEL’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb finds Chauncey drinking with Roger. 

                                 CALEB
                        Hey, I’m leaving.

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Already? No. Stay. You gotta--

                                 CALEB
                        I’m tired. Getting up early to 
                        train anyway. I called a cab. 

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        Have some fun. Lighten up.

                                 CALEB
                        No, I--

                                 CHAUNCEY
                        You could use some--

                                 CALEB
                        I-- I’m going. I’m good.

           Caleb peels off. Not letting Chauncey try to convince him.

           EXT. NAZAR KOZEL’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb exits the front and walks down the driveway until no 
           one can see him. He does not leave the property - he slips 
           into the woods at the perimeter and heads towards the back.

           EXT. NAZAR KOZEL’S HOUSE - WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb finds a spot to settle. Where he can see the yard but 
           not be seen. As the party goes on and fades in the night so 
           does Caleb. He begins to doze off. Huddled in the woods.
           EXT. NAZAR KOZEL’S HOUSE - WOODS - MORNING

           Caleb asleep. Sitting up. Back against a tree. Birds sparsely 
           chirp. It is early. The sun rising. Soft. A low fog in the 
           woods and outdoor gym in the backyard.

           Caleb’s eyes slowly open. He looks at the house and yard. 
           Empty. No more party guests. He watches. Waits.

           EXT. NAZAR KOZEL’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Patio doors open. Nazar steps out. Shirtless. No shoes. Only 
           shorts. Finishes a glass of orange juice. Places it on the 
           table outside - still covered in empty bottles of booze. 

           Nazar always working. No time for hangovers like the rest of 
           his guests likely have today. Nazar fixes a WALKMAN to his 
           shorts and places the headphones on his ears as he sets out 
           into the low fog to his outdoor gym. Ready to go to work.

           EXT. NAZAR KOZEL’S HOUSE - WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb watches through the leaves as Nazar lays on a bench and 
           raises the dumbbells onto each thigh. Start position. Caleb 
           removes his shoes, shirt and pants. Ready to move and not 
           wanting to get snagged on something and make noise. Caleb 
           moves through the trees. Closer.

           EXT. NAZAR KOZEL’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           ANGLE. Caleb’s feet reach the trimmed grass of the yard. Each 
           step made with intense purpose. His stride incrementally 
           picking up speed as he gets closer to Nazar.

           Nazar lays back and starts doing dumbbell chest press. His 
           music blasting from his earphones. Caleb picks up a big 45lb 
           weight plate laying in the grass. Dragging it before swinging 
           it overhead. He gets right behind Nazar. Starts to bring the 
           weight down to smash Nazar’s head in. Nazar just barely sees 
           the weight as it lowers toward his head. He reacts. Rolls. 
           Drops the dumbbells. Falls off the bench. One of the 
           dumbbells knocks him on the back of the head.

           Caleb’s effort a glancing blow. Still, it does damage. Nazar 
           knocked wobbly. Caleb’s balance taken with the weight as he 
           misses - giving Nazar time to defend himself. He trips up 
           Caleb’s legs. The two wrestle on the ground. Nazar getting in 
           punches. Caleb taking serious hits to the face - to the ribs. 
           Caleb bites into Nazar’s shoulder. Nazar grunts. Throws Caleb 
           off him. They reposition. Grapple. Caleb attacks - looking to 
           open up the gash on Nazar’s head from the weights.

           Nazar grips Caleb’s arm and twists it. There’s an audible 
           rip. Tear in his shoulder. Nazar gets hold of the wire from 
           his headphones and wraps it around Caleb’s neck. Caleb gets a 
           few fingers between the wire and his neck. Nazar pulls tight. 
           Caleb’s finger tips look like they are going to get sliced 
           off from the pressure. Most would concede. This drives Caleb. 
           He swings furiously. Throws his head back into Nazar’s jaw. 
           The wire loosens. Caleb breaks free. They get to their feet. 

           Caleb tackles Nazar over the bench and onto the ground. Nazar 
           lands on the dumbbells below. He inhales aggressively like 
           he’s sucking in all his pain with the air and burying it.

           Caleb moves on him thinking he would be weaker. Instead Nazar 
           grabs hold and tosses Caleb to the ground. Gets on top of 
           him. More punches. Caleb is dazed. Nazar grabs the weight 
           plate and raises it to strike Caleb down.

           Nazar hesitates. Drops the weight. Face turns red. Stumbles. 
           Falls. Gasping. Body clenched. Caleb confused but thankful to 
           be alive. He realizes Nazar is having a massive HEART ATTACK. 

           Nazar clutches his chest as he lays stiff in the grass. Caleb 
           crawls up next to him. Nazar locks eyes with Caleb. He looks 
           scared. Eyes pleading.

                                 NAZAR
                        Why?

           This question landing harder than any punch could. Caleb in 
           shock. Unable to answer. Nazar grabs Caleb’s hand. Squeezes 
           it tight in his last moments. Forcing Caleb to feel his death 
           in a real way. In a human way. Nazar’s head falls back. Caleb 
           lays his head on Nazar’s chest. Barely a heartbeat... 
           ba......dum. Gone.

           Caleb robbed of killing the man destined to be the most 
           celebrated male body of the next decade in the sport and 
           beyond. His trophy kill. Caleb stands. He looks out at the 
           yard. At the caged jaguar. An animal never meant to be kept 
           in a cage. Caleb goes to the jaguar. Stares into the cage 
           with a deep sadness. He breaks open the lock with a weight 
           and backs away. Caleb walks to the trees. The jaguar pushes 
           the cage door open. Saunters over to Nazar’s body. Sniffs it.

           Later, a figure enters the yard. Stops. A WOMAN. She just 
           rolled out of bed, having stayed from the party with Nazar. 
           She sees the jaguar laying on top of his body. Paws extended. 
           Picking at his flesh. Noshing on its snack. 
           With its blood soaked snout the jaguar looks at the woman. 
           Some of Nazar’s flesh still in its mouth. She goes to SCREAM--

           JAGUAR ROARS.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SANTA MONICA BEACH - LATER

           Waves roll in and out. Caleb staggers into frame. His face 
           swollen. One eye shut. He cradles his shoulder and holds his 
           ribs. He walks along the beach. Slow and delirious like a 
           parched man wandering the desert. He slows. Vomits.

           SIRENS BLASTING. COP CARS. They speed past Caleb on the 
           Pacific Coast Highway going back toward Topanga Canyon.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - LATER

           Caleb makes his way along the boardwalk. He has been walking 
           for miles. All the way from the house. He is visibly shaken. 
           Each step growing more emotional.

           EXT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - LATER

           Caleb limps up to the house in the driveway. Aubrey in the 
           yard gardening. Caleb collapses. Aubrey hears him drop and 
           turns. She rushes over to him on the ground.

                                 AUBREY
                        Caleb? Caleb!?

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DUSK

           Caleb in the bath tub. Aubrey soaks a hand towel. 
           Affectionately places it on his forehead. She looks at his 
           hand resting on the side of the tub. Knuckles bruised. Dry 
           blood wedged deep under his fingernails. She scrubs them.

                                 AUBREY
                        You have to say it. It won’t scare 
                        me. If you say it I will help you. 
                        If you can’t... you have to go.

           Caleb looks his most vulnerable. Scared. A hurt little boy.

                                 AUBREY (CONT’D)
                        How many?

           He breaks down as she tends to him. Confession.
                                 CALEB
                        One today but... it was different. 
                        At least... eight in all? Not sure. 
                        Lately, my dreams have been so real 
                        it’s hard separating memory from 
                        fantasy. I wrote down every detail. 
                        Reading it back helps to remind me. 
                        It was never easy. 
                             (trailing off)
                        The amount of pressure it takes to 
                        crush life out of someone...

           Aubrey listens closely. She has power over him. As disturbing 
           and sobering an account as it is, she likes it. She knows how 
           dangerous he is. She feeds off of this as he fed off killing.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        They became part of me. Destroying 
                        those bodies helped give me mine. I 
                        believe that. I do.

           Caleb presses his knuckles against his head like he’s trying 
           to alleviate the terrible thoughts that bombard him.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        I thought someone would catch me. 
                        Force me to stop. No one ever came. 
                        No one. Natural order, I guess. I 
                        should stop. I know I need to stop. 
                        What I want is more. Always one 
                        more. One more rep. One more body. 
                        One more until I find out I can’t. 
                        That I went to failure.

           Caleb desperate. Unsure of what to do next. Unsure of how 
           Aubrey will ultimately respond. She strokes his hair. As 
           compassionate as she is, she is exacting her power. She is 
           pouncing like Caleb but in her own way.

           She cares for him but has her own cravings and like killing 
           for Caleb, being able to dominate and control a maniac is at 
           the top of her list and makes everything else feel like a 
           light breeze instead of a hurricane.

                                 AUBREY
                        You’re sick. You need someone to 
                        care for you. Someone to hurt you.

           Caleb looks into her eyes and does not see any judgement. He 
           cries. She has her own madness and it might perfectly manage 
           his ghastly impulses. Aubrey climbs into the tub. She holds 
           Caleb as she gently sings a lullaby version of JOAN BAEZ - 
           THERE BUT FOR FORTUNE.
                                 AUBREY (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        Show me the prison. Show me the 
                        jail. Show me the prisoner whose 
                        life has gone stale. And I’ll show 
                        you a young man with so many 
                        reasons why. There but for 
                        fortune... go you or I...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                        There... but for fortune... go 
                        you... or I...

                                                         HOLD IN BLACK.

                                                               FADE IN:

           ANGLE. Caleb’s face. Subdued. His wounds have healed. No sign 
           of the brutal death match with Nazar. Weeks later. Months. He 
           stands in front of a black backdrop.

           A FITNESS PHOTOGRAPHER takes photos. Body shots. He is in 
           competition trunks. Nothing else. Caleb does as instructed. 
           He is big. Even slightly bigger. More toned. Each photo makes 
           him more and more uncomfortable. The lens piercing.

           People pass behind her on the bike path. The boardwalk and 
           beach vibrant as ever. Like a postcard.

                                 FIELD REPORTER
                        His body was found lifeless in his 
                        backyard. Being eaten by a jaguar 
                        illegally owned by Mr. Kozel. An 
                        autopsy later determined the actual 
                        cause of death to be a massive 
                        heart attack suffered minutes 
                        earlier. Toxicology reports show an 
                        incredibly high amount of steroids 
                        in his system. Doctors say the 
                        drugs paired with his strenuous 
                        lifting ironically weakened the 
                        most important muscle: his heart. 
                        It is still unclear how the jaguar 
                        got free from its cage...

           A familiar looking man goes jogging behind the reporter 
           during the newscast. Blink and you miss it. Caleb...

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - BOARDWALK - CONTINUOUS

           Panning off the reporter and camera team and staying with 
           Caleb as he runs down the beach. The sound of the reporter 
           fading as he leaves her behind. He looks healthy and bored.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        Chauncey was right. Gaining sure 
                        beats the hell out of maintaining.

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - GARAGE APARTMENT - DAY

           ANGLE. Wall covered in bodybuilder images. Pushing in until 
           we land on the ones Caleb got taken of himself. Now part of 
           the collage. A massive man like the rest.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Caleb injects a small dose of steroids very carefully. He 
           ties his sneakers and readies to go lift.
                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        I take a minor dosage of steroids. 
                        Helped me heal and also reverses 
                        catabolic effect. A temporary fix. 
                        Until I can manage on my own again.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Caleb leans on a cable machine between sets. He stares 
           despondently. We realize this is not at Flexion now. 
           Suddenly, we are in a different gym.

           PULL BACK to see lockers randomly in the middle of the room. 
           The other men on lifting machines wearing identical outfits 
           to Caleb. White tank tops with a lame logo in the center and 
           either red or blue shorts. BELL RINGS. 

           PULL BACK further to reveal CREW MEMBERS. An AD and 
           PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS move around the gym. A FAKE GYM.

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE - FITNESS SET - DAY

           A set for an aerobics/exercise video. The gym portion only 
           part of a bigger set. The randomly placed lockers fake. 

           A giant wall of neon lights and patterns. A stage in the 
           center. Multiple camera setup.

                                 ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                        My background bodies, listen up! 
                        Doing this one for real so as soon 
                        as you hear playback start working 
                        out. Don’t stop lifting. Don’t stop 
                        smiling. Remember, we fucking love 
                        working out! It’s the best!
                             (to production assistant)
                        Aerobics team in place?
                             (beat)
                        Clear the floor. Everyone settle!
                             (beat)
                        Playback...

           Insanely catchy eighties pop music echoes from the speakers. 
           Its rhythm so upbeat it’s hard not to move to it. Caleb 
           starts to lift. So do the other men on the gym set.

                                 ASSISTANT DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        Cameras...

           The cameras start their movements. Focusing in on different 
           parts of the set. Slow pulling zooms.
                                 DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        Action!

           Out from behind the set runs a team of primary color spandex 
           wearing AEROBICS PERFORMERS. They come dancing out to the 
           rhythm of the music. Huge fake smiles on their faces. 
           Bouncing around like idiots. Caleb and the other men on 
           machines behind them. Nothing more than set dressing. 
           Background muscle to fill the space.

           The aerobics team performs choreographed dances - sometimes 
           coming up near Caleb. He looks sick to his stomach as they 
           dance and flex and smile. So sugar sweet. So obnoxious. The 
           bouncy music distorting as Caleb grows more sickened by the 
           whole production. Lights whirl. Strobe. 

           Caleb doing everything he can to hold it together. He would 
           love to jump off his machine and pound on every one of them. 
           He is a reformed man though. Enduring this hellscape a test. 

           ANGLE. Monitor. Push in past all the dancers and extremely 
           tight on Caleb as he works out on his fake machine.

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE - BATHROOM - LATER

           Caleb hunched in a stall. He looks ill. Fighting off terrible 
           thoughts. Feeling weak. Sweaty. Pale. He hears a few of the 
           male aerobics performers pass the stall doors. Watches their 
           sneakers and calf muscles go by. Longing to snap one in half. 

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           PRODUCTION ASSISTANT pays Caleb for his work. His body making 
           him money in a different way than grueling manual labor. A 
           much less honest way in Caleb’s mind. Better pay.

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Aubrey fills a glass with water at the sink. Caleb enters. He 
           looks drained. Languishing from the experience.

                                 AUBREY
                        How was it?

           No answer. Aubrey looks - sees he is on edge. Aubrey puts 
           down her glass. Walks to Caleb. Gets close. A proposition.

                                 AUBREY (CONT’D)
                        My worst? So long as I don’t scar.
                                 CALEB
                        Please.

           ANGLE. Aubrey’s hand grabs hold of Caleb’s with care.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           ANGLE. Caleb’s hands contorted. Bound. Extremely tight. 

           Caleb naked. On his knees. Arms yanked behind his ankles. 
           Ankles tied and connected to wrist restraints. Moving one 
           limb hurts the other. Aubrey forces his head back. Covers it 
           with a clear plastic hood. Suffocating. 

           Caleb’s restraints and positioning make it more excruciating, 
           or wonderful, depending on your outlook. His breathing 
           desperate. His efforts for air weakening. Barely there. 
           Consciousness drifting. Drifting...

           Aubrey rips the hood off his head. He gasps. Chokes on air. 
           In so much pain. In love with it. Medicine. Aubrey plants her 
           foot on his head. Compressing it into the ground. The best 
           pain. Cathartic. Atonement and ecstasy all at once. 
           Helplessness is dizzying for Caleb.

                                 AUBREY
                        You think you’re a monster? You’re 
                        a boy throwing a fit. Looking for 
                        attention. A boy throwing a fit!

           She pushes off his head with her foot. Caleb finally catching 
           his breath. WHACK. She inflicts more pain in a different part 
           of his body. Both enjoying this. Both getting their fix. 
           Getting adjusted. Gaining some sort of balance. Deriving 
           pleasure as well. Mutually beneficial.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        She is able to sense my foul self 
                        plotting carnage before I even can. 

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - DAY

           Caleb lifts. More robotic. He seems laser focused but in a 
           different way. A less violent intensity. Tame.

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Caleb’s arms tied up from above. He hangs their uncomfortably 
           and satisfied. Body splotched red from long sessions of hurt.
                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        Hours. Sometimes days at a time. 
                        She keeps me away until it is safe.

           Aubrey comes in with food. Feeds him. Leaves him there.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - DAY

           Caleb and Aubrey sunbathe. Aubrey applies sunscreen to 
           Caleb’s back. They are surrounded by people. Blending in.

           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - DAY

           Caleb gives someone a spot on bench. Hands following the bar 
           as the man gets through his set. Caleb zones out as he stares 
           at the bar moving up and down. Suddenly, he is holding the 
           bar down on the man’s neck. Not letting up. Choking him. 
           Throat crushing. Eyes about to pop out of his fucking face.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Caleb blinks - back to reality. His mind succumbing to his 
           desires. Caleb is not crushing the man to death but he does 
           need help finishing the last rep. Caleb lifts the bar.

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Caleb and Aubrey naked in bed. Aubrey on top of Caleb. He 
           tells her something - we don’t hear it. By the look on his 
           face it is emotionally draining. Intense. Scary.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        I tell her all my ugly thoughts.

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Aubrey dominating another man. Not Caleb. She blindfolds the 
           restrained man. Then Aubrey walks to the door and quietly 
           opens it. Caleb enters. She slowly walks him over to the man. 
           Looks at Caleb. Go ahead. Caleb puts his hand around the 
           man’s throat. Squeezes. Aubrey allowing it. Man unaware.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        She finds ways to relieve them.

           Caleb keeps squeezing. Not letting go. A taste of killing 
           again. For a moment it is there. He should let go. Holding on 
           a little too long. Aubrey steps in front of him and locks 
           eyes. Caleb loosens his grip. 
           INT. FLEXION FITNESS - DAY

           Caleb does triceps rope pull downs. Each hand squeezing the 
           rope tight. Caleb’s face angry. He yanks down on the rope. 
           Strangling it. Thinking of the man’s neck. Seems to help. 
           System working. Great set. Caleb steps in front of the 
           mirror. Flexes. Hits poses. Barry behind him. Proud.

                                 BARRY
                        About time to show it off.

           Barry gives him a pat on the back. The blessing to compete.

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           A fire flickers on Caleb’s face. Aubrey sitting nearby - she 
           reads from his journal. Every detail.

                                 CALEB (V.O.)
                        Only she knows what I really am. To 
                        everyone else, I’m everyone else.

           She finishes reading - places it in the fire. The pages burn. 
           The document of his evil gone. Proof in his own words gone.

           INT. AUBREY’S HOUSE - GARAGE APARTMENT - BATHROOM - MORNING

           Caleb shaves his entire body with a razor. A sheering before 
           the show. He makes sure his skin is clean and smooth. Muscles 
           exposed as much as possible. Aubrey enters and helps shave 
           areas he can’t. She wipes away leftover shaving cream. Kisses 
           him on the shoulder. They stare at each other in the mirror.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGING ROOM - DAY

           BEAM SCALE - centered in the room. An EVENT OFFICIAL stands 
           behind it with a clipboard. The room feels very clinical and 
           procedural like cattle being herded.

                                 EVENT OFFICIAL
                        Step forward.

           A bodybuilder steps up and shakes out as he places one foot 
           after the other onto the scale. The judge nudges the weight 
           marker until it levels. Writes down the weight. 

                                 EVENT OFFICIAL (CONT’D)

           He hands the bodybuilder a number to be affixed to his 
           competition trunks. The bodybuilder steps off. Next.
                                 EVENT OFFICIAL (CONT’D)
                        Step forward.
                             (weighing)

           The bodybuilder get his number. Steps off.

                                 EVENT OFFICIAL (CONT’D)
                        Step forward.

           Caleb steps up. Weight marker moves.

                                 EVENT OFFICIAL (CONT’D)

           INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE - LATER

           PRE-JUDGING. Bodybuilders on stage. House lights on. Not 
           dramatic like it would be for the main event. Auditorium 
           empty except for the judges. Silence in the room casts a 
           strange air of soullessness. Judges inspect bodies. Poses 
           held for an awkward amount of time. Judges request the 
           bodybuilders move on to a new pose.

           Caleb off. His body looks great. His confidence and ferocity 
           hampered. Very self-aware. Only presenting part of himself. 
           Feels inauthentic. Chips at him. Stirs volatile emotions.

                                 EVENT OFFICIAL #2
                        That completes the pre-judging 
                        stage. Main judging for tonight’s 
                        show will begin in four hours. Make 
                        sure you check-in when you return. 
                        Thank you all. Good luck.

           The bodybuilders walk off stage. Some socialize. Take in the 
           auditorium. Caleb heads over to Barry in the wings. He puts 
           on his shirt and sweatpants to keep the muscles warm.

                                 BARRY
                        If you’re not gonna use any tanner 
                        for main judging then go get in a 
                        last minute sunbake. I’ll meet you 
                        back here in a couple hours. Get 
                        you oiled and stretched.

           EXT. VENICE BEACH - LATER

           Caleb tans. Tiny bright colored tanning goggles protecting 
           his eyes. He rotates carefully. Giving every inch its time. A 
           frisbee skitters up to Caleb in the sand. He removes the 
           small goggles - sees the frisbee. Picks it up.
                                 IRENE (O.S.)
                        Ah, sorry!

           Caleb knows that voice. He looks up as a woman jogs over to 
           retrieve the frisbee. Irene. Caleb hides his surprise well. 
           Waiting for her to see him. She grabs the frisbee. Looks 
           Caleb right in the eyes. She does not recognize him.

                                 IRENE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.

           No acknowledgement of who he is. Caleb transformed in ways 
           she can’t imagine. His eyes not the same as when they met. 
           She just sees a stranger on the beach lending a hand. 

           Irene jogs back to her friends. Tosses the frisbee back to a 
           guy. He looks similar to Caleb’s old self. Average. Not some 
           enormous specimen. Irene runs up to the guy and kisses him. 
           Cooler full of drinks. Towels out. Music playing. Perfect 
           beach day. Normal. Something Caleb can’t have. Something he 
           doesn’t want. Caleb goes back to tanning. No lingering 
           affect. She is from another life. As real as a dream.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - DRESSING ROOM - LATER

           Bodybuilders get in a pump before the show. Posing in the 
           mirrored wall. Oiling up. Re-applying bronzer. Images that 
           remind us of the very beginning of this story. However, this 
           is not accompanied by Chopin’s Nocturne. No music. Far less 
           romantic and big feeling. Barry applies oil. Caleb lifts 
           light weights to get the blood pumping.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - WINGS - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb stands lined up with all the other men. Each one trying 
           to get a look at the crowd and ANNOUNCER on stage. The crowd 
           cheering already. The bodybuilders can sniff the buzz of the 
           room and competition that awaits.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        A lot of exciting athletes and 
                        physiques to see tonight. Some 
                        making their official debut. We 
                        also have a very special guest here 
                        to present the winner his award. An 
                        all-time great. Got his start at 
                        muscle beach...
                             (beat)
                        Luca... Leone!
           The crowd gets loud. Caleb angles to get a better look of the 
           stage - excited to see if Luca is out there. Or going out 
           there. He looks over his shoulder - where is he?

                                 ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
                        First, let’s meet our competitors!

           The bodybuilders start filing onto the stage.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE - NIGHT

           The men line up. Caleb mixed into the middle of the row of 
           eight men. They all strike unique poses - showing off their 
           personality. Jockeying for space.

                                 JUDGE
                        Please stand facing judges. Hands 
                        at your sides.

           They square up. Get serious. Ready position. SYMMETRY ROUND. 
           The men flex the entirety of the round. Judges take notes - 
           eyeing very specific details of the symmetry of the muscles. 

                                 JUDGE (CONT’D)
                        Quarter turn to the right.

           The bodybuilders turn to the right until their sides now face 
           the judges. Still flexed. Judges write.

                                 JUDGE (CONT’D)
                        Quarter turn to the right.

           Bodybuilders again turn. Now their backs to the judges. The 
           men all intensely focused. Flexing this long and being aware 
           of every little muscle you display and in as perfect symmetry 
           as possible is grueling.

                                 JUDGE (CONT’D)
                        Quarter turn to the right.

           Other side of the body. Beat.

                                 JUDGE (CONT’D)
                        Quarter turn to the right.

           The men face the judges again. Holding tight.

                                 JUDGE (CONT’D)
                        Two and three. Step forward.

           Bodybuilders with numbers two and three affixed to their 
           trunks step up. Prepare to pose. COMPULSORY ROUND. 
           Competitors will strike seven poses.
                                 JUDGE (CONT’D)
                        Front Double Biceps.
                             (beat; posing; judging)
                        Front Lat Spread.
                             (beat; posing; judging)
                        Side Chest.
                             (beat; posing; judging)
                        Side Triceps.
                             (beat; posing; judging)
                        Back Double Biceps.
                             (beat; posing; judging)
                        Back Lat Spread.
                             (beat; posing; judging)
                        Abdominal and Thighs.

           The two men strike their poses. Caleb watches from behind 
           them. He takes in the judges. How they examine the men.

           Caleb looks into the crowd. He sees Aubrey. He sees Chauncey. 
           He sees Barry. All seated separately. Then the rest of the 
           crowd. So many eyes. He feels them all. A barrage of intense 
           thoughts start to attack Caleb.

                                 JUDGE (CONT’D)
                        Four and six. Step forward.

           Two and three step back. Number six steps forward. Caleb 
           realizes he is number four. He picks up his step to get even 
           with the other bodybuilder. They take their marks. Ready. The 
           judges again go through the seven poses. Caleb hitting them 
           strong and methodically. His competitor acts macho and 
           overdoes each pose. Distracting Caleb.

           Caleb's stoic face winces. Beat. Next pose. Winces again. 
           Muscles under his pectoral - over his ribs - twitch. CRAMP. 
           Then his calf muscles cramp. Caleb in serious pain. His pose 
           shaky. Abs loosen as he tries to manage his cramping.

           He goes to adjust his footing and his toes curl painfully 
           from cramping. He can barely hit the next pose. Falling apart 
           - craving what has always kept him feeling strong. The phase 
           ends. Bodybuilders walk off stage. Caleb’s legs lock up as he 
           walks. Toes curling in terrible directions. Head lowered.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb sits on a stool. Barry rubs out his calf muscle. Caleb 
           stretches his mid-section to extend the rib cage.

                                 CALEB
                        Fuck. I can’t stop cramping. I can 
                        barely move without ceasing up.
                                 BARRY
                        Relax. If you stress so do the 
                        muscles. Stay loose up there.

           Barry taps his temple. Signaling to Caleb to keep his head on 
           straight. Barry flattens Caleb's cramped toes. Excruciating. 
           His body rejecting him. In withdrawal. Contest assaulting his 
           senses. Body built on broken backs of men he murdered.

                                 BARRY (CONT’D)
                        You’re the tail end of individual 
                        posing. You got some time. Hit the 
                        showers. Keep the hot water running 
                        on you as long as you can.

           Barry helps Caleb to his feet.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           First bodybuilder for individual posing does his routine. 
           Good but stilted performance. Practiced. Predictable.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb naked on the floor of the showers - water runs over his 
           body. He looks weak. Legs tangled - limp like a newborn fawn. 
           Similar to our introduction to Caleb on the beach. Now weak 
           in a new body. Caleb not able to carry the form he has 
           created without the proper sustenance. 

           INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Another competitor on stage. More energy. More rhythm and 
           dance elements. Nothing exciting or dangerous. Nothing that 
           makes the jaw drop. Big. Defined. Rehearsed.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Caleb dries off gingerly to avoid cramping. He puts on his 
           competition trunks and takes a deep breath.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb exits the bathroom. Head down. Lost. He can hear the 
           crowd cheering. He can feel his heart beating. His body weak 
           and suppressed. Then, suddenly he hears his idol Luca Leone 
           down the hall in the opposite direction of the stage. Luca 
           signs an autograph for a fan. Caleb watches. Adoration and 
           hunger in his eyes. Luca enters his dressing room. 
           Caleb looks back toward the stage. A couple minutes before he 
           is due to go on. Caleb fighting an urge. He should go to the 
           staging area. Instead, he turns his attention back toward 
           Luca Leone's dressing room. Evil in his eyes again.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           One competitor leaves stage as another comes on - judges 
           write vigorously. Final notes for one performer. First 
           impressions for the next. New posing routine begins.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           KNOCK - KNOCK - KNOCK.

                                 LUCA LEONE (O.S.)
                        Yeah, come in.

           The door opens. Caleb sticks his head in. Luca relaxing, 
           seated in a chair. Waiting to announce final results.

                                 CALEB
                        Excuse me, sir. I wanted to, uh, 
                        introduce myself. I’m Caleb. I’m 
                        competing tonight.

                                 LUCA LEONE
                        I can tell.

           Luca gestures to his trunks and number. He stands.

                                 CALEB
                        It’s my first time on stage and I 
                        gotta say you are the reason I got 
                        into lifting. A true legend.

                                 LUCA LEONE
                        Oh, well, thank you. That’s nice to 
                        hear. Much appreciated.

           Long uncomfortable pause.

                                 LUCA LEONE (CONT’D)
                        Nervous?

                                 CALEB
                        I... don’t feel like myself.

                                 LUCA LEONE
                        Want some advice? Don’t hold 
                        anything back. Show them who you 
                        really are. All of you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LUCA LEONE (CONT'D)
                        Let ‘em really see you. What you’re 
                        made of. Not just your muscles.

           This triggers something in Caleb. He knows now what he must 
           do. Luca extends his hand. Caleb shakes. The firm clasp like 
           a conduit for Luca Leone’s strength. Caleb can’t resist it 
           now. He will take Luca’s advice. Luca goes to remove his 
           hand. Caleb won’t let go. His grip tight and unrelenting. 
           Luca gives him a look to let up.

                                 LUCA LEONE (CONT’D)
                        Alright now... Hey...

           Caleb’s eyes like a shark. Cold. Dead. He squeezes harder. 
           Luca’s hand going pale as the blood leaves the fingers.

                                 LUCA LEONE (CONT’D)
                        Let go. Come on. Let go.

           Luca pulls back. Caleb puts his other hand on the back of 
           Luca’s neck. Holding him in place. Nowhere for him to go.

                                 LUCA LEONE (CONT’D)
                        What are you--

           Caleb brings Luca in close. His hold on his neck and hand 
           impossible to break from. Luca pushing back. Concerned now.

                                 CALEB
                             (sincerely; calmly)
                        Thank you.

           Caleb releases the handshake and elbows Luca in the eye. 
           Crushing his orbital bone. A cut opens immediately. Luca’s 
           blood flows. Caleb sees the red and his fury grows. Excited. 
           Luca tries to defend himself but the shock of the situation 
           overwhelming. He is stunned and Caleb is a monster.

           Caleb strays his efforts and slams him into the mirror. Part 
           of the glass breaks - pieces of glass go flying onto the 
           counter below. In the shards of glass we see them fight. 
           Caleb is rabid. Each unique piece of shattered glass 
           providing a different angle and perspective.

           Caleb’s hand reaches for the piece of glass our eyes are most 
           focused on - a somewhat clear view of the brawl - a sharp 
           weapon. Caleb swiftly grabs it and thrusts it at Luca.

           ANGLE. Pieces of glass on the counter. Too obscure for us to 
           see - not letting us drink in the result of this violent act. 
           Light refractions - muscles - blurred animalistic figures 
           entangles. A fatal blow heard but barely seen. 

           BLOOD SPRAYS ONTO THE COUNTER AND THE BROKEN GLASS.
           Gurgling breaths. Blood filling Luca’s throat and leaving it 
           all at once. Flowing. Lasting. A horrifying sound.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - STAGING AREA - CONTINUOUS

           A STAGEHAND watches in the wings as the bodybuilder on stage 
           nears the end of his routine. She looks at her clipboard and 
           then her surroundings. Someone missing. She searches through 
           the other bodybuilders and spectators backstage.

                                 STAGEHAND
                        Contestant four. Cole. Caleb. Up 
                        next. Contestant four. Cole...

           INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb is drenched in blood. Face covered. He looks relaxed. 
           At peace. He sees himself in the broken mirror. The cracks 
           distorting his face and body. He steps to the side to look at 
           himself in an unbroken piece. There he is. A blood soaked 
           killer. He stares for a beat.

           He starts to massage the blood into his skin like bronzer. A 
           different kind of rich paste. Smooth. Skin a shade darker. 
           The blood drying as he rubs it in. Taking on a rusty hue. In 
           certain lighting and from a distance you would not think he 
           drained a human and lathered himself in it. 

           You would think it was in fact bronzer. The idea of it being 
           blood so unnatural your mind not allowing itself to consider 
           it a reality. His muscles look better than they ever have. 
           Blood in all the grooves. Caleb’s stare unimaginable. Sick.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The stagehand pokes her head into rooms as she goes down the 
           hall. Caleb opens the door to the dressing room. Steps out. 
           She spots him down the long hall. The lighting dim enough 
           that all she sees and cares about is that she found him.

                                 STAGEHAND
                        Contestant four? Caleb Cole? You’re 
                        up next. You good to go?

           Caleb does not respond or move for a beat. The stagehand 
           waits. Caleb looks up. Suddenly present. Lucid. Smiles.

                                 CALEB
                        Ready.
           The stagehand walks back toward the staging area. Caleb 
           follows down the hall. In a state of bliss. Free from 
           himself. From his torment. Ready for his debut.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - STAGING AREA - CONTINUOUS

           The bodybuilder before Caleb walks off stage to decent 
           applause. The stagehand looks to the platform behind the 
           stage where Caleb stands in the dark. Waiting.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Your final competitor: Caleb Cole!

           The stagehand gives Caleb a thumbs up.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The lights low - backlit in RED. Caleb rises on a platform to 
           stage level. It comes to a stop. Body silhouetted. Shoulders 
           raise and lower with each breath. The lights behind him lower 
           to black and the front lights brighten. He steps out from the 
           shadows. It is quiet. Do they know? Do they all know he is 
           covered in the blood of a slaughtered man?

           MUSIC UP - AUDITORIUM SPEAKERS: ORCHESTRAL. BOLD. SWEEPING.

           Sharp ears will notice this music is the score in the Luca 
           Leone film Caleb had playing on his television. A heroic 
           theme he does not deserve but one he claims. This all feels 
           surreal. Caleb looks out at the crowd. The judges. A sea of 
           mostly undefinable human shapes in shadows from his vantage.

           His muscles pumped. His killer instinct firing. It is as if 
           he has grown three inches and put on another ten pounds of 
           muscle from the walk to the stage. He begins his routine. 
           Hits his poses with fluidity unmatched by his competitors. 
           With an intensity that is captivating. Caleb plays to the 
           crowd. Calling on them to cheer - feast their eyes. His 
           tongue out. He hollers. Guttural.

           The audience feels his energy. Exactly what Chauncey 
           explained. That primal reaction. The people don’t know what 
           exactly it is but he is presenting them with what they came 
           for: a show. Caleb finally seen. True self unveiled. A beast. 

           Aubrey watches - eyes glassy - proud and afraid for Caleb. 
           She recognizes what everyone else does not yet. Barry coaches 
           from near the stage. Oblivious. Only focused on the muscles. 
           The sport. Chauncey claps. Then... a hesitation. Recalling 
           what Caleb said to him in the water. Grappling with it as he 
           witnesses Caleb on stage. New pose. Cheering. New pose. 
           Screams of excitement. Momentous. Acceptance. Praise.
           The blood on Caleb begins to run under the hot lights but the 
           crowd continues to cheer. Not focused on what Caleb has done 
           to give them this body. Not aware they rally support for a 
           killer. Not aware they should be screaming in horror. Caleb 
           strikes his final pose. Muscles and veins blast like they are 
           trying to escape from under the skin. He smiles ear to ear.

           MUSIC SOARS. Camera floats up over Caleb transcendentally. 
           Leaves only a view of the audience staring back at us. 
           Uproarious applause and flashing lights.

           Suddenly, during his bravado moment there is a faint SHRILL 
           SCREAM. Rooted in terror. It quickly blends back in with the 
           cheers as though it never happened. As though no one cares.

                                         THE END.
