           FADE IN ON...

           The night sky. Through the tree-tops, an infinity of stars.

           One twinkling star appears to GROW. It TWISTS and EXPANDS, 
           tearing a hole in space itself.

           This RIP soon stretches across the Milky Way, its outline 
           emitting an otherworldly glow, reflecting more colors than 
           we've ever known in the universe. But within it: unrelenting 
           BLACKNESS. Noticeably darker than the sky that surrounds it.

           A dissonant SCORE builds...

           From quiet... 

           To loud...

           AND THEN LOUDER. It's disconcerting. It's uncomfortable. And 
           then, with a violent crescendo, the music cuts out as we --

                                                          SMASH TO:

           A NEWS VAN DOOR SLAMMING SHUT.

           A CAMERA GUY, 50s, lugs a TV CAMERA away from the van and 
           down a dirt road AT THE EDGE OF A CORNFIELD at night. An 
           INTERN, early 20s, wrangles cable, scrambling to keep up. 

           SUPER: 13 YEARS LATER. PRESENT DAY

           They pass CAR after CAR parked on the roadside, where 
           GAWKERS stare up at the Rip. Many are in costume -- alien 
           masks, tin foil hats, etc. A WOMAN dressed like a monk 
           CHANTS as WORSHIPPERS raise their arms in prayer.

                                 CAMERA GUY
                                 (
                                  shaking his head
                                                 )
                        Rippers. Buncha nut jobs.

                                 INTERN
                        They come out here every year?

                                 CAMERA GUY
                        Used to be a lot more of 'em. 

           They arrive at a temporary media village set up next to the 
           cornfield. REPORTERS and CREW mill about.

                                 INTERN
                        Tell you the truth, I was too young. 
                        Don't remember what it was like. 
                                 CAMERA GUY
                        Felt like the end of the world.

                                                            CUT TO:

           A REPORTER, 40S. MINUTES LATER. 

           We're looking at her through the TV CAMERA as she checks her 
           perfect hair in a compact mirror. The Intern hands her a 
           bottle of sparkling water, then steps out of frame.

                                 CAMERA GUY (O.S.)
                        Half-step to your left.

           She slides over and the Rip becomes visible, even larger now 
           and ever present in the sky like a second moon. She puts the 
           water down and nods. Ready.

                                 CAMERA GUY (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        OK, you're on in 5...4...3...

           Quickly affecting a practiced on-air posture and smile --

                                 REPORTER 
                        For thirteen years, the world's biggest 
                        mystery has remained unsolved. Yes, 
                        today marks another anniversary of the 
                        day the Rip first appeared in the sky.

           We TRACK through the media village, first passing a BRITISH 
           REPORTER, addressing the BBC audience...

                                 BRITISH REPORTER 
                        As the Rip grew larger, this cornfield 
                        in Mill Grove, Missouri, was struck by 
                        an unprecedented category 5 hurricane.  

           ... then a CHINESE REPORTER (in Chinese, with subtitles)...

                                 CHINESE REPORTER 
                        It was the first hurricane in the 
                        history of this American state. And 
                        the first of many anomalies caused by 
                        the Rip.   

           ... then a SPANISH REPORTER (in Spanish, with subtitles)... 

                                 SPANISH REPORTER
                        Scientists had no explanation for these 
                        anomalies, many of which violated known 
                        laws of physics.
           ... then a SOUTH AFRICAN REPORTER, speaking in English...

                                 SOUTH AFRICAN REPORTER
                        And then, a few years after it 
                        appeared, the Rip stopped growing and 
                        the anomalies ceased at once. 

           ... and finally we return to the original reporter...

                                 REPORTER
                        For more than a decade, the world has 
                        waited, wondering if these mysterious 
                        events would ever resume.

           ... only now the image morphs into a TV SCREEN. 

                                 REPORTER (TV)
                        In the meantime, the post-Rip world 
                        has tried to move on... 

           PULL BACK from the TV. We're in a cozy LIVING ROOM.

                                 REPORTER (TV) (cont'd)
                        Except for once a year...

           PULL BACK to reveal an OLD WOMAN, 70s, watching from her La-
           Z-Boy. We keep PULLING BACK, past her...

                                 REPORTER (TV) (cont'd)
                        When onlookers flock to this spot to 
                        mark the anniversary of our planet's 
                        strangest visitor. 

           PULL BACK through the living room WINDOW as the Old Woman 
           turns off the TV and gets up. We're now OUTSIDE.  

           As we keep PULLING BACK, we see her RUSTIC HOUSE surrounded 
           by thick woods. Visible in the sky above: the Rip. 

           The front door opens. The Old Woman steps out. 

           REVERSE to reveal a pair of BINOCULARS, but it's too dark to 
           see who's holding them. From O.S., we hear a CAR drive off. 

           The glass is lowered, and we see a pair of EYES in the 
           darkness, reflecting the light from the Rip. One of the eyes 
           is BROWN, the other an eerie CRYSTAL BLUE.

                              TITLE: THE MAN IN THE WOODS
           EXT. RUSTIC HOUSE. BACKDOOR. A MINUTE LATER.

           Note: through the following sequence, we will never get a 
           good look at the Man, only seeing him in shadow.

           THE MAN uses a homemade tension wrench (paper clip, bobby 
           pin + a pair of pliers) to unlock the door. 

           SUPER: EAST MILLINOCKET, MAINE

           He accidentally chips the door frame. Unzips his bag, opens 
           a small BOX to reveal tiny homemade canisters of PAINT, each 
           with a corresponding ADDRESS. He picks one and, using a fine 
           brush, paints over the wood. Blows it dry. A perfect match.

           Satisfied, he pushes on the door, and it creaks open.

           INT. ENTRY HALL. RUSTIC HOUSE. LATER.

           As the Man walks, we hear a soft WHOOSH with each step. 

           CAMERA LOWERS to reveal that he's tied PLASTIC BAGS around 
           his shoes. Not leaving any tracks.

           He opens a cabinet, pulls out a pack of BATTERIES, but only 
           removes ONE before returning the pack. Reaches for a PILE of 
           PAPER CLIPS, counts out FOUR.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. RUSTIC HOUSE. LATER.

           The Man scans the books, running his fingers past the bible 
           and other literary classics before settling on a Danielle 
           Steele bodice ripper: Matters of the Heart. He grabs it. 

           Next, the Man rummages through a discarded pile of 
           newspapers, skimming headlines.

           IN THE PANTRY

           The Man scoops a small handful of cereal (high fiber) and 
           puts it in a Ziploc baggie. Then he stops when he sees:

           A FIVE-POUND JAR OF PEANUT BUTTER

           Stares at it like it's the Holy Grail. Checks the lid -- 
           it's been opened. Pulls out a Swiss-army-knife, digs out a 
           clump. Takes a bite, closing his eyes in absolute bliss. 
           EXT. WOODS. NIGHT.

           The hemlock, maple and elm trees are so dense it's almost 
           jungle-like, but the Man navigates the forest with the ease 
           that can only come from years of experience.

           He steps on rocks whenever possible, covering his tracks as 
           he goes, gliding like a ghost. A dance with nature.

           Finally, he slows when he comes upon a blueberry bush. He 
           pulls his knife, cuts down vines. Completely silent except 
           for the sound of CICADAS. 

           But then, through the trees, the Man sees a RURAL HOUSE -- a 
           proud old two-story in need of renovation. Serene. Isolated. 

           And in the backyard --

           -- a YOUNG GIRL, 12, sets up a TELESCOPE aimed at the Rip.

           CLANK! The Man drops his knife, smacking against a ROCK.

           IN THE BACKYARD

           As the girl turns toward the sound, we get a better look at 
           her -- this is HENRIETTA THORNE. Worn t-shirt, cargo pants, 
           she's the kind of kid who'll spend hours in the dirt staring 
           up through a prosumer telescope.

           Curious, she approaches the dark woods, reaches out into the 
           thick brush and...

           Her finger CLIPS a thorny bush, drawing blood --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Ow!

           Henrietta puts a finger to her mouth, when all the sudden --

           -- a curtain-like ARC OF LIGHT swirls above and around her.

           Parallel rays of differing colors: green, blue, violet. Like 
           magic. She stands frozen, not breathing, afraid to move. 
           After a beat, the aurora fades away, and Henrietta exhales.   

           Then she BOLTS past a MOVING VAN in the driveway and into --
           INT. KITCHEN. THORNE HOME. SAME.

           Where Henrietta almost runs into her mother, SHEILA, 30s, 
           weary from unpacking MOVING BOXES, wearier from holding a 
           family together on her own.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I think I just saw an aurora!

           Sheila pulls an old POCKET WATCH from a moving box.

                                 SHEILA
                        Dammit. My watch broke.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I was out looking at the Rip --

                                 SHEILA
                        Movers must've jostled it too much. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        But there's so many trees out here I 
                        could barely see anything --

                                 SHEILA
                        Used to be your grandpa's. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I thought I heard something and then 
                        it was like... light. All around me. 

                                 SHEILA
                                 (
                                              )
                                  not listening
                        Sounds fun, sweetie.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Hello?! I was in the middle of an aurora 
                        thousands of miles from the North Pole. 

           Sheila doesn't respond, just shakes the watch. Henrietta 
           rolls her eyes and grabs it, futzes with a dial.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                                 (
                                  handing it back
                                                )
                        You just have to wind it.

                                 SHEILA
                        Huh. How bout that?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        When's our wifi gonna be up? I need 
                        access to an online database --
                                 SHEILA
                        Henry, this is a really small town. 
                        Everything takes a while. 

           Exasperated, Henrietta stomps her way into --

           THE LIVING ROOM

           -- where she almost trips over the ARMY ACTION FIGURES her 
           brother BEN (9) has lined up on the floor. Despite deafness 
           and thick-lens glasses, Ben is intent on being all he can 
           be. And he always wears his camo to prove it. 

           Henrietta taps his shoulder as he rummages through a BOX, 
           indiscriminately tossing aside TOYS (most military-themed). 

           They use SIGN LANGUAGE (all signing will be denoted in 
           dialogue by ITALICS and subtitled on screen) --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I think I just --

                                 BEN
                        Have you seen my BB-gun?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Ben, I saw an aurora. Right outside!

           Ben shrugs, nonplussed. 

                                 BEN
                        I can't find my BB-gun.

                                 (
                                  sighs
                                 HENRIETTA
                                 )
                        Why don't you check your butt hole?

                                 BEN
                        No room cuz your mom lives there.

           He can apparently read lips. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        She's your mom too, nimrod. 

           Chagrined, Ben turns away, effectively shutting her out. He 
           reaches for an UNMARKED BOX, one that's completely covered 
           in tape. As if it's not meant to ever be opened. 

           But Ben is undeterred. He starts to tear into it when --
                                 SHEILA (O.S.)
                        No!

           From out of nowhere, Sheila swoops in, snatching the box.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        What's... in there?

                                 SHEILA
                        Mom's allowed private things too, OK?

           Sheila backs away and trips over an action figure. YELPS.

                                 SHEILA (cont'd)
                        I would appreciate a little help from 
                        you two. I'm doing everything here!

           And with that she angrily heads upstairs with the box. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Like it's our fault she moved us to 
                        the forest moon of Endor.

                                 BEN
                        I like Endor. Ewoks are great 
                        tactical fighters. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        They're stone age teddy bears. Don't 
                        embarrass yourself. 

           Ben lights up as he finds his BB-GUN under the coffee table. 

                                                            CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON HENRIETTA'S FACE. 

           Her mind in overdrive. Her mouth barely keeping up.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Charged particles from the sun can't 
                        just randomly wind up anywhere on the 
                        planet, right? They're supposed to 
                        deflect to the poles cuz that's where 
                        the magnetic field is weakest. 
                                  no response, then
                                 (
                                                  )
                        So how does an aurora show up all the 
                        way down here? Is the magnetic field 
                        damaged? But even that wouldn't 
                        explain why it was so localized...
           Finally, REVERSE to reveal that she's talking to a stuffed 
           "Albert Einstein" DOLL propped up on her desk.

           She's in her and Ben's BEDROOM (two twin beds amid more 
           moving boxes, hamster cage with requisite HAMSTER).

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                                 (
                                  to the Einstein doll
                                                     )
                        You think I should ask the forum? You 
                        think I should ask the forum...

           She plops down at her desk and pulls out her phone. ON HER 
           SCREEN: an app, "Science Forums." She types a post...

                 AnnusMirabilis1905: Aurora spotted in Millinocket Maine

           We see her side of the room, littered with science gear:

           -- a CHEMISTRY SET, with test tubes and a Bunsen burner. 
           -- a MOBILE, with the planets of the solar system. 
           -- a MICROSCOPE, a BREADBOARD, stacks of SCIENCE BOOKS, and 
           a framed NEWSPAPER with the headline: "A RIP IN THE SKY."

           Henrietta looks up at Einstein. His black eyes taunt her.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        You know if you already figured it 
                        out, you could just tell me. 

           She glances at her phone. Someone's already responded.

                    Newt0nslaws123: northern lights visible? so what?

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                                 (
                                  sighs, then to Einstein)
                        They're never gonna believe it was in 
                        my backyard.

           Behind her, Ben army crawls in, quietly, "armed" with his 
           BB-Gun. To his fatigues, he's added camouflage face paint.  

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        Unless I can get a picture and then --

           Sensing her brother's presence, Henrietta quickly hides the 
           Einstein doll under her pillow when --

           A KOOSH BALL flies at her. She catches it. 

           Ben stands, disappointed.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        Some ambush.
                                 BEN
                                 (
                                                )
                                  re: the hamster
                        Were you talking to Bazooka?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Why would I talk to a hamster. Don't 
                        be ridiculous.

           Henrietta grabs her backpack and picks up a CAMERA... 

                                 BEN
                        Where're you going?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I need a photo.

                                 BEN
                        Can I come?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        You'll just get scared.

                                 BEN
                        No I won't.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Ben, you always get --

                                 SHEILA (O.S.)
                        Henrietta! Trash!

           Henrietta pauses. An idea.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Mom wants you to take out the trash.

                                 BEN
                        Nice try.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Hey - you wanna come or not?

           EXT. THORNE HOME. NIGHT.

           Ben tosses a trash bag into the can, looks back through the 
           kitchen window where Sheila washes dishes.

           On the side of the house, Henrietta shimmies down the drain 
           pipe. Lands quietly, gives Ben a thumbs-up.
           When Sheila steps away from the window, they run to the edge 
           of THE WOODS. Henrietta FLICKS on a flashlight and they step 
           into the trees. 

           Almost immediately, though, they come upon a SHED.

                                                            CUT TO:

           THE MILKY WAY GALAXY.

           Actually, a KEYCHAIN of the Milky Way. We PULL BACK to 
           reveal that it's attached to a pocketknife Henrietta is 
           using to jimmy open the shed door. She waves Ben over.

           He stays back, scared. She shakes her head as she enters --

           THE SHED.

           A beam of moonlight cuts across the space, which looks like 
           it hasn't been touched in years. Old, rusted, falling apart.

           In the center, a work table. Replete with rusted TOOLS. 
           Henrietta zeroes in on an OLD RAFT, propped up against the 
           wall. Traces her finger along it, wipes off the dust.

           She looks back to find Ben in the doorway.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Don't tell anybody about this place. 
                        It's ours.

           EXT. DEEP WOODS. NIGHT.

           The dark forest has an ominous feel. Ben, frightened, taps 
           Henrietta's shoulder. He wants to go home.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Just a few more minutes. Maybe we --

           Henrietta cuts herself off when she faintly hears... WATER. 
           She heads toward the sound, Ben following. 

           They round a bend to find a RAVINE of jagged rocks. Down 
           below, a RIVER. Maybe 30 to 40 feet wide, moderate depth.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        Whoa.

           They look downstream -- the river winds through the trees.
           A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Hiking along the edge of the ravine, they follow the slope 
           downhill. Henrietta picks up the pace as she sees, up ahead, 
           a spot where the river becomes accessible.

           They arrive. Henrietta glances up -- an unobstructed view of 
           the Rip and the star-filled sky.

           She sets her bag down to unpack her camera. Turns to Ben, 
           who's faced away. She nudges him but Ben doesn't budge. 
           Henrietta follows his confused gaze and lands on: THE MAN, a 
           ways down river. 

           As the Man hauls an OLD WHEELBARROW (cobbled together from 
           chopped wood) up to the river's edge, we finally get a good 
           look at him: 60s, trim and fit with a long, unkempt beard, 
           wild hair, and ragged clothes. 

           He's a frightening sight.

           Henrietta grabs Ben and pulls him to the ground. They crawl 
           behind a boulder and watch the Man fasten a rope around a 
           HEAVY LOG in the wheelbarrow.

           Henrietta leans forward: the Man pulls the rope, maneuvering 
           the log into the river via an elaborate PULLEY SYSTEM. 

           The log drops in place, surrounded by HUNDREDS of other logs 
           and rocks that stretch across the width of the river. Packed 
           with dirt, branches, leaves.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Did he build a dam?

           She stands for a better look, but Ben grabs her. Henrietta 
           tries to wrest herself free from her brother's grasp --

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                                 (
                                  yells to the Man
                                                 )
                        Hey! 

           The Man sees her and freezes. Stunned.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                                 (
                                       )
                                  to Ben
                        Let me go, you goon!

           Quickly recovering, the Man DARTS off into the forest.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        Wait! I just wanted to...
           Henrietta breaks free and goes after him, but he's gone. 

           On the riverbank, she finds a WORN NOTEBOOK left behind. 
           Picks it up and thumbs through the pages. It's a log, with 
           dates, times and categorizations. Elaborate tables dating 
           back years and filled with things she doesn't understand.

           A few words stand out: "hypothesis," "trial 1," "trial 2."

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        I think he's a scientist...

           Henrietta looks into the woods with interest, then stuffs 
           the notebook into her jacket pocket and turns back to Ben.

           EXT./INT. EAST MILLINOCKET SCHOOL. DAY.

           Establish: A quaint, red-brick K-8 nestled among tall pine 
           trees in the shadow of a mountain.

           In a SCIENCE CLASSROOM, Henrietta sits still amid puberty-
           inspired chaos. She looks around, noting MANY EMPTY SEATS.

           In front stands MS. GAGNON (pronounced Gag-None), 60s, armed 
           with thirty years experience and the exasperation to match. 

                                 MS. GAGNON
                        All right everyone, settle. Banks - 
                        settle. OK, before we get started, we 
                        have a new student joining us today. 
                        Stand up and introduce yourself.

           All eyes turn to Henrietta, who doesn't move. Nearby, 
           DUSTIN, 12, scruffy red hair + freckles, encourages her. 

                                 (
                                  whispers
                                 DUSTIN
                                         )
                        Go ahead.

           Henrietta sighs, pops up.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Henrietta.

           She sits down just as quickly. A few SNICKERS.

                                 MS. GAGNON
                        Welcome, Henrietta. Why don't you 
                        tell us something about yourself? 
                                 (
                                  beat, no response
                                                  )
                        What brought you to Millinocket? 
                        Dad get a new job?
           This angers Henrietta, who leans in, emboldened. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Mothers can support families, too.

           Stifled TITTERS from the class.

                                 MS. GAGNON
                        Of course, yes, I didn't mean to --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Mine has, since my dad died. 

                                 MS. GAGNON
                        Well good! I mean no, not good. I'm 
                        very sorry to hear that your, uh...

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Single mother households are the 
                        second most common family arrangement 
                        in developed economies.

                                 MS. GAGNON
                        Well. There you have it.  
                                  awkward beat
                                 (
                                             )
                        OK, let's get class started, shall 
                        we? Today we're going to --

           Henrietta's hand shoots up. Ms. Gagnon stops talking, but 
           Henrietta waits for Ms. Gagnon to nod at her before --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        How come there's nobody here? All my 
                        other classes are full.

                                 MS. GAGNON
                        Ah. Well I don't know what the policy 
                        was at your old school, but science is 
                        an elective course here, so many of 
                        our students choose not to take it. 

           Someone makes a FARTING noise with their armpit. LAUGHTER.

                                 MS. GAGNON (cont'd)
                        Banks, no. Just... no.

           BANKS (12, braces, Lacrosse t-shirt) high fives a FRIEND.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        You're not serious. An elective?
                                 MS. GAGNON
                        Post-Rip it's become quite common, 
                        sadly. Welcome to backwards-ville.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        That's insane. 

                                 MS. GAGNON
                        You're telling me. 
                                  beat
                                 (
                                     )
                        Then again, it would be helpful if 
                        scientists could come up with a 
                        decent explanation for at least some 
                        of it.

                        Just because there's no explanation 
                        yet doesn't mean there won't be. 

                                 MS. GAGNON
                        Right, absolutely... Still, how can 
                        something be visible 24/7 in the same 
                        spot from anywhere on the planet? It 
                        violates so many basic principles, 
                        it's even made me question if --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Aren't you supposed to be the science 
                        teacher? No wonder no one's here.

           More SNICKERS directed at Ms. Gagnon, who's exasperated.

                        The whole point of science is to try 
                        to figure it out. Maybe it's a black 
                        hole. Or maybe --

                        But how should I explain hurricanes 
                        in the middle of a continent or 
                        earthquakes where there are no fault 
                        lines? Our textbook doesn't account 
                        for sudden mass extinctions or 
                        auroras. It doesn't mention increased

                                 MS. GAGNON
                        Yeah. They happened all over the world 
                        after the Rip first appeared. Which

                        An aurora. Last night by my house. 

                                 MS. GAGNON
                        That's not funny, Henrietta. Please

           ANOTHER armpit fart sound, and the students BREAK OUT in 
           laughter. Ms. Gagnon leans against her desk. Defeated.

           Henrietta abruptly grabs her stuff and heads for the door. 

                                 MS. GAGNON (cont'd)
                        Where do you think you're going?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        This is an elective, right? I elect 
                        to do something better with my time.

           Ms. Gagnon doesn't object as Henrietta scoots out.

           INT. CAFETERIA. EAST MILLINOCKET SCHOOL. LATER.

           Henrietta types an update into her phone on her Science 
           Forum post: 

               AnnusMirabilis1905: "Guys what if this aurora = the Rip???" 

           Henrietta considers the implications as she sits alone at a 
           table, her tray untouched. Dustin plops down opposite her.

                                 DUSTIN
                        Henrietta, right? A pleasure. I'm 
                        Dustin.

           She nods but doesn't disengage from her phone. Awkward beat.
                                 DUSTIN (cont'd)
                        Sorry to hear about your dad.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        It happened when I was four. It's OK. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        I see. Do you happen to have a copy 
                        of his obit?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        His what?

                                 DUSTIN
                        His obituary. 

           She finally looks up at him. A bit bewildered.  

                                 HENRIETTA
                        No.

                                 DUSTIN
                        Too bad. 

           THREE KIDS sit down at the other end of the table, giggling 
           and pointing across the room at a JANITOR, 50s. Disheveled, 
           with big HEADPHONES and slumped shoulders, the Janitor gives 
           off a 'stay away from me' vibe.     

           Meanwhile, Dustin shows Henrietta the SCHOOL NEWSPAPER.

                                 DUSTIN (cont'd)
                        I write for the paper. Been trying to 
                        get the administration to let me do 
                        an obit section. It's kind of a 
                        passion of mine, but so far, no go.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        An obit section in a school newspaper?

                                 DUSTIN
                        Yeah that's what they said. But you 
                        know what? People die. This counselor 
                        who retired a few years ago just did. 
                        I could've written a heck of an obit 
                        for Mr. Busekist. I could do one for 
                        your dad if you want.  

           Henrietta smiles. Dustin's an oddball. She digs it.  
           One of the kids at the end of the table (his faded t-shirt 
           shows the Rip, a fart cloud, and the words "I'll RIP you a 
           new one!"), purposefully and loudly knocks over his milk. He 
           SNAPS for the Janitor, who makes his way over. 

           As the Janitor dutifully cleans the spill, head down, MUSIC 
           blares from his headphones as the kids stifle laughter. 

                                 KID #1
                        Thank you soooooo much!

           Spill cleaned, the Janitor shuffles away. Henrietta watches 
           him with pity. The kids ERUPT laughing.

                                 DUSTIN
                        Hey, that's not cool.

                                 KID #2
                        Whatever. Guy's a freak.

                                 DUSTIN
                        He's not a freak, he's just a mute.

                                 KID #2
                        Exactly. A freak. And so are you, o-
                        bitch-uary boy.

           Dustin looks down, embarrassed, as the kids return to their 
           own conversation. Henrietta tries to perk him up. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Hey, what's your article about?

                                  excited

                        This vending machine upstairs that 
                        always eats people's quarters. I call 
                        it the "Snack Hole". You know, as a 
                        play on black --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Who's the Millinocket hermit?

           Henrietta points above another article: a crude drawing of a 
           familiar looking man, long-haired and bearded. The headline: 
           "Millinocket Hermit strikes again."

                                 DUSTIN
                        Oh, right, you're new. Local legend 
                        says he's lived out in the woods 
                        around here for like decades. He eats 
                        dogs and little kids to survive.
                                 HENRIETTA
                        Yeah, right...

                                 DUSTIN
                        No, for real. A little girl went 
                        missing a few years ago and everyone 
                        says it was him. He robbed my 
                        cousin's house last spring and now my 
                        uncle goes out looking for him every 
                        other weekend with his buddies... 

           Henrietta looks disturbed, but then her attention gets 
           pulled ACROSS THE ROOM, where she hears YELLING.

           BULLIES taunt an unlucky soul: "What're you wearing, 
           dummy?!" "Can't you hear?" "This isn't the army!"

           WITH THE BULLIES: We're surrounded by FACES, contorting in 
           screams. Somebody SPITS. But we don't hear any of it. 

           THE WORLD IS SILENT.

           Why? The poor soul being bullied is BEN, and we're seeing 
           the world FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE.

           BACK WITH HENRIETTA: Sound returns as recognition dawns on 
           her. In a flash, she's up and OUT OF HER SEAT --

           Runs at FULL SPEED across the cafeteria --

           Grabs a stray LUNCH TRAY from a table --

           Arrives at the circle of bullies where Ben is being pushed 
           around, TEARS in his eyes.

           SMACK! SMACK! Henrietta pummels everyone in sight.

           INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE. WAITING ROOM. DAY.

           CLOSE ON FINGERS typing. They belong to the SECRETARY, 70s. 

           On a bench sits Henrietta, cheek bruised. Through the ajar 
           office door, she watches Sheila talk to the PRINCIPAL, 50s.

                                 SHEILA 
                        She's always had trouble making 
                        friends, but nothing like this.  

                                 PRINCIPAL 
                        Any other behavior that concerns you?
                                 SHEILA
                        Well she talks more to her Einstein 
                        doll than anyone else. It was a gift 
                        from her father, but still...

           Henrietta looks at her feet, embarrassed. The secretary 
           notices, SHUTS the door. With a nod to Henrietta, she 
           waddles back to her desk. Henrietta's gaze follows her past 
           the glass doorway leading to the hallway where --

           -- the Janitor stands, STARING RIGHT AT HENRIETTA. As soon 
           as he's made, he gets back to mopping. Heads down the hall.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Don't mind Ed. He's the new janitor. 
                        A bit weird but harmless. I think.
                                 (
                                  then
                                     )
                        Millinocket attracts all the kooks, 
                        but you'll end up liking it here...
                                 (winks)
                        ... so long as you don't beat up too 
                        many more boys.

           Henrietta smiles, but it quickly fades when the principal's 
           door re-opens and Sheila, in scrubs, walks out. Angry. 

                                                            CUT TO:

           SETTLERS OF CATAN. THE BOARD GAME --

           -- on a table in the THORNE DINING ROOM. Ben examines the 
           board carefully, but Henrietta's once again on her phone: 

                Bohrisabore123: any more sightings?
                Bohrisabore123: you should really call the Rip hotline. 
                Bohrisabore123: update please!

           Seems she's aroused somebody's curiosity. But her attention 
           is pulled away by Sheila lecturing from the kitchen. 

                                 SHEILA (O.S.)
                        I know moving out here's been hard, 
                        but for crying out loud, a suspension 
                        on your first day of school?!

           Henrietta fumes.

                                 SHEILA (O.S.) (cont'd)
                        And I appreciate you defending your 
                        brother, I do.

                        an adult, don't start hitting people. 
                        Oh, and I can't believe you're 
                        dropping science! 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Mother, you weren't there. It was a 
                        joke.

                                 SHEILA (O.S.)
                        Hey, now what did I say about calling 
                        me mother? You know I hate that.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        You're my mother, are you not?

           Sheila enters, wearing a RED COCKTAIL DRESS and a face full 
           of makeup. Henrietta and Ben notice.

                                 SHEILA
                        You're not the only one having a 
                        tough time here, OK? I'm working 
                        double shifts at the hospital --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        You going to work dressed like that?

           Sheila's tone changes. 

                                 SHEILA
                        What? No, I told you. I've got a 
                        meeting with a coworker tonight. 

                                 HENRIETTA

                                                     )
                        Yeah. I should be back around --

                                 BEN
                        Lot of makeup for a meeting.

                                 SHEILA
                        Well it's like a social slash work 
                        thing so I thought I'd --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        How many people are going to this 
                        meeting?
                                 SHEILA
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        Fine, it's a date, OK? He works at the 
                        hospital. Now will you please --

           Suddenly, the LOUD WAIL of the smoke alarm in the kitchen.

                                 SHEILA (cont'd)
                        Dammit! The burner!

           Sheila runs out. Ben and Henrietta follow her into --

           THE KITCHEN 

           Filled with SMOKE. The sound is PIERCING -- Henrietta and 
           Sheila cover their ears, but Ben is unfazed.

           Sheila turns off the burner and frantically fans the smoke 
           away from the alarm, which finally quiets. Then she looks 
           down at her chicken cutlets, all burnt BLACK.

                                 BEN
                        What're we gonna eat now?

           EXT. THE RIVER ACCESS POINT. DAY.

           Through a mirror we see a REFLECTION of the Man's dam.

           REVERSE to reveal one end of a homemade PERISCOPE, barely 
           peeking out of the woods. The mirror is affixed to an elbow 
           joint, which is attached to PVC pipe.

           HIDDEN IN THE TREES, the Man uses the periscope to peer 
           around the corner and scan the surrounding area.

           Satisfied he's alone, he steps into the clearing. Walks to 
           the river's edge where he dropped the notebook. Looks along 
           the ground. But of course, it's not there...

                                                            CUT TO:

           THE MAN'S NOTEBOOK. 

           Sticking out of Henrietta's backpack. She and Ben sit at a 
           table at the RUSTY TAVERN, a dive-y bar and eatery. Sawdust 
           on the floor, ALCOHOLICS on the stools. 

           Ben scarfs a burger and fries. Henrietta's nose is buried in 
           a SCIENCE BOOK. She's also eavesdropping on...
           THE NEXT TABLE: Where RICHIE, 40s, a schlub of a man wearing 
           a medium size dress shirt when he really needs a large, 
           talks animatedly to Sheila, who tries to keep up.

                                 RICHIE
                        They live on Gallifrey, located in 
                        the Kasterborous constellation. This 
                        one Time Lord steals a Tardis to go 
                        on an adventure through space and --

                                 SHEILA
                        Wait - Tardis?

                                 RICHIE
                        Time and Relative Dimension in Space.

                                 SHEILA
                        OK, you're losing me...

                                 RICHIE
                        Oh gosh, you know what? I told myself 
                        before I left the house, "Now, 
                        Richie, don't start talking about 
                        Doctor Who," and whaddaya know. 

           At the next table, Henrietta shakes her head. Then glances 
           over at Ben, now doodling in the Man's notebook. 

           Henrietta grabs it from him, but before closing it, sees 
           something in the notebook that seizes her attention.

           BACK WITH SHEILA AND RICHIE:

                                 RICHIE (cont'd)
                        So, you a big dater?

                                 SHEILA
                        Not really. Nursing school and two 
                        kids will keep you pretty busy.

                                 RICHIE
                        Oh I can imagine! Heh.
                                 (
                                  then, he retreats
                                                  )
                        Only vicariously, of course. I don't 
                        have kids. And I got my degree online.

           Henrietta BOUNDS over, brandishing the Man's notebook. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        He saw it! The Hermit saw it too!

                                 SHEILA
                        Jesus, you startled me --
           Henrietta shoves the Man's notebook in Sheila's face. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Electromagnetic storms, hurricanes... 
                        Check out his last entry, from the 
                        other night - "aurora." The same one 
                        I saw. I told you!

                                 SHEILA
                        Who saw what now?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        He's been logging anomalies. I bet he 
                        knows about the Rip, too! 

           She drops the notebook onto the table. Richie picks it up.

                                 RICHIE
                        Wait a tic - you saying you took this 
                        notebook from the Millinocket Hermit?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I didn't take it. He dropped it.

                                 SHEILA
                        Hold on, who's the Millinocket --

                                 RICHIE
                        Hermit. He's like a ghost. Nobody 
                        knows how he even survives out in the 
                        woods all year. I wouldn't go near 
                        him. People tend to go missing around 
                        these parts, and a lot of folks think 
                        it's cuz of him. I heard he's got a 
                        big cache of weapons, too.

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh god. Henry, how did you meet 
                        this --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        It doesn't matter. Don't you get it? 
                        The Rip is reactivated, and we're the 
                        only ones who know about it!

           Richie chuckles condescendingly.

                                 RICHIE
                        Now you sound like one of those end 
                        time wackos.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I'm not a wacko. I'm a scientist.
                                 RICHIE
                        OK, if the Rip is reactivated, how 
                        come it hasn't started growing again? 

           She has no answer for that.

                                 RICHIE (cont'd)
                        Uh huh. Maybe you should stick to 
                        princesses.

                                 SHEILA
                        Whoa, that's not -- 

           Richie tussles Henrietta's hair. Incensed, she steps back.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I wasn't even talking to you.

                                 SHEILA
                        Henrietta. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Well I wasn't! Why would I? He 
                        doesn't know anything.
                                  to Richie
                                 (
                                          )
                        Gallifrey can't exist within a 
                        constellation because constellations 
                        are relative to your location. That 
                        show is stupid, and so are you. 

                                 SHEILA
                        OK, that's enough!

           Henrietta SWIPES at Sheila's plate and it CRASHES to the 
           floor. Other patrons gawk as Henrietta runs out.

                                 SHEILA (cont'd)
                        Excuse me.

           Sheila gets up to follow -- but then turns back.

                                 SHEILA (cont'd)
                        You ever tell my daughter to "stick 
                        to princesses" again, I'll make sure 
                        your voice ends up two octaves 
                        higher. Got it?

           EXT. THE RUSTY TAVERN. NIGHT.

           Sheila finds Henrietta leaning against their car. Tries to 
           put her arm around her daughter, but she recoils.
                                 SHEILA
                        You're upset. Cool.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        You won't listen to me!

                                 SHEILA
                        Because I'm on a date. Was on a --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        You're so much better than that guy. 

           Beat.

                                 SHEILA
                        Yeah he kinda sucks, doesn't he?

           They laugh. The tension fades.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        You always date these idiots... Was 
                        dad like that? 

                                 SHEILA
                        What? No! I mean - not at all. Your 
                        father was... He was the smartest 
                        person I ever met. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I wish I could talk to him about the 
                        Rip.

                                 SHEILA
                        You'd have to get his attention first.
                                 (
                                  off Henrietta
                                              )
                        I wish you'd gotten to know him, of 
                        course, but... I worry he would've 
                        disappointed you. Your father was 
                        always in a lab. That's where he was 
                        when you were born. Ben too. He never 
                        thought of other people because he 
                        couldn't see past his own work. Kind 
                        of like you, actually. Henry, you've 
                        gotta open yourself up to somebody.

           Henrietta leans her head onto her mother's shoulder. We cut 
           across the parking lot to watch the tender moment from afar. 

           REVERSE to reveal a RUSTED PICK-UP. Through the windshield, 
           we see that someone else is also watching: Ed. The janitor.
           EXT. THORNE HOME. BACK DOOR. DAY.

           FROM A HANDHELD POV IN THE WOODS, we watch Henrietta emerge 
           from the house, backpack on, and head for the trees.

           EXT. RIVER ACCESS POINT. DAY.

           We watch FROM THE WOODS as Henrietta arrives at the dam. She 
           unzips her backpack. Takes out the notebook.

           REVERSE to reveal we've been watching from the MAN'S POV. 

           LATER, ON THE RIVER BANK 

           Henrietta sits, picking at the dirt. Been a while. Finally, 
           she gets up, leaves the notebook on the ground and heads 
           back into the woods towards home.

           WE STAY WITH THE MAN, hidden in the brush. He doesn't move, 
           even when Henrietta's gone.

           TIME LAPSE: The sun TRAVERSES the sky. As it approaches the 
           horizon, the first stars appear. But the Rip never moves. 
           And neither does the Man.

           Time returns to normal as we hear an unnatural WHOOSH sound. 
           There it is again. WHOOSH. Is it a car? A plane?

           Moving just his eyes, the Man looks up: a flock of BIRDS in 
           formation. As they all change direction at once, there again 
           goes the WHOOSH. A surprising and beautiful sound. The Man 
           smiles at this moment of natural tranquility. 

           WHOOSH... WHOOSH... WHOOSH.

                                                           FADE TO:

           THE NIGHT SKY FILLED WITH STARS, ALONG WITH THE RIP.

           TILT DOWN to the Man, still waiting. Dude has serious 
           patience. At last, he emerges. Picks up the notebook. 

                                 HENRIETTA (O.S.)
                        I saw the aurora, too.

           The Man DARTS for the forest as Henrietta emerges.

                                 HENRIETTA 
                        Wait! I just want to talk --
           He disappears behind trees. She chases. Dodges branches. 
           Lumbers as quickly as she can, but the Man surges ahead.

           She steps on a branch and her ankle TURNS. Henrietta screams 
           and tumbles DOWN A RAVINE --

           SKY

               GROUND

           SKY 

               GROUND

           SKY

               GROUND --

           and CRUNCH! Her head HITS A ROCK and we --

                                                       CUT TO BLACK:

           FADE IN ON:

           Henrietta's face, unconscious, bobbing slightly. Her jaw is 
           bruised, her hair matted with blood. She doesn't look good.

           She's lying prone on a makeshift stretcher (duct tape used 
           as support material between two long tree branches).

           The Man pushes the stretcher, one hand on her shoulder to 
           keep her stabilized.

           ANGLE ON HIS FEET: HE IS FLOATING, a few feet up in the air.

           The Man and the stretcher glide through the forest, drifting 
           as gravity takes a holiday.

           LATER IN THE NIGHT.

           Henrietta's head is now wrapped in blood-soaked GAUZE. 

           She opens her eyes to find she's in THE MAN'S CAMP, though 
           it's out of focus. She squints and we see the Man crouched 
           over a hand-crank RADIO. We can barely make out the audio:

                                 VOICE (RADIO)
                        Friends, now’s the time to get an 
                        order of Rip Radio's ultra fish oil 
                        vitamins. These babies are exactly 
                        what you’ll need to fend off the 
                        alien horde that's sure to...
           Henrietta's eyes flutter, losing consciousness, and we...

                                                      FADE TO BLACK:

           EXT. THE MAN'S CAMP. NIGHT.

           Henrietta wakes with a start. A bit more alert, but her face 
           has SWOLLEN. Reddened. Infected.  

           She winces and looks down at her ankle. It's infected, too.

           Reaching to touch her face, she notices a thin BRACELET 
           around her wrist. Like the sleekest Fitbit you've ever seen. 
           An inscription reads "HEALTH FORWARD." A light glows RED.

           What is this thing? She rips it off, and the inscription 
           disappears. The light now FLASHES RED.

           Lifting her head, she gets her first look around. She's on a 
           twin-sized mattress, faded polka-dot Tommy Hilfiger sheets.

           Brown and green plastic tarps are overlaid like roof tiles, 
           anchored with bungee chords tied to the ground, creating an 
           A-frame structure, open on both ends like a train tunnel.

           Moon and Rip light shines through the tarps like stained 
           glass windows, giving the place an almost church-like feel.

           A two-burner stove rests atop milk crates, a garden hose re-
           purposed as a gas-line. Cooking supplies hang from ropes. On 
           the floor, mousetraps. A BIN stuffed with NOTEBOOKS.

           It's all very impressive. 

           But then she sees the Man, sleeping under blankets across 
           the A-Frame. Leaning up against a tree next to him: an AX 
           and an apron covered in BLOOD.

           Quietly, she swings her feet onto the worn carpet.

           Slowly... silently... painfully... she slips on her shoes. 

           The BED CREAKS. 

           After a beat, she stands, legs wobbly and ankle screaming.  
           She limps away, watching the Man the whole time. 

           He doesn't stir. And then -- she RUNS!

           Outside the A-Frame, HUGE BOULDERS. Many COVERED in TICK 
           MARKS, counting away the days. THOUSANDS of them. 
           She SPINS, overwhelmed. 

           Hearing the Man ROUSE, she claws her way to the top of a 
           boulder. Jumps down the other side and SNAP! Her ankle 
           collapses into AN UNEARTHLY BEND.

           Henrietta WAILS in agony -- 

           She lurches away. But in the black of night, she can't see. 
           Looking up, she can barely make out the trees swaying above. 
           Suddenly dizzy, she STUMBLES and lands with a THUD.

           MORNING

           Henrietta wakes, back in the bed. Her eyes bright, her color 
           returned. Much improved.

           Across the way, the Man uses a ladle to stir a steaming POT, 
           then exits the A-frame. Henrietta tries to sit up when she 
           senses something under her blanket. She lifts it to find --

           HER ANKLES ARE TIED TO THE BED WITH OLD BELTS.

           Frantic, she reaches to untie them when she sees, back on 
           her wrist -- THE BRACELET. Now glowing GREEN.

           Henrietta jumps when she hears a CLAMORING: a SQUIRREL 
           scampers from a crude wooden BIRD FEEDER, hung from a tree. 

           The Man approaches and yanks down the feeder. Frustrated.

           He turns to see her eyes open for half a beat before she 
           quickly closes them. Doesn't dare breathe.

           The Man fills a BOWL with the ladle then carries it over. 
           She squints one of her eyes open. Busted. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        If you let me go, I promise I won't 
                        tell anyone...

           He just holds the bowl until she takes it. Mac and Cheese. 

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        I've got a strong olfactory sense. 
                        I'll know If you try to poison me.

           Henrietta makes a show of taking a deep SNIFF, sneaking a 
           peek at the Man, who's unconcerned. He's headed over to the 
           bird feeder, where he pulls a rope to raise it even higher. 

           She dives in hungrily.
                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        You do know the average squirrel can 
                        jump four feet vertically and more 
                        than twice that horizontally, right? 

           The Man pauses. Then raises the feeder some more.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        With all the potential launching pads 
                        around here, there's nowhere you can 
                        hang it the squirrels can't reach.

           He lets the feeder DROP, spins and approaches Henrietta. As 
           he bears down on her, she leans back in a fearful reflex...

           But he merely unties her legs then points to the bracelet. 
           She takes it off and hands it to him, but she's more focused 
           on her ankle. 

           The skin looks normal. No infection. She TWIRLS it around -- 
           NO PAIN. Then she reaches to her forehead... NO GASH.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        What the heck?

           The Man places the bracelet in a CIGAR BOX on a rock shelf. 

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        What is that thing?

                                 THE MAN
                        Time... to go.

           His voice clanks and stutters, an old engine turning over 
           for the first time in ages. Each word a separate adventure.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        You're not gonna eat me or anything?

                                 THE MAN
                        Already had breakfast.

                                 HENRIETTA
                                 (
                                  laughs, then
                                             )
                        You don't seem like the dangerous 
                        monster everyone says you are.

           The Man shrugs as he pours water into a mug, she leans 
           forward to look closer at his different colored EYES.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        I've never seen someone with iris 
                        heterochromia before.
                                 THE MAN
                        Drink.

           He hands her the mug, but she just hops up and down on her 
           ankle. Right as rain. She points at the cigar box.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        My ankle was broken, and I'm pretty 
                        sure I had a -- 

                                 THE MAN
                        You were hallucinating. After you 
                        fell. Probable dehydration. Which is 
                        why you need to drink.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        What was the bracelet for then?

           He just glares at her. A brick wall. She finally drinks, and 
           he calms. Beat, then --

                                 THE MAN
                        Shoes.

           And with that, he disappears. She pokes around, mind racing.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Hey what's that dam for? At the river.

                                 THE MAN (O.S.)
                        Easier to fish when the fish can't 
                        escape.

           Henrietta comes upon his notebooks. Reaches for one --

                                 THE MAN
                        Don't. Touch.

           He drops her shoes at her feet. Returns to his feeder.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        You've been tracking unexplained 
                        phenomena. I read your notebook.

                                 THE MAN
                        Living out here, you need hobbies.

           She clocks a handmade BOOKSHELF, changes tactics.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        These your science books? I've got my 
                        own collection. I like to feel the 
                        pages. Way better than an iPad.
           She pulls out a PAPERBACK. On the cover: a woman, sopping 
           wet, hangs onto a muscular, shirtless man. The title: DOWN 
           RIVER. Henrietta scans the shelf. Scoffs.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        These are all romance novels. Ew.

           The Man snatches the book.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        Why do you read that garbage?

                                 THE MAN
                        Research.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Research... into what? Sexism?

                                 THE MAN
                        A modeling of non-intellectual 
                        influences on human behavior.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        So... emotion.

                                 THE MAN
                        Sure.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Wow, you’re even weirder than I am.
                                 (
                                     )
                                  then
                        You must be lonely.

           He slides the book back in place. She studies him.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        I'm lonely, too. I just moved here,  
                        and it sucks. It's not like I had a 
                        ton of friends back in Pittsburgh.

           The Man points down at her shoes. As she puts them on...

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        But at least there were libraries. And 
                        the science museum. I was lonely, I 
                        guess, but it didn't feel like I was 
                        alone, you know? Not like here.

           Now it's the Man's turn to study her. He looks as if he's 
           considering letting down his guard. But then --
                                 THE MAN
                        Your parents must be worried. We're 
                        leaving.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Fine, Mr. Killjoy. Can I at least use 
                        the bathroom before I go?

           The Man hesitates, then points to a boulder on the far side. 
           Henrietta walks over to find a HOLE in the ground. Scrunches 
           her nose. Walks back to the Man, who's now cleaning a pot.

           She reaches out to tap his shoulder when he RECOILS. Like 
           even the thought of her touch burns. Awkward beat, then --

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        TP?

                                 THE MAN
                        Dan Brown novels. Next to the hole.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I can't go if you're in here.

           The Man doesn't move.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        Come on, don't be a perv.

                                 (
                                 THE MAN
                                  honestly confused
                                                  )
                        I am not a... perv.

           The Man exits through the boulders and into the woods 
           beyond. Henrietta waits until he's out of sight.

           EXT. WOODS. VARIOUS. DAY.

           -- HENRIETTA'S POV: through a handkerchief blindfold, we see 
           the ground and glimpses of Henrietta's feet as she walks 
           through an undergrowth of ferns and red-topped mushrooms, 
           her hands tied in front of her by rope, being led along...

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I'm open to alternate theories, if 
                        you got 'em. But at this point, I 
                        can't see any other explanation. It 
                        has to be the Rip. The only question 
                        is why did it reactivate now?
           LATER, STILL WALKING

           We hear the sound of LOONS singing in the tree-tops, 
           Henrietta CRUNCHES BRANCHES as she steps...

                                 HENRIETTA
                        So then when I was six I had this 
                        real bad reaction to Rocky Road ice 
                        cream. It was the marshmallows. Turns 
                        out gelatin gives me a huge --

           LATER, STILL WALKING

           Burned embers, black stumps. Remnants of a forest fire. 
           Henrietta CRUNCHES more branches. And still...

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I get it. You wanna be left alone. I 
                        can relate. Sometimes I daydream 
                        about everyone at school getting sick 
                        so I can get way ahead in all my 
                        classes. But I think it'd be lonely.

           Suddenly, the rope goes slack and Henrietta stops. Through 
           the blindfold, she can barely make out the Man's feet. Beat. 

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        What's happening? Are we --

                                 THE MAN
                        When I was a boy, if I ever felt 
                        lonely, I would repeat the word 
                        stardust to myself, over and over. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Stardust. Why?

                                 THE MAN
                        We're surrounded by this vast 
                        accumulation of planets and matter and 
                        life. It's all made of stardust. Helps 
                        me remember I'm not ever really alone.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        Never told anybody about that.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        ... I like it. 

           Beat. No response. 
           Henrietta peels off the blindfold. She squints as her eyes 
           adjust to the sun. Back at THE RIVER ACCESS POINT. She 
           spins -- the Man is gone. Sighs.  

           But then she unties her hands and pulls out the Man's 
           BRACELET from her pocket. A wry smile.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. THORNE HOME. LATER.

           Ben plays with his army action figurines on the floor. A 
           door SLAMS and Henrietta enters. Steps over Bazooka (rolling 
           around in a hamster ball) to tap Ben's shoulder.  

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Where's mother? 

                                 BEN
                        Still asleep. Got home late. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        She didn't even notice I was --

                                 BEN
                        You were right.

           Ben points behind her, to the TV, playing the NEWS. The 
           CHYRON reads: NASA SCIENTISTS BELIEVE RIP HAS REACTIVATED. 

           On TV, cell phone footage of SNOW blanketing PALM TREES.

                                 BEN (cont'd)
                        It grew again, too. 

           CLOSE on Henrietta, her jaw dropping. Ben looks up at his 
           sister, fearful.

                                 BEN (cont'd)
                        What's gonna happen now?

           Henrietta just watches the snow fall on TV, then a huge GRIN 
           spreads across her face.

           INT. LIBRARY. EAST MILLINOCKET SCHOOL. DAY.

           PUSH THROUGH kid traffic until we arrive at a READING NOOK, 
           where Henrietta sits surrounded by SCIENCE BOOKS. 

           She checks to make sure no one's watching then digs into her 
           backpack, eyeing the Man's BRACELET. 
           But when Dustin appears, she quickly picks up a book and 
           pretends to read. He stands there a beat. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        You should be careful. They usually 
                        send kids with the flu in here to 
                        wait 'til their parents pick 'em up. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I got a flu shot in early October. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        That's good. Smart. 

           Another beat. Awkward.

                                 DUSTIN (cont'd)
                        Today in class everybody was making 
                        fun of Ms. Gagnon for not listening 
                        to you about that aurora.

           Henrietta nods but doesn't look up. Dustin persists...

                                 DUSTIN (cont'd)
                        Anyway, it's pretty cool. You knew 
                        about the Rip before anybody else.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        And now I'm gonna figure out why that 
                        anomaly showed up here first.
                                 (
                                  re: the books
                                              )
                        Using science. So if you don't mind --

                                 DUSTIN
                        How come you care so much? About 
                        science I mean.

           Henrietta puts down her book, takes a beat to consider.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        It's the only way you can really know 
                        something. You don't have to think it 
                        or believe it. It's just true.

                                 DUSTIN
                        Huh. That's prolly why science is my 
                        worst subject.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        What do you mean?
                                 DUSTIN
                        I don't want to know the truth. It's 
                        usually bad. That's why I like obits 
                        so much. They don't go on and on about 
                        people's mistakes. Just the good 
                        stuff, you know?
                                 (
                                  then
                                     )
                        I got a sweet collection I could show 
                        you sometime.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Oh - yeah, sure.

                                 DUSTIN
                        I'd invite you to my place but my dad 
                        sits around watching HGTV all day.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        You could come to mine, I guess.

           Dustin smiles, grabs Henrietta's PHONE from the floor. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        Super. Let's say Saturday? Here's my 
                        number, in case you wanna text before. 

           EXT./INT. SCHOOL BUS. LATER.

           Henrietta sits alone in the back of the bus. In her hand: 
           the Man's bracelet. Curious, she puts it on. The inscription 
           emerges: HEALTH FORWARD. But then she feels a tiny PRICK --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Ow!

           Henrietta yanks it off. A droplet of blood appears where it 
           pricked her. The inscription on the bracelet fades away.

           Ben plops down across the aisle, catching a glimpse of the 
           bracelet before Henrietta can slip it into her pocket.

           He looks at her, suspicious. Then he glances OUT THE WINDOW 
           and spots an OLD JEEP driving next to them, with a sign on 
           top: ANGIO'S PIZZA. Ben turns back to Henrietta.

                                 BEN
                        Pizza tonight?

           As Henrietta nods, the CAMERA drifts --
           OUTSIDE THE BUS, to the Jeep. We float INSIDE, where a PIZZA 
           GUY, 20s, a douche-y bro with a Bluetooth in his ear, rocks 
           out to terrible music (probably MAROON 5). Makes a turn.

           EXT. ABANDONED APARTMENT BUILDING. NIGHT.

           Pizza Guy gets out of his Jeep, a large PIE in hand, talking 
           on his phone via the Bluetooth.

                                 PIZZA GUY 
                        Bring beer. Cassie's outta town so I 
                        got the place to myself. 

           AT THE FRONT DOOR

           Despite a NO TRESPASSING sign and BOARDED UP windows, Pizza 
           Guy shoves open the door. 

                                 PIZZA GUY
                        Brazil. I guess her grandma slipped 
                        and broke her hip or something when 
                        they had that crazy Rip blizzard.

           He enters the building, steps over broken bottles and heads 
           up a flight of stairs, unfazed. He's done this before.  

                                 PIZZA GUY (cont'd)
                        I don't know, dude. She thinks this 
                        is like the Rapture or whatever.

           INT. HALLWAY. ABANDONED APARTMENT BUILDING. A MINUTE LATER.

           Pizza Guy heads down a darkened hall. Sketchy as hell.

                                 PIZZA GUY
                        That's what I said. Nothing we can do 
                        about it anyway. If it is the end of 
                        the world, I'm gonna stop hitting the 
                        gym and just get wasted, you know?

           Arriving at a door, he clocks an ENVELOPE on the floor.

                                 PIZZA GUY (cont'd)
                        Hey lemme call you right back. Gotta 
                        deliver a pie to that crackpot on 
                        Maple.

           Turns off his Bluetooth and sets the pizza down. Grabs the 
           envelope and opens it: CASH. He counts it, seems satisfied, 
           and then... waits to see if the door opens. Shakes his head.
                                 PIZZA GUY (cont'd)
                        OK OK, catch you later, weirdo.

           He leaves. But WE STAY AT THE DOOR for several beats before 
           it finally opens a SLIVER. We can't see who's there. Just an 
           EYE. Then the door opens the rest of the way --

           Revealing Ed. As he grabs the pie, we follow him inside and 
           see stained walls, a floor in tatters. The hum of a 
           GENERATOR. This place should be (and probably is) condemned. 
           But then we CUT AROUND:

           -- a dozen FILING CABINETS and BOOKSHELVES, meticulously 
           organized and catalogued. 

           -- meteorological EQUIPMENT, beeping and clicking.

           -- a massive TIMELINE drawn out on one wall. Dates and 
           descriptions (aurora, earthquake, etc). RIP anomalies.

           Ed sets down his pizza on an egg-crate desk, next to a 
           crackling POLICE SCANNER and an early 2000s pink iMac 
           covered with unicorn stickers.

           He sifts through a manila folder, pulls a sheet labeled 
           "Henrietta Thorne transcript." Checks her ADDRESS then scans 
           a MAP. CIRCLES a house.

           As he opens the pizza box... 

                                                       MATCH CUT TO:

           AN ANGIO'S PIZZA BOX BEING OPENED...

           In the THORNE DINING ROOM. Sheila and Henrietta sit across 
           from Ben, as the camera DRIFTS AROUND THE TABLE.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I guess you don't care about the 
                        planet, mother.

                                 SHEILA
                        You know you're not helping your 
                        cause with this mother crap. 

           The argument continues as the camera lands ON BEN.

                                 HENRIETTA (O.S.)
                        I'm working on the biggest scientific 
                        mystery in the history of mysteries - 
                        I don't have time to tile the roof!
                                 SHEILA (O.S.)
                        Nobody's asking you to tile the roof.

           PUSH IN on Ben. Eating quietly, staring straight ahead.

                                 HENRIETTA (O.S.)
                        Not yet but it's a slippery slope! 

                                 SHEILA (O.S.)
                        It's vacuuming. I hardly think --

                                 HENRIETTA (O.S.)
                        You're such a tyrant! 

           As Sheila and Henrietta's conversation ends, the camera, now 
           in a Ben CU, REVOLVES AROUND HIM, until we're behind his 
           head and can see Sheila and Henrietta again.

           But they're actually STILL ARGUING. We just can't hear them. 
           In fact, we hear NOTHING. Because we're in TOTAL SILENCE. 

           This, once again, is the world from Ben's perspective. 

           We finally see what Ben's been staring at: Henrietta's 
           pocket, where he can make out the outline of the BRACELET.

           INT. HENRIETTA & BEN'S ROOM. LATER THAT NIGHT.

           STILL SILENT. 

           Ben lies in bed awake. Shuts his eyes when Henrietta enters, 
           then opens them to see her stuff the Man's bracelet under 
           her mattress before heading out to the bathroom in the hall.

           INT. THORNE HOME. VARIOUS. MORNING.

           STILL COMPLETELY SILENT.

           In her PJs, Sheila cooks breakfast sausages in the KITCHEN. 
           She moves to turn off the stove, when she glances up at the 
           CLOCK. Running late, she hurries upstairs.

           But we PUSH IN ON THE NOB of the stove -- once again left 
           ON. The sausages continue to simmer...

           ANGLE ON THE SMOKE, wafting up. We follow it to the ceiling, 
           where it reaches the SMOKE ALARM. Several beats as the smoke 
           envelops the alarm. Then a RED LIGHT turns ON, and -- 

           THE SILENCE IS PUNCTURED. We hear a distant, warbled alarm. 
           As the CAMERA DRIFTS from the kitchen, floating through the 
           LIVING ROOM and up THE STAIRS, the WAIL of the alarm grows 
           louder, still warped...

           Gliding down THE HALLWAY, past the bathroom door, behind 
           which we can HEAR the SHOWER. The alarm gets LOUDER STILL...

           We move THROUGH THE DOOR into BEN & HENRIETTA'S ROOM, where 
           Ben sleeps in bed. Restless, twitching...

           The sound GROWS...

           We reach his bedside. Ben's ears are swollen, INFECTED. The 
           veins on his neck discolored.

           PUSH IN to an ECU of BEN'S INFECTED EAR...

           The alarm CRESCENDOS...

           His eyes FLY OPEN and we PULL BACK SUPER FAST as he SHOOTS 
           UP in bed. His hands move to cover his EARS, the Man's 
           BRACELET around his wrist. Glowing RED.

           IN THE HALLWAY

           The alarm is PIERCING. Ben furiously BANGS his head with his 
           fists! As Henrietta exits the bathroom, Sheila rushes over 
           and tries in vain to hold Ben's arms down as he CONVULSES.  

           EXT. SHEILA'S TOYOTA. MINUTES LATER.

           Sheila's car PEELS out of the driveway, and the camera 
           LOWERS to the ground, where we see that the lawn is --

           -- LITTERED WITH DEAD CICADAS. Thousands of them. 

           EXT./INT. SHEILA'S TOYOTA. DAY. 

           Sheila drives like a maniac. In back, Ben FOAMS at the mouth, 
           shivering in a blanket as Henrietta tries to soothe him. 

           They SCREECH to a halt in front of the HOSPITAL ER ENTRANCE. 

           INT. HALLWAY. HOSPITAL. DAY.

           Ben lies unconscious on a gurney as DOCTORS and NURSES race 
           him down the hallway. Henrietta and Sheila run alongside. As 
           they reach the ICU, a NURSE blocks Sheila and Henrietta.
                                 NURSE
                        Sheila, you know you can't go in 
                        there...

                                 SHEILA
                        I have to stay with him. Please!

           Sheila reaches out as the doors shut behind Ben.

                                 NURSE
                        Let the doctors do their job.

           Henrietta and Sheila stare at the closed doors, helpless.

                                                            CUT TO:

           A TINY SWARM OF CICADAS, FLYING OUTSIDE A LARGE WINDOW.

           In the HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM, Henrietta watches. Then --

           SPLAT! The bugs smash into the glass. Henrietta jumps.

           She turns: Sheila sits nearby, oblivious. Bouncing a knee, 
           anxious as hell.

           And then, through the window, Henrietta sees a BLACK CLOUD 
           in the distance. Leans in for a better look.

           It's not a cloud. It's another swarm of cicadas. Only this 
           one's bigger. MUCH bigger. So big it dwarfs a distant tree.

           Making her way down the hall, Henrietta follows the swarm. 
           It grows larger as more cicadas join. She soon finds herself 
           blocked by the double doors that lead to the ICU. 

           Then a NURSE pushes past, using an ID BADGE to open the 
           doors. Henrietta catches the door before it closes.

           IN THE ICU

           Chaos. DOCTORS and NURSES rush about. Through the crush, 
           Henrietta sees Ben, THRASHING on a bed. 

                                 DR. BRANDT
                        Someone get neuro on the phone! We've 
                        got serious brain swelling.

           Suddenly Ben goes limp. Henrietta clocks his monitor: his 
           heartbeat SLOWS. She takes a step closer. He's so still.
                                 DR. BRANDT (cont'd)
                        I need a Dilantin load STAT!

           As a nurse flies in with Dilantin, Henrietta steps aside, 
           glancing out the window. The swarm of cicadas has GROWN 
           CONSIDERABLY LARGER. She GASPS.

           We hear Ben's heartbeat RETURN TO NORMAL...

                                 ANOTHER DOCTOR
                        He's coming back! C'mon, kid.

           Through the window, we see the swarm shrink in size almost 
           immediately. Cicadas scatter. Henrietta turns back to her 
           brother. Hopeful. 

           But then his heartbeat SLOWS AGAIN. And there's a loud --

           SMACK!!!

           A different CICADA SWARM slams into the glass! One of the 
           ICU NURSES heard it too, drifting toward the window...

           Cicadas swirl all over, as if they've gone collectively mad. 
           The swarm literally PULSES ALONG WITH BEN'S HEARTBEAT.

                                 ICU NURSE
                        What the...?

                                 DR. BRANDT
                        Sam, I need another IV in him, now!

           The ICU Nurse scrambles off. But Henrietta keeps watching: 
           in the parking lot outside, she sees a WOMAN desperately 
           swatting the bugs away. And then --

           Ben's heartbeat QUICKENS... and the cicadas dissipate. The 
           woman, relieved, stands down.

           Ben's heartbeat SLOWS... and the cicadas return in force. 
           The poor woman once again under attack.

           Henrietta looks back and forth, from her brother to the 
           swarms of bugs. Furrows her brow. No. Not possible. Is it?

           Then Ben's heartbeat abruptly STOPS.

           And the swarm MULTIPLIES. Every second, more cicadas emerge 
           from the woods from all directions. She can see nothing out 
           the window besides cicadas now. Blacking out the world.

           IT'S A GODDAMN PLAGUE. 
                                 ANOTHER DOCTOR
                        No pulse!

           Ben's covered in sweat. The doctor RIPS off his hospital 
           gown, and Henrietta sees it. Around his wrist. Holy shit -- 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        The bracelet! Take off the bracelet!!

           They finally notice her --

                                 ANOTHER DOCTOR
                        Someone get this kid outta here!

           A nurse yanks Henrietta by the shoulder --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Please! You've got to take it off! 
                        TAKE IT OFF!!

           IN THE ER LOBBY

           Henrietta is shoved out, catching one more glimpse of Ben as 
           a nurse investigates the bracelet. Then the doors SHUT. 

           At this point, the cicadas outside have attracted attention. 
           VISITORS and STAFF gawk out the window.

           Henrietta joins them, holding her breath. A beat. Then 
           another. And another.

           And then... 

           In an instant, the blackness outside melts away. Within 
           seconds, the cicadas disperse and all is clear. 

           As things calm down around her, Henrietta looks back at the 
           double doors, and exhales.

                                                           FADE TO:

           THE TV IN THE WAITING ROOM

           On it, a White House PRESS BRIEFING in progress. The CHYRON: 
           WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR CALM AMID WORLDWIDE ANOMALIES.

           As Henrietta huddles in a corner with Sheila, she stares at 
           her phone. A new response on the message board:

                    Bohrisabore123: hey did u ever call the hotline? 
           DR. BRANDT (one of the doctors from the ICU: 40s, 
           hardworking, conscientious) approaches. Sheila stands --

                                 DR. BRANDT
                        He's stable.

           Sheila covers her mouth with her hand. Can't even speak.

                                 DR. BRANDT (cont'd)
                        He's also awake. One of the nurses 
                        signs so she's been translating. He 
                        keeps calling me sergeant.

                                 SHEILA
                        When can we see him?

                                 DR. BRANDT
                        I need to explain something first... 
                        Somehow - and lord knows I've never 
                        seen anything like it - but, well - 
                        we just tested Ben's hearing, and 
                        he's at 30 decibels.
                                 (
                                  re: their confusion
                                                    )
                        He's got mild hearing loss... but Ben 
                        can hear.

           Tears form in Sheila's eyes. Henrietta is flabbergasted.

                                 SHEILA
                        ... how is that possible?

                                 DR. BRANDT
                        A lot of strange things have been 
                        happening obviously, but this...

           Dr. Brandt reaches into his pocket, pulls out the BRACELET.

                                 DR. BRANDT (cont'd)
                                 (
                                  to Henrietta
                                             )
                        How'd you know to take this off him?

           Sheila looks at Henrietta, who tries to think fast.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Just a guess. It was flashing red and 
                        I'd never seen it before. What is it?

                                 DR. BRANDT
                        Do you have any idea where he 
                        might've gotten it or what it does? 

           Henrietta shakes her head no.
                                 SHEILA
                        I don't understand. What does that 
                        thing have to do with his hearing?

                                 DR. BRANDT
                        Honestly, I have no idea. The 
                        infection dissipated as soon as we 
                        removed it, but that could have been 
                        a coincidence. I'm grasping at straws 
                        here. We're going to have to send it 
                        out for testing tomorrow.

           ANGLE ON Henrietta as she takes this in.

                                 DR. BRANDT (cont'd)
                        In the meantime, I'd like Ben to 
                        visit a specialist in Bangor...

           Dr. Brandt keeps talking, but his voice FADES DOWN as we 
           PUSH IN on the TV above, where the PRESS SECRETARY speaks --

                                 PRESS SECRETARY (TV)
                        ... to remain calm and go about your 
                        lives as usual. The worst thing any 
                        of us can do right now is panic.

           INT. WENTWORTH FAMILY GROCERY. DAY.

           Panic. TOWNIES raid emptying shelves as they overfill 
           shopping carts, stocking up for the coming apocalypse.

           Sheila ushers Ben and Henrietta down an aisle. Henrietta 
           takes in the chaos and taps her mother, impatient.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Can we go home, please?

                                 SHEILA
                        Dr. Brandt said to get pain meds and 
                        cotton balls in case Ben's ears start 
                        bleeding again. 

           An ELDERLY MAN pushes past Sheila, heading for the pharmacy.

           ANGLE ON BEN, looking around. 

           -- a nearby shopping cart wheel SQUEAKS. 
           -- two customers ARGUE over a loaf of bread. 
           -- groceries BEEP at check-out.
           -- an ANNOUNCEMENT about a spill. 

           The CACOPHONY grows and Ben covers his ears. Bangs his head.
                                 SHEILA (cont'd)
                        Oh no...

           Sheila runs over and scoops Ben up. Rushes him toward the 
           exit. As the double doors OPEN into the parking lot --

                                                       MATCH CUT TO:

           THE DOOR TO SHEILA'S TOYOTA SLAMMING SHUT.

           They're all inside. It's quiet. Finally. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Tell me what hurts.

                                 BEN
                        Everything sounds... terrible.

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh, baby. I think that's just how the 
                        world sounds.

           After a beat, Ben actually smiles. They all share a breath. 
           A beat of respite as they process this new reality.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. THORNE HOME. DAY.

           Sheila and Ben are glued to TV news coverage of the Rip. 
           Behind them, through the window, we see Henrietta shimmy 
           down the drain pipe and head off into the trees...

           EXT. RIVER ACCESS POINT. LATER.

           Standing by the dam, Henrietta unfurls a MAP of the area. 
           With a pencil, she traces a path from the river out into the 
           woods. Trying to remember how she got to the Man's camp. 

           IN THE WOODS. LATER.

           Henrietta looks down as she hikes: BURNED EMBERS. 

           Stops to edit the route she's drawing on her map. Excited, 
           she picks up the pace, on the right track.

           ELSEWHERE IN THE WOODS. LATER.

           ANGLE ON the trees. Gently swaying.
           Henrietta appears, crossing left to right. Sweaty now. She 
           exits frame, but we hold on the trees. Beat.

           She crosses again, this time right to left. And out.

           Finally, she re-enters a third time and stops. Frustrated. 
           Lost. But then, from the trees behind her --

           -- the sound of LOONS. She heads that way. 

           ON THE GROUND: branches she broke on the way out. BREAD 
           CRUMBS. Re-energized, she updates her map.

           ELSEWHERE IN THE WOODS. LATER.

           Henrietta arrives at a minefield of vehicle-sized boulders. 
           Folds her map and slips it into her jacket pocket...

           ON THE GROUND: Her foot clips a WIRE, causing it to VIBRATE. 

           We FOLLOW THE VIBRATION, racing along the wire, past boulder 
           after boulder before finally zooming up a tree, across a 
           branch, snaking its way through more trees and down into --

           THE MAN'S CAMP

           The wire feeds into a WOOD BOX, triggering a FLASHING light. 

           BACK WITH HENRIETTA: As she finds the entrance...

           But there's no sign of the Man. Just the flashing light. 
           Then, sensing a presence behind her, she turns -- 

           -- Just as the Man leaps down from a boulder. He gets in her 
           face, intense. Holding the empty cigar box.

                                 THE MAN
                        Where is it?! 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I'm sorry. I...

           She's flooded with shame.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        I know I shouldn't have taken it, but 
                        I - just wanted to figure out how it 
                        worked! And then - does that thing 
                        use nanobots? Is that what causes the 
                        infection? 
                                 THE MAN
                        What have you done? What's happened?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        It's my brother, he... he can hear.

           Stunned, the Man collapses onto the ground. Defeated.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        This may sound crazy, but is that 
                        bracelet connected to the Rip? 

           The Man just sits there, staring at the ground.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        It seemed like the cicadas and the 
                        bracelet were... I'm not sure, I --

                                 THE MAN
                        TELL ME WHERE IT IS!

           Henrietta reflexively takes a step back.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        ...this doctor... he took it.

           Beat.

                                 THE MAN
                        Please don't wait for more questions 
                        before volunteering information.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        He, um, said he's gonna send it 
                        somewhere tomorrow. For testing.

           EXT. WOODS ABOVE HOSPITAL. LATER.

           Hidden in the trees up on a CLIFF, the Man looks through his 
           binoculars. Henrietta crouches next to him. 

           In the valley below, several hundred yards away, the 
           hospital, surrounded by woods. The Man lowers the glass.

                                 THE MAN
                        You have to get it.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Are you - I'm a kid. That's like a 
                        secure facility. My mom works there 
                        and even she needs a badge to get in.
                                 THE MAN
                        There's no other option.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Uh - how about you go? 

                                 THE MAN
                        Too dangerous. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        But it's OK for me? Thanks a lot.

                                 THE MAN
                        That device is paired to me. You saw 
                        what happened when your brother --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        The anomaly, you mean? The cicadas?

                                 THE MAN
                        He could have died. That bracelet 
                        causes an infection in anyone but me.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        How come you used it on me, then?

                                 THE MAN
                        It was an emergency, under my 
                        supervision. It's not --

           The Man cuts himself off. Obviously holding something back.  

                                 HENRIETTA
                        C'mon. You can trust me.

                                 THE MAN
                        ... Never mind. I'll get it myself.

           ELSEWHERE IN THE WOODS

           Three HUNTERS walk, a GERMAN SHEPHERD alongside them. They 
           look rough, drinking beers and holding guns. 

                                 HUNTER #1
                        Don't care what nobody says, I'm not 
                        letting it ruin my day.

                                 HUNTER #2
                        Hear hear. It's a false flag anyways.
                                 HUNTER #3
                        I don't know Daryl, if it is the 
                        government, why'd they wait 10 years 
                        to start them anomalies up again?

                                 HUNTER #2
                        Not easy to set these things in 
                        motion. Takes time for the deep state 
                        to dot the I's and whatnot.  

                                 HUNTER #1
                        Plus you know the media's in on it.

           The dog GROWLS. The hunters get quiet.

                                 HUNTER #3
                        What is it, Mac? You got something?

                                 HUNTER #2
                        Better not be another dang raccoon.

           Hunter #3 squats down, pulls an old PAPERBACK from his bag. 
           A DANIELLE STEELE novel. Holds it under the dog's nose.

                                 HUNTER #3
                        Go catch us a hermit, boy.

           BACK WITH HENRIETTA AND THE MAN 

           The Man stands abruptly. Spins.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        What's the matter...

                                 THE MAN
                        We need to go. Right --

           GROWLING nearby. They look over and the GERMAN SHEPARD 
           approaches. The Man's eyes dart. Making calculations.

           Then, O.S. voices. As the Hunters emerge from the brush --

                                 HUNTER #3
                        It's him! Holy crap!

           They fan out to encircle the Man and Henrietta, who back 
           away from the encroaching threat. The dog BARKS like mad.

                                 HUNTER #2
                        Hold it there, hermit.

           The Man and Henrietta back up to the cliff's edge. Cornered. 
                                 HUNTER #1
                        You all right, kid? He hurt you?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Listen, he's not dangerous --

                                 HUNTER #2
                        Step away from him, honey...

           The Man leans over, whispers to Henrietta --

                                 THE MAN
                        Your hand. Now.

           She hesitates. The Hunters RAISE THEIR GUNS.

                                 THE MAN (cont'd)
                        Trust me!

           TIGHT ON HIS EYES. Then TIGHT ON HERS. She holds out her 
           hand. As the Man reaches...

           Hunter #3 pulls the trigger and FIRES!

           And at the moment their hands touch --

                                     *** WHOOSH ***

                        -- HENRIETTA AND THE MAN FLOAT UP INTO THE AIR!

           The dog YELPS as the Hunters stumble back, eyes wide in 
           terror. Then they run off into the woods.

           A surreal beat as Henrietta and the Man hang there, floating 
           as if in outer space. And then, the Man lets go of 
           Henrietta's hand, and just as quickly as they went up --

           THEY GO DOWN. Hard. 

           IN THE WOODS, A MINUTE LATER

           They move FAST through the trees.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        What the hell was that?!!

           Henrietta tries to keep up as the Man pushes their pace.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        We freaking floated! 

           Her mind is racing. Making connections.
                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        You said give me your hand and then - 
                        did you know that was gonna happen?!

           Just the SWISH SWISH SWISH of leaves brushing their legs.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        Was that an anomaly? Did you cause 
                        it?! But you don't have the bracelet.

           EXT. THE MAN'S CAMP. DAY.

           They rush in, out of breath. The Man staggers to the bed.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        If it isn't the bracelet... is it 
                        you? Are you causing them?! 

           Henrietta sees that his hand, clutching his abdomen, is 
           COVERED IN BLOOD. When he lets go, his shirt is soaked. 

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        Oh my god. We need to get you to the 
                        hospital!

           The Man shakes his head. Digs through his supplies and pulls 
           out a TOWEL. Ties it around the wound. GASPS in pain.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        You need help.

                                 THE MAN
                                 (
                                  weakly
                                       )
                        No...

           He falls onto his back. The color draining from his face as 
           the towel soaks in blood.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        But you're gonna die!

                                 (
                                 THE MAN
                                  choking the words
                                                  )
                        The bracelet... 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Yeah doctors can heal you, too! If you 
                        won't go, I'll bring back help --

                                 THE MAN
                        No!
                                 HENRIETTA
                        Why the hell not?!

                                 THE MAN
                        You're right... about the Rip... I'm 
                        not... supposed to be here.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        What are you talking about?!

           He fights off unconsciousness to say --

                                 THE MAN
                        ... I'm from the future.

           As soon as he says that, BLINDING LIGHT fills the forest.

           Henrietta covers her eyes as a spectacular AURORA forms all 
           around them. Ten times the size of the earlier one.  

           It literally knocks her off her feet. 

           As it dissipates, her eyes adjust, and she looks back to the 
           Man, PASSED OUT. Stares at him, wide-eyed. And then --

           HENRIETTA SPRINTS THROUGH THE WOODS...

           ... as fast as she can. Determined, focused.

                                 OPPENHEIMER (FOOTAGE O.S.)
                        We knew the world would not be the 
                        same...

                                                            CUT TO:

           J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER.

           Yes, that Oppenheimer. The father of nuclear power. He looks 
           super intense as the camera bores into him in BLACK & WHITE. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER (FOOTAGE)
                        A few people laughed, a few people 
                        cried, most people were silent... 

           Then we hear LOUD BANGING from O.S. 

                                 OPPENHEIMER (FOOTAGE) (cont'd)
                        I remembered the line from the Hindu 
                        scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita... 
           PULL BACK to reveal that we're looking at a WWII documentary 
           on the TV in the THORNE LIVING ROOM. More BANGING O.S.

                                 OPPENHEIMER (FOOTAGE) (cont'd)
                        Vishnu is trying to persuade the 
                        Prince that he should do his duty and 
                        to impress him takes on his multi-
                        armed form and says: 'Now I am become 
                        Death, the destroyer of worlds.'

           PULL BACK more to reveal Ben, using a wooden SPOON to BANG 
           on pots and pans with joyful abandon. Sheila emerges from 
           the basement, dragging up an EMPTY SUITCASE. 

           Just then the FRONT DOOR FLIES OPEN. It's Henrietta, sweaty 
           and out of breath. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Henry - there's pizza in the fridge 
                        if you're hungry. But I need you to 
                        pack after you eat, OK?

           Henrietta wants to scream: The hermit is a time traveler. He 
           might control the Rip. AND HE'S DYING! Instead --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Pack... pack for what?

                                 SHEILA
                        Bangor. I got Ben in to see that 
                        specialist tomorrow.

           Henrietta fixates on the HOSPITAL ID BADGE clipped to the 
           hip pocket of Sheila's scrubs. She approaches her mother, 
           who's distracted by Ben banging on a wok. 

           Henrietta slowly... carefully... tentatively reaches for the 
           ID badge. Almost has it, when Ben taps her. Henrietta turns 
           and sees Ben was signing to her. 

                                 SHEILA (cont'd)
                        Try sounding out your words.

           He moves his mouth to speak but becomes self-conscious, 
           feeling their eyes bore into him. 

                                 SHEILA (cont'd)
                        Dr. Brandt said it could take years 
                        to learn to speak. I want you to get 
                        started.

           But Ben gives up, frustrated. Returns to signing --
                                 BEN
                        Just say something else, will you?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Like what?

           He closes his eyes, marinates in the sound. Smiles big.

                                 BEN
                        Your voice. It sounds... orange. 

           Ben laughs then returns to banging pots. The badge dangles 
           from Sheila's hip, taunting Henrietta. 

           Sheila's eyes well with tears. Henrietta notices. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Hey, this is all so... Can I have a 
                        hug?

           Sheila smiles warmly. As they embrace, Henrietta carefully 
           SWIPES the badge, pockets it, then abruptly pulls away.

           In a flash, Henrietta is up and heading for the door. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Where are you --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        New science project!

                                 SHEILA
                        Henry, I don't want you going out 
                        right now with all this crazy Rip 
                        stuff happening. Plus we're leaving 
                        first thing in the -- 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I'm not going to Bangor. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Well you're not staying here by 
                        yourself.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Who's gonna take care of Bazooka?

                                 SHEILA
                        We're taking him with us.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Then I'll stay at my friend Dustin's!
                                 (
                                  perking up
                                 SHEILA
                                           )
                        You have a friend?!

                                 HENRIETTA
                        None of your business!

                                 SHEILA
                        Well, OK. Good! Just leave me his 
                        number. Henry, I'm so proud of --

           Henrietta SLAMS the door on her way out. And Sheila smiles.

           EXT. THORNE HOME. SAME.

           Henrietta hops on her BIKE, pedaling furiously as she 
           careens out of the driveway. As she turns onto the road, she 
           SWERVES, barely missing a TRUCK, parked on the shoulder.

           She brakes when she sees who's inside: ED. He opens the 
           driver side door --

                                 ED
                        Oh gosh, I'm so sorry. You all right?

           Yep. ED SPEAKS. Henrietta is as stunned as you are. But then 
           she snaps out of it.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Aren't you --

                                 ED
                        Where ya headed so fast?

           Beyond creeped out, Henrietta starts pedaling again...

                                 ED (cont'd)
                        Henrietta, right? I can drive you 
                        somewhere if you want!

           She rides off, Ed cursing himself as he watches her go. He 
           then looks to the Thorne home before glancing down at some 
           DAISIES growing on the side of the road...

           EXT. THE MAN'S CAMP. SUNSET.

           The Man winces as he ties a new towel around his torso. 
           Coughs into his hand. Blood. Tries to take a deep breath but 
           it's too painful. As he lies down and looks up --

           -- TILT UP to the RIP... then TILT DOWN to reveal we're...
           EXT. HOSPITAL. A FEW MINUTES LATER.

           Henrietta races into the PARKING LOT. Dumps her bike behind 
           some bushes near the ER entrance.

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM. HOSPITAL. SAME.

           Behind the front desk, a BORED NURSE, 60s, does a crossword 
           puzzle when the front doors slide open. She looks up but 
           doesn't see anyone. Returns to her crossword.

           In front of the desk, we TRACK near the floor where 
           Henrietta CRAWLS, avoiding detection. 

           As she makes her way past the desk towards the double doors 
           leading into the rest of the hospital --

                                 ELDERLY LADY (O.S.)
                        Hello, dear.

           Henrietta glances over at the waiting area, where an ELDERLY 
           LADY, 80s, sits staring right at her. Henrietta freezes. 

                                 BORED NURSE
                        I said I'd call you when they're 
                        ready. Buttering me up won't help.

           Henrietta resumes crawling. Reaches the double doors, pulls 
           out her mom's ID BADGE. Holds it up to the sensor...

           Behind the desk, the Bored Nurse sees the doors OPEN and, 
           yet again, nobody comes or goes.

                                 BORED NURSE (cont'd)
                        This place is falling apart.

           INT. DINING ROOM. THORNE HOME. SAME.

           ANGLE ON a small bouquet of DAISIES, as Sheila arranges them 
           in a vase. Ed sits at the table, looking on.

                                 SHEILA
                        Well these are lovely, thank you, Ed. 
                        You said they're from your garden?

                                 ED
                        I'm a bit of a horticulturalist, I 
                        must admit. I'm just sorry it took me 
                        so long to introduce myself. It's 
                        been a crazy few weeks since I 
                        started at the school.
                                 SHEILA
                        You're our neighbor, you work at the 
                        kids' school, and you're new to the 
                        area. What are the odds?

                                 ED
                        Gotta be a million to one.

           Ben stares daggers across the table at Ed, who, unnerved by 
           the boy's attention, smiles. As Sheila pours tea...

                                 ED (cont'd)
                        I hate to be a bother, but I'd love 
                        some sugar if you have any.

                                 SHEILA
                        Of course.

           She reaches behind the teapot and reveals a sugar container. 

                                 ED
                        Oh - actually I was hoping you might 
                        have a sugar substitute? 

                                 SHEILA
                        Ah. Um, let me check in the kitchen.

                                 ED
                        Sorry for being so persnickety. Just 
                        trying to watch the waistline...  

           As Sheila gets up, she rolls her eyes. Once she's out of the 
           room, Ed "casually" turns his attention to Ben. 

                                 ED (cont'd)
                        It's Benjamin, right?

           Ben nods.

                                 ED 
                        You liking Millinocket so far? Lots 
                        of fun exploring the woods I bet.

           Ben shrugs.

                                 ED
                        You haven't ever... run into anyone 
                        out there, have you? Maybe with your 
                        sister?

           Off Ben...
           INT. HALLWAY. HOSPITAL. NIGHT.

           Henrietta arrives at Dr. Brandt's OFFICE. Peeks in the 
           window -- empty. 

           IN DR. BRANDT'S OFFICE

           Henrietta approaches the messy desk. Pokes around.

           IN THE HALLWAY

           Rounding a corner is... Dr. Brandt.

           IN DR. BRANDT'S OFFICE

           Henrietta searches the desk before finally, beneath some 
           papers, she sees a MANILA ENVELOPE. The bracelet. 

           The doorknob TURNS. Henrietta looks around. Nowhere to hide.

           Brandt enters to find: AN EMPTY OFFICE.

           UNDER THE DESK, Henrietta sits, holding her breath. We hear 
           RUSTLING and then the door SLAMS. She stands to grab the --

           Wait a second. The envelope is GONE.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Oh come on.

           INT. HALLWAY. HOSPITAL. SAME.

           CU on the ENVELOPE, nestled under Dr. Brandt's arm. Behind 
           him, Henrietta surreptitiously follows.

           Dr. Brandt arrives at the NURSES' STATION, passes the 
           envelope to a YOUNG NURSE, 20s, who pulls out his earbuds.

                                 DR. BRANDT
                        For the courier.

                                 YOUNG NURSE
                        You got it, Dr. B.

           As Dr. Brandt walk off, Henrietta looks around and slips 
           into a nearby PATIENT'S ROOM.
           IN THE PATIENT'S ROOM.

           The lights are off. A PATIENT sleeps under covers. Henrietta 
           grabs the CHART at the end of the bed. Forms a plan...

           INT. DINING ROOM. THORNE HOME. SAME.

           Sheila returns with EQUAL PACKETS. Finds Ed and Ben sipping 
           their tea in silence.

                                 SHEILA
                        Voila.

           She slides an Equal across the table. He ignores it.

                                 ED 
                        Benjamin sure is a quiet one, huh.

                                 SHEILA
                        Well, yes he... doesn't speak at all, 
                        actually.
                                 (

                        Oh I thought you might've known from 
                        school. He's deaf, or was, or... well 
                        it's really hard to explain.

           Sheila laughs, so absurd hearing it out loud. Ed stares.

                                 SHEILA (cont'd)
                        Yeah, they're telling me his hearing 
                        loss was maybe reversed somehow by 
                        this bracelet thing he found in a 
                        dumpster? Not that I let my kids root 
                        around --

                        Hey what were you doing rooting 
                        around in a dumpster, anyway?

                                 ED
                        Sorry, a bracelet fixed his hearing?

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh we don't think of it as "fixed." 
                        Deafness isn't a disability --

                                 ED
                        Where is the bracelet now?

                                 (

                        At the hospital. Why?
           Ed stands abruptly.

                                 ED
                        I'm sorry. I just realized, I - I 
                        have to go. I have a... Excuse me.

           He abruptly scoots out. The door slams. Beat. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Well that was weird.

           INT. NURSES STATION. HOSPITAL. SAME.

           Henrietta rushes up to the Young Nurse, listening to his 
           music. She eyes the envelope on the desk in front of him.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        My mommy... she needs help!

                        Huh?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        She's having a reaction to her 
                        Lisinopril medication! 

                                 YOUNG NURSE
                        Oh dang, OK --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        It's taken orally three times a day!

           The Young Nurse gathers his things.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        Room 671. Hurry! She's vomiting all 
                        over the place. Which is a rare side 
                        effect, along with --

                                 YOUNG NURSE
                        OK, OK --

           The Young Nurse starts toward the room, but then stops...

                                 YOUNG NURSE (cont'd)
                        Hold up - your mom's in 671?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Yeah! Please hurry!
                                 YOUNG NURSE
                        ... Your mom is Arthur Johnson?

           Beat. Henrietta SWIPES the envelope and RUNS --

                                 YOUNG NURSE (cont'd)
                        Hey!

           He takes off after Henrietta, who books it towards a set of 
           double doors, she tries them but they're locked!

           The Young Nurse is CATCHING UP --

           Henrietta runs AROUND A CORNER and bursts through the first 
           door she sees, into --

           INT. HOSPITAL BREAK ROOM. SAME.

           Empty, except for TWO EMPLOYEES talking near the coffee 
           maker on the other side of the room. They don't notice 
           Henrietta, but Henrietta definitely notices one of them --

           It's RICHIE - Sheila's date, talking with a FEMALE NURSE. 
           Henrietta freezes, a sitting duck.

                                 RICHIE
                                 (
                                  to Young Nurse
                                               )
                        See, I saw this aurora a few days 
                        before the Rip reactivated, so I 
                        actually knew all this was coming.

           Henrietta rolls her eyes as she searches for an escape route.

                                 (
                                  unimpressed
                                 FEMALE NURSE
                                            )
                        Oh yeah?

                                 RICHIE
                        Yeah, I've seen every ep of Dr. Who, 
                        even the lost Christmas episode with 
                        the fourth doctor. So that's kind of 
                        sharpened my scientific mind.

                                 FEMALE NURSE
                        ... Well, I better get back to it.

                                 RICHIE
                        Oh sure, allow me to escort you.

           And then... they HEAD STRAIGHT FOR HENRIETTA! She turns 
           away, pretending to use a small bottle of HAND SANITIZER. As 
           Richie passes, slows. 
           A hint of recognition on his face...? 

           But then he follows the Female Nurse out the door. Henrietta 
           exhales. Looks at the hand sanitizer, plotting her next move.

           A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Henrietta reaches the ER LOBBY. Almost free. She hugs the 
           envelope tightly as she makes her way across the room.

           The Bored Nurse doesn't even look up... 

           Almost to the door leading outside, Henrietta's lips curl 
           into a smile when --

           The door slides open revealing --

           ED. 

           They freeze. Then a SECURITY GUARD steps between them, 
           facing Henrietta. 

           The Young Nurse CHARGES through the double doors, gasping 
           for air. Henrietta's trapped. Nowhere to go. Defeated.

                                 YOUNG NURSE
                        Not cool, kid.

           He rips the ENVELOPE from her hands. Ed clocks it. 

           The security guard tries to GRAB her, but Henrietta spins 
           away, leaving him holding her jacket. Henrietta looks back 
           as her MAP flutters out of a pocket and to the floor.

           She watches Ed pick it up before she runs out into the 
           night. The security guard starts after her, but the Young 
           Nurse holds up the envelope.

                                 YOUNG NURSE (cont'd)
                        Just let her go.

           Ed unfolds the map - sees the drawn route to the Man's camp.

           AT THE NURSES STATION. A FEW MINUTES LATER.

           The Young Nurse DROPS the envelope on the counter and puts 
           his earbuds in, rocks out. Spins around in his chair to grab 
           a bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos and starts munching. But when 
           he spins back --

           THE ENVELOPE IS GONE.
           He stands up, looks both ways down the hall.

                                 (

                        Son of a bitch.

           EXT. HOSPITAL. NIGHT.

           Ed exits, CARRYING THE ENVELOPE. Rips it open and pulls 
           out --

           THE SMALL BOTTLE OF HAND SANITIZER.

                                                            CUT TO:

           THE BRACELET

           In Henrietta's hand as she bikes up the ROAD, the hospital 
           receding in the distance behind her.   

           EXT./INT. ED'S TRUCK. SAME.

           ENGINE REVS as Ed squeals out of the HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. 
           Henrietta’s MAP unfurled next to him. A PISTOL rests on top.

           EXT. WOODS. LATER.

           On foot now, Henrietta pushes her way through trees. Veers 
           left. But then spins and comes back. Trying to remember her 
           way in the dark, she grows frantic.

           ELSEWHERE IN THE WOODS. 

           Map in hand, Ed emerges at the RIVER ACCESS POINT. 

           Discovers the DAM, put together rock by painstaking rock 
           over many years. He pauses. Impressed. 

                                 ED
                        Clever.

           He wades into the water and PULLS rocks, DISLODGES twigs, 
           YANKS branches. A bit maniacal, destroying years of the 
           Man's work in a matter of minutes.  
           EXT. THE MAN'S CAMP. NIGHT.

           The Man's LIFELESS BODY lies prone, half off the mattress. 

           The PERIMETER WARNING LIGHT flashes, and the Man stirs, but 
           he's too weak to move. Crunching FOOTSTEPS O.S.

           Then, bursting into the A-Frame is --

           Henrietta. Out of breath. Relieved she got there before Ed.

           She pulls the bracelet out of her pocket and squats down to 
           the Man. But as soon as she grabs his arm --

           -- they FLOAT again! A few feet up in the air.

           Henrietta GASPS and lets go, sending them CRASHING TO THE 
           GROUND. The Man GRUNTS in pain.

           Henrietta tries to fasten the bracelet on his wrist without 
           touching him. But her fingertips graze him, and they FLOAT a 
           few inches up...

           This time she's ready for it, keeping her focus as she 
           hovers in the air -- CLICKING the bracelet in place. 

           Once they're no longer touching, they PLUNK back down.

           The Man lies there, still. And nothing happens. No red 
           light. No "Health Forward" insignia. Nothing. 

           Is she too late?

           Beat.

           Then the flashing light GLOWS RED. "Health Forward" emerges.

           She relaxes. But then remembers ED. She leans in close to 
           the Man, careful not to touch him.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Hey. Hey --

           The Man doesn't move.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        No chance you can walk, right?

           No response. He's covered in blood. His breathing, shallow. 
           He can barely move let alone walk.

           Henrietta sighs, looks around. Tries to find something, 
           anything she can use to move him.
           Then an idea forms. A very very crazy idea...

           A MINUTE LATER

           Henrietta has draped a blanket over the Man's shivering 
           body. She POKES him with a STICK until he wakes. But he 
           immediately drifts off again --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        No! No. You have to stay awake for 
                        this. Please. Someone's coming. 

           He manages to hold his head up. Nods weakly.

           Then with a deep breath -- 

                         -- Henrietta takes him by the hand --

                                         -- and they float up in the air.

           They hang there, a few feet up, as she gathers herself. 

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        Whoa... OK... Now what?

           The Man looks to his feet. Takes a "step" in mid-air...

           They move forward. 

           Henrietta follows suit and steps forward, using her other 
           hand to "swim" through the air. They gain momentum. Make 
           their way out of the A-Frame and toward the boulders...

           JUST OUTSIDE THE MAN'S CAMP.

           Ed tiptoes through the boulders, PISTOL up, finger on the 
           trigger. 

           He finds the entrance to the camp and heads in -- 

           EMPTY. Ed lowers his gun.

           ELSEWHERE IN THE WOODS.

           Henrietta keeps stepping and "swimming," struggling to steer 
           them around trees. Eventually, the woods grow too dense, and 
           they CRASH into pine after pine.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Oof - sorry!
           The Man reaches over. He interlocks his arm into hers and 
           pulls them close so their sides are touching...

                                     ***WHOOSH*** 

                                                    They FLY STRAIGHT UP! 

           Above the trees, they're still ascending -- a bit too fast 
           and a bit too high -- so the Man pushes Henrietta away...

           But he pushes too hard, so that only their hands are 
           touching, and Henrietta SCREAMS as they PLUMMET BACK DOWN!

           After a few more fits and starts -- rising then 
           plummeting -- they find the right amount of contact that 
           enables them to more or less hover above the trees. 

           More steady now, they sail through the night, flying over 
           the forest, awkwardly tumbling and twisting through space.

           A beautiful, moon-lit ballet. 

           Henrietta squeals in delight. Even the Man manages a smile. 

           And then, in the distance, Henrietta sees the THORNE HOME.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        Now how do we land? 

           The Man slowly releases her arm and they lower a bit. Then 
           he UNCLASPS his hand from hers, finger by finger, and they 
           float gently toward the ground... 

                                                      FADE TO BLACK:

           FADE IN ON THE MAN'S FACE.

           The color has returned. Opening his eyes, he looks better. 
           The bracelet on his wrist, however, still glows RED. 

           THE MAN'S POV: Henrietta enters frame, blinks down at us. 
           We're in THE SHED. The sun shines through the window. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Hi.

           The Man manages to prop himself up on his elbows. 

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        They left for Bangor, so the coast is 
                        clear. You hungry?
           INT. DINING ROOM. THORNE HOME. LATER.

           Chips, salsa, cookies and whatever else Henrietta could 
           scrounge. She nibbles while the Man DEVOURS. Been a long 
           time since he could freely eat junk.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        So I have a buttload of questions. 
                        You can probably guess the first...

                                 THE MAN
                        More efficient if you just asked.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I mean, we float whenever we touch.

           He chews, mouth full. She looks at him expectantly.

                                 THE MAN
                        There was no question.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        My question is what the hell's going 
                        on?!

           A beat until he swallows the food.

                                 THE MAN
                        Difficult to say. My presence causes 
                        any number of unexpected reactions.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Anomalies. 

           He nods, then helps himself to more cookies.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        So it is all you. The storms, the 
                        cicadas, it's all because you're from 
                        the future. 

                                 THE MAN
                                  nodding
                                        )
                                 (
                        Mm hmm.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        But... why?

                                 THE MAN
                        My theory? I've disrupted the fabric 
                        of space-time. The more I change 
                        things, the larger the reaction.
                                 HENRIETTA
                        But everything you do changes things. 

                                 THE MAN
                        To a degree, yes.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Even us talking like this. How come 
                        there aren't any anomalies now?

                                 THE MAN
                        Just because we can't see them 
                        doesn't mean they aren't there.

           INT. KITCHEN. THORNE HOME. A MINUTE LATER.

           Water boils in a POT on the stove. Steam WAFTS. 

                                 THE MAN
                        If I alter things in a small way, the 
                        reaction will be correspondingly 
                        small. Us talking causes a reaction, 
                        but it's microscopic. Molecules 
                        bouncing differently, too tiny for 
                        humans to perceive.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        OK... 

                                 THE MAN

                                 (
                                                   )
                        But if I do something a bit more 
                        impactful, like, say, reveal 
                        something about the future...  
                                  beat, as he thinks
                        In five years, the VR game "Dino 
                        Hunt" will revolutionize gaming. It 
                        will literally break the Internet. 

           Beat. Henrietta looks confused. The Man smirks.

                                 THE MAN (cont'd)
                        Small changes, small reactions.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Small reactions? What reac --

           The Man nods towards the boiling pot, and when Henrietta 
           sees it, her face goes slack. 

           The flame still burns underneath, but the water no longer 
           boils. In fact, it's FROZEN SOLID.
                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        What happens if you change something 
                        really big?

                                 THE MAN
                        It would be... bad.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        How bad?

                                 THE MAN
                        I can only make projections, but 
                        likely... end of the world bad.

                                                            CUT TO:

           A STAR CLUSTER AT NIGHT, SEEN THROUGH A TELESCOPE LENS

           REVEAL Henrietta and the Man, in the THORNE BACKYARD, taking 
           turns looking through Henrietta's telescope.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        But just you being here has changed 
                        things. You've set the whole world on 
                        a totally different path.

                                 THE MAN
                        That one troubled me for some time...

           The Man pans the telescope, then leans back. She looks 
           through the viewfinder: He's focused it on the Rip.

                                 THE MAN (cont'd)
                        Even when I isolated myself, when I 
                        disconnected from society so that 
                        there were no more perceptible 
                        anomalies, the Rip never went away.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        ... Because the Rip is an anomaly.

                                 THE MAN
                        It's here because I'm here. It grows 
                        because my presence changes 
                        everything. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        ... why are you here? 

           The Man takes a beat, then looks down.
                                 THE MAN
                        It was an accident. An experiment 
                        gone wrong.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        So you never even meant to be here 
                        and now you're just trying to prevent 
                        anomalies. That's why you're stuck 
                        hiding in the woods.

           He nods.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                                 (
                                  realizes
                                         )
                        I ruined it! You can’t go back out 
                        there, now that the janitor knows...

                                 THE MAN
                        It’s OK. The forest is large. I’ll 
                        find another spot.

           She watches him a beat.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        It's all just so sad. 

                                 THE MAN
                        It's what I deserve. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        What does that mean?

                                 THE MAN
                        In my time, I... I hurt people.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Well, you're making up for it now. 
                        You're sacrificing your whole life to 
                        protect people. To save the world.

           He doesn't respond.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        How did you figure all this out?

                                 THE MAN
                        I've had a long time to experiment. 
                        To note trends, accumulate data.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        And you discovered that whenever you 
                        touch somebody, you float?
                                 THE MAN
                        That never happened before. Not until 
                        I met you.

           The Man stares up at the stars a beat, and then --

                                 THE MAN (cont'd)
                        Hey, there's something I always 
                        wanted to show my kids and... never 
                        got the chance.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        What is it?

           Beat. The Man smiles.

                                 CARL SAGAN (V.O.)
                        The cosmos is all that is, or ever 
                        was, or ever will be.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. THORNE HOME. LATER.

           ORCHESTRAL MUSIC plays. The Man and Henrietta eat popcorn on 
           the couch. Colors from a TV screen flicker in their eyes. 

                                 CARL SAGAN (TV)
                        Our contemplations of the cosmos stir 
                        us. There's a tingling of the spine, 
                        a catch in the voice, a faint 
                        sensation as if a distant memory of 
                        falling from a great height. We know 
                        we are approaching the grandest of 
                        mysteries.

           ON THE TV: The original "COSMOS" with CARL SAGAN. 

                                 CARL SAGAN
                        We are made of star stuff. We are a 
                        way for the cosmos to know itself.

           ANGLE ON the Man and Henrietta, happier than we've ever seen 
           them.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. THORNE HOME. MORNING.

           The Man SNORES on the floor. Henrietta lies asleep on a  
           couch. Empty pizza boxes, candy wrappers, and science books 
           litter the place. Like a slumber party for science nerds.  

           It's peaceful. It's quiet. Then --
           DING DONG!

           The Man SHOOTS UP. Awake in a heartbeat. He dashes to the 
           window and peeks through the curtain as Henrietta comes to.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Who is it?!

                                 THE MAN
                        A child. 

           Confused, Henrietta joins the Man, sees DUSTIN outside, 
           holding a scrapbook. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Oh no. It's Saturday! I forgot I made 
                        plans with this kid in my class to 
                        look at obituaries.
                                 (
                                  off the Man's look
                                                   )
                        Long story. You better go hide. My 
                        closet's full of stuffed animals. You 
                        can blend in.

                                 (
                                 THE MAN
                                  honestly confused
                                                  )
                        I look nothing like a stuffed animal. 

           DING DONG!

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Just get out of sight, OK?! I'll get 
                        rid of him... 

           The Man goes upstairs as Henrietta opens the door. She slips 
           out onto the porch, closing the door behind her.

                                 DUSTIN
                        Huzzah! I know I'm a bit late, but my 
                        dad's obsessed with building a bomb 
                        shelter before the next Rip thing 
                        and --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Listen, I'm real sorry about this but 
                        I can't actually hang out right now.

           Dustin can't hide his disappointment.

                                 DUSTIN
                        Oh. Yeah. Sure. No problem...
                                 HENRIETTA
                        It's just, I'm working on something 
                        and I really need to --

                                 DUSTIN
                        Maybe I could help?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Ah, yeah, I don't think so. It's, uh, 
                        it's pretty heady stuff. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        OK. I get it. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Maybe we can reschedule?

                                 DUSTIN
                        No, no. You don't have to say that --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I'm not just saying it. The truth is 
                        it's been a real crazy couple days 
                        and I - I just gotta go, OK? 

           As she turns to head back inside --

                                 DUSTIN
                        Wait! I, uh, I wasn't gonna tell you 
                        about this yet, but I'm working on a 
                        really big story...

                                 HENRIETTA
                        For the paper?

                                 DUSTIN
                        More of a side project, actually. But 
                        it's an amazing scoop. I haven't 
                        quite confirmed everything, but I 
                        think you should know --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Cool! You can tell me all about it  
                        at school on Monday. Thanks for 
                        understanding.

           Henrietta heads back inside, closing the door behind her. 
           Dustin STICKS his foot out to stop it from shutting.

                                 DUSTIN
                        But I really think you should know...
           Dustin trails off as Henrietta has already bounded up the 
           stairs. Then he notices the state of the living room. The 
           evidence of a slumber party. He shakes his head.

                                 DUSTIN (cont'd)
                        Heady stuff.

           Disappointed, Dustin leaves, the door STILL OPEN.

           INT. BEN AND HENRIETTA'S ROOM. THORNE HOME. SAME.

           The Man stares at the closet full of stuffed animals. Shakes 
           his head. As Henrietta enters, he admires all her gear.

                                 THE MAN
                        Quite the scientist, aren't you?

           Henrietta shrugs, then proudly points out items on her 
           desk -- chemistry set, Milky Way mobile, microscope...

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I got this set in third grade when I 
                        taught myself to make slime, I made 
                        this for my science fair, oh and I 
                        got the scope in a yard sale so I 
                        could see a spider web up close. 

           She pauses when she comes to the Albert Einstein doll. 

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        This was from my dad. I guess he got 
                        it for me when I was born. Now it's 
                        the only thing I have of his.
                                 (
                                  then
                                     )
                        Sometimes I talk to it cuz it feels 
                        like, in a way, he can hear me. 

           The Man has tears in his eyes. Something occurs to Henrietta.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        You never got to say goodbye to your 
                        family. Cuz you came back by accident. 

           He nods. 

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        You must really miss them. 
                                 (
                                  then
                                     )
                        Nobody knows about that shed but me 
                        and my brother. You could stay there.

           The Man smiles. But --
                                 THE MAN
                        I wish I could.

           IN THE LIVING ROOM

           As they reach the bottom of the stairs -- 

           -- they notice the front door WIDE OPEN.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        AnnusMirabilis1905?

           Henrietta spins to find a woman (40s) with ROUND GLASSES and 
           a warm smile sitting on the couch. Standing behind her, a 
           man (also 40s) in a DARK SUIT.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Uh, who are you and what --

                                 ROUND GLASSES (FORMERLY VOICE)
                        I'm Bohrisabore123. From the Science 
                        forum message boards. Remember?

           Henrietta is flabbergasted. The Man notices Dark Suit's 
           holstered GUN.

                                 ROUND GLASSES
                        We mean no harm, sir. We just need to 
                        speak to your daughter. It's urgent. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        He - he's my grandpa. Grandpa Albert.

                                 ROUND GLASSES
                        Nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosalind 
                        Wells.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        How... did you know where I live? 

                                 ROUND GLASSES
                        You never did call that hotline, so... 
                        I am sorry about this, but we had to 
                        use a Stingray to track your phone.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Stringray?
                                 ROUND GLASSES
                        Shoot, I'm getting ahead of myself. I 
                        work out of Goddard - for NASA - and 
                        I'm studying the potential origins of 
                        the Rip.

           INT. DINING ROOM. THORNE HOME. DAY.

           Henrietta sits opposite Round Glasses, while the Man stands 
           in the doorway, watching Dark Suit pace.

                                 ROUND GLASSES
                        We monitor chatter on every science 
                        blog, forum, message board and DM on 
                        the net. So when I read your post --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I'm sorry you came all the way out 
                        here. I don't know anything.

                                 ROUND GLASSES
                        Henrietta, I'm a scientist, too, you 
                        know. 
                                 (
                                  then, to the Man
                                                 )
                        Your granddaughter reminds me a lot 
                        of me when I was her age.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Now that I think about it, I'm not 
                        even sure exactly what I saw.

           Dark Suit swoops in. His frustration evident...

                                 DARK SUIT
                        We just need to know where you saw --

           Round Glasses holds up a hand and Dark Suit shuts up. Round 
           Glasses smiles anew and leans in.

                                 ROUND GLASSES
                        You know I cried when I first saw the 
                        Rip. I thought, how lucky am I to 
                        have the chance to solve the greatest 
                        mystery in the history of the world?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        ... I get that.

                        I've been following every lead for 13 
                        years. Tracking every sighting.

                        You're the only person on Earth who 
                        credibly cited an anomaly in the days 
                        before the Rip started growing again.

                        vibrational spectroscopy of the air 
                        around where you saw this aurora... 
                        Henrietta, you could be part of the 
                        answer we've all been looking for.  

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I... don't remember where I saw it. 
                        In the woods somewhere. It was dark. 
                        Sorry.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. THORNE HOME. A MINUTE LATER.

           Round Glasses and Dark Suit exit, Henrietta closing the door 
           behind them. The Man watches through the window. 

                                 THE MAN
                        Might be harder than anticipated to 
                        get out of here unnoticed.

           THROUGH THE WINDOW: Round Glasses and Dark Suit get into an 
           unmarked BLACK SUV. Two more BLACK SUVs behind them. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        This is all my fault. If I just left 
                        you alone, like you asked --

                                 THE MAN
                        It's OK --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        No. You need to get far away. And I'm 
                        gonna help. 

           INT. KITCHEN. THORNE HOME. LATER.

           Henrietta pulls a can of spinach from the back of the 
           pantry. Stuffs it into a duffel. Searches for more...

                                 HENRIETTA
                        She'll never notice these are gone.  
                        What else do you want? Heart of palm?

                                 THE MAN
                        Really, I can make it fine on my --

           KEYS DANGLE outside. Henrietta scoots over to the window. 
                                 HENRIETTA
                        What the - it's my mother!

           Sheila's at the back door. The Man makes a break for the 
           living room just as the lock turns, and the door opens --

           -- Not knowing what else to do, Henrietta just holds out her 
           arms. Ta-da! Sheila stares at her a beat, confused, then --

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        You're back early!

                                 SHEILA
                        Don't get me started. When the 
                        "specialist" got into your brother's 
                        gluten intake, we were outta there.

                                  realizing
                                 HENRIETTA
                                          )
                                 (
                        Where is Ben?

           IN THE LIVING ROOM: The Man stands frozen. Through the 
           window, he can see Ben letting his hamster out of its cage 
           to run around the porch. Blocking the Man's way out. Then -- 

                                 HENRIETTA (O.S.)
                        I'll get him! You stay in here! 

                                 SHEILA (O.S.)
                        What's the matter with you? 

           Hearing them approach, the Man hurries UPSTAIRS just as 
           Sheila enters, Henrietta on her heels. 

           Sheila crosses to the window, knocks. Ben looks over.

                                 SHEILA
                        Come inside. It's getting dark.

                                 BEN
                        Bazooka needs exercise.

                                 SHEILA
                        Put him in his ball then. Henry, come 
                        help me with the luggage.

           As Henrietta looks around, confused and concerned, Ben 
           scoops up the hamster...

                                                            CUT TO:
           A HAMSTER BALL, ROLLING DOWN THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.

           Bazooka runs with abandon, Ben following, into BEN AND 
           HENRIETTA'S ROOM. The ball crashes into the CLOSET DOOR.

           Then it stops, backs up, and CRASHES into it again.

           And again.

           Ben notices. Squats down to watch Bazooka with interest.

           The hamster is scrambling to get at the closet door, backing 
           up and crashing into it now on repeat. Really freaking out.

           Ben reaches for the door to open it when --

                                 HENRIETTA 
                        Ben!

           He turns to find Henrietta running in. She glances to the 
           closet. He looks at her expectantly. She thinks fast...

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Ken Burns' Vietnam doc is on TV 
                        again. Just started.

           Ben excitedly grabs the hamster ball and runs out. As soon 
           as he's gone, Henrietta slams the door. Exhales. 

           She opens the closet to find the Man, standing there among 
           the stuffed animals.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        Fine. The closet was a bad idea.

           Henrietta walks over to the window and opens it.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                                 (
                                  off the Man's look
                                                   )
                        One more night in the shed. Sorry.

           INT. KITCHEN. THORNE HOME. THE NEXT MORNING.

           Sheila enters. It's spotless. Breakfast is on the table. 

                                 SHEILA
                        What in the world?

           Henrietta appears.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I made breakfast.
                                 SHEILA
                        You cleaned the kitchen, too. And was 
                        that a 'mom' I just heard?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Was it? I didn't realize...

                                 SHEILA
                        Uh huh. And what is it that you want?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        A ride. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Yep, there it is.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        There's this botanical garden, about 
                        thirty miles down highway 157. They 
                        have this flower there called the 
                        Agalinis neoscotica. Well, that's the 
                        scientific name. You'd know it as the 
                        False Foxglove --

                                 SHEILA
                        I really wouldn't.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Anyway, I'm doing an experiment on --

                                 SHEILA
                        OK OK. I'm just glad to see you're 
                        back to your old self. We'll go after 
                        breakfast.

           Henrietta smiles big.

           EXT./INT. SHEILA'S TOYOTA. DAY.

           Sheila drives down a rural road. Passes a truck parked on 
           the shoulder. INSIDE: Ed. He starts to follow...

           INT. SHEILA'S TOYOTA. MINUTES LATER.

           Henrietta's in the passenger seat, Ben in back. 

                                 SHEILA
                        OK Ben, you're gonna like this one...

           Sheila presses a button on her phone, and the opening chords 
           of The Flaming Lips' "Do You Realize" play. Ben nods, sways.
                                 SHEILA (cont'd)
                        Right?!

           Ben leans back and closes his eyes. They drive a few beats.

           But then, as Sheila makes a TIGHT TURN, Ben hears something 
           RUMBLE AROUND in the trunk. He opens his eyes.

           Another quick turn and another RUMBLE from behind. He looks 
           through the back windshield at the trunk, but he sees --

           -- a black SUV. Tailing them. And then, FLASHING LIGHTS.

                                 SHEILA (cont'd)
                        Are you kidding me?! I wasn't even 
                        speeding.

           Henrietta turns around and sees the SUV.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Don't pull over.

                                 SHEILA
                        What? Oh, don't be ridiculous.

           Sheila slows to a stop. 

           The first SUV is trailed by another. And a THIRD. Once they 
           all stop, ROUND GLASSES and DARK SUIT get out of the first.

                                 SHEILA (cont'd)
                        What's going on?

           Through Sheila's side mirror: Dark Suit approaches. Leans 
           down to the driver-side window. Scopes it out.

                                 DARK SUIT
                        Ma'am, please step out of the 
                        vehicle. Henrietta...

                                 SHEILA
                        How do you know my daughter's --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        They came to the house earlier.

                                 (
                                 SHEILA
                                  as she gets out
                                                )
                        What? Why didn't you say anything?!

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I didn't think it was a big deal!
           Sheila walks away, answering Dark Suit's questions. Then 
           Henrietta hears the backdoor OPEN. Ben's getting out, too.

                                 (
                                  urgent whisper
                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                                               )
                        Ben, stay in the --

           But he's already out. Round Glasses appears at the passenger 
           side window. Leans down. Smiles thinly. 

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        Howdy.

                                 ROUND GLASSES
                        You don't have a Grandpa Albert. You 
                        lied to me, Henrietta.

           Henrietta doesn't respond. Ben makes his way to the TRUNK. 

                                 ROUND GLASSES (cont'd)
                        Matter of fact, you don't have any 
                        living grandparents, do you? 

           Ben puts his ear against the trunk. Listening.

                                 ROUND GLASSES (cont'd)
                        Henrietta... Who was that man, and 
                        where is he now?

           Henrietta glances to Ben in the side mirror and Round 
           Glasses notices. She looks at Ben, too. 

           Henrietta watches with growing dread as Round Glasses heads 
           back to join Ben at the trunk. 

                                 ROUND GLASSES (cont'd)
                                 (
                                  to Sheila
                                          )
                        Can we get this trunk open, ma'am?

           Sheila and Dark Suit turn, make their way over.

                                 DARK SUIT
                        What is it?

                                 ROUND GLASSES
                        I'm not sure yet. I'd just like to --

           But the car's ENGINE turns over, and it LURCHES AWAY!

                                 SHEILA
                        Henrietta!
           Sheila stands there stunned, as Round Glasses and Dark Suit 
           RUN back to their SUV. 

                                 SHEILA (cont'd)
                        Hey...

           The SUVs - ALL OF THEM - take off after Henrietta.

                                 SHEILA (cont'd)
                        Hey!

           As the SUVS head down the road, Sheila and Ben are stranded.

                                 SHEILA (cont'd)
                        What about us?!!!

           INT. SHEILA'S TRUNK. SAME.

           The Man lies scrunched, bouncing and rolling this way and 
           that as he hears Henrietta's muffled SCREAM O.S. 

                                 THE MAN
                        What is happening?!

                                 HENRIETTA (O.S.)
                        They're chasing us! And I'm driving!

           As that lands, he starts KICKING against the backseat.

           IN THE CAR: The back seat LURCHES with each KICK, but it 
           holds. Police lights FLASH behind them. Sirens BLARE.

           Henrietta SCREAMS again. It's insanity. But then --

           EXT. SHEILA'S TOYOTA. SAME.

           Henrietta plods along, maybe going 15 MPH. The SUVs trail a 
           few car lengths behind. It's like Bullitt. In slo-mo.

           Dark Suit gets on a LOUDSPEAKER --

                                 DARK SUIT
                        HENRIETTA. STOP THE CAR! 

           INT. SHEILA'S TOYOTA. SAME.

           Another KICK and the seat back FLIES OPEN! The Man rolls 
           onto the backseat. 
                                 THE MAN
                        What are you doing?! You don't know 
                        how to drive!

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Don't you think I know that?!

                                 THE MAN
                        Go. FASTER.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I can barely reach the pedal!

           Henrietta's cell phone RINGS. Fumbling as she drives, she 
           sees it's her mom. SILENCES it. 

           One of the SUV's PASSES them and skids to a halt in the 
           middle of the road up ahead. Blocking their path.

           The Man thinks fast. Then --

                                 THE MAN
                        Hang on.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        What are you --

           Before she can finish her question, he puts a hand on her 
           shoulder. They FLOAT UP -- and BUMP INTO THE CAR CEILING!

           Her foot no longer on the gas, the Toyota SLOWS TO A STOP. 
           The Man lets go, and they both fall back into their seats.

                                 THE MAN
                        Damn. 

           EXT. SHEILA'S TOYOTA. SAME. 

           WIDE SHOT: the SUVs behind them pull to a stop as well. All 
           four cars sit still. But there's MOVEMENT inside the Toyota.

                                 DARK SUIT
                                 (
                                            )
                                  loudspeaker
                        STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE.

           A long beat. Then another. Agents start to get out of the 
           SUVs and then... the Toyota takes off!
           INT. SHEILA'S TOYOTA. SAME.

           The Man's behind the wheel now. He swerves around the SUV, 
           SCRAPING against the guard rail. Henrietta gives him a look.

                                 THE MAN
                        It's been a while, OK!? Put on your 
                        seat belt. 

           She does, and he maneuvers them back onto the open road. All 
           three SUVs again follow, only now everybody's driving FAST.

           The Man checks the rear view. Shakes his head.

                                 THE MAN (cont'd)
                        We're never going to outrun them. 

           His eyes dart. His mind in overdrive. And then he sees 
           something --

           -- he makes a sharp turn onto another road. Now driving 
           alongside a RIVER. Presses the gas. Henrietta is confused.

                                 THE MAN (cont'd)
                        Next year, the Chicago Cubs will lose 
                        a record 121 games.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Huh? Who are the Chicago Cubs?!

                                 THE MAN
                        Just listen! Remember the boiling 
                        water?

           He turns OFF ROAD and careens towards the flowing RIVER.

                                 THE MAN (cont'd)
                        In 2024 we find evidence of microbial 
                        life on Jupiter's moon Europa. 

           The SUVs follow. They're headed straight for the water! 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        It's not working! Stop the car! 

           The Man's face twists in consternation, then, desperate --

                                 THE MAN
                        I didn't come back by accident.

           Behind them, the SUVs slam on the brakes. But the Man FLOORS 
           IT. At the river now. Henrietta turns to him...
                                 THE MAN (cont'd)
                        I... I invented time travel. 

           Just as they reach the river's edge -- 

                                                      -- IT FREEZES OVER!

           INSIDE THE SUV: Dark Suit and Round Glasses watch the Toyota 
           drive safely across the now frozen river, mouths agape.

           INSIDE SHEILA'S TOYOTA: The Man and Henrietta SCREAM!

           BACK WITH THE SUV: Dark Suit hits the gas. Reaches the edge 
           of the river to find -- the ice melting. SLAMS the brakes 
           and skids to a stop just before they hit the water.

           ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER: As they drive off, Henrietta 
           looks back across the river at the SUVs. Her phone RINGS 
           again. The Man grabs it and TOSSES it out the window.

           EXT./INT. SHEILA'S TOYOTA. A FEW MINUTES LATER. 

           Mountains loom in the b.g. Sheila's Toyota careens into a 
           quaint "downtown," one main drag with shops on either side. 
           American flags hang from nearly every storefront.

           Henrietta clocks one store that's boarded up with a sign out 
           front: "Closed for the end of the world!"

                                 THE MAN
                        Gotta get rid of this car. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Why?

                                 THE MAN
                        After what they just saw, we've only 
                        got a few minutes before every 
                        satellite over the western hemisphere 
                        will be looking for us.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Right. 
                                 (
                                  then
                                     )
                        That was... incredible. 

                                 THE MAN
                        It was, wasn't it?

           They allow themselves a beat to laugh in disbelief. Then --
                                 HENRIETTA
                        You invented time travel...

           The Man's smile fades.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        Just so you could hide out in the 
                        woods? Why would you do that?

           He can't bring himself to look at her as he pulls to a stop 
           at an intersection. Then, with a deep breath he turns -- but  
           Henrietta is staring past him, terror in her eyes...

           The Man spins to find ED'S TRUCK barreling towards them at 
           full speed. He has time for just one word --

                                 THE MAN
                        Oliver?

           Before the truck PLOWS INTO THE DRIVER'S SIDE of the Toyota!

           -- THEY SPIN -- AND SPIN --

           And then CRASH into a LIGHT POST.

                                                       CUT TO BLACK.

           WE HEAR A RINGING...

           FADE IN on Henrietta. She's woozy, her forehead BLEEDS and 
           the world is out of focus. 

           She looks at the Man, BLOODIED and UNCONSCIOUS.

           Through the window, she sees TOWNSFOLK exit stores to check 
           out what happened. Henrietta's eyes flutter...

           SMACK!

           She's startled by a DEAD BIRD SPLATTERING against the 
           windshield.

           SMACK. Another. Henrietta looks up --

           Specks. Getting larger. DEAD BIRDS RAINING DOWN. 

           SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! 

           The townsfolk SCREAM and run for cover. And then --

           CLUNK! The driver side door is pulled open with a crowbar. 

           It's Ed. As he reaches into the car, Henrietta sees -- 
           ON ED'S WRIST, A BRACELET. 

           Just like the Man's, but a different hue. She is staggered.

                                 HENRIETTA
                                  so weak
                                        )
                                 (
                        ... You too?

           Ed ignores her as he DRAGS the Man out of the car. She 
           reaches out to stop him but she's too dazed and debilitated.

           Finally, the RINGING in her ears dies down and she manages 
           to unbuckle her seat belt. Pushes against her door. Won't 
           budge. Tries again, using all her strength.

           The door swings open and she tumbles from the car only to 
           see Ed's truck SQUEAL away...

           The dead birds stop falling. LOOKY-LOOS re-emerge from the 
           safety of the stores, descending on the crash site just as 
           Henrietta hears distant SIRENS. THEY'RE COMING.

           She backs away from the crash and TAKES OFF. 

           Running down Main Street, she turns a corner and almost 
           smacks into --

                                 DUSTIN 
                        Henrietta?

           She skids to a stop. DUSTIN'S DAD, 30s, slovenly and 
           disheveled, stands behind him chewing tobacco. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        Did you see those birds?! We were 
                        over at the hardware store when --

           Dustin notices Henrietta's frantic energy and bleeding face.

                                 DUSTIN (cont'd)
                        Whoa - you OK? A bird hit your face or 
                        something?

           The sirens are louder now. GETTING CLOSER.

                                 HENRIETTA
                                        )
                                 (
                                  intense
                        I need a ride.

                                 DUSTIN
                        Oh. Uh, Dad? 
           Henrietta peeks around the corner, the SUVs approach the 
           intersection.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Please... 

           Henrietta grabs Dustin's hand.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        NOW. 

           INT. ED'S APARTMENT. ABANDONED BUILDING. DAY.

           Ed carries the Man, battered, bruised and unconscious, over 
           his shoulder in a fireman's carry. Dumps him onto the floor. 

           Checks to make sure his own bracelet is still in place 
           before he bends over --

           -- and REMOVES THE MAN'S BRACELET. As Ed looks down at the 
           Man and tries to catch his breath...

           INT. DUSTIN'S DAD'S OLD BEATER. SAME.

           Dustin and Henrietta sit in back as his dad chugs a red bull 
           behind the wheel. Henrietta stares off, in her own world. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        I'm just gonna call out the elephant 
                        in the room. Your slumber party. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        ... What?

                                 DUSTIN
                        It would've been better if you just 
                        told me the truth is all.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        The truth about what --

                                 DUSTIN
                        I saw it. All the snacks and blankets 
                        and... you know if you didn't want to 
                        hang out, you could have simply --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I wasn't having a slumber party. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        OK, whatever.
                                 HENRIETTA
                        You don't... understand.

           Henrietta turns away as her eyes well with tears. She can't 
           hold it in though, and the tears flow. She SNIFFLES audibly. 

                                 DUSTIN
                        Oh, um, sorry, I... I didn't want --

           He cuts himself off. Watches her cry, deeply uncomfortable.

                                 DUSTIN (cont'd)
                        It's not a big deal, I - you can have 
                        slumber parties. Not that I should 
                        even tell you what you can and can't 
                        do. Like Mrs. Potts says, women have 
                        agency, I just --

           Henrietta can't help but laugh through her tears at Dustin's 
           awkwardness. She wipes her face, then resets. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I'm sorry. About yesterday. I'm just 
                        going through a lot right now.

           Beat. Then Dustin smiles big and leans in, excited.

                                 DUSTIN
                        I got just the thing to cheer you up. 
                        I've been burying the lede! I 
                        confirmed my big scoop, and I - let me 
                        just start from the beginning. So I 
                        was poking around online that day you 
                        told us about your dad, and I thought, 
                        hey, wouldn't it be cool if I could 
                        find his obit.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Wait, what?

                                 DUSTIN
                                 (
                                  not breathing
                                              )
                        Yeah, but I came up empty, which is 
                        pretty rare cause I'm usually really 
                        good at that sort of thing. Anyway I 
                        got a little bit obsessed, and I 
                        eventually realized your mom goes by 
                        her maiden name, Thorne -- 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Dustin --
                                 DUSTIN
                        -- so I did some more digging and 
                        found your parents' wedding 
                        announcement, and then I discovered 
                        your dad's real last name was Visser, 
                        but as far as I can tell the only 
                        dead Griffin Visser kicked the bucket 
                        a hundred and fifty years ago!

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I don't understand.

                                 DUSTIN
                        But then I found out that there's 
                        actually one other Griffin Visser and 
                        he's listed as a physics professor at 
                        Cal Tech right now!

           Henrietta just looks at Dustin, totally confused.

                                 DUSTIN (cont'd)
                        Henrietta, did you go to your dad's 
                        funeral?

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I was too young. I don't remember. 
                        Why?

                                 DUSTIN
                        I think your dad is alive.

           INT. ED'S APARTMENT. ABANDONED BUILDING. DAY.

           ANGLE ON THE MAN'S FACE as he slowly comes to. Still on the 
           floor. Checks his wrist to find his bracelet missing --

                                 ED
                        Hello, old friend.

           Across the room, Ed sits on a crate, twiddling the bracelet.

                                 ED (cont'd)
                        I had to take it off, you understand. 
                        Couldn't risk you getting your strength 
                        back. Not when we're so close.

           The Man clocks the PISTOL on the floor next to Ed.

                                 THE MAN
                        Oliver...
                                 (
                                 ED
                                  wistful
                                        )
                        Haven't heard that name in ages.
                                 (
                                  then
                                     )
                        I've imagined this moment, every day, 
                        for thirteen years... Do you have any 
                        idea what I've been through? I'll 
                        never see my wife again. My kids...

                                 THE MAN
                        I didn't make you come back. 

                                 ED
                        You left me no choice!

                                 THE MAN
                        How did you even...

           The Man's brow furrows. Realizing.

                                 THE MAN (cont'd)
                        You were in the cylinder...

           Ed nods.

                                 THE MAN (cont'd)
                        Tipler postulated it was impossible --

                                 ED
                        -- but we always thought the light 
                        cones would tilt such that they 
                        would --

                                 THE MAN
                        -- spin along the longitudinal axis.

                                 ED
                        Yes. Turns out the frame-dragging --

                                 THE MAN
                        -- pointed the cones backwards.

                                 ED
                        Exactly. That's right. We were right.

           The Man manages a satisfied chuckle. Ed does too, in spite 
           of himself. For a beat, they forget their differences. 

           But then Ed grows serious. Incredulous.
                                 ED (cont'd)
                        Even now, you're more interested in 
                        the science of how we both traveled 
                        in time than the damage its caused. 

                                 THE MAN
                                 (
                                  defensive
                                          )
                        I went into hiding. I didn't --

           The Man notices Ed's JANITOR BADGE, hanging off of a chair.

                                 THE MAN (cont'd)
                                 (
                                  realizing
                                          )
                        You're the janitor.
                                  then
                                 (
                                     )
                        You criticize me when you went to 
                        work at a school?!

                                 ED
                        I got desperate! Time was running out, 
                        so yes, I got a job. Figured when she 
                        came along, you would follow. 

                                 THE MAN
                        ... so what now?

           Ed leans back. Picks up the gun.

                                 ED
                        Now we wait. Until it's over.

           EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY.

           The SUVs surround the scene of the accident. Round Glasses 
           interviews a TOWNIE when Dark Suit approaches --

                                 DARK SUIT
                        Store owner saw the other guy drag a 
                        man into his truck and drive off. Got 
                        the plate number and local PD spotted 
                        it outside a building a few miles 
                        away.

           Round Glasses and Dark Suit hurry to their SUV...

           EXT./INT. DUSTIN'S DAD'S OLD BEATER. DAY. 

           Dustin's dad pulls into the Thorne driveway. Henrietta moves 
           to open the door before the old beater even stops. 
                                 DUSTIN'S DAD
                        Whoa, slow down, kid.

           Henrietta hops out.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Sorry thanks bye!

           Dustin and his dad watch her run to the house. Beat.

                                 DUSTIN
                        She's great, right?

           INT. BEN AND HENRIETTA'S ROOM. THORNE HOME. DAY.

           Henrietta's on her computer. Typing into a search bar:  

                                 Griffin Visser Caltech

           We stay on her as she reads, and we can see it on her face. 
           It's true. Her dad is alive. Her whole world crumbles...

           INT. ED'S APARTMENT. ABANDONED BUILDING. SAME.

           The Man's eyes are half-closed. Slumped even more. Across 
           the way, Ed looks a bit better. His bracelet working.

                                 THE MAN
                        You know she might not even run away.

                                 ED
                        How's that?

                                 THE MAN
                        You remember Kassapa's theory. Our 
                        very presence altered the timeline. 
                        Perhaps I've inadvertently eliminated 
                        whatever reason she had to run.

                                 ED
                        Maybe. Maybe not. Kassapa was also a 
                        drunk. He plagiarized his entire -- 

                                 THE MAN
                        Even if she does, the machine's 
                        imprecision turned in my favor. 

           The Man smiles. Almost cocky.
                                 THE MAN (cont'd)
                        Coming back years earlier than I 
                        intended gave me time to discover how 
                        to change the past without inciting a 
                        GCV. The key is incrementalism. 
                        Little by little, year after year, I 
                        built something to stop her. And the 
                        universe didn't react. 

                                 ED
                        I assume you're referring to the dam.

           For the first time, the Man looks seriously concerned.

                                 ED (cont'd)
                        I knew what it was as soon as I found 
                        it. Had to destroy it of course.

           The Man pulls himself up, vibrates with rage. Ed stands too.

                                 THE MAN
                        God dammit, Oliver! I spent a DECADE in 
                        those woods! I stole from people's 
                        homes, I ate rats, I nearly starved! 
                        Men hunt me, children fear me... I'm a 
                        monster! But I survived it all, just so 
                        I could save my daughter. I can't let 
                        you ruin this... Not now -- 

           The Man takes a step forward. Ed aims his gun.

                                 ED
                        I'll shoot if I have to. You know 
                        that's how this has to end. We both 
                        have to die.

                                 THE MAN
                        Do it. Pull the trigger. I won't sit 
                        here while she dies all over again.

           The Man inches closer. Ed's face twists. His hand shakes. 

                                 ED
                                 (
                                         )
                                  pleading
                        I'm just a physicist...

                                 THE MAN
                        Not anymore. 

           The Man closes his eyes. 

           Ed's finger tightens around the trigger, when...
           CAR DOORS SLAM OUTSIDE.

           Ed glances to the boarded up window, and in that split 
           second, the Man LEAPS forward and SWINGS his arm --

           -- managing to knock Ed's pistol away just as he FIRES! 

           The pistol SLIDES across the floor and under a file cabinet 
           as the Man DIVES into Ed's midsection.

           They fall to the ground and the Man grabs Ed's head and 
           SLAMS it to the floor. Ed's out.

           On his knees, the Man grimaces. His whole body on fire. He 
           crawls to his bracelet, grabs it and heads for the door.

           EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING. SAME.

           Dark Suit pulls his gun as he runs past Ed's truck and into 
           the building. As Round Glasses follows, the Man sneaks out a 
           side window and heads for the treeline, unseen.

           INT. ED'S APARTMENT. ABANDONED BUILDING. SAME.

           Dark Suit and Round Glasses BUST the door open to find --

           Nothing. Ed's gone. Dark Suit lowers his gun. 

           INT. SHEILA'S ROOM. THORNE HOME. DAY.

           A series of quick cuts as Henrietta RAGES:

           -- Henrietta tosses CLOTHES from her mom's dresser.
           -- EMPTIES out the drawers of a nightstand.
           -- TEARS through the closet. 

           High on a closet shelf, she sees a BOX. Unmarked, completely 
           covered in tape, as if it's never meant to be opened... The 
           box from the beginning. 

           Henrietta gets on her tippy-toes, pulls it down. Rips 
           through the tape, tears into the box to find -- PAPERS.

           She rifles through: Birth certificates, apartment leases, 
           loan agreements, and then -- 

           -- a DIVORCE DECREE. For Griffin Visser and Sheila Thorne. 

           Henrietta can't move, can't breathe. As the paper flutters 
           to the floor... 
                                                            CUT TO:

           A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF MILLINOCKET

           On the desk in BEN AND HENRIETTA'S ROOM. A pencil circles 
           the BUS DEPOT. Traces along the road. It's circuitous. Long. 

           Henrietta scribbles a few quick calculations. 

                                 HENRIETTA
                        41 miles to the bus depot. Average 
                        incline... 18 degrees. 

           Sighs. Looks over at her Einstein doll staring back.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        Won't make it before dark...

           Then Henrietta sees something on the map. Leans back in. The 
           RIVER. She draws a NEW PATH -- the river cuts across the 
           center of the map, directly to the depot. A straight shot.

           A few more calculations.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        7 miles... downstream.

           INT. SHED. DAY.

           The door swings open to reveal Henrietta, her backpack so 
           stuffed it can't quite close. She eyes the OLD RAFT propped 
           up against the wall.

           EXT. THE WOODS. SAME.

           The Man runs, using all his strength. But he stumbles and 
           falls, doubling over in pain.

           Hearing a HELICOPTER above, he hides beneath tree cover. 
           Once it's gone, he's again on the move.

           ELSEWHERE IN THE WOODS. 

           Ed TEARS his way through the trees. Not as graceful as the 
           Man, but at full strength he's going fast...
           EXT. THORNE HOME. LATE AFTERNOON.

           A SQUAD CAR pulls into the driveway. Sheila and Ben wearily 
           get out. Head for the door. 

           INT. BEN & HENRIETTA'S ROOM. THORNE HOME. LATE AFTERNOON.

           Ben enters to find Henrietta's drawers open, clothes strewn 
           about. He glances over to the window, WIDE OPEN.

           INT. SHEILA'S ROOM. THORNE HOME. LATE AFTERNOON.

           Sheila stands in the doorway, staring at the torn open box. 

           Then she sees the DIVORCE DECREE on her bed. Mortified, she 
           covers her mouth with her hand. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh, no.

           Next to the decree, a NOTE: "GOING TO CALIFORNIA"

           EXT. THORNE HOME. LATE AFTERNOON.

           Ben walks through the brush beyond the house, comes upon THE 
           SHED. A dragged PATH leading from the open door. The RAFT. 

           INT. KITCHEN. THORNE HOME. MINUTES LATER.

           Sheila rushes in, grabs her car keys from the kitchen table. 
           She turns to yell for Ben when he appears in the doorway, 
           wearing army fatigues, boots and a bandanna. BB-gun in his 
           hands. He looks like a tiny Rambo. 

           EXT. WOODS. SUNSET.

           ANGLE ON the Rip, illuminated by a red sunset. 

           PAN DOWN to find Henrietta dragging the raft out of the 
           woods at the RIVER ACCESS POINT. She looks downriver and 
           sees the broken dam. 

           Surprised, she sets the raft down and drags it to the water, 
           eases it onto the river. Steps inside, wobbly. Pushes herself 
           off, using a branch as a paddle. Drifting downstream.

           We PUSH AHEAD, past the busted dam to free-flowing rapids. 
           ELSEWHERE IN THE WOODS.

           The Man SPRINTS, breaks through the treeline, arriving at 
           the RIVER ACCESS POINT. Sees Henrietta down river.

                                 (
                                 THE MAN
                                  waves frantically
                                                  )
                        HENRY!!!

           WITH HENRIETTA: She turns, squints in confusion. Then she 
           looks up -- a HELICOPTER emerges above them. 

           WITH THE MAN: He tries to scream over the cacophony.

                                 THE MAN (cont'd)
                        YOU'RE GOING TO DROWN! THAT'S WHY I 
                        CAME BACK!

           As this lands on Henrietta, her attention is drawn to the 
           sky above, where all the sudden --

           -- a BLACK HOLE MATERIALIZES. Swirling and growing, the 
           colors of the sunset bend and bow to its will.

           The helicopter retreats as the WIND HOWLS, the current 
           taking Henrietta past the busted dam. The raft speeds up.

           AT THE RIVER ACCESS POINT: The Man goes after her, running 
           down river, hopping over rocks, catching up. 

           He's about to dive into the water when --

           Ed emerges from the woods and TACKLES him. The Man SCREAMS 
           in agony as Ed rips off his bracelet. 

           WITH HENRIETTA: In the rapids now, Henrietta approaches a 
           sharp turn in the river. Attempts to use her branch/paddle 
           to navigate it, but she can't quite make the turn and -- 

           -- the raft collides with some rocks and FLIPS OVER! 

           SPLASH! Desperate, she wrestles herself out from under the 
           overturned raft, managing to hold on with one arm.

           The raft lodges up against a large rock... 

           ANGLE ON Henrietta's hand, as her fingers start to slip.

           ELSEWHERE ALONG THE RIVER'S EDGE: Ben leads Sheila out of 
           the woods and into the clearing to find --

           -- THE MAN & ED, GRAPPLING thirty yards away.
           The wind grows even stronger. Storm clouds. LIGHTNING. 

           Ben looks to the sky. The black hole CHURNING. Then he 
           squints downriver, sees the raft in the distance. 

           THUNDER and he hides behind Sheila, SCARED.

                                 THE MAN (cont'd)
                        She's going to DIE!

           TIGHT ON Sheila. Something about that voice. She drifts 
           toward it, almost as if in a dream...

           The Man pushes Ed off of him, grabs his bracelet from the 
           ground and sprints down the riverbank.

           WITH HENRIETTA: Her fingers slip -- she LOSES HER GRIP! 

           Now hurtling downstream, she's headed directly for a 
           collection of JAGGED ROCKS!

           She SLAMS into one. Grabs it as the current TUGS.

           ON THE RIVER'S EDGE: The Man runs, Ed a ways behind. 

           We hear a LOW RUMBLE. Across the river, wind WHIPS, the 
           clouds TWIST and a TORNADO appears!

           Trees are TORN from their roots and FLY through the air.

           The black hole EXPANDS, a stain spreading across the sky. 

           The Man stands frozen. Ben and Sheila as well. Ed stares up. 

           Then the earth SHAKES. More tornadoes materialize all around 
           them. Small and large. A tree catches FIRE. Cicadas SWARM.

           The HELICOPTER crests the ridge. Struggles with the wind. 
           Then it goes down, EXPLODING IN A FIERY CRASH.

           It's the end of the goddamned world.  

                                 ED
                        My god.

           WITH HENRIETTA: As she clutches the rock in the river, she 
           looks around in terror and awe.

           ON THE RIVER'S EDGE: The Man steps closer to the river, to 
           Henrietta, and the black hole DESCENDS, inhaling more sky.

           The Man stops. 
           And the black hole stops.

           Something truly horrifying occurs to him.

           The same thing occurs to Henrietta, in the water.

           The Man again moves closer to the river, and the the black 
           hole responds in kind, OPENING wider and LOWERING EVEN MORE!

           When he stops, it stops. His heart sinks. 

           Behind the Man, Ed yells --

                                 ED (cont'd)
                        You see?! You can't save her, not 
                        without putting everything in danger!

           The Man turns to Ed, then up to the black hole, and then --

           -- to Henrietta. Holding onto the rock but looking right at 
           him. Resignation and resolve on her face. She knows what she 
           has to do. It's the only rational choice.

           SHE PURPOSEFULLY LETS GO OF THE ROCK. 

           As she is swept into the rapids --

                                 THE MAN
                        No!!

           WITH HENRIETTA: She's thrown about like a rag-doll until her 
           head SLAMS into another rock, knocking her out.

           Her eyes roll back as she SINKS beneath the surface!

           UPSTREAM, ON THE RIVER'S EDGE: Ben watches it all unfold in 
           horror. Then he opens his mouth... AND SCREAMS!!

           As the Man makes eye contact with Ben, the Man feels the 
           full weight of every mistake he's ever made. And he can't 
           take the pain anymore. 

           HE DIVES INTO THE RIVER.

           The black hole GROWS again, enveloping more of the world in 
           darkness.

           UNDERWATER: Unconscious, Henrietta's body sinks until she's 
           lodged among the rocks she collided with.

           ON THE RIVER: The Man swims with the current. Then he takes 
           a deep inhale and DIVES --
           INTO THE MURKY WATER: He struggles to see. Then --

           SPLOOSH! SPLOOSH! SPLOOSH!

           DEAD BIRDS crash into the surface of the river and descend 
           into the depths all around him...

           ON THE RIVER'S EDGE: Ben and Sheila try to follow the Man 
           along the riverbank, slowing when they see --

           -- A COYOTE FLOATING IN THE AIR, ACROSS THE RIVER. 

           Panic in its black eyes. And then - SHOOP! The coyote gets 
           SUCKED into the black hole. They stare, bewildered.

           UNDERWATER WITH HENRIETTA: She's still. Dying.

           Beat. Another.

           Then, on her cheek, a reflection. A faint RED LIGHT.

           Flashing. It grows stronger and BRIGHTER.

           Finally, the glow envelopes Henrietta's lifeless face.

           A HAND reaches out, trying to dislodge her. It's the Man, 
           RED LIGHT from the bracelet shining from his clenched jaw.

           He pulls. HARDER. She won't budge. STUCK. She's going to die.

           The bracelet lands with a silent thud on the river bottom, 
           and the light flickers OUT.

           ON THE SURFACE: An eerie moment of calm. The waves of the 
           river lap. The wind dies down. The black hole appears to 
           wane. Sheila and Ben hold their breath. Ed relaxes.

           And then -- BOOM! Henrietta and the Man BURST THROUGH THE 
           WATER'S SURFACE!

           THE MAN HUGS A LIMP HENRIETTA TIGHTLY AS THEY TWIST --

           -- AND TWIST --

                                    -- UP AND UP --

                                                         -- INTO THE SKY.

           For a beat THEY HOVER, spinning amidst the chaos of a world 
           gone awry. The black hole once again EXPANDING AND MOVING...

           Ed watches, dumbstruck, as the Man maneuvers them to the 
           ground on the edge of the water. 
           As they land, Ed runs over and SHOVES the Man and Henrietta 
           back into the water. Ed holds them under, drowning them...

           The forest teems with ANIMAL SCREAMS... Then --

           FWIP! FWIP! 

           Ed lets go! HOWLS in pain as he clutches his back. Freed 
           from Ed's grasp, the Man leaps up and lands a PUNCH. As Ed 
           collapses, the Man looks past him to see --

           Ben, clutching his BB-gun. 

           Sheila catches up to the Man and Henrietta...

                                 SHEILA
                        Griffin? I don't understand... how --

                                 THE MAN
                        Save her.

           Sheila takes Henrietta and lays her on the riverbank. Not 
           breathing.

           The black hole hovers above the Man. Empty. Dark. Menacing.

           Sheila attempts CPR as the Man stares up, the universe dying 
           all around him. 

           TIGHT ON HIS EYES... And we are BLINDED by WHITE LIGHT. 

                                                           FADE TO:

           A CEMETERY.

           It's a funeral. Henrietta's funeral. TRACK ALONG the 
           mourners: Sheila, Ben, a few others and then finally --

           -- a man, our Man, THE MAN, only YOUNGER, 30s. Clean-shaven 
           and rather pudgy, his TWO BROWN EYES, staring off, vacant.

           BEGIN SEQUENCE:

           (Throughout the following, the camera is always in motion, 
           moving left to right)

           -- A MESSY OFFICE. The Man drinks from a CALTECH mug, half-
           empty bottle of whiskey on his desk. Suddenly he sits up.  

           LEAPS from his chair and uses his sleeve to WIPE math 
           equations off a dry erase board. Starts writing anew. 
           -- A VAST CONCRETE TUNNEL. Sandwiched between 100-foot-tall 
           hexagonal walls covered with fiber optic cables, metal and 
           tubes. At the center of the hexagons, two beams jut out.

           At their point of collision, the Man, now early 50s, gray 
           hair, works alongside...

           A YOUNGER ED, 40s, up on an elevated platform. Familiar 
           looking BRACELETS around both their wrists, glowing green.

           Two G-MEN in suits enter on the ground floor. Flash BADGES.

           -- A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM. The Man faces the 
           COMMITTEE. Speaks solemnly into a microphone. A row behind 
           him, Ed looks concerned.

           -- A SMALL, EMPTY OFFICE. Stuff packed, Ed places a FAMILY 
           PHOTO into his last box and heads DOWN THE HALL, passing 
           vending machines, including one touting the various 
           electronic wares from a company called HEALTH FORWARD.

           He slows as he reaches THE CONCRETE TUNNEL entrance. The 
           doors are CHAINED but a window is BROKEN. Blood on the floor.

           Ed's face goes slack. He drops his box, approaches the window 
           and cranes his neck up to the elevated work platform: the Man 
           furiously types on a laptop wired to an access panel. 

           A DEEP, RUMBLING WHOOSH SOUND PULSATES in the tunnel.

           ON THE PLATFORM, the Man keeps typing, manic, as Ed climbs 
           the ladder. The WHOOSH sound intensifies.

           The Man shuts his laptop, and a BEAM OF LIGHT erupts between 
           the two hexagonal plates.

           Ed reaches the platform and SWIPES at the Man's leg. The Man 
           kicks him OFF the ladder, and he lands with a THUD below. 

           But the Man is off balance and he tumbles INTO THE BEAM --

           Which pierces HIS LEFT EYE, and we --

           FOLLOW THE BEAM OF LIGHT until we're INSIDE the Man's eye...

           Until we are looking at a SINGLE ATOM...

           Until we penetrate the nucleus wall and land on a PROTON.

           The proton ACCELERATES. Faster and faster. Everything around 
           us blurs, as we're moving at LIGHT SPEED. 

           Then the proton COLLIDES with another proton and we --
                                                          FLASH TO:

           A VOID OF... WHITE

           It’s blinding. We hear a distant scratching. It gets closer, 
           grows louder. More insistent. And then --

           -- the white starts to TEAR. Every color in the universe 
           bounces, ricocheting this way and that. Through the tear, we 
           initially see darkness. Then... TWINKLING. Stars?

           Our POV moves FAST, first to the Rip and then THROUGH IT. 
           The twinkles revealing themselves to be CITY LIGHTS.

           We descend at an impossibly fast rate towards the Earth. 
           Down to a CORN FIELD at night, next to a BARN.

           We find THE MAN, lying on the ground. We move down until --

           WE'RE TIGHT ON THE MAN'S EYES. CLOSED. 

           With a GASP, he opens them. His left eye now CRYSTAL BLUE. 

           He vomits, then scrambles off into the night.

           But we move THROUGH THE WALL of the barn to find ED, also 
           vomiting. He runs --

           -- OUTSIDE. But the Man's already gone. PAN UP to the night 
           sky. TO THE RIP. 

                                                            CUT TO:

           THE MAN'S EYES, OLDER NOW

           Back at the RIVER ACCESS POINT. The night Henrietta dies. 
           Sheila still applies CPR to Henrietta. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Henry, please, wake up! I'm so sorry!

           Around the Man: Fire. Hail. Locusts. And then -- 

           HENRIETTA GASPS!

           And the Man closes his eyes, overcome with relief. When he 
           opens them again, his blue eye has MORPHED BACK TO BROWN.

           He watches Ben and Sheila help Henrietta sit up. Then he 
           turns to the black hole, still warping space around them.
           Henrietta sees the Man, and everything suddenly starts to 
           make sense. Weakly...

                                 HENRIETTA
                        ... Dad?

           The Man turns back to her.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        You did all this... for me.

           There's so much he could say: I had everything but screwed 
           it all up. I let you down. I love you. What comes out is --

                                 THE MAN
                        I'm sorry I took so long.

           The Man smiles, then picks up a still unconscious Ed, 
           straining to hold him up as he steps toward the black hole.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Wait, what are you...

           With one last look --

                                 THE MAN
                        Write a letter. Tell him everything. 

           As the Man edges closer to the black hole, he whispers --

                                 THE MAN (cont'd)
                        Stardust. Stardust. Star --

           The black hole WARPS their bodies and SUCKS THEM IN. 

           We hear a WHOOOOOSH -- 

           And the black hole implodes, collapsing inside itself, 
           consuming all the anomalies as well. 

           The Rip... CLOSES. And then -- silence. 

           The river flows. The birds chirp. The Rip is gone.

           FROM ABOVE: We see Henrietta crying, Ben and Sheila next to 
           her. The forest now a wasteland. 

                                                           FADE TO:

           THE NIGHT SKY, FILLED WITH STARS

           The clearest of nights. Almost out of a storybook. 
           We PAN down to the THORNE HOME and find HENRIETTA in the 
           backyard, looking up through her telescope. 

           A STREAK across the sky. Then another. AND ANOTHER. She 
           SQUEALS in delight. Bolts towards the house --

           IN THE KITCHEN

           Henrietta runs up to Sheila, hunched over the stove.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I saw the Geminids! Three or four of 
                        them, right in a row, just like that. 
                        If you come now, we can --

                                 (
                                  distracted
                                 SHEILA
                                           )
                        Germs? Wash your hands please...

           Henrietta GRUNTS in frustration.

           IN THE LIVING ROOM

           ANGLE ON THE TV, with the Reporter from the beginning --

                                 REPORTER (TV)
                        Scientists are still trying to piece 
                        together why the Rip disappeared and 
                        exactly what a tiny coal mining town 
                        in Maine has to do with it. If the -- 

           But Ben's not watching. He's on the couch rocking out to THE 
           FLAMING LIPS, blasting through his headphones. 

           Henrietta runs in from the kitchen.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        Ben! I saw the Geminids! You wanna --

           Ben waves her away, lost in the music. Her shoulders slump.

                                                            CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON HENRIETTA'S FACE, FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT.

                                 HENRIETTA
                        I saw the first one near Castor, at 
                        the mid-Northern latitude. The 
                        quarter moon didn't diminish it AT 
                        ALL! Really remarkable. It's...

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                                 (
                                  losing steam
                                             )
                        It's the best shower I've ever seen.

           Silence. Her enthusiasm fades.

                                 HENRIETTA (cont'd)
                        Anyway...

           REVERSE to find her talking once again to her Einstein doll. 
           But it's clearly not the same. She sits, frustrated.

           INT. HENRIETTA & BEN'S ROOM. THORNE HOME. LATER THAT NIGHT.

           Ben tinkers with a keyboard on GarageBand. Henrietta reads a 
           book. Then --

                                 SHEILA (O.S.)
                        Henrietta! Trash!

           Ben looks over at her, and Henrietta sighs.

           EXT. THORNE HOME. A MINUTE LATER.

           Henrietta tosses a trash bag in the garbage can as a TAXI 
           pulls into the driveway. 

           A man gets out. As he steps into the light, we see it's not 
           just any man. It's our Man. THE MAN. Her dad. Young again.

           They both stand there a beat as the taxi drives off. Then --

                                 HENRIETTA
                        You got my letter.

                                 THE MAN
                        I wouldn't have believed it but 
                        then... Stardust.

           Henrietta betrays no emotion. The Man's eyes well with tears. 

                                 THE MAN (cont'd)
                        I'm sorry, Henry. If you tell me to 
                        shove it, well, that's probably what 
                        I deserve, but, I was thinking... 
                        Tonight's a pretty good night to see 
                        the Geminids. If you're interested.

           We cut back and forth, from Henrietta to the Man. And then, 
           as she shows the hint of a smile --

                                                       CUT TO BLACK.
