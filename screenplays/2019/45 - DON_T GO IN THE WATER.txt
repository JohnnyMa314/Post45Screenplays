                           DON'T GO IN THE   WATER

                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT. LAKE-NIGHT

           We glide over the surface of a vast lake, surrounded on all 
           sides by thick pines--

           The water is still, empty. Lit only by a waning moon.

           As we approach the shore, a small FIRE comes into view. 

           And then 2 people. A MAN and WOMAN. They are backpackers 
           camped for the night.

           Their small tent is no more than 10 feet from the water’s 
           edge. And behind it--nothing but thick, black forest.

           INT. TENT-CONT.

           The woman unzips the opening and crawls into the tent...

           With her flashlight, she searches...for something...

           FINALLY

           She finds what she’s looking for. Holds it up.

           CU PLASTIC BAG

           Inside: A fat joint.

           SHE SMILES

           She crawls back out of the tent

           INTO:

           EXT. CAMPSITE-CONT.

           She steps out of the tent, stands up--

                                 MAN
                        DON’T MOVE

           She turns to look at her husband--

           He stands there. FROZEN. Pale as a sheet. His eyes focused 
           intently on something--behind her.
           SHE TURNS

           To see: A LARGE GREY WOLF

           Teeth bared. Hungry.

           PETRIFIED

           The woman takes a slow step back towards the water.

           THE WOLF’S DEAD EYES

           Follow her intently.

           THE MAN

           Slowly removes a HUNTING KNIFE from his pocket...

           THE WOMAN 

           Takes another small step back...

           She is at the water’s edge--

           CU HUNTING KNIFE

           The man flicks it open. Their only defense...

           CU WOMAN’S FOOT

           Another cautious step--

           THE GROUND IS UNEVEN

           She loses her footing--

           SHE FALLS--

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        NO!

           --INTO THE DARK WATER

           The sound muffled as she hits the rocky lake bed

           She’s only under a few inches of shallow water. She pushes 
           herself back up--

           AS

           THE WOLF LUNGES--

           POV WOMAN
           The wolf already on top of her--

           She can see straight down the wolf’s throat past rows of 
           canine teeth--

           She throws up her arm to protect herself. Is she going to be 
           eaten or just drown?

           THE WOLF

           BITES into her arm like a steak--

           THE MAN

           Runs at the wolf, ready to stab it--

           CU WOMAN

           Her pupils are pinpricks

           THE WOLF 

           Releases her arm

           OPENS ITS JAW WIDE

           Goes straight for the throat--

           THE WOMAN 

           Closes her eyes

           THIS IS THE END

           AND THEN

           --The wolf is RIPPED of off her, out of the water completely--

           By an unseen...something.

           CU WOMAN

           She opens her eyes

           She pulls herself out of the water--gasping for air...

           POV WOMAN

           The wolf is pulled STRAIGHT UP off the ground

           With terrifying force
           30...40...50 feet

           THE MAN

           Runs into the water to his wife--

                                 WOMAN
                             (confused to be alive)
                        What happened?

           The man just points UP--

           The wolf has disappeared into the dark but we can still HEAR 
           it. The wolf makes a new sound: no longer growls, instead 
           PURE FEAR. Like a beaten puppy.

           THE WOMAN

           Looks at her husband, hunched over her, still holding the 
           knife...

           THEY BOTH LOOK STRAIGHT UP

           At the black sky that the wolf vanished into...

           JUST AS SUDDENLY

           The wolf’s YELPS are abruptly cut short--

           SILENCE

           AND THEN

           The SOUND of a soft rain...

           Hitting the water...

           And our young couple--

           AND THEY REALIZE

           It’s not rain...but the wolf’s still warm blood.

           They’re drenched in it.

           A SPLASH FROM THE LAKE

           CU MAN

           He turns to look--

           THE WOMAN
           Looks at him. He can’t articulate what he just saw. But he’s 
           newly terrified...

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

           ON CUE:

           The man is RIPPED under the water with impossible force--

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        KEVIN!

           She splashes desperately, searching for him. But he’s gone. 
           Like he was never there...

           THEN

           He re-surfaces 20 feet away. Just long enough to get out one 
           word:

                                 MAN
                        RUN!

           AND SHE IS RUNNING

           TOWARDS THE DARK WOODS

           BEHIND HER

           A sound like the SNAP of a wet rubber band.

           AND THEN HER HUSBAND’S SCREAMS

           Not fear. PAIN. 

           She stops, turns back. 

           CU WOMAN

           She looks UP. She sees SOMETHING. Her eyes are filled with 
           terror but also pure AWE--

           And then she SCREAMS. Bloody murder--

                                                                  BLACK

                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT. CLOUDFALL RECOVERY CENTER-DAY

           Birds chirp outside an ornate adobe building surrounded by a 
           tranquil garden.
           Rehab.

           Our hero HENRY WABASH, 30’s, walks out into the sunlight for 
           the first time in a month. The duffel bag he checked in with 
           slung over his shoulder.

           He walks down brick steps towards

           THE STREET

           Where a Subaru is parked.

           His sister, ATHENA stands beside it. Waiting for him.

           INT. ATHENA’S CAR-DAY

           Athena driving. Henry in the passenger’s seat.

                                 ATHENA 
                        You look good. How do you feel?

                                 HENRY
                        Like I need a drink. 

           She glares at him...

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        ...That’s a joke.

           Not amused...

                                 ATHENA
                        It’s funny.

           Henry looks away. He’s the perpetual fuck up. Just another 
           thing he can’t get right. 

                                 HENRY
                        How’s Mom?

                                 ATHENA
                        She’s...good.

                                 HENRY
                        ...Good.

                                 ATHENA
                        I know what you’re asking--and the 
                        answer’s not yet. But I’m working 
                        on it.

           Henry nods...
                                 HENRY
                        Just tell her I’m sorry.

           Athena says nothing.

           Changing the subject to something less painful...

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        So what’d I miss on the outside?

                                 ATHENA
                             (shrugs)
                        Not too much.
                             (then)
                        ...Well. Actually. Uncle Pat.

           Henry looks at her--

                                 ATHENA (CONT’D)
                        He’s “officially” dead.

           Beat. Henry isn’t upset by this, just confused.

                                 HENRY
                        He was always dead.

                                 ATHENA
                        Well, not always. 

                                 HENRY
                        He’s been missing for two years.

                                 ATHENA
                        Exactly.

                                 HENRY
                             (surprised)
                        They found his body?

                                 ATHENA
                        No, but it’s been long enough that 
                        they--legally...you know.

                                 HENRY
                        ...Shit. 

                                 ATHENA
                        I guess I was holding out hope he 
                        was just off in the woods, you 
                        know? Completely off the grid this 
                        time. 
                                 HENRY
                             (nods)
                        He never was a people person.

                                 ATHENA
                        Well, he liked us. Guess who he 
                        left his “hermitage” to?

           He looks at her.

                                 HENRY
                             (shocked)
                        No way. 

           Athena smiles, points between them...

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        What are we going to do with it?

                                 ATHENA
                        Sell it. 

                                 HENRY
                        To who? The Unabomber?

           INT. HENRY’S APARTMENT-AFTERNOON

           Henry and Athena inside his small depressing apartment.

           He stands by the window as she pours the contents of his 
           liquor cabinet into the sink.

                                 HENRY
                        You know you don’t have to quit 
                        drinking. It’s good stuff--take it 
                        with you.  

           She looks back at him, pointedly.

                                 ATHENA
                        ...”Good stuff”?

                                 HENRY
                             (sheepish)
                        ...To someone who’s not me. 
                        Obviously.

           She just looks at him--exhausted...

                                 ATHENA
                             (sighs)
                        You’ve quit before.
                                 HENRY
                        Christ, Athena. It’s 18-year old 
                        scotch. I just thought you might 
                        appreciate...

           She looks at him. There is concern in her eyes...

                                 ATHENA
                        Maybe...maybe you should stay with 
                        me. It might be a good idea.

           It doesn’t seem like she thinks it’s a good idea...

                                 ATHENA (CONT’D)
                        Maybe this is all too much for you 
                        at once.

           Henry looks at her--

                                 HENRY
                             (pointed)
                        I’ll be fine.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HENRY’S APARTMENT-NIGHT

           He sits on his dingy sofa, drinking seltzer from the bottle, 
           watching TCM.

           He’s lonely. Bored. He absent-mindedly turns his iPhone in 
           his hands...

           Finally, he unlocks his phone

           CU IPHONE

           He goes to CONTACTS then FAVORITES. 

           There’s only one name: MARIA

           HIS THUMB

           Hovers over her name...Working up the courage to call--

           FUCK IT. He does. 

           RING...

           CU IPHONE

           An image of Henry and a pretty young woman. MARIA. Happier 
           days. 
           HENRY GRIMACES

           We can see the nervousness on his face, in his shoulders...

           RING--

           --He cancels the call. 

           Lowers his head. Defeated.

           BEAT

           Henry HURLS the phone at the wall--

           WHAP!

           The phone lands screen up--

           It starts to VIBRATE

           CU IPHONE

           MARIA is calling him back.

           HENRY

           Grabs his jacket and walks out...

           Leaving the phone still buzzing...

           EXT. CITY STREET-NIGHT

           Henry just walking. Aimlessly. Feeling sorry for himself

           WE HEAR

           Music. PEOPLE enjoying themselves

           RACK FOCUS

           Across the street: the lights from a BAR

           HENRY

           Attempting to block it all out.

           FINALLY

           HE GIVES IN
           Walks across the street, into the bar--

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. HOLDING CELL-HOURS LATER

           Henry sits in the DRUNK TANK, a large jail cell, with 
           assorted other FUCK UPS in for the night.

           He has a black eye. He looks terrible. Not completely sober 
           but already hungover.

                                 OFFICER
                        Wabash?

           Henry looks up.

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        You’re posted.

           INT. WAITING ROOM, THE TOMBS-EARLY MORNING

           The officer leads Henry out past the bulletproof glass to 
           where Athena is waiting for him.

           Instantly, Henry looks ashamed

           INT. ATHENA’S CAR-EARLY MORNING

           Henry gets in the passenger seat of Athena’s Subaru. Again.

           Athena gets in the driver’s seat. Just looks at him. 

                                 HENRY
                        Just. Don’t.

                                 ATHENA
                        “I’ll be fine.”

                                 HENRY
                        What can I say--I’m back on the 
                        wagon.

                                 ATHENA
                        You mean you fell off the wagon.

                                 HENRY
                        Whichever one means I’m a fucking 
                        drunk. 
                                 ATHENA
                        You almost made it a full day. Wow. 

           Henry looks away, ashamed--

                                 ATHENA (CONT’D)
                        You’re not even trying. 

                                 HENRY
                        Try. For what? And don’t say I’m 
                        throwing my life away. It’s already 
                        gone. My job. My marriage. 

                                 ATHENA
                             (over)
                        Yes, because my life is so amazing. 
                        And yet somehow I’m still here to 
                        always fix your shit.

                                 HENRY
                        There’s nothing you can say that 
                        can make me feel worse about myself-

                                 ATHENA
                             (over)
                        --You know who you sound like?

                                 HENRY
                        --so can we just fight later?

           He closes his eyes and leans on the glass window...

                                                                  BLACK

                                                               FADE IN:

           INT. ATHENA’S CAR-DAY

           Slowly, Henry awakes. His head still against the window. 
           Still in Athena’s car. Athena is driving.

           HE LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW

           No longer in the city. Instead, a narrow road in the 
           wilderness--

                                 HENRY
                        Where are we?

           Athena ignores him. Just keeps driving.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Athena, where are we going?
                                 ATHENA
                        Somewhere you can get your shit 
                        together.

           Henry realizes...

                                 HENRY
                        ...No, no, no--

                                 ATHENA
                        Uncle Pat’s needs work. You’re 
                        handy. Fix it up so we can sell it. 
                        It’ll be good for you to have a 
                        project. And I know you need the 
                        money.

                                 HENRY
                        Turn the car around.

           She ignores him...

                                 ATHENA
                        And as a bonus--you won’t be able 
                        to drink. 

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD-HELICOPTER SHOT

           Athena’s Subaru drives ever deeper into the wilderness...

           I/E. ATHENA’S CAR-CONT.

           Henry in the passenger’s seat while his sister chauffeurs 
           him...

           EXT. COUNTRY ROADS-ASSORTED

           A series of shots as the Subaru drives deeper

           ...and deeper

           ...the roads get narrower

           ...and narrower

           They are the only car on the road.

           EXT. MAIN STREET, MILL TOWN-EVENING

           The Subaru pulls into what’s left of a small downtown.
           Half the buildings are boarded up. The few PEOPLE around 
           appear to be over 70. A mill town without a mill.

           The car stops in front of a small mom-and-pop grocery store.

           INT. GROCERY STORE

           Athena and Henry at the checkout. They are the only people in 
           the store besides the CASHIER.

           The counter is littered with supplies. Athena is buying 
           everything in the store. Steaks and orange juice and camping 
           supplies...

           Henry looks miserable. He looks over at a freezer full of 
           beer--

           Rows of six packs behind refrigerated glass. They seem to 
           stare back at him.

           The CASHIER looks very pleased...

                                 CASHIER
                             (grins)
                        I think I’ll close up early today. 
                        You guys prepping for the 
                        apocalypse?

                          ATHENA
                                                          HENRY
                 (smiles)
                                                (pissed)
           No.
                                              Yes.

           Athena stares at Henry...

           BEHIND THE CASHIER

           We can a see a MISSING poster. It shows the two BACKPACKERS 
           from the first scene...

                                                                CUT TO:

           I/E. WOODED ROAD-DAY

           Athena drives her Subaru down an endless, narrow dirt road...

           On either side of the road is miles of thick pine forest. The 
           sun dapples through the tree branches. 
                                 HENRY
                        I forgot what the actual middle of 
                        nowhere looks like.

           The road seems to go on forever

           FINALLY

           The road ends--

           It terminates at a VAST LAKE. Completely surrounded by pine 
           forest. Pristine. No houses. No development of any kind.

           There is a DOCK and what’s left of a small MARINA. A few 
           rusted BOATS that do not seem sea-worthy...

           When Athena turns the car off, it is completely SILENT--

           She HONKS the horn...

           After a moment, an older grizzled fisherman--MAURICE--steps 
           out of a small shed. Comes over to the car...

                                 MAURICE
                        You lost?

                                 ATHENA
                        No, sir. 
                             (points to the lake)
                        Can you take us out?

                                 MAURICE
                        I’m afraid there’s no fish worth 
                        catching anymore. Red tide got 
                        everything except jellyfish. 

                                 ATHENA
                        My brother needs to get out to 
                        Wabash Island.

           Maurice’s eyes go wide...

                                 MAURICE
                        Why?

                                 ATHENA
                        ...We own it.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:
           EXT. LAKE-UNDERWATER SHOT

           We look straight up through the clear water at the surface of 
           the lake...

           As the motor boat cuts its wake across it--

           I/E. MOTOR BOAT-CONT.

           Maurice drives the boat...

           CU HENRY

           Standing next to Athena. Looking out at the lake...

           REVERSE SHOT

           Maurice picks up the radio receiver and speaks into it. Henry 
           can’t hear what he is saying...

           RACK FOCUS

           Past Maurice to the water--

           The boat steers around a bend...

           A SMALL ISLAND 

           becomes visible...

           As they get closer...

           A SMALL RUSTIC CABIN

           On the island. Surrounded by a few pine trees...

           They get closer still and it becomes clear that the house has 
           seen better days. Paint peeling. Sagging beams.

           This is their late Uncle Pat’s house. 

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-DAY

           Henry steps from the motorboat into the shallow water and 
           then onto the beach.

           Athena and Maurice follow behind.

           HENRY WALKS 

           ...by a tree stump with an AXE buried in it. Split logs 
           tossed randomly around it...
           ...by an old overturned CANOE...

           TO THE FRONT DOOR

           Of the half-crumbling house. The whole thing has an eerie 
           feel. Like his uncle just disappeared into thin air. 

           Henry opens the door. It is unlocked. And steps into:

           INT. UNCLE PAT’S HOUSE-CONT.

           The inside of the house is worse. A layer of dust covers 
           everything. There’s graffiti on the walls. And there’s a 
           decent size HOLE in the roof--you can see straight up to the 
           sky...

           Athena enters behind him--

                                 ATHENA
                        ...Wow.

           Maurice enters...

                                 MAURICE
                        Nature comes back fast.

                                 HENRY
                             (to ATHENA)
                        Worse than you thought?

                                 ATHENA
                        Nothing you can’t handle.

           She doesn’t sound convinced...

           There is an old turntable, some classic LPs...Athena tries to 
           spin the situation as best she can. 

                                 ATHENA (CONT’D)
                        Good vinyl collection.

           Henry ignores this small olive branch, points to graffiti on 
           the wall...

                                 MAURICE
                        Kids come out here sometimes. They 
                        used to say your uncle had treasure 
                        buried somewhere on the island. 
                             (then)
                        By the way, my condolences--I 
                        guess. Some people don’t think he’s 
                        really gone. 
           Henry wipes dust away from a picture frame on the wall. 

           A photo inside: HENRY and ATHENA as kids. Next to an older 
           man--UNCLE PAT. Together they hold a large fish. All smiling. 
           Behind them, the same small house--but in mint condition. 
           Better times. 

           Henry can’t help but smile slightly.

                                 HENRY
                        I wish that were true.

                                 MAURICE
                             (shrugs)
                        Pair of hunters swear they saw him 
                        walking the woods last spring.

           Henry looks at Athena...

                                 HENRY
                        That’d be about right. Maybe this 
                        place wasn’t rustic enough for him 
                        anymore. 
                             (smiles)
                        Maybe he abandoned it to go live in 
                        a tree. 

                                 MAURICE
                        Here’s hoping. He kept to himself, 
                        but he was alright.

           Henry gestures to a gun rack mounted to the wall. Without a 
           gun.

                                 HENRY
                        These treasure hunters--they took 
                        the gun?

           Maurice shrugs. 

                                 MAURICE
                        Truth be told, not many kids around 
                        anymore. Whole town’s on its way 
                        out. I’m sure you noticed.

           Henry and Athena look at each other. They did. 

                                 ATHENA
                             (polite)
                        Is that right? 
           INT. BATHROOM, UNCLE PAT’S HOUSE-CONT. 

           Henry enters. Turns on the faucet--

           The PIPES shake violently...

           PUTRID BROWN WATER sputters from the faucet like diarrhea--

           Henry’s face sinks...

           He looks at his PHONE:

           NO SERVICE

           Henry rolls his eyes...

           FINALLY

           Clear lake water comes out of the faucet...

           INT. LIVING ROOM, UNCLE PAT’S HOUSE-CONT.

           While Henry is preoccupied, Athena talks to Maurice...

                                 ATHENA
                        Could I trouble you to check up on 
                        him--maybe once a week? I’d pay you 
                        obviously.

                                 MAURICE
                        Sure. I can bring him groceries if 
                        you want.

                                 ATHENA
                        That’d be great.

                                 MAURICE
                        Does he like anything special?
                        Favorite type of beer?

                                 ATHENA
                             (too quick)
                        No beer. 

           Maurice nods, understanding.

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-DAY

           Athena and Henry stand at the water’s edge. She is ready to 
           head back to the mainland. 
           Maurice is already back on his boat with the motor running, 
           he steps back onto dry land...

                                 MAURICE
                        Here.

           He hands Henry something...

                                 MAURICE (CONT’D)
                        If there’s a problem, send it up. 
                        We’ll see it. 

           Henry look at what he is holding: A FLARE

                                 HENRY
                             (not pleased)
                        ...Thank you.

           Maurice gets back on the boat...

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        This is a terrible idea.

           Athena isn’t sure he’s wrong. But she’s resolved. 

                                 ATHENA
                        Henry, we’ve got nothing but good 
                        memories of this place. You used to 
                        never want to leave.

                                 HENRY
                        That’s cause we were away from Dad. 
                        Not because I was a prisoner on an 
                        island. 

           Athena gestures to the canoe--

                                 ATHENA
                        You can canoe out of here anytime. 

                                 HENRY
                        It’s got to be a mile back to the 
                        landing. Plus another ten through 
                        the woods back to town. 

           Athena shrugs...

                                 ATHENA
                        I sometimes think--what if we’d 
                        grown up here, instead of at home. 
                        How our lives would be different. 
                                 HENRY
                             (nods)
                        Better. 

                                 ATHENA
                        So think of this as a second 
                        chance.

           He wants to believe that but...

                                 HENRY
                        It’s too late to start over. 

           She stops sugarcoating it--

                                 ATHENA
                        Then think of it as a last chance. 
                        I’ll come back in six weeks. You’re 
                        all I got in this world, Henry, but 
                        this is the final time I’m going to 
                        save you or pick you up or bail you 
                        out. Use this. Please. Get your 
                        shit together.

           She grabs him in a hug...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-MOMENTS LATER

           Henry watches the boat speed back towards the mainland.

           THE BOAT 

           Goes around the bend and disappears. 

                                 HENRY
                        Well, shit.

           HENRY

           Turns and walks back to the house. 

           He stops at the tree stump. Wrenches the axe from the wood 
           and places a piece of firewood vertically on top of the 
           stump...

           He raises the axe and buries it in the firewood--but it only 
           goes halfway in. Annoyed, he smashes the firewood against the 
           stump until it SPLITS. 

                                                               FADE TO:
           INT. BEDROOM, UNCLE PAT’S CABIN-MORNING

           Looking out the window, at the pristine lake outside.

           Henry awakes, sits up in front of the window. He’s grown a 
           full beard. He looks healthier. Sober. The black eye has 
           disappeared. Time has passed.

           It’s no longer frigid early spring but the beginnings of 
           summer. 

           INT. DEN, UNCLE PAT’S CABIN-MORNING

           Henry puts a record on the turntable. Maybe Van Morrison’s 
           Astral Weeks...

                        If I ventured in the slipstream
                        Between the viaducts of your dreams-

           And the music carries us over into the next scenes...

           INT. SHED, WABASH ISLAND-DAY

           Henry planes a board of wood...

           EXT. UNCLE PAT’S CABIN-DAY

           Henry on top of the house, patching the hole in the roof.

           He’s already made significant progress...

           The lake is silent except for the sound of his HAMMER

           EXT. LAKE-SUNSET

           Henry canoes out into the middle of the lake...

           He is at peace.

           He stops paddling. Removes his iPhone.

           CU IPHONE

           NO SERVICE. He opens the camera app.

           WIDE SHOT:

           Henry in his canoe. Silhouetted against a breathtaking 
           sunset... 
           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-NIGHT

           Henry sears a T-bone on a flaming charcoal grill.

           The night is warm, beautiful.

           INT. DEN, UNCLE PAT’S CABIN-DIFFERENT NIGHT

           Henry eats a steak at the table.

           He drinks water.

           Behind him, the graffiti has been covered up with fresh 
           paint. 

           The whole house has been fixed up though there is still a 
           shitty old rug on the floor...

           The record is still spinning--

                        ...Lay me down
                        In silence easy
                        To be born again--

           --The ELECTRICITY gives out. The lights and music 
           disappear...

           Henry sighs...

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-NIGHT

           Henry feeds gasoline into the GENERATOR outside the house...

           INT. DEN, UNCLE PAT’S CABIN-NIGHT

           Henry puts the record back on. The song begins again...

           The cycle repeats--

           INT. BEDROOM-NIGHT

           Henry reads a book by a single light...

           EXT. UNCLE PAT’S CABIN-NEXT DAY

           Henry fixing the roof...
           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-DUSK

           Henry comes down from the roof. Sweating. Exhausted. 

           He stops at the tree stump. The AXE BLADE buried in it.

           He places a piece of wood on the stump...

           Raises the axe...

           Splits the wood perfectly.

           He grins. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-NIGHT-WIDE SHOT

           The cabin dark.

           The lake silent except for cicadas...

                                                                CUT TO:

           UNKNOWN POV

           We are underwater. Gliding through the shallows towards the 
           beach of Wabash Island...

           We hit the shore and rise out of the water

           ONTO THE BEACH

           We CRAWL low across the sand...

           Then STAND up--a little unsteady...

           AND WALK

           TOWARDS THE CABIN

           The front door is unlocked...

           WE ENTER THE HOUSE

           Empty. Dark. 

           We walk across the old shitty rug...

           TO THE BEDROOM

           ...CREAK--
           We gently PUSH the door open...

           Henry is in bed. ASLEEP.

           We scan the room...

           HENRY JOLTS AWAKE

           HE LAYS THERE

           Something is wrong...but he can’t put his finger on it.

           HIS EYES

           Dart toward the door--

           REVERSE SHOT

           There is nothing there.

           But the bedroom door SWAYS...

           THEN

           He realizes...through the open window, he can HEAR the 
           lapping of waves. Against the shore--

                                                               BACK TO:

           UNKNOWN POV

           We watch from the shadows as Henry exits the bedroom

           And walks out the front door...

           We wait in silence...

           THEN MOVE

           To the WINDOW. To see:

           HENRY

           At the water’s edge with his flashlight.

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-CONT

           Henry shines his flashlight towards the water’s edge and sure 
           enough:
           WAVES

           Not huge. Maybe two feet high. They gently crash into the 
           sand...

           One...

           After...

           Another...

           WHAT THE FUCK

           He’s transfixed. Because it’s not possible. 

                                                               BACK TO:

           UNKNOWN POV

           We move away from the window

           INTO THE KITCHEN

           The sink is steadily dripping...

           Next to the sink

           A LARGE KNIFE

           OUR HAND REACHES OUT

           Fingers around the knife handle...

           BUT the hand SHAKES, palsied. The fingers contorting--like 
           they’ve never gripped anything before.

           THE KNIFE

           Spasms out of our hand...

           Bouncing off the sink...

           Onto the floor--

           CLANG!

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:
           HENRY

           WHIPS around. He heard the noise.

           There’s someone in the house.

           He RUSHES to the tree stump--

           RIPS the axe out--

           STEALTHILY

           He walks

           TO THE CABIN

           PUSHES THE FRONT DOOR OPEN

           INSIDE:

           Everything is the same as before

           The faucet DRIPS...DRIPS

           He raises the axe over his shoulder--

           Scared shitless but trying to seem tough--

                                 HENRY
                        I’ve got an axe! I’ll 
                        fucking...chop you.

           He winces...

           Silence. 

           He lowers his axe. Embarassed. There’s no one here. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (sighs)
                        You get paranoid when you’re sober. 

           HENRY STOPS

           REVERSE SHOT

           Embedded in the wooden floor: THE KNIFE. The handle sticks 
           straight up like the sword in the stone...

           He moves to: 

           THE BEDROOM

           PUSHES the door open...
           It is empty...

           CRASH!

           Henry WHIPS around

           Moves toward the SOUND in:

           THE BATHROOM

           He enters...

           Gripping the axe, his fingers shaking...

           THE WINDOW

           Is open...

           CU HENRY

           Did he leave it like that?

           THE SHOWER 

           Behind him. The curtain closed.

           HENRY

           Realizing...

           SLOWLY

           He turns around, moves toward the shower...

           CLUTCHING

           The axe in one hand...

           HE RIPS back the shower curtain--

           SWINGING THE AXE--

           At nothing.

           HE LOOKS DOWN

           Into the tub: Something reflects the light...

           Something transluscent, gelatinous...Like a jellyfish that’s 
           been washed ashore...

           He pokes at it with the axe handle...

           He lifts one end up to his face... 
           It’s a piece of translucent, otherworldly fabric. Maybe a 
           snake skin...for a giant fucking snake. 

           He lets the bizarre substance fall back into the tub...

           A few tiny RED SPORES, floating on a thin film of water, 
           circle the drain

           CU HENRY

           He watches, puzzled as

           THE SPORES

           Disappear down the pipes--

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-MORNING

           Henry steps out into the morning light. Looks around.

           The air is thick with humidity. It’s hot.

           He walks to the water’s edge. 

           THE LAKE IS COMPLETELY STILL

           Henry is dumbfounded.

           CU HENRY

           He is truly puzzled--

           REVERSE SHOT

           Half a mile out into the lake. A large splotch--maybe 50 
           yards wide--of DARK RED. Like someone planted a cranberry bog 
           overnight.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. LAKE-DAY

           Henry paddles the canoe out to the RED SPLOTCH...

           Millions of tiny RED SPORES--just like the ones in the tub--
           float on the top of the water.

           The spores stick to Henry’s paddle as the canoe glides 
           through them...
           --BUZZ

           Startled, Henry reaches into his pocket and pulls out his 
           iPhone.

           CU IPHONE

           He has 200 new emails. More importantly, he has service. Just 
           one bar but still.

           HENRY SIGHS

           Then...impulsively...he dials Maria again. Now or never.

           RING...

           RING...

           RING...

                                 MARIA
                        Henry?

                                 HENRY
                        Maria! Yeah. It’s me. Don’t hang 
                        up.

                                 MARIA
                        I know it’s you, Henry...there’s 
                        been caller ID for about 20 years. 

           Henry doesn’t know what to say now that he’s got a hold of 
           her...

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        So...

                                 HENRY
                        ...Uhhhh...

                                 MARIA
                        Are you...are you doing ok?

                                 HENRY
                        Yes. Yeah. Thanks for asking.

                                 MARIA
                        Where are you? The service isn’t 
                        very good.

                                 HENRY
                        That’s the thing. I’m in the middle 
                        of a lake. 
                                 MARIA
                        What?

                                 HENRY
                        I’ve been sober--five weeks. All I 
                        had to do was...
                             (laughs)
                        Remove myself completely from 
                        civilization.

                                 MARIA
                        ...That’s really good, Henry.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah. Thanks. I’m not really 
                        calling for the credit...maybe I 
                        am. But what I really want to say 
                        is: I’m sorry.
                             (beat)
                        And not in a--I know it’s over. And 
                        it’s a disease and maybe I can 
                        learn to forgive myself for that 
                        part. But you deserved better. You 
                        deserve better.

           Beat.

           No response.

           He looks at his phone: NO SERVICE. She’s no longer there.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Of course.

           AND THEN 

           The sound of wings FLAPPING

           Henry looks up as a FLOCK OF GEESE rise from the water and 
           BUZZ right past him like he’s Tippi Hedren--

           THE CANOE

           Rocks dangerously as he swats them away...

           AND THEN

           The birds are gone...

           And then he sees what they were fleeing from...

           There’s SOMETHING rising out of the water. 

           MOVING TOWARDS HIM--
           It’s closer now and he can see that it’s a WAVE--on the 
           otherwise still water.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit.

           He can see now that the wave is at least 15 feet high. No 
           crest but it’ll roll him--

           He paddles furiously, turning the canoe 90 degrees so he’ll 
           be perpendicular to the wave and won’t flip...

           He paddles straight at the wave--

           The canoe rides up the wave like a one-man Perfect Storm--But 

           he doesn’t crest it--

           And the wave is longer than the canoe--

           THE CANOE FLIPS

           End over end--

           Henry smashes into the water

           UNDERWATER

           Flailing as the wave rolls over him...

           He can see his iPhone sink below him. He grabs for it. Fails. 
           Watching it sink to the floor, 40 feet below...

           CU HENRY

           His eyes go wide

           REVERSE SHOT

           There is something on the lake floor:

           A WRECK

           It is covered in sand and seaweed. But it is unmistakably:

           A PROPELLER PLANE. On the side: "US Army Chemical Corps"

           The plane is ripped open in the middle. INSIDE:

           Rusting cannisters marked HAZARDOUS-- 

           AND THEN 

           A LARGE JELLYFISH
           Floats past him--light purple in the underwater light. It’s 
           TENTACLES are 3 feet long--

           Henry tries to push back to the surface before it can sting 
           him. But it’s too late--

           EXT. LAKE-CONT.

           Henry emerges to the surface, cringing in pain from the 
           jellyfish sting. 

           He grabs onto the underside of the flipped over canoe and 
           just floats there for a second.

           The water is completely calm again.

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-DAY

           Henry paddles back to shore..

           INT. UNCLE PAT’S HOUSE-DAY

           Henry enters, clearly in pain.

           His entire right arm is purple and puffy from the jellyfish 
           sting. 

           He grabs a glass from the kitchen table and goes into the 
           bathroom--

           We can hear him PISSING into the glass--

           INT. BATHROOM-CONT.

           He holds the glass full of his own urine.

           He hesitates before he pours it on his arm--

           EXT. UNCLE PAT’S HOUSE-CONT.

           We hear him scream in pain. It echoes across the empty lake. 

           IN THE DISTANCE

           A storm is rolling in...

                                                               FADE TO:
           INT. KITCHEN, UNCLE PAT’S CABIN-NIGHT

           It is RAINING HARD. It is deafening against the roof.

           THUNDER rolls in the distance

           HENRY LOOKS UP

           At where the hole in the roof once was--now fully patched.

           BUT 

           After a moment, water starts to leak through the new wood.

                                 HENRY
                        Shit.

           He grabs a pot from the stove and places it to collect the 
           rainwater...

           New leaks emerge--water coming down in several places at 
           once...

           THE WATER

           Runs along the wooden floor...

           And POOLS at the center of the room: THE OLD SHITTY RUG

           Henry goes over and starts to roll up the rug--

           HE STOPS

           CU HENRY

           A look of true surprise...

           REVERSE SHOT

           Beneath the rug: 

           A TRAPDOOR

           CREAK!

           Henry pulls open the hatch

           REVEALING:

           A small crawlspace.

           HE LEANS INSIDE
           It is empty. Except for an old duffel bag...

           He UNZIPS it...

           CU HENRY

           Again...true surprise--

           REVERSE SHOT

           The bag is filled with wrapped stacks of $100 bills.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Uncle Pat, Jesus Christ. You really 
                        did have buried treasure.
                             (then, realizing)
                        Why would you leave this behind? 

           HE LOOKS

           Out of the crawlspace--to the empty gun rack on the wall...

           HENRY

           Realizes something--

           HE DIGS

           Through the bag...

           More stacks of cash...

           AND THEN

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        FUCK. 

           He recoils as if from a snake--

           REVERSE SHOT

           An ancient bottle of SCOTCH. It reflects the light 
           beautifully...

           HENRY

           Clenches his eyes shut as if he’d been punched--

           QUICKLY

           He pulls himself out--

           SLAMS the hatch shut.
           It is STILL raining...

           EXT. UNCLE PAT’S CABIN-NEXT DAY

           Henry on top of the cabin. Re-fixing the roof...

           It is even hotter and muggier today. 

           WE PAN

           The lake around him...

           REVEALING:

           The patch of RED ALGAE has GROWN. Twice the area it was 
           yesterday.

           WE KEEP PANNING...

           TO REVEAL:

           Maurice’s motorboat approaching...

           HENRY

           Looks up to see it...

           INT. UNCLE PAT’S CABIN-MINUTES LATER

           Henry and Maurice enter, hauling supplies...

                                 MAURICE
                        Place looks good.

                                 HENRY
                        Thanks, man. I’m trying.

           There are several kitchen pots on the floor--filled with 
           rainwater. Henry point to one--

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Watch your step. I’ve had a few 
                        leaks. 

           Maurice puts the supplies down, wipes sweat from his brow.

                                 MAURICE
                        Never used to get this hot up here. 

           Henry carries one of the pots of rainwater over and places it 
           on the stovetop.
                                 HENRY
                             (shrugs)
                        Global warming’s a bitch. 

           Maurice smiles politely...

                                 MAURICE
                        ...If you don’t mind my saying--it, 
                        uh, smells like piss in here. 

                                 HENRY
                        Oh yeah. Sorry. Jellyfish.

           Maurice realizes...

                                 MAURICE
                        That doesn’t actually work.

                                 HENRY
                        I know that now.

           Changing the subject--

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        What’s the deal with the, uh...the 
                        plane at the bottom of the lake?

           Maurice is surprised he knows about this--

                                 MAURICE
                        Oh wow. Yeah, it was a military 
                        transport. Went down in...’83?

                                 HENRY
                        Just crashed?

                                 MAURICE
                        Yeah. Kids used to say it was 
                        carrying something from Area 51 or 
                        whatever. Escaped. Ate the pilot, 
                        you know?

           He laughs...Henry doesn’t.

                                 HENRY
                        Why would they say that?

                                 MAURICE
                             (confused)
                        Because they’re dumb kids. It was 
                        just a malfunction. Crew got out 
                        fine. 
                                 HENRY
                             (embarassed)
                        ...Right.

                                 MAURICE
                        What were you, scuba diving? How’d 
                        you even find that?

                                 HENRY
                        ...I saw it when I got knocked out 
                        of my boat. That’s how I got stung.

                                 MAURICE
                        Knocked?

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah. There was this, uh...rogue 
                        wave. I could’ve surfed it. 

                                 MAURICE
                             (gently)
                        This is a lake. There’s no tides.

                                 HENRY
                        I know.

           Maurice doesn’t say anything...

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Forget it. Alcoholic falls out of a 
                        boat, what else is new, right?

           Maurice looks at Henry, concerned...

                                 MAURICE
                        You alright, out here?

                                 HENRY
                        ...I’m not alright anywhere. Can’t 
                        cut it in the real world. I swore I 
                        wouldn’t end up like my father. And 
                        yet here I am: a drunk. So this 
                        spot’s as good as any. At least I 
                        can’t hurt anyone.

           Maurice looks around...

                                 MAURICE
                        Seems like the real world to me.
                                 HENRY
                        If you remove yourself from 
                        everything that makes a life a 
                        life. Just to survive. I mean, 
                        what’s the point?

                                 MAURICE
                        Your uncle had a life here. 

                                 HENRY
                        Oh, come on man--

           He points to the empty gun rack on the wall--

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Kids didn’t steal that shotgun. Pat 
                        went out in the woods and blew his 
                        head off. 

           Maurice is silent. Henry realizes something has upset him.

           Finally...

                                 MAURICE
                        I had a daughter. 
                             (then)
                        Heroin. Opiates. Same old shit.

           He looks away. Too many painful memories. 

                                 MAURICE (CONT’D)
                        A life’s a life. Surviving--that’s 
                        all there is. Far as I can tell, 
                        that’s the whole point. 

           Henry looks away ashamed. Maurice is angry at him.

                                 MAURICE (CONT’D)
                        You take care of yourself. 

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-LATE AFTERNOON

           HENRY WATCHES

           Maurice’s boat zoom away...

           The sun is already low in the sky...

                                                                  BLACK
           CREAK!

           Henry OPENS the hatch of the trapdoor--

           INT. KITCHEN, UNCLE PAT’S CABIN-DAY

           Henry sits at the table, staring--

           REVERSE SHOT

           The bottle of SCOTCH, sitting on the table. Unopened. Staring 
           back at him.

           BEAT

           Every muscle in Henry’s body is tensed. All his willpower 
           holding him back. He wants to give in.

           FINALLY

           He gets up from the table and walks out of the house--

           Leaving the bottle behind...

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-LATE AFTERNOON

           Henry puts the CANOE in the water--

           --and starts PADDLING. Fast. 

           No destination. 

           He just needs to get away.

           The sun is nearing the horizon.

           EXT. LAKE-TIME ELAPSE

           Henry ROWS out to the same spot where he capsized yesterday.

           HE LOOKS 

           Straight down into the water--

           He can see, dimly:

           THE PLANE

           At the bottom of the lake

           THE CANOE
           Drifts on

           POV HENRY

           He stays fixed on the plane

           THEN LOOKS UP

           To see: AN OLD MAN

           Standing knee deep in the water. Just off the mainland shore--

           CU HENRY

           His eyes POP. He almost drops his paddle.

           The old man is far away but he recognizes him--

                                 HENRY
                        Uncle Pat?

           REVERSE SHOT

           UNCLE PAT stares back at him.

           QUICKLY

           Henry turns the boat around--

           Briefly losing sight of the shore--

           POV HENRY

           He looks at the shore.

           UNCLE PAT IS GONE

           HENRY

           Paddles quickly

           TO THE SHORE

           Jumps out of the canoe.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        PAT!

           He’s walking into the woods--

           The sun is setting. Long shadows everywhere. 

           FURTHER INTO THE WOODS
           No sign of the old man...

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        It’s official. You’ve lost your 
                        mind.

           THROUGH THE BREEZE

           He HEARS the FLAPPING of plastic

           CU HENRY

           He looks up into the trees...does a double take. 

           REVERSE SHOT

           In the top branches of a pine tree: A GREEN TENT

           Perfectly set-up. As if someone just picked the top of a tree 
           for a campsite.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        “Abandoned it to go live in a 
                        tree”.

           He yells up--

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        PAT?

           No response. 

           AFTER A MOMENT

           Henry starts climbing the tree

           TOWARDS THE MYSTERIOUS TENT

           Cautiously--

           Branch...

           Over...

           Branch...

           POV HENRY

           Looking down...he’s further up then he realized

           CU HENRY

           A little vertigo...
           He collects himself...

           Continues on...

           REACHES THE TENT

           It’s a little battered but still together. The poles are 
           upright. You could go in and sleep there right now.

           The opening is zipped shut.

           Henry unzips it--

           --A CORPSE

           Falls out on top of him--

           HENRY SCREAMS

           IT IS THE FEMALE BACKPACKER

           She’s been dead a long time--decomposing--

           The body is smothering him--right against his face--

           He can’t shake it off without losing his footing-- 

           HE SCREAMS AGAIN

           As a large SPIDER crawls out of her eye socket--

           He loses his grip on the branch

           AND FALLS

           Backwards--

           Hitting branch...

           After branch...

           He lands HARD on the forest floor.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. LAKE-NIGHT

           The sun has already set. 

           HENRY

           Paddles the canoe FURIOUSLY
           BACK TO WABASH ISLAND

           He’s out as soon as the boat hits the sand

           AND RUNNING

           INTO THE CABIN

           He throws open a cabinet. Removing the FLARE that Maurice 
           gave him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-WIDE SHOT

           A BRILLIANT white flare ROCKETS into the night sky... 

           Illuminating the water and the island...

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-NIGHT

           Maurice’s boat pulls up to the island...

           HENRY

           Is already waiting outside with his bags packed...

           MAURICE

           Gets out of the boat--

           A DEPUTY in uniform gets out behind him...

                                 MAURICE
                             (to HENRY)
                        You look fine. What happened?

                                 HENRY
                        I’m fine.

                                 MAURICE
                        This is our Deputy Gorham. I 
                        thought--just in case. 
                             (to GORHAM)
                        Looks like a false alarm.

           Henry shakes Gorham’s hand...
                                 HENRY
                        No, you’re just the guy I need to 
                        see. I found a body. 

                                 GORHAM
                        A human body?

           Henry just looks at him--

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, man. 

                                 GORHAM
                        Where?

                                 HENRY
                        Thirty feet up in a fucking pine 
                        tree. Explain that.

           Gorham and Maurice look at each other, wary.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        And I think I saw my uncle.

           Now Maurice looks at Henry with real concern.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Then again it could just be 
                        withdrawal. 

           Gorham looks at the bottle of scotch on the table. Still 
           unopened. 

                                 GORHAM
                             (suspicious)
                        What you been up to out here?

           Henry, realizing...

                                 HENRY
                        I just need to get off this island. 

           EXT. LAKE-NIGHT

           Maurice’s boat zooms out into the dark lake, illuminated by a 
           single light at the stern...

           I/E. MOTOR BOAT-CONT.

           Maurice steers. Deputy Gorham stands next to him.

           HENRY
           stands at the rear. 

           CU HENRY

           Looking back...

           REVERSE SHOT

           UNCLE PAT’S HOUSE

           Slowly receding away...

                                 MAURICE (O.C.)
                        Jesus Christ.

           Henry turns to see:

           ANOTHER ROGUE WAVE

           Rolling towards the boat.

                                 MAURICE (CONT’D)
                        ...That’s not possible.

                                 GORHAM
                        Steer into it!

                                 HENRY
                        No, it’ll flip us.

                                 MAURICE
                             (not convincing)
                        No, we’ll be fine.

           Maurice cuts it 45 degrees, then guns it straight for the 
           wave...

                                 HENRY
                        Goddamnit. We’ll flip!

           Maurice ignores him--

           The wave is only 15 feet away...

           MOMENT OF TRUTH

           CU HENRY

           He closes his eyes as he grabs onto the side of the boat...

           THE WAVE

           Sinks into the lake and disappears...
           Like it never existed.

           MAURICE 

           Cuts the engine. He is totally spooked. 

           THE BOAT

           Just sits there in the dark water.

           HENRY

           Looks at Gorham and Maurice. They are all dumbfounded.

           The water is completely still. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (to MAURICE)
                        You believe me now?

           WHAM!

           Something smashes into the boat from underneath--

           The front end of the boat POPS into the air--and then smashes 
           into the water again, knocking all the men over...

                                 GORHAM
                             (scared)
                        What the--?

           UNDERWATER SHOT-CONT.

           We are looking at the underside of the boat from the POV 
           of...something.

           It RUSHES straight at the boat--

           I/E. MOTOR BOAT-CONT.

           Henry goes flying as the boat is again smashed from below--

           The boat spins from the force--

                                 HENRY
                        Let’s get out of here!

           Maurice nods, starts the engine again--

           WHAM!

           The boat is hit again--
           Maurice goes over the side of the boat--

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Maurice!

           WHAM!

           THE WOOD FLOOR

           Splinters. Water shoots up from below.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god.

           WHAM!

           The wood floor CRACKS

           AND THEN

           A GIANT TRANSLUCENT TENTACLE

           STABS straight through the boat...

           CU HENRY

           He looks helplessly in terror--but also sheer awe--

           WHAM!

           ANOTHER TRANSLUCENT TENTACLE

           Smashes through the boat--

           Each tentacle is at least 30 feet long--

           AND THEN

           The tentacles SNAP in divergent directions--

           RIPPING THE BOAT IN TWO

           The half that Henry is on FLIPS 

           INTO THE WATER

           HENRY

           Swims to the surface. Treading water.

           He can see:
           GORHAM

           Clings to what’s left of the other side of the boat. The 
           OUTBOARD MOTOR is attached, it’s blades still SPINNING--

           Maurice is nowhere to be seen.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Maurice! Maurice!

           No response. 

           HENRY

           Still treading water. He looks around the lake.

           The closest land is still WABASH ISLAND.

           He turns back to Gorham--

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        We need to go. Now. 

           Gorham is barely there. Totally traumatized. He just clings 
           to the boat. Bobbing up and down in the water. 

           AND THEN

           Gorham SCREAMS. Pain mixed with sheer terror.

           Something has latched onto him from below and is PULLING his 
           bottom half--

           He holds onto what’s left of the boat for dear life--

           But the something is too strong--

           GORHAM

           Is pulled across the fiberglass

           INTO THE SPINNING BLADES OF THE MOTOR

           His left arm FLIES into the air--

           --and SPLASHES down inches from Henry. He is too scared to 
           even scream--

           THE BLADES CATCH

           On his torso--the blades SCREECH to a halt.

           THE MOTOR
           Vibrates dangerously against what’s left of Gorham--

           HENRY

           Realizes what’s going to happen next--

           He DIVES underwater AS

           THE MOTOR EXPLODES

           The FIREBALL shoots over Henry, illuminating the water that 
           engulfs him--

           BELOW HIM

           He can see the shadow-y outlines of the MULTI-TENTACLED 
           LOVECRAFTIAN NIGHTMARE that attacked them.

           IT flails away, startled by the explosion. 

           HENRY

           Realizes he has a chance while the thing is distracted...

           He rises to the surface and starts SWIMMING for his life--

           BACK TOWARD WABASH ISLAND

           Swimming...

           Desperately.

           Swimming... 

           Swimming...

           NOT LOOKING BACK

           The flaming debris behind him--

           Swimming...

           Swimming...

           HE REACHES THE BEACH

           Back where he started:

           WABASH ISLAND

           He takes a few steps on the beach and then collapses, 
           exhausted, next to the TREE STUMP. The axe still in it.
           He just lies there...

           Taking in all the impossible shit he just saw...

           THEN--

           HE SEES IT A SPLIT SECOND TOO LATE

           A translucent tentacle DARTS out of the water--

           And LATCHES onto his leg--

           It pulls him towards the water with astonishing force--

           Right past the tree stump--He GRABS the axe.

           HE SCREAMS

           As he’s RIPPED 

           INTO THE AIR 

           20...30 feet--

           HE’S GOING TO DIE

           NOW OR NEVER

           He swings the axe into the tentacle--

           It SLICES surprisingly easily--

           NEW PROBLEM

           He’s falling straight down through mid-air

           He SMASHES into a large pine tree next to the house. The 
           branches break his fall--

           He’s stuck in the tree about 20 feet up.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (sighs)
                        Back in a tree.

           ON CUE:

           The tree SNAPS--

           The trunk swivels and Henry careens onto:

           THE ROOF
           Of the house--

           And he’s rolling onto:

           The spot on the roof where the hole once was. You can tell 
           because of the newer WOOD--which gives under his weight--

           HE COLLAPSES

           Into the KITCHEN-- 

           BACK IN THE HOUSE-CONT.

           In pain, Henry slowly sits up. He looks at his leg:

           What’s left of the tentacle is still attached--and wrapped 
           tight--

           He grabs the tentacle and instantly recoils, in pain--

           He looks at his hand. It is already red. The tentacle clearly 
           secretes some kind of venom. Like a jellyfish.

           QUICKLY

           He grabs the tentacle again and rips it off--

           Then TOSSES the disgusting gelatinous thing across the room.

           He looks at his leg--it is PURPLE and SWOLLEN and 
           THROBBING...

           BEAT.

                                 HENRY
                        Ok. Pull it together. There’s a 
                        monster in the lake.
                             (matter-of-fact)
                        There’s a monster in the lake.

           Realizing...

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        You’re in the middle of the lake. 

           Thinking...

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Maurice told somebody. Somebody 
                        knows he came out here. 

           Realizing...
                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        And they’ll get fucking killed too. 
                        Come on, Henry. Think. 

           A new question:

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Why did nobody know this was here?
                             (then)
                        Because everyone who’s seen it is 
                        dead.

           HE FREEZES

           Realizing something--

           He looks over where he tossed the severed tentacle--

           IT ISN’T THERE

           A shiver runs down his spine

           POV HENRY

           He looks around--

           THE SEVERED TENTACLE ISN’T IN THE ROOM AT ALL

           CU HENRY

           He’s frozen. What the hell is going on?

           HE RUSHES

           To the kitchen drawer

           PULLS OUT

           A LARGE KNIFE

           POV HENRY

           He looks around again. We can see his hand CLUTCHING the 
           knife.

           DRIP...

           DRIP...
           Henry turns towards the leaky faucet, slowly dripping into 
           the sink--

           POV HENRY

           Frozen. From this angle, he can’t see into the sink itself...

           --He...moves...towards it

           DRIP...

           He takes another cautious step...

           DRIP...

           Clutching the knife tighter...

           He raises the knife--prepared to STAB straight down...

           DRIP...

           Peering over the lip of the sink--

           THWAP!

           The amputated tentacle LUNGES from the sink--

           IT wraps around Henry’s throat before he knows what is 
           happening--

           He’d scream except it is already strangling him--

           CU TENTACLE

           The veins in Henry’s neck BULGE out as it tightens aorund his 
           throat like a noose--

           HENRY

           Desperately tries to pull it off as he CHOKES--

           THE TENTACLE 

           Only tightens its death grip

           HENRY’S EYES

           Are popping out. His face red--

           He’s dying. 

           Losing consciousness, he stumbles to the kitchen stove. 
           Throws on the BURNER full blast--
           He grabs the loose end of the tentacle and holds it directly 
           into the flames--

           THE TENTACLE

           Makes an otherworldly sound as it’s reflexes kick in, 
           receding from the flame--

           And loosening its grip--

           HENRY 

           WRENCHES away the momentarily confused THING--

           And SLAMS it

           Into the POT of rainwater on the stove.

           Desperately, he grabs the LID

           THE TENTACLE

           Slithers up--about to pop back out

           AS

           Henry SMASHES the lid down onto the pot

           Trapping the thing inside.

           THE POT

           Vibrates with tremendous force

           HENRY

           Throws all his weight on top to hold the lid on--

           THE BURNER

           Is still going...

           HENRY

           Slides the pot over onto the FLAMES--

           THE TENTACLE

           Emits the same otherworldly SHRIEK--

           THE POT
           Shakes with doubly violent force--

           HENRY

           Holds the lid down with all the strength he’s got. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        You’re cooked, fucker. 

           THE METAL

           Of the pot DENTS outward. So desperate is the thing to 
           escape. 

           THE VIBRATIONS

           Of the pot begin to slowwwwww....

           AND THEN

           STOP.

           CU HENRY

           He relaxes slightly. Breathing heavy.

           HE LOOKS

           At the LID--

           Still unwilling to open it... 

           THWAP!

           THE TENTACLE

           BUSTS THROUGH

           The lid--AND HENRY--go flying.

           HENRY

           Hits the floor AS

           IT RISES triumphantly from the pot--extending itself like a 
           KING COBRA

           CU HENRY
           He looks up in horror but also...AWE--

           THE TENTACLE

           Is TWICE the size it was before. Somehow--it grew.

           It doesn’t have a “head”. No eyes. But nonetheless seems to 
           stare back at

           HENRY

           He’s completely frozen--

           They’re locked in a standoff.

           AND THEN

           The skin of the tentacle. The biofilm. It RIPS open and then--
           begins to re-form--

           --into something NEW

           THE TOP OF THE TENTACLE

           SPLITS open--like a mouth.

           And out of nowhere, it GROWS razor sharp canine teeth. Like a 
           wolf’s. 

           A GIANT NIGHTMARE WORM

           CU HENRY’S EYES

           Glimpsing the KNIFE he dropped--

           THE TENTACLE

           LUNGES

           As:

           HENRY ROLLS TOWARD THE KNIFE

           The tentacle SLAPS into the floor where Henry was AS:

           HENRY STABS IT--

           Impaling it against the floor. 

           THE NIGHTMARE WORM

           LUNGES at

           HENRY
           But he rolls away

           THE NIGHTMARE WORM

           Catches on the blade like a dog on a leash...

           IT SQUIRMS violently against the blade...

           But it is STUCK.

           AND THEN

           The SOUND of it struggling grows louder--like rough 
           sandpaper...

           Its SKIN loses its shine, grows opaque...

           And begins to CRACK

           IT IS DRYING OUT

           HENRY CAN ONLY WATCH

           As the nightmare worm’s movements begin to slowwwww. Sputter 
           out.

           FINALLY

           It seizes up. Contracting...and then ceases all movement.

           THE BIOFILM

           CRACKS open...and RED SPORES tumble out--losing their scarlet 
           luster as they hit the open air

           --The collapsed biofilm, once empty of the spores looks 
           identical to the “snake skin” Henry found in the bathtub.

           HENRY

           Lets out a giant sigh of relief.

           Then COLLAPSES into himself--

           PASSES OUT

                                                                  BLACK

                                                               FADE IN:
           EXT. LAKE-NEXT DAY

           The sun already beating down.

           The vast field of RED ALGAE from far away...

           WE ZOOM IN

           On the individual spores..

           CU SINGLE RED SPORE

           The spore SPLITS like an embryonic cell--creating a perfect 
           copy. 

           These two cells split again...

           And again...

           Accelerating in the heat--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. UNCLE PAT’S CABIN-DAY

           Henry wakes up on the kitchen floor--

           THE CRACKED DEAD TENTACLE

           Is still there too.

           HENRY

           Tries to stand--

           --Immediately COLLAPSES in HOWLING pain--

           HE LOOKS AT

           His right leg. It is impossibly swollen and purple...

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-DAY

           Henry HOBBLES slowly into the sunlight. Every step he takes 
           is a dagger...

           It is already HOT.

           POV HENRY

           Scanning the lake. Even more RED SPORES then yesterday.
           SCANNING...

           There is something floating in the water...

           HENRY SQUINTS

           He can make out that the something is the other half of 
           Maurice’s boat. It’s low in the water but still floating...

           CU HENRY

           He’s thinking--

                                                              FLASH TO:

           I/E. MAURICE’S BOAT-WEEKS EARLIER

           Maurice drives his boat towards Wabash Island.

           He picks up the RECEIVER on his radio. 

           Speaks into it.

                                                               BACK TO:

           HENRY-PRESENT DAY

                                 HENRY
                        If it still works.

           Then...

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        If you stay here, you’ll die. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-MOMENTS LATER

           Henry ties a ROPE to the back of the canoe

           CAUTIOUSLY

           He pushes the canoe to the water’s edge...

           HE LOOKS AT THE WATER

           Terrified.
           The water is perfectly still. No sign of IT. 

           HE SHOVES

           The canoe fully into the water. It floats away, unmanned--

           INSTANTLY

           Henry furiously backpedals from the water, not wanting to 
           spend a second more there--

           He has one hand on the rope connected to the canoe, letting 
           it slide through his fingers.

           EXT. LAKE-UNDERWATER SHOT

           The canoe floats undisturbed past the camera...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-TIME ELAPSE

           Henry leans against the house. As far from the shore as 
           possible. He still holds the end of the rope...

           REVERSE SHOT

           The canoe has drifted out a third of the way into the lake. 

           It’s stopped now. Bobbing slightly.

           But nothing’s attacked it. No sign of a monster.

                                 HENRY
                             (shrugs)
                        Maybe it’s nocturnal.

           BEYOND THE CANOE

           The mainland and its vast woods. They now seem tantalizingly 
           close--

           SLOWLY...

           Henry pulls the canoe--back to shore...

           THE WATER

           Is perfectly still. Not a ripple. 
           THE CANOE

           Hits the shore again...

           HENRY

           Moves toward the canoe holding the paddle--

           QUICKLY 

           He tosses the rope into the boat--

           NOW OR NEVER

           He jumps into the canoe and pushes himself into the lake--

           --

           THE CANOE

           Drifts out into the water. Riding lower because of Henry’s 
           weight...

           AFTER A MOMENT

           Henry gently dips the paddle into the water--

           EXT. LAKE-UNDERWATER SHOT-CONT.

           Looking up at the underside of the canoe as the paddle cuts 
           through the water--creating a little counter-clockwise 
           whirlpool...

           The SOUND of the paddle against the water is amplified 10x. 
           Vibrating through the empty water.

           EXT. HENRY’S CANOE-CONT.

           Henry SPEEDS up his paddling. The closest point of the 
           mainland still very far. 

           EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE LAKE-CONT. 

           A thick splotch of the RED SPORES. 50 yards wide.

           WE ZOOM IN

           Silence. 

           We can see the individual spores condensing, moving closer 
           together at a central point...
           THEY GATHER

           Faster...

           And faster...

           AND THEN

           The center of the swarm is PULLED below the surface of the 
           water--

           FROM ABOVE

           We see the entire swarm of red spores pulled towards a single 
           central point--and then disappear below the surface. Like a 
           black hole. 

           The last spores disappear with a POP, releasing a small shock 
           wave

           WE TILT UP 

           To follow the gentle wave as it ripples towards Henry in the 
           distance--

                                                                CUT TO:

           HENRY 

           Arrives at the half-sunk half of a boat

           He ties the canoe to the wreck, then

           CAREFULLY

           He steps from the canoe onto the wreckage. It bobs wildly 
           against his weight.

           HE FREEZES

           Until the boat stabilizes

           THEN ENTERS

           What’s left of the BOAT’S INTERIOR

           The whole thing is tilted 15 degrees on it’s side. The water 
           is knee deep--

           HENRY STOPS.

           REVERSE SHOT
           MAURICE

           Propped up against the wall. His legs in the water.

           He’s dead.

                                 HENRY
                        Shit.

           HE TURNS

           To see the RADIO. Hanging on the wall. Miraculously dry.

           HE GRABS THE RECEIVER

           Clicks it. Nothing happens.

           HE LOOKS DOWN

           at the radio CONSOLE. A bunch of knobs and dials he doesn’t 
           understand.

           He turns one of the DIALS--

           IT EMITS A DEAFENING FEEDBACK SCREECH--

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LAKE-CONT.

           The SCREECH echoes across the water--

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. BOAT-CONT.

           Henry turns the dial back until the SCREECH subsides...

                                 HENRY
                             (”you idiot”)
                        At least we know it works.

           He hits the receiver.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        SOS. SOS. Please respond. 

           He waits. No response.

           He changes frequencies--
                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        SOS. SOS. Please respond. 

           No response. 

           HENRY

           Looks down at the console. Changes frequencies again. CLICKS 
           the receiver--

           A HAND

           Grabs Henry’s wrist!

           HENRY JUMPS BACK

           TO SEE:

           The hand is connected to MAURICE. Apparently NOT dead.

                                 MAURICE
                             (whispers)
                        Shut. The fuck. Up.

           ON CUE:

           THE BOAT 

           Is ROCKED violently from below--

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LAKE-FROM ABOVE-CONT.

           We can see the massive SHADOW of the thing in the water 
           beneath the wrecked boat.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. BOAT-CONT.

           Henry and Maurice frozen in place. Terrified. 

                                 MAURICE
                             (whispers)
                        It hears better than it sees.

           A TENTACLE

           Emerges from the water. It blindly slides across the roof of 
           the boat. 
           The boat rocks precipitously--the creature’s strength is 
           enormous--

           SILENTLY

           Maurice opens a cabinet beneath the radio...

           Slowly...he removes his final FLARE

           THE TENTACLE

           Still probing the wreck

           MAURICE

           Holds the flare next to Henry’s head, pointing it out towards 
           the lake...

           HENRY

           Is practically hyperventilating...

           MAURICE FIRES

           THE FLARE

           Shoots out horizontally like a bullet--

           50, 100 yards before it succumbs to gravity--

           EXT. LAKE-UNDERWATER SHOT-CONT.

           The FLARE hits the surface of the open water causing 
           cascading RIPPLES in every direction--

                                                                CUT TO:

           LAKE--FROM ABOVE-CONT.

           The giant SHADOW darts--with amazing agility--from underneath 
           the boat. Towards the vibrations from the flare--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BOAT-CONT.

           Henry and Maurice HEAR the searching tentacle pulled away 
           with the rest of the monster.
                                 MAURICE
                        ...NOW.

           DESPERATELY

           They make the few steps to Henry’s canoe.

           They jump in.

           Henry grabs the paddle as Maurice fumbles 
           to...untie..the...rope--

                                 HENRY
                        Hurry up!

           --The rope is free--

           And Henry is paddling for his life--back towards Wabash 
           Island.

                                 MAURICE
                        Don’t. Look. Back.

           BEHIND MAURICE

           Out of focus: the monster rises from the water at the spot 
           the flare hit. Tentacles flailing, trying in vain to 
           slaughter its absent prey--

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-NIGHT

           The canoe tipped over at the water’s edge

                                 MAURICE (O.S.)
                        That thing was not that big last 
                        night.

           INT. UNCLE PAT’S CABIN-CONT.

                                 HENRY
                        I’ve been here for weeks. That 
                        thing wasn’t a thing until a few 
                        days ago. 

                                 MAURICE
                        That’s not possible.

                                 HENRY
                        Don’t you get it? It’s those 
                        spores, the algae. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HENRY (CONT'D)
                        The heat make it grow. I saw 
                        it...mutate. It can change its form-

                                 MAURICE
                        --Into what?

                                 HENRY
                             (shrugs)
                        Whatever serves its purpose: keep 
                        growing, keep mutating. And you 
                        said yourself--it never used to get 
                        this hot. 

           Maurice takes this all in...

                                 MAURICE
                        Ok, we just wait until the weather 
                        cools down. Maybe it’ll...

                                 HENRY
                             (skeptical)
                        Shrink?

                                 MAURICE
                        Ok, what’s your better idea?

                                 HENRY
                        ...It doesn’t like fire.

                                 MAURICE
                             (confused)
                        You just said heat makes it--

                                 HENRY
                        I know but there’s a difference 
                        between being in warm water and, 
                        you know--in flames. 

           As he says this he realizes...

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        It’s the water that’s important.

           He points to the dried up tentacle skin still on the floor...

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        It stayed out of the water too 
                        long. It dried up. 

                                 MAURICE
                        Ok, that’s...something.
                                 HENRY
                             (still thinking)
                        ...We know distractions work. 
                        There’s two of us. We go out in 
                        different directions. One of us’ll 
                        make it back to the mainland.

           Maurice looks at him, wary--

                                 MAURICE
                        The other’s bait?

                                 HENRY
                             (shrugs)
                        It’s fifty-fifty odds. I don’t 
                        think we’re going to get better.

                                 MAURICE
                        Oh yeah? Who do you think it’s 
                        going to go for--you or the old 
                        guy? No offense--I think I’ll wait 
                        it out. There’s food here. Like you 
                        say: it’s got to stay in the water. 
                        So I don’t know: Don’t go in the 
                        fucking water! It’s not like it can 
                        reach through the windows--

           SMASH!

           Henry jumps back AS:

           A TENTACLE

           Crashes through the window pane behind Maurice--

           It is larger and fatter than before--

           Blindly, it searches the cabin.

           MAURICE

           Frozen--

           He looks at Henry as:

           THE TENTACLE

           Finds his left ankle--

           INSTANTLY

           Maurice’s feet are pulled from behind him--his breath knocked 
           out of him before he can scream--
           HENRY 

           Looks on in horror as

           MAURICE

           Is yanked into the air like a rag doll--

           SMASH!

           ANOTHER TENTACLE

           Crashes through another window on the opposite side of the 
           small cabin--

           INSTANTLY

           It LATCHES onto Maurice’s arm.

           AND NOW HE DOES SCREAM

           Suspended in the air, his body pulled in two directions at 
           once, like a medieval rack.

           CRUNCH!

           We HEAR his joints POP and then bones CRACK

           HENRY

           Looks away--helpless

           AND THEN

           SNAP

           Maurice’s arm is RIPPED away from the rest of his body like a 
           chicken wing. Muscle and skin go with it--

           AND THEN the room is filled with arterial spray--

           What’s left of Maurice pulled through the window. Blood still 
           SPRAYING.

           THE OTHER TENTACLE

           Retreats with Maurice’s arm.

           SILENCE

           Henry just stands there, covered in Maurice’s blood...

           BEAT
           Henry in total shock. His body shaking. He’s been spared. But 
           for how long?

           SMASH!

           A TENTACLE

           Crashes through another window

           AND THEN ANOTHER TENTACLE

           Still blindly searching--it knows he’s there somewhere. 

           A THIRD TENTACLE

           Comes down through the hole in the roof...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND--WIDE SHOT--CONT. 

           Massive tentacles reach out from the watery abyss into the 
           cabin.

           The monster has grown--it seems to surround the entire 
           island. 

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. UNCLE PAT’S CABIN-CONT.

           The tentacles slither across every surface in the house...

           ...The counter...

           ...The floor...

           HENRY

           Sits against the wall. Helpless. Trying to calm his shaking 
           body before it gives him away...

           A TENTACLE 

           Slides across the top of the KITCHEN TABLE...

           Onto a CHAIR--

           CU HENRY

           His eyes spot something--
           REVERSE SHOT

           THE HATCH

           Will it work? Does he have a choice?

           THE KITCHEN CHAIR

           Is top heavy against the tentacle. It FALLS OVER

           BANG!

           INSTANTLY

           All three tentacles are on the chair--

           TEARING IT TO SPLINTERS

           HENRY

           Sees his chance. Makes a break for the hatch--

           CRAWLING

           Cautiously, silently

           THE TENTACLES 

           Start to calm down, realizing the chair isn’t worth the 
           effort...

           HENRY

           Reaches the hatch...

           HE PULLS

           The trapdoor up. 

           SLOWLY...

           Mercifully, it doesn’t creak...

           HE ROLLS

           Into the small crawlspace--

           --Landing with a THUD

           INSTANTLY

           A TENTACLE 

           Shoots toward
           HENRY

           Reaching up to grab 

           THE TRAPDOOR--

           He YANKS it and it falls DOWNWARD...

           THE TENTACLE

           Slides in at the last millisecond--

           Preventing the trapdoor from fully closing...

           HENRY

           Lies on the floor of the crawlspace. Staring straight up.

           TRAPPED

           ANOTHER TENTACLE

           Latches onto the trap door, pulls it back open

           AS

           THE FIRST TENTACLE 

           Slides down into the crawlspace

           SEARCHING

           Inches from Henry--

           THIS IS IT

           HENRY

           Turns to his right. TO SEE:

           THE DUFFEL BAG

           THE TENTACLE

           Is seconds from discovering Henry--

           HENRY 

           Grabs the duffel bag. Sits up. HURLS it out.
           SMACK!

           Like clockwork

           THE TENTACLES POUNCE

           Ripping the bag apart--

           Money goes flying--

           The tentacle holding the trapdoor releases its grip--

           THE TRAPDOOR

           Falls back down

           SMASHING

           Henry in the back of the head--

           He collapses into the hole--

                                                                  BLACK

                                                              SMASH IN:

           INT. DORMITORY BEDROOM-MORNING

           Henry AWAKES with a jolt--

           IN A STRANGE ROOM

           Confused...he feels his face--he is clean shaven...

           GETTING HIS BEARINGS

           Morning light streams in from the windows...

           He is in a twin bed...there is another empty twin bed across 
           from him...

           INT. REC ROOM, REHAB-MORNING

           Henry walks in, dazed.

           A GROUP MEETING is already in session. A semi-circle of about 
           12 people with VIOLA--the group leader--at the center...

           Viola sees Henry come in--
                                 VIOLA
                        Henry, what did we say about being 
                        late?

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah. I know. I’m sorry...

           Viola look at him for an explanation... 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (finally)
                        ...I just had the craziest fucking 
                        dream.

           There is one empty seat. Henry sits in it...

                                 VIOLA
                        You want to tell us about it?

                                 HENRY
                        ...Not really.

                                 VIOLA
                        It clearly affected you.

           Henry sighs...

                                 HENRY
                        Alright...Oh. Hi. My name is Henry. 
                        And I’m an alcoholic

                                 ALL
                        Hi Henry.

                                 HENRY
                        Ok. I was...I was in this cabin on 
                        an island... 

           He looks around. The whole group is looking back at him, 
           expectantly...

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        In a lake. I went there to, you 
                        know, dry out. And, well, to make a 
                        long story short: there was 
                        something in the lake. 

                                 VIOLA
                        Something?

                                 HENRY
                             (shrugs)
                        A monster.
                                 VIOLA
                        What kind?

                                 HENRY
                             (laughs to himself)
                        I’m not really sure. A bad one.

                                 VIOLA
                        It was trying to hurt you?

                                 HENRY
                        Kill me. Yeah.

                                 VIOLA
                        What did you do about that?

                                 HENRY
                        Not a whole hell of a lot.

                                 VIOLA
                        You didn’t kill it?

           Henry shakes his head...

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t think it was killable.

                                 VIOLA
                        What do you think that means?

                                 HENRY
                        I think...I think you want me to 
                        say it’s an obvious metaphor for my 
                        addiction.

           Viola smiles...

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        It’s like you always say: You can’t 
                        beat it. You can only survive.

                                 VIOLA
                        Very good, Henry.

           Henry nods...

                                 VIOLA (CONT’D)
                        But no.

                                 HENRY
                        ...What?
                                 VIOLA
                        You didn’t really think it was 
                        going to be that easy?

           Henry looks down at his leg--

           It is PURPLE and SWOLLEN and THROBBING--

                                 VIOLA (CONT’D)
                        The monster doesn’t mean anything. 
                        It’s just a monster.

           She starts to laugh.

                                 VIOLA (CONT’D)
                        And you’re going to fucking die.

           The whole GROUP starts to LAUGH at him--

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. CRAWLSPACE

           HENRY JOLTS AWAKE

           SCREAMING

           Then realizes where he is--ceases his screams immediately--

           Covers his mouth. Terrified--

           Nothing happens.

           The crawlspace is like being in a coffin...

           A miniscule amount of LIGHT comes through the cracks between 
           the floorboards...

           Henry looks THROUGH one of the cracks...

           POV HENRY

           No movement in the cabin above. No tentacles...

           IT IS SILENT

           INT. DEN, UNCLE PAT’S CABIN-MORNING

           Henry slowly PUSHES the lid up...

           HE PEEKS OUT
           No sign of IT.

           It is morning.

           CAUTIOUSLY 

           He pulls himself out of the crawlspace...

           Henry sits at the kitchen table

           ACROSS FROM HIM

           The bottle of SCOTCH.

           CU HENRY

           Defeated. He’s going to die here. 

           Might as well have a drink--

           FINALLY

           He gives in. Breaks the seal on the bottle. Removes the cork.

           He grabs a rocks glass

           AND STARTS POURING

           He doesn’t stop.

           Pours the liquid right to the top of the glass...

           It overflows before he stops.

           He puts the bottle down...

           He INHALES the sweet aroma...

           THEN pushes the glass away...

           He grabs another rocks glass--

           REPEATS

           Filling it to the brim--

           Pushing it away--

           Grabs another glass--

           REPEATS
           Filling--

           Not drinking it.

           There is still a small amount of alcohol left in the bottle. 

           HENRY

           Winces...

           Then pours what’s left straight into the sink.

           CU EMPTY BOTTLE

           Sitting on the kitchen counter...

           REFLECTED IN THE BOTTLE

           We see Henry exit the kitchen...

           Then re-enter lugging the gas canister and a long rope.

           He removes the gas cap...and POURS gasoline into the empty 
           bottle...

           HENRY

           Takes a dishrag and soaks it in one of the glasses of 
           whiskey.

           He shoves the rag into the mouth of the bottle: MOLOTOV 
           COCKTAIL

           NEXT

           He takes the ROPE and douses it with the remaining alcohol--

           THEN

           He puts one end of the alcohol-soaked ropes into the gas 
           canister...

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-DAY

           Henry hobbles outside. Holding his improvised grenade in one 
           hand, running the rope along the ground as he

           CAUTIOUSLY

           approaches the CANOE at the water’s edge 
           THE LAKE

           Is still. Quiet. Covered in red algae. 

           The sun beats down. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           UNKNOWN POV

           We rise out of the shallow water--

           At the shore of WABASH iSLAND

           We can see Henry running the rope from the gas canister to 
           the canoe--

           But we’re BEHIND HIM--he doesn’t see us...

                                                                CUT TO:

           HENRY

           Gently places the molotov cocktail in the canoe, next to the 
           paddle...

           HE LOOKS OUT

           Across the water, at the nearest point of the mainland

           Relatively close but so, so far

                                 HENRY
                        Well. Never thought I’d die sober.

           He takes out the box of waterproof STORM MATCHES...

           Lights a match, then lights the other end of the rope--now a 
           slow burning FUSE running along the sand, back towards the 
           house and the gas canister--

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        This better be a big enough 
                        distraction.

           He gets in the canoe and

           PUSHES OFF

           Into the lake.
           THE FUSE

           Slowly burns towards the house

           HENRY

           Doesn’t dare paddle yet...

           Just drifiting...

           Waiting...

           THE FUSE

           Burns right up to the house...

           Past the front door...

           HENRY

           Covers his ears as

           The flame enters the house and disappears from sight...

           Henry waits...

           Henry still waits...

           Nothing happens.

           CU HENRY

           Shit.

           He paddles the short distance back

           TO THE ISLAND

           He jumps out of the canoe

           Hobbles across the beach

           INTO THE HOUSE

           He looks around the house--wrecked, covered in Maurice’s 
           dried blood.

           THE FUSE
           Is not in the gas canister. It lays beside it on the floor. 
           Black and burnt out.

           He goes and picks up the rope as if this will offer him some 
           explanation...

           HE STOPS

           The hairs on his neck stand up--

           He WHIPS around

           CU HENRY

           His face drops. Surprise. But also--sadness

           REVERSE SHOT

           UNCLE PAT STANDS IN THE KITCHEN

           Looking back at Henry with a vacant stare...

           HENRY LOOKS

           At Uncle Pat’s hand

           HE HOLDS THE LARGE KNIFE

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Pat. Uncle Pat. What are you doing?

           Uncle Pat APPROACHES. Steady but with an awkward gait. His 
           skin is wet, clammy, unnatural. His face blank.

           HENRY 

           Steps backwards towards the door--

           BEHIND HIM

           Out of the shadows steps MAURICE. With the same dead-eyed 
           blank expression, the same wet unnatural skin--

           HE GRABS HENRY FROM BEHIND. Immobilizing him.

           Henry in shock. He saw Maurice slaughtered with his own eyes. 
           And now he’s back--with both arms.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (pleading)
                        Maurice?

           Maurice doesn’t respond. Instead he starts to squeeze the air 
           from Henry’s lungs--
           Henry tries to struggle free but Maurice is unnaturally 
           strong. Holding him in place as Pat approaches with the 
           knife...

           HENRY WATCHES AS:

           UNCLE PAT STOPS

           At the spot where the sun shines brightly through the hole in 
           the roof.

           Instead of going through the sunlight, he deliberately goes 
           around it. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Pat. Please.

           Uncle Pat is now only feet away.

           THE KNIFE

           Gleaming and sharp.

           NOW OR NEVER

           Henry RUNS towards the spot where the sun shines through, 
           DRAGGING Maurice on his back--

           --Maurice emits a pained growl as he’s pulled 

           INTO THE SUNLIGHT

           Maurice’s skin begins to dry and CRACK and he LOOSENS his 
           grip...

           HENRY PUSHES HIM OFF--

           HE TURNS

           To see: PAT over him. His face never changes as he SWIPES the 
           blade at Henry--

           HENRY ROLLS AWAY

           To the gas canister. He GRABS it.

           DESPERATELY

           He SMASHES the canister into Uncle Pat’s leg--

           PAT’S KNEE

           Snaps unnaturally--
           UNCLE PAT

           Drops the knife as he stumbles to the ground--never making a 
           sound...

           He turns his head toward Henry, expression blank AS:

           HENRY SMASHES

           The canister into his skull--

           UNCLE PAT’S HEAD

           SNAPS off like a mannequin. It hangs there off his shoulder 
           by a flap of skin--

           No blood. Instead out of the neck cavity pours the RED SPORES-

           HENRY 

           Watches in horror as: 

           “UNCLE PAT”

           Stand back up! With his head hanging off

           DESPERATELY 

           Henry unscrews the gas canister, then DOUSES “Uncle Pat” in 
           gasoline--

           HE DROPS THE CANISTER

           To pull out a waterproof match--

           BUT BEFORE HE CAN LIGHT IT

           MAURICE

           Slides the KNIFE into the meat behind Henry’s left shoulder 
           blade. Maurice’s face never changes...

           HENRY SCREAMS. Collapses to the ground. He looks up to see:

           “Uncle Pat” standing over him. He pushes his own head back 
           onto his neck. The skin re-seals itself. As if there never 
           was an injury--

           Maurice starts to PULL the knife back out.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        NO!
           The knife comes out with a SPURT of blood. Maurice is ready 
           to stab him again.

           Henry still holds the match. He flicks it with his thumbnail. 
           It LIGHTS.  

           He HURLS the small flame at 

           “UNCLE PAT”

           It makes an otherworldly noise as it is ENGULFED in a 
           FIREBALL--

           MAURICE 

           Emits the same otherworldly noise as if he was on fire too--

           He SEIZES up. Clearly in immense pain. And drops the knife--

           HENRY

           Grabs the knife and STABS Maurice--

           As with Pat, no blood comes out. Just red spores...

           Henry looks back to see

           “Uncle Pat” shrivel...and then DIE in the flames.

           NEW PROBLEM

           The whole kitchen is on FIRE--

           And SPREADING--

           The wood floor ABLAZE around the gas canister...

           CU HENRY

           He realizes with dread what is going to happen--

           AND HE IS RUNNING--

           For his life--

           OUT THE DOOR--

           ONTO THE BEACH--

           --THE CANISTER EXPLODES

           --The front of the house is blown off

           --HENRY is knocked from his feet
           EXT. LAKE-UNDERWATER SHOT-CONT.

           The shockwave CASCADES through the water--

           And the SHARDS of debris CRASH down, piercing the surface--

           EXT. WABASH ISLAND-CONT.

           Henry lifts his face from the sand--

           BEHIND HIM

           The cabin is still standing but on fire--

           CU HENRY

           He looks out at the lake...

           REVERSE SHOT

           In the distance, the massive creature BREACHES the surface of 
           the lake--giving us our first real view of what it looks 
           like:

           A LOVECRAFTIAN NIGHTMARE

           IT crashes back down into the water. 

           Creating a small TSUNAMI

           Heading straight for Henry

           CU HENRY

           Oh shit.

           AND HE IS RUNNING

           BACK into-- 

           THE BURNING CABIN

           --THROUGH THE FLAMES

           --JUMPING UP ON THE COUNTER

           --REACHING THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE ROOF

           --PULLING HIMSELF UP THROUGH THE HOLE

           TO THE ROOF

           As: 
           THE WAVE HITS THE HOUSE

           Henry looks down 

           THROUGH THE HOLE

           The water RUSHES straight through the house and back out the 
           already smashed windows--

           PINE TREES 

           SNAP around him

           There is no island anymore. Just lake. 

           CRUNCH!

           The CABIN comes loose of its foundation--

           AND SLIDES OUT with the RUSHING water

           Henry holds on for dear life as what’s left of the cabin 
           becomes a raft--

           HENRY WATCHES

           As the wave ROLLS across the entire lake and HITS the shore 
           of the mainland. Trees SNAP.

           AND THEN

           THE LAKE IS CALM AGAIN

           CU HENRY

           Helpless. Waiting.

           WE ZOOM OUT

           He’s trapped on the roof

           THE CABIN

           Is slowly sinking into the water that surrounds it on all 
           sides...

           And drifting around the bend in the lake--the DOCK is now 
           visible. Towards what’s left of Maurice’s boat.

           HENRY

           Just...drifts there...
           Waiting for the inevitable...

           HE LOOKS OVER

           To see: His CANOE drift by. 20 yards away.

           The paddle and molotov cocktail still in it.

           CU HENRY

           He could swim for the canoe if he left...right...now--

           CRASH!

           THE CREATURE SURFACES

           Not 10 feet from the sinking cabin--

           The top of IT is gelatinous--shiny and smooth like the bulb 
           of a jellyfish--

           UNTIL its gelatinous form PULLS open--revelaing a cavernous 
           Sarlacc pit of sharp teeth--

           Countless tentacles spring up around it--

           Reaching towards the cabin--

           HENRY

           Shuts his eyes--this is how it ends...

           HONK!

           The sound of a CAR HORN drifts over the lake. It is distant 
           but crystal clear--

           Repeated: HONK! HONK! HONK!

           HENRY

           Opens his eyes--

           THE CREATURE

           Disappears below the surface, pulls its tentacles down with 
           it.

           HENRY TURNS

           Towards the sound
           WE ZOOM

           in on a distant part of the mainland:

           THE DOCK

           Athena’s Subaru. Inside: Athena. Pumping her horn, expecting 
           Maurice to appear like last time...

                                                               BACK TO:

           HENRY

           His eyes go wide

                                 HENRY
                        NO!

           INT. ATHENA’S CAR-CONT.

           Henry’s screams cannot be heard

           THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

           The fog on the lake rolls away. Revealing: The sinking cabin 
           with Henry on top, waving his arms frantically--

                                 ATHENA
                        What the--?

                                                                CUT TO:

           POV CREATURE

           Zooming towards the mainland, towards Athena--

           The HONKS distorted through the water--

                                                                CUT TO:

           HENRY-CONT.

           He jumps into the water--

           --and starts swimming for the wrecked boat--

                                                                CUT TO:
           POV CREATURE

           Approaching the shore...

           WE CRASH

           Out of the water--mere feet from the DOCK and ATHENA’S CAR

           ATHENA

           Looks UP through the windshield, in awed terror as the 
           massive CREATURE rises out of the water--

           SHE SCREAMS

           As a TENTACLE SMASHES into the windshield. The glass CRACKS 
           into a huge spiderweb--but doesn’t break...

           CU ATHENA

           FROZEN in terror--

           She can’t see out of the windshield.

           Beat.

           Nothing happens. 

           Then SMASH!

           The tenatacles PIERCES through the windshield--like the tip 
           of a spear. 

           ATHENA

           Scrambles into the backseat of the car AS:

           TWO MORE TENTACLES

           PIERCE through the windshield, grabbing blindly at the seats--

           PULLING the entire car towards the water--

           ATHENA

           Rolls over the backseat--

           Into the TRUNK--

           She can reach the HATCHBACK DOOR--
           THE ENTIRE BACK END OF THE CAR

           SHOOTS straight up 90 degrees--

           ATHENA

           Falls backwards AS:

           THE CREATURE

           Pulls the entire car over the edge of the dock--

           THE CAR

           SMASHES into the lake--

           And IMMEDIATELY begins to fill with water--

                                                                CUT TO:

           HENRY 

           Reaches the wrecked boat--

           Pulls himself inside--

           THE RADIO RECEIVER

           Still hanging there

           HE GRABS IT.

           Switches on the volume full blast--

           As before: A DEAFENING SCREECH 

           But this time Henry doesn’t stop it--it just keeps going like 
           nails on a chalkboard--

                                                                 CUT TO

           EXT. LAKE-WIDE SHOT-CONT.

           The SCREECH echoes across the lake

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ATHENA’S CAR-CONT.

           Athena trapped inside as her car FILLS with water--
           THE SCREECH can be heard over the RUSHING water

           THE TENTACLES

           Retract. Disappearing out of the car...

           CU ATHENA

           Confused. But she’s got bigger problems--

                                                                CUT TO:

           POV CREATURE

           Shooting through the water. BACK towards Henry. Towards the 
           SCREECH--

                                                                CUT TO:

           HENRY

           DIVES from the boat--back into the lake...

           He is swimming to the CANOE--

                                                                CUT TO:

           POV CREATURE

           Approaching the wrecked boat--

                                                                CUT TO:

           HENRY

           Reaches 

           THE CANOE

           He pulls himself in--

           AS BEHIND HIM:

           The creature RISES from the water--

           And RIPS Maurice’s boat into sawdust--

           POV HENRY
           On the floor of the canoe: The molotov cocktail and the 
           waterproof matches

           DESPERATELY

           Henry GRABS the molotov cocktail. The rag falls from the 
           bottle--GASOLINE spills into the canoe--

           Henry re-inserts the rag in the bottle as:

           THE SCREECH STOPS

           HENRY TURNS

           To see: The CREATURE has finished destroying Maurice’s boat.

           HENRY

           Holds the molotov cocktail and a match, triumphant.

                                 HENRY
                        Come on, you piece of shit.

           THE CREATURE

           Turns towards him--its massive nightmare jaws open wide

           CU HENRY’S HAND

           He flicks his thumbnail against the head of the match--IT 
           IGNITES

           THE CREATURE

           Is very close--

           BEHIND HENRY

           A TENTACLE silently rises from the water--

           IT GRABS HENRY BEFORE HE EVEN KNOWS WHAT IS HAPPENING--

           Before he can light the molotov cocktail--

           He’s RIPPED from the canoe, all his breath KNOCKED from him--

           He DROPS the lit match into the canoe--the spilled gasoline 
           IGNITES--

           --but he HOLDS onto the unlit molotov cocktail--

           As he is PULLED into the air
           ANOTHER TENTACLE

           Darts out of the water--and LATCHES onto Henry--

           And then ANOTHER--

           And ANOTHER--

           AND NOW: Just like Maurice, Henry is being RACKED apart like 
           William Wallace. 

           CU CANOE

           Engulfed in flames...

           HENRY

           SCREAMS as his joints begin to POP--

           The venom in the tentacles SEARS his skin--

           THEN DIRECTLY BELOW HIM

           The CREATURE rises from the water--

           Its massive JAWS open wide--ready to swallow him whole.

           HENRY CAN SEE:

           The jaws are so large they encircle the now flaming canoe 
           without even noticing...

           CU HENRY

           He realizes he has one last chance. It’s either going to work 
           or it isn’t. Resigned to his fate.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        DRINK UP.

           He DROPS the unlit bottle--

           It FALLS...

           FALLS...

           FALLS...

           Past the razor sharp teeth...

           It hits the flaming canoe--
           BOOM!

           --The CANOE explodes

           --Right into the creature’s upper jaw, RIPPING a hole in the 
           creature’s body

           THE TENTACLES

           Release

           HENRY

           Falling through open air--

           POV HENRY

           Upside down. He can see what’s left of the creature--blown to 
           shit-- 

           Chunks of gelatinous viscera FLY in every direction--

           HE HITS THE WATER. HARD.

                                                                  BLACK

                                                              SMASH IN:

           HENRY AWAKES

           Underwater.

           He gains his bearings and SWIMS

           TO THE SURFACE

           It is only moments later--

           PIECES OF THE CREATURE

           Are everywhere. Some of them are on fire. 

           POV HENRY

           He can see: He is near the DOCK...but Athena’s car is gone.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. ATHENA’S CAR-CONT.

           The car is almost completely filled with water--

           A few inches of air left...

           Athena manages to keep her nose and mouth above water for one 
           final breath--

           Before she is SUBMERGED.

           She is drowning.

           The car is a coffin.

           She can see: SUNLIGHT through the back windshield. She is 
           only a few feet underwater. The shallows of the lake. But it 
           makes no difference.

           THE HATCHBACK DOOR

           Is PULLED open!

           Henry is there. He grabs her.

           And pulls her to the surface...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE LAKE-CONT.

           A CHUNK of the creature FLOATS on the surface...

           We watch as the RED SPORES empty out. They are very much 
           alive.

           WE TILT UP 

           To see: The other CHUNKS. Emptying out in the same way...

           FROM ABOVE

           We can see the spores gathering together--

           Then condensing...moving closer together at a single point...

           THEY GATHER
           Faster...

           And faster...

           AND THEN

           As before: the center of the swarm is PULLED below the 
           surface of the water--

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DOCK-CONT.

           Henry and Athena collapsed at the water’s edge. Soaked. 
           Exhausted. But back on dry land. 

                                 ATHENA
                        You saved me.

                                 HENRY
                             (shrugs)
                        You’ve done it enough times. 
                        Thought I’d return the favor.

           She looks at him, overwhelmed, shell-shocked--what is there 
           to even say?

                                 ATHENA
                        ...Beard looks good.

                                 HENRY
                        Thanks.
                             (then)
                        So good news--I fixed up the house. 
                        Bad news--I had to blow it up. 
                        Seemed like a good idea at the 
                        time.

                                 ATHENA
                             (shrugs)
                        A kraken ate my car.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah.

           HE FREEZES

           As a small WAVE crashes into the shore...

           Athena looks at him--

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        RUN!
           He PULLS her to her feet

           They HOBBLE past the treeline-- 

           AS: BEHIND THEM 

           WITHOUT WARNING--the CREATURE PIERCES the surface of the 
           water. Right at the shore.

           It has reconstituted itself. Even BIGGER. And now REALLY 
           pissed off--

           TENTACLES

           Reach INTO THE FOREST--grasping for Henry--

           --but he is just...out of reach--

           INSTEAD

           THE TENTACLES grasp the TRUNKS of pine trees

           HENRY AND ATHENA

           Keeps hobbling as several TREES are ripped from the soil, 
           roots and all--

           CU HENRY

           He looks back. A new kind of fear on his face.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LAKESHORE-WIDESHOT-CONT.

           The hideous CREATURE pulls itself onto the land. Desperate to 
           get Henry. 

           A mass of tentacles--out of its element--but still very 
           dangerous--

           IT CRASHES into the treeline like they are bowling pins--

                                                                CUT TO:

           HENRY AND ATHENA RUNNING

           Behind them: Splinters FLY everywhere

           FROM ABOVE
           All we can see are the green tops of mighty pines--COLLAPSING 
           into the forest floor--

           HENRY

           Looks back to see:

           A PINE TREE

           Falling straight at them.

           HE PULLS ATHENA LEFT

           To avoid it--successfully--

           They smash into the dirt AS:

           THE CREATURE

           Careens PAST THEM. The SOUND of falling trees infinitely 
           louder than any human being--

           HENRY AND ATHENA

           Crawl through the dirt, towards a still STANDING TREE

           They hide behind it...

           HENRY

           looks back to see:

           THE CREATURE searching for him...

           It STOPS moving. Frustrated.

           BEAT.

           After a moment, the VIBRATIONS of falling trees cease.

           SILENCE.

           HENRY

           Waiting. All they can do.

           THE CREATURE

           Is still searching...

           CU HENRY

           Looking out into the forest...
           POV HENRY

           In the distance, he can see: A CLEARING--no trees. Sunlight 
           streaming through.

           CU HENRY

           He has an idea. But wishes he hadn’t.

           He steels himself...and RISES TO HIS FEET

                                 ATHENA
                             (whispers)
                        What are you doing?

                                 HENRY
                        Just stay here.

                                 ATHENA
                             (realizing)
                        ...No, no, no.

                                 HENRY
                        It’s alright. I’m going to lead it 
                        away. Once I do, you get out of 
                        here.

                                 ATHENA
                        No. You’ll die.

           Henry shrugs: “Yeah”.

                                 HENRY
                        Please. Let me do something right 
                        for once. 

           AND WITH THAT

           Henry hobbles into the forest...

           Once he is away from Athena--

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        HEY! OVER HERE!

           THE CREATURE

           Turns--

           INSTANTLY is after him--

           HENRY 

           Hobbling
           BEHIND HIM

           The CREATURE crashes through the trees--

           POV HENRY

           Ahead of him, he can see: THE CLEARING.

           He SPRINTS for it--

           Every step--

           A dagger through his leg--

           He BREAKS through the treeline into:

           THE CLEARING

           Blinding sunlight. The screen goes

           PURE WHITE

           HENRY’S EYES

           Adjust just enough from the darkness--

           He keeps running--into the open field.

           HE TURNS

           To see: TENTACLES reach out from behind the tree--

           --but he is just outside their grasp. The tentacles flop into 
           the grass. Useless. 

           HENRY

           Can see the tentacles have lost their translucence from being 
           outside the water. And they are starting to CRACK in the 
           sunlight. 

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        COME ON! COME AND GET ME YOU UGLY 
                        FUCK!

           He takes a step back as the massive creature CRAWLS into the 
           clearing. 

           It has lost its speed. It seems diminished. And in PAIN.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        COME ON!

           IT raises its tentacles to strike--
           AND THEN

           A moment that seems to go on forever...

           Henry locked in a standoff with a massive eldritch god

           The sun is BEATING down...

           The biofilm of the creature is dying, CRACKING in the 
           sunlight...

           ...FINALLY

           The creature lowers its tentacles...

           RETREATS

           Back into the darkness of the woods.

           CU HENRY

           He can’t believe it.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        You can’t beat it. You can only 
                        survive. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LAKE-WIDE SHOT

           We see the creature emerge from the woods... 

           ...and re-enter the LAKE.

           It dissolves back into RED SPORES. They float on top of the 
           water. 

                                                                  BLACK

                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT. WOODED ROAD-EVENING

           Athena and Henry, walk down the same narrow dirt road that 
           she and Henry drove in on...

           The sun is setting...
                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. INTERSECTION-NIGHT

           Henry and Athena emerge from the woods. Where the dirt road 
           meets a real paved one.

           There is a small roadhouse with a sign that simply reads 
           BAR...

           INT. BAR-NIGHT

           Henry and Athena enter...

           The place is a real dive. Mostly empty.

           The BARTENDER looks at them: they look pretty bad. He’s beat 
           up and limping. She just looks stoned. 

           They sit at the bar--

                                 HENRY
                        Two shots. Wild Turkey.

           Athena looks at him, a little disappointed...

           The bartender pours the two shots--

           Henry hands both shot glasses to his sister

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        And a club soda.

           Athena knocks back both shots, without hesitation. This seems 
           to calm her nerves--

           IN THE DISTANCE

           A CLAP of thunder--

           OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

           It begins to RAIN...

           The bartender hands Henry his club soda.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. Could you call us a 
                        taxi?
           EXT. BAR PARKING LOT-NIGHT

           It is pouring rain now.

           Henry and Athena exit the bar.

           A TAXI is waiting

           HENRY

           Steps in a puddle as he walks to the car--

           WE HOLD

           On the puddle as Henry moves on...

           ZOOM IN

           Tighter...

           And tighter...

           UNTIL WE CAN SEE

           A single RED SPORE. Floating on the surface of the puddle...

           THEN

           The SPORE splits--like an embryonic cell. A perfect copy.

           And then each of the 2 cells splits again.

           THE PUDDLE OVERFLOWS

           And the spores are flowing...

           ...down a small rivulet of water

           ...across the asphalt street

           --and washed down a sewer grate--

                                                                 BLACK.
