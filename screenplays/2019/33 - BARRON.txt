           OVER BLACK

           A CROWD roars to life. Drunk with anticipation - and maybe 
           other things, too. 

                                 CROWD (O.S.)
                        USA! USA! USA! 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HILTON HOTEL, MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - DAY - NOVEMBER 9, 2016

           All we see is red. Proud ‘Mericans sporting hats and signs 
           and t-shirts with the promise of Making America Great Again. 
           On stage, MIKE PENCE addresses the mob -

                                 MIKE PENCE
                        Ladies and gentlemen, it is my 
                        privilege to introduce to you the 
                        president elect of the United 
                        States of America - Donald Trump.

           The crowd goes fucking bananas as the THEME FROM “AIR FORCE 
           ONE” fills the room. Patriotic as SHIT. 

           Then, like a scene in a movie where you see the fucked up 
           dystopian future before the time traveler goes back to 
           prevent it...

           We watch as the TRUMP DYNASTY takes the stage - their 
           fearless leader, DONALD TRUMP, steps up to the podium.

                                 DONALD TRUMP
                        Thank you. Thank you very much...

           I’m not going to type his victory speech out, because, well - 
           we don’t need to relive that shit. But while we’re on the 
           subject, it’s probably a good time to let you know that 
           Donald will only exist in the periphery of this film. 

           So fear not, dear reader - you’re in safe hands.

           We quickly move across the stage to find the hero of our 
           story: little BARRON TRUMP (10). The spitting image of his 
           father. Also the only one in the family who isn’t wearing a 
           smile right now...

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        I know what you’re thinking: Air 
                        Force One? Really?? And trust me, 
                        I’m totally with you.

           Barron squints into the crowd as cameras FLASH aggressively.
                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        My name is Barron Trump. And even 
                        though I’m only ten years old...

           Barron shifts his attention to a nearby AMERICAN FLAG - 

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        I’m old enough to know that today, 
                        America became a very F’d up place. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A SERIES OF NEWS CLIPS

           - As we cycle through VARIOUS CHANNELS, all reacting to the 
           rather shocking news...

                                 ANCHOR 1
                        This just in, Donald Trump has 
                        taken the state of Ohio-

           FLIP!

                                 ANCHOR 2
                        Donald Trump continuing to baffle 
                        analysts as he wins North Carolina, 
                        Florida, Wisconsin-

           FLIP!

                                 ANCHOR 3
                        I can’t believe I’m saying this, 
                        but Donald J. Trump has officially 
                        won the presidency-

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        The news people were shook by my 
                        father’s victory. Even the New York 
                        Times said that Hilary Climpton had 
                        an 85% chance of winning.

           - Armies of TRUMP SUPPORTERS pump their fists at various 
           RALLIES. MAGA country. Mad at the world. 

                                 TRUMP SUPPORTERS
                             (chanting)
                        Send them back! Send them back!

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        It turns out Americans don’t vote 
                        based on politics - they vote based 
                        on fear.

                        the path to the dark side.

           - CROWDS OF PROTESTORS march in solidarity, carrying SIGNS 
           like “HATE LOVES TRUMP” and “NOT MY PRESIDENT.” 

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        Look, the truth is there are a lot 
                        of people out there who hate my 
                        dad...

           - We finally land back on Barron on stage at the Hilton. 

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        But no one - and I mean no one - 
                        hates him more than me.

           CLOSE on his tiny hand as he balls it up into a FIST...

           EXT. COLUMBIA PREP, UPPER WEST SIDE - DAY - SPRING 2015

           A year and a half before shit hit the fan.

           We’re at a prestigious prep school for the children of 
           politicians and other wealthy folk. An AMERICAN FLAG waves 
           proudly out front.

                                 CHILDREN (PRE-LAP)
                        I pledge allegiance, to the flag...

           INT. COLUMBIA PREP - CLASSROOM - DAY

           A room full of UNIFORMED STUDENTS recite the Pledge of 
           Allegiance in unison. Hands over their hearts, like tiny toy 
           soldiers. 

           We move through the class to find Barron - the only one not 
           mouthing the words to this morning ritual. MRS. HAWTHORNE 
           (40s, severe) tracks this. 

           LATER

           Hawthorne aggressively scribbles today’s lesson on the board: 

                                      CAPITALISM
           At his desk, Barron’s in his own little world, doodling 
           various key images from Star Wars in his notebook (X-wings, 
           the Millennium Falcon, etc).

                                 MRS. HAWTHORNE
                        Now class, who can tell me what 
                        capitalism means? 

           RUFUS (9, freckly kiss ass) raises his hand.

                                 RUFUS
                        It means America’s the best.

           CHUCKLES from the students. Barron rolls his eyes.

                                 BARRON
                        Sheeple. 

                                 MRS. HAWTHORNE 
                        That’s very true, Rufus. When the 
                        founding fathers came to America...

           Mrs. Hawthorne’s American dream bullshit trails off... then - 
           THWAP! A crumpled up paper ball SMACKS Barron in the face. 

           He looks up, clocks TANNER HAMPTON (10, Ivy League frat star 
           in training) - holding back a devilish smirk. Barron decides 
           to let it slide. Goes back to his doodling and... THWAP! 
           Another one. Right to the eyeball. 

           This time, Barron hisses across the room -

                                 BARRON
                        Cut it out, Tanner!

                                 MRS. HAWTHORNE (O.S.)
                        Barron. 

           Barron looks up at his teacher - busted. 

                                 MRS. HAWTHORNE
                        Are you paying attention?

                                 BARRON
                        Yes, Mrs. Hawthorne. 

                                 MRS. HAWTHORNE
                        Then what did I just say?

           All eyes on Barron. 
                                 BARRON
                        You were saying that...the founding 
                        fathers believed capitalism to be 
                        the most effective economic system 
                        that also represented the core
                        American values. 

                                 MRS. HAWTHORNE
                             (surprised)
                        That’s right. Would you care to 
                        elaborate on that, Mr. Trump?

                                 BARRON
                        I mean, it’s a good idea in theory, 
                        but capitalism is kinda messed up, 
                        don’t you think?

                                 MRS. HAWTHORNE
                        Pardon me?

           Barron’s the type to always speak his mind, even in the face 
           of the Empire. So, he forges onward -

                                 BARRON
                        Well...the wage gap in our country 
                        is the worst it’s ever been. And 
                        the rich just keep getting richer. 
                        I think if George Washington could 
                        see us now, he’d be ashamed.

           Students GASP in horror.

                                 BARRON
                        And you know, Thomas Paine was in 
                        favor of universal income. He 
                        called it the Citizen’s Dividend- 

                                 MRS. HAWTHORNE
                        Enough!!

           Mrs. Hawthorne SLAMS a book down on her desk in disgust - 
           she’s red-faced and ready to snap. Barron might as well have 
           just taken a giant steaming shit on the American flag.

                                 MRS. HAWTHORNE
                        What you’re referring to is called 
                        socialism and I won’t tolerate it 
                        in my class - nor will I allow you 
                        to deface the principles of this 
                        great country! 

                                 BARRON
                        But Mrs. Hawthorne, I was just-
                                 MRS. HAWTHORNE
                        Take yourself to Principal Katz’s 
                        office immediately. 

           Barron sighs, accepts his fate. Grabs his briefcase and heads 
           out. Exchanges a fuck you look with Tanner on the way.

           INT. COLUMBIA PREP - PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - LATER

           Barron sits in front of PRINCIPAL KATZ (70s, tweed blazer, 
           the kind of guy who exclusively drinks Chardonnay).

                                 PRINCIPAL KATZ
                        I think it’s very noble of you to 
                        have your own opinions, Barron -
                        especially those that contradict 
                        the majority of your colleagues, 
                        but what have I told you about 
                        disrespecting your teachers? 

                                 BARRON
                        I wasn’t disrespecting her! I was 
                        just giving my opinion...

                                 PRINCIPAL KATZ
                        I’m afraid that when you’re a 
                        student, those are one and the 
                        same. And what’s this I hear about 
                        you protesting the Pledge of 
                        Allegiance now? 

                                 BARRON
                        With all due respect, sir - I think 
                        the Pledge is a tool used to 
                        ‘docternate children. I also find 
                        the use of the words under God 
                        offensive to anyone who doesn’t 
                        believe in him.

                                 PRINCIPAL KATZ
                        Do you believe in God, Barron? 

           It’s a genuine question -

                                 BARRON
                        Not the one who gives awards to 
                        celebrities and kills kids with 
                        cancer. 

           That he definitely regrets asking. Katz tries to get them 
           back on track -
                                 PRINCIPAL KATZ
                        The Columbia Prep Handbook states 
                        that every student is required to 
                        participate in the Pledge.

                                 BARRON
                        But this is America - shouldn’t I 
                        have the freedom to not 
                        participate? 

           Katz leans back. Simultaneously frustrated and impressed. 

                                 PRINCIPAL KATZ
                        You’re becoming quite the little 
                        debater, aren’t you? You remind me 
                        more and more of your father by the 
                        day.

           Barron’s been hearing this his whole life - and it still 
           visibly stings him every time.

                                 BARRON
                        I’m nothing like my father. 

           Katz can tell he’s struck a nerve. He moves past it -

                                 PRINCIPAL KATZ
                        Look Barron, you’ll have plenty of 
                        chances to fight the system when 
                        you’re older, but there’s a time 
                        and a place for everything - you 
                        catch my drift? 

           Barron nods gently. He knows Katz is just doing his job - and 
           in the grand scheme of things, he’s one of the good guys.

                                 BARRON
                        Yes, sir. 

           And with that, Barron grabs his briefcase and heads off. Katz 
           sits there for a beat, then opens up his “special” desk 
           drawer. Pulls out an empty bottle of Chardonnay.  

                                 PRINCIPAL KATZ
                        Cynthia-

           CYNTHIA (20s, pantsuit) rushes inside.

                                 PRINCIPAL KATZ
                        I’m out of grape. 
           EXT. COLUMBIA PREP - BLACKTOP - DAY

           Children run rampant on the blacktop. Near the handball 
           court, Barron haggles with Rufus - who’s clutching a bag of 
           homemade RICE KRISPIE TREATS. 

                                 RUFUS
                        But...my mom packed these for me.

                                 BARRON
                        What’d I tell you, Rufus? You have 
                        to think of it as a ‘vestment! That 
                        means today you lose, but tomorrow 
                        you win. Do we have a deal?

           Barron offers up his CARROT STICKS with a big, businessman-
           like smile. Rufus mulls it over. He doesn’t understand how 
           this makes any sense - but finally agrees to the trade. 

                                 RUFUS
                        Fine. 

           The boys exchange snacks - and Barron heads off victorious. 

                                 BARRON
                        Nice doing business with you!

           Rufus hangs back. Eats a carrot stick. Does not enjoy it.

           LATER

           Barron sits on a bench, rice krispie in one hand and a copy 
           of Howard Zinn’s A People’s History of the United States in 
           the other. Undoubtedly the source of his “wokeness.” 

           But instead of reading, Barron stares across the blacktop, 
           fixated on someone sitting on the nearby swings. And that 
           someone is ISABEL LUNA (10, Latinx, eccentric loner).

           She’s also by herself, swinging softly and bobbing her head 
           to music provided by her pink earbuds. Barron takes a deep 
           breath. Tries to hype himself up -

                                 BARRON
                        You can do this. 

           Finally, he straightens out his tie and marches over. 

           MOMENTS LATER, AT THE SWINGS

           Barron hovers awkwardly for an extended beat before clearing 
           his throat. Isabel looks up, removes a single earbud -
                                 BARRON
                        Good afternoon, Isabel. What are 
                        you listening to?

                                 ISABEL
                        Yeezus. 

                                 BARRON
                        Uh, is that even a word?

                                 ISABEL
                        It’s only the single greatest album 
                        of all time! Here-

           Isabel offers up one of her earbuds. Barron eyes it 
           cautiously.

                                 BARRON
                        Is that...sanitary?

                                 ISABEL
                        It’s Kanye West. 

           Barron finally puts the earbud in. Then - “BOUND 2” by Kanye 
           fills his eardrums and ours...

                                 KANYE
                             (rapping)
                        “Close your eyes and let the world 
                        paint a thousand pictures...one 
                        good girl is worth a thousand 
                        bitches, BOUND.”

                                 ISABEL
                        It’s deep, right?

           Barron couldn’t give two shits about the song, but because 
           Isabel is staring into his eyes right now - it’s the best 
           thing he’s ever heard. 

                                 BARRON
                        Sooo deep. 

                                 ISABEL
                        I think Ye’s real strength is 
                        producing beats. I’ve been teaching 
                        myself how to use ProTools, 
                        actually. Who knows - I might even 
                        collab with him someday. 

           Barron smiles, hands the earbud back.
                                 BARRON
                        Hey, Isabel - there’s something I 
                        wanted to ask you. 
                             (beat)
                        Would you be interested in hanging 
                        out sometime? After school, I mean.

                                 ISABEL
                        Are you asking me out on a 
                        playdate?

                                 BARRON
                             (gulp)
                        I suppose I am. 

           An agonizingly tense beat. Isabel studies Barron for a 
           moment. Poor kid looks like he’s about to pass out. 

                                 ISABEL
                        I’ll have to ask my parents. But 
                        they’re pretty chill.

           Barron looks like he’s about to lose it - but he does his 
           best to play it cool.

                                 BARRON
                        Cool! Yeah. That’s...chill. I’ll 
                        see you later. Or whatever. Bye!

           Barron walks off before he spouts anymore stupidity - 
           completely beside himself. After he’s gone, Isabel reveals 
           the tiniest smile. 

           INT. COLUMBIA PREP - GYMNASIUM - LATER

           Fencing practice - also known as P.E. for rich kids. The 
           students are dressed in all white, sparring with swords. 
           Barron battles it out with a RANDOM KID. Scores a point. He’s 
           not half bad!

                                 RANDOM KID
                        Nice footwork.

                                 BARRON
                        Thanks. 

           On the sidelines, an overpaid COACH hoots and hollers - 

                                 COACH 
                        Switch partners!

           Barron removes his helmet, wipes sweat before realizing who 
           he’s matched up with next. Tanner fucking Hampton. 
                                 TANNER 
                        Prepare to lose, Tiny Trump.

                                 BARRON
                        It’s not a competition, Tanner.

                                 TANNER
                        This is America - everything is a 
                        competition. 

           Then, there’s a WHISTLE - forcing Tanner and Barron into 
           action. Tanner’s style is more aggressive, while Barron’s 
           fast and on the defense - 

           Finally, Tanner JABS Barron in the chest, scoring first.

                                 TANNER
                        Child’s play. 

           The boys square up again. But this time, Barron foresees 
           Tanner’s moves - dodging this way and that - and scores! 1-1.

                                 TANNER
                        You’re gonna regret that.

           They get into it once more, neck and neck, until Tanner 
           finally KICKS Barron’s legs out from under him! A cheap shot. 

           Barron falls backwards and hits the mat HARD. Tanner steps 
           forth, looming over him with an evil smile -

                                 TANNER
                        And that’s what you get for being a 
                        socialist. Smell ya later, Tiny 
                        Trump. 

           Tanner walks off, snickering. Barron rolls around on the mat 
           for a while, GROANING in pain. 

           EXT. COLUMBIA PREP - AFTER SCHOOL

           Barron heads across the front lawn, waves to someone in the 
           distance. Leaned up against a fancy BLACK CADILLAC is his 
           bodyguard FREDERIK (30s, big boy with an even bigger heart).

           They exchange fist bumps and Barron hops inside. 

           INT./ EXT. CADILLAC (MOVING) - MOMENTS LATER

           Barron stares out the window, watching the school disappear. 
           Leaving this place is his favorite part of the day. 
                                 BARRON
                        What’s the scoop, Frederik?

                                 FREDERIK
                        Not much, little buddy. Had another 
                        talk with Maggie today about you 
                        know what...

                                 BARRON
                        You’re gonna be a great dad.

                                 FREDERIK
                        I just don’t know if I’m ready for 
                        that kind of responsibility, you 
                        know? Anyway, how was school? 

                                 BARRON
                        Well...I talked to Isabel-

           Frederik SLAMS the brakes - the car SCREECHES to a halt.

                                 FREDERIK
                        You what?!

                                 BARRON
                        Multiple sentences. In a row.

                                 FREDERIK
                        Did you ask her out on a playdate?

                                 BARRON
                        I kind of blacked out for a minute, 
                        but I think so. And I think she 
                        said yes?

                                 FREDERIK
                        This is major! We gotta celebrate. 
                        Wanna roll through McD’s for some 
                        McFlurries?

                                 BARRON
                        Why does it feel like you always 
                        find a reason to celebrate over 
                        McFlurries? 

                                 FREDERIK
                        Oprah says every day is a gift. 

           EXT. TRUMP TOWER - LATER

           Establishing shot of Trump Tower. We’ll use forced 
           perspective to make it look smaller than it really is - just 
           to piss Donald off. 
           INT. TRUMP TOWER - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Barron and Frederik navigate the busy lobby, Butterfinger 
           McFlurries in hand. The place is bustling with TOURISTS and 
           BUSINESSMEN and perhaps even a few SKETCHY LOOKING MEN 
           speaking Russian. 

                                 FREDERIK 
                        The Force Awakens is going to be 
                        absolutely lit. JJ Abrams is a fan!

                                 BARRON
                        Just because he’s a fan doesn’t 
                        mean he’ll make a good film. I 
                        mean, this is the holy grail we’re 
                        talking about. Star Wars is sacred-

                                 FREDERIK
                        It’s a franchise - by its very 
                        definition, it can’t be sacred. 

           As they reach the ELEVATOR BANK, one opens and out walks 
           motherfucking KANYE WEST - alongside his own bodyguard, ROMEO 
           (an even bigger boy than Frederik).

                                 KANYE
                        Lil’ B! What’s good, fam? 

           Barron looks around. Realizes Kanye is talking to...him??

                                 BARRON
                        You’re...Kanye West.

                                 KANYE 
                        Best believe it, little wizard. I 
                        was just upstairs with your pops. 
                        Big D knows how to keep it real - 
                        we both got that dragon energy. 

           I really wish I could take credit for that dragon energy bit, 
           but Kanye actually tweeted that shit. 

                                 KANYE
                        When is NBC gonna hook you up with 
                        your own TV show? You finna be a 
                        star, just like your old man. A 
                        mean, green ratings machine. 

           Barron chuckles awkwardly. 

                                 BARRON
                        To tell you the truth, Mr. West, 
                        I’m not really interested in 
                        reality television. 
           Kanye LAUGHS mockingly at Barron, like this is the stupidest 
           thing he’s ever heard.  

                                 KANYE
                        You can fight it all you want, but 
                        we’re men - we all become our 
                        fathers eventually. And the sooner 
                        you accept that, the better off 
                        you’ll be.

           Barron sits with this for a beat. So many emotions. Frederik 
           can sense it’s time to wrap things up. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        We should probably get going, right 
                        little buddy? 

           Barron snaps out of it. Nods gently. 

                                 KANYE
                        Yo, I’m gonna make Madison Square 
                        Garden my bitch next month. 
                        Consider yourself on the homie 
                        list, B! 

           Kanye flips the peace sign and heads off with his bodyguard. 
           Barron and Frederik head into the elevator and stand in 
           silence - because what the fuck can you even say about Kanye 
           West?

           INT. TRUMP TOWER - BARRON’S FLOOR - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Yes, you read that right. Barron’s “room” consists of an 
           ENTIRE FUCKING FLOOR of Trump Tower. It’s a grandiose space, 
           complete with expensive gadgets and gizmos.

           On the coffee table, there’s an elaborate LEGO CITYSCAPE on 
           display - it’s a staggeringly accurate replica of New York 
           City, with the titular Trump Tower at its center. 

           Frederik and Barron lounge on the couch, watching Game of 
           Thrones. 

                                 BARRON
                        Frederik - was your father a 
                        bodyguard too?

                                 FREDERIK
                        No clue. He bailed on my mom before 
                        I was born. Why do you ask, 
                        grasshoppa? 

           A quiet beat. 
                                 BARRON
                        No reason. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        Hey, is this about what Kanye said 
                        earlier? That guy’s clearly off his 
                        meds. And he doesn’t even know you.

                                 BARRON
                        But what if he’s right? What if I’m 
                        destined to end up just like my dad 
                        and there’s nothing I can do about 
                        it? 

                                 FREDERIK
                        Kid, you’re literally the smartest 
                        person I’ve ever met. You can grow 
                        up to be whatever and whoever you 
                        want - got that? 

           Barron smiles. Reassured. 

           INT. BARRON’S OFFICE - THAT NIGHT

           Barron sits at his desk, watching DOZENS OF CAMERA FEEDS on 
           his computer screen - various rooms scattered throughout 
           Trump Tower. From the odd and unflattering angles, it’s 
           pretty clear these are “spy cams.”

           Barron cycles through the various channels. We see...

           - A BUSINESSMAN getting a blowjob from his SECRETARY.

           - A DISGRUNTLED WOMAN arguing with an HR REPRESENTIVE.

           - Donald Trump’s PR TEAM having an important meeting inside a 
           large CONFERENCE ROOM. 

           Barron stays on this last channel. CRACKS a La Croix and sits 
           back. We ZOOM INTO THE FOOTAGE... 

           INT. TRUMP TOWER - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           At the head of the table, there’s a thick-necked man - 
           whiskey in hand. Pretty clear he’s the HEAD PR REP.

                                 HEAD PR REP
                        We’ve got twenty-four hours to come 
                        up with something, so get your 
                        thumbs out of your asses! No 
                        offense, Jared. 
           LAUGHS all around as JARED KUSHNER throws his hands up in 
           defense -

                                 JARED
                        Laugh it up, dickwads. 

           Next, a MAN IN A MUSTARD SHIRT goes on a tirade -

                                 MUSTARD SHIRT
                        I still don’t see what the big deal 
                        is. Gwen Stefani’s got tits and 
                        she’s sold a million albums - why 
                        wouldn’t NBC pay her more for The 
                        Voice than Donald on The 
                        Apprentice?

           Now, a CHAINSMOKING MAN speaks up -

                                 CHAINSMOKER
                        If Donald wants a certified PR 
                        boost, he should just release that 
                        tape he’s hoarding. 

                                 HEAD PR REP
                        Tape? What tape?

                                 MUSTARD SHIRT
                        I heard he paid a fortune for it, 
                        keeps it in a safe up in the 
                        penthouse. My guess? It involves 
                        pissing and hookers.

                                 JARED
                        There is no tape. That’s fake news-

                                 CHAINSMOKER
                        I heard it’s Ivanka getting 
                        demolished by some NFL star. No 
                        offense, Jared. 

                                 JARED
                        Goddammit - the next person to 
                        crack a joke at my expense is 
                        fired! Now if anyone’s got a 
                        legitimate idea on how we can get 
                        Donald more money, I’m all ears. 

           Silence for a beat. Then:

                                 CHAINSMOKER
                        Fuck it - let’s have the bastard 
                        run for president. 
           Suddenly, the ENTIRE ROOM bursts into LAUGHTER at this 
           obviously absurd idea. But Jared is clearly intrigued...

           BARRON’S OFFICE

           Barron shakes his head in disbelief at the absolute 
           tomfoolery he’s just witnessed. Then, an ALARM on his phone 
           RINGS loudly. The reminder: Skin Treatment w/ Mom.

           He hurries out of the room.

           INT. TRUMP TOWER - MELANIA'S FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           The elevator DINGS as Barron steps off and enters the foyer 
           of Melania’s quarters. 

                                 BARRON
                             (Slovenian)
                        <Mother?>

           Yeah, Barron Trump speaks fucking Slovenian.

                                 MELANIA (O.S.)
                        <I’m in the bathroom.>

           INT. MELANIA’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The bathroom is bigger than most apartments in New York City. 
           Melania’s in an expensive silk robe near the tub, shaving her 
           legs. 

           Barron enters, framed by an obligatory MRS. ROBINSON SHOT a 
           la The Graduate. He studies her exposed thigh for a beat - 
           then turns his head away, embarrassed.  

                                 MELANIA 
                        <A woman should never be ashamed of 
                        her body, Barron. Now come.>

           Barron walks over and strips down to his tighty whities. 
           Then, his mother begins to apply a homemade CAVIAR 
           MOISTURIZER to his skin. 

           You literally cannot make this shit up. 

                                 MELANIA
                        <How’s school? The kids aren’t 
                        picking on you again, are they?>

                                 BARRON
                        <No, Mother.>
                                 MELANIA
                        <Good. By the way, your father has 
                        arranged for you to meet with Olga - 
                        last year’s Little Miss Russia.>

                                 BARRON
                        <What? Why?>

                                 MELANIA
                        <Olga’s family is very close with 
                        Putin. We wouldn’t want to upset 
                        them.>

           Barron finally nods in defeat. 

                                 BARRON
                        <When are you going to leave him?>

           Melania’s taken aback by the question. It’s one she’s been 
           avoiding for years. 

                                 MELANIA
                        <It’s not the right time.>

                                 BARRON
                        <You always say that.>

           She sighs. Rubs her hand through Barron’s hair. 

                                 MELANIA
                        <I have to stay, Barron - so that 
                        you can have a better life. 
                        Someday, you’ll understand.>

           Melania kisses him on the forehead and walks off. 

           Barron stays behind, stares at himself in the mirror for a 
           long moment. Thinking about his father. His future. And his 
           stupid date with a Russian beauty queen.  

           INT. BARRON’S LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Barron CRUNCHES into an apple, looks out his window at an 
           army of NEWS TRUCKS and REPORTERS. Frederik enters from the 
           kitchen, pop-tart in hand. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        Place looks like a dang circus. 

                                 BARRON
                        What else is new?

           Barron grabs the remote. Flips on the NEWS -
                                 ANCHOR (O.S.)
                        We’re here at Trump Tower for a 
                        special announcement. And here 
                        comes Donald now...

           ON THE TV

           The infamous escalator entrance. Donald and Melania wave to 
           their adoring “fans” - who have each been paid accordingly. 

           Neil Young’s “Keep On Rockin’ in the Free World” BLARES - 
           because this was before Neil told Donald to fuck right off. 

           On STAGE, Donald gropes IVANKA TRUMP, then takes the podium. 
           And the rest is history.

           INT. / EXT CADILLAC (MOVING) - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Frederik whips through traffic at increasingly unsafe speeds. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        I mean look at me! I’m not White 
                        House material - I’m a fast food 
                        addict with a high school diploma. 

                                 BARRON
                        Frederik, you’re panicking-

                                 FREDERIK
                        Of course I’m panicking! This job 
                        is all I have!

                                 BARRON
                        And you’re amazing at it. Remember 
                        the time that drunk perv was 
                        exposing himself on the street? And 
                        within seconds, what did you do?

                                 FREDERIK
                        I...tackled him to the ground.

                                 BARRON
                        That’s right! And that other time, 
                        when that other drunk perv was 
                        exposing himself at Coney Island - 
                        what did you do?

                                 FREDERIK
                        I...also tackled him to the ground. 
                        Okay, so I’ve dropkicked a couple 
                        flashers. That doesn’t mean your 
                        dad would promote me to the Secret 
                        Service. 
                                 BARRON
                        Look, this is just another one of 
                        his crazy publicity stunts. I heard 
                        the PR team talking all about it. 
                        He’s not really running for 
                        president and you’re not going to 
                        lose your job. 

           But Frederik isn’t sold - he continues to hyperventilate. 

                                 BARRON
                             (idea)
                        What if we run through McD’s for 
                        some McGrids? Would that make you 
                        feel better?

                                 FREDERIK
                        But you’ll be late for school. 

                                 BARRON
                        So what? You can write me a note.

           Frederik connects with Barron via the rearview mirror. 
           Finally smiles. 

           INT. MCDONALD’S - LATER

           The boys chow down on some McGriddles and hash browns. 
           Through the nearby glass window - they can see into the 
           McDonald’s PLAYPLACE - rambunctious TODDLERS going completely 
           apeshit in the ball pit, etc. 

           Then, Frederik spots something that no one else has: one WILD 
           CHILD has gone rogue and somehow climbed up into the overhead 
           rafters...

                                 FREDERIK
                        Holy guacamole - how’d that kid get 
                        up there?!

                                 BARRON
                        I’m not gonna lie - that’s pretty 
                        impressive.

           Frederik quickly BANGS on the glass window, trying to alert 
           the PARENTS standing around -

                                 FREDERIK
                        HEY - THERE’S A KID UP THERE! LOOK 
                        ABOVE YOU, YOU DUMB IDIOTS!

           But they all ignore Frederik. Finally, he SPRINTS into 
           action... bursting through the nearby door -
           And just as the WILD CHILD FALLS FROM THE RAFTERS - Frederik 
           catches him! Barron APPLAUDS, gives Frederik a THUMBS UP 
           through the window. 

           Finally, a CONCERNED MOTHER runs up, takes her child. Only a 
           little late to the party, lady...

           EXT. COLUMBIA PREP - BLACKTOP - DAY 

           Kids run circles around Barron, who’s watching a NEWS CLIP on 
           his phone. Various political pundits talking about Donald’s 
           campaign announcement. The absurdity of it all. Back when 
           this was all one big joke...

           Just then - a HYPER KID tags Barron.

                                 HYPER KID
                        Got you! I got you! Go to jail! 

                                 BARRON
                        Gladly. 

           Barron walks off to “jail,” located...

           UNDERNEATH THE JUNGLE GYM

           A bunch of unenthused students lounge around, all stoked to 
           be in “jail” so that they don’t have to play anymore. Amongst 
           said students, Barron spots Isabel. 

           He walks over, sits next to her, like it’s NBD.

                                 BARRON
                        Guess they got you too, huh?

           Without looking up -

                                 ISABEL
                        Guess so.  

           Isabel continues to avoid eye contact. What the hell?

                                 BARRON
                        Is...everything alright?

                                 ISABEL
                        I don’t know - is it? 

                                 BARRON
                        Are you pranking me or something?

           Just then - Rufus stumbles onto the scene, out of breath. 
                                 RUFUS 
                        I did it! I freed you all from 
                        jail! YOU’RE FREE! AND YOU’RE FREE!

           Without even saying goodbye, Isabel walks off. Rufus hovers 
           over Barron -

                                 RUFUS
                        Aren’t you happy? You’re free!

                                 BARRON
                        I heard you. Stop yelling.

           Barron storms off -

                                 RUFUS
                        You’re welcome, jerks!

           ON THE BLACKTOP

           Barron catches up to Isabel...

                                 BARRON
                        Hey, did I do something wrong? 

           She finally faces him -

                                 ISABEL
                        You mean like the fact that your 
                        dad is running for president so he 
                        can round up all the immigrants?

           And suddenly, everything makes sense. 

                                 BARRON
                        Look...Donald Trump is my father, 
                        but I swear, I barely know the guy. 
                        He’s been M.I.A. my whole life. And 
                        as far as what he said about 
                        immigrants, I’m against everything 
                        he stands for. 

           Isabel eyes Barron suspiciously. Sussing him out. 

                                 BARRON
                        Please - you’ve got to believe me. 

           After a long beat -

                                 ISABEL
                        I’m sorry I snapped at you. 
                        Immigration is a topic my family 
                        and I don’t take lightly. 
                                 BARRON
                        Trust me, neither do I. So are we 
                        still friends? 

           With a smile:

                                 ISABEL
                        Friends. 

           INT. TRUMP TOWER - BALLROOM - THAT NIGHT

           In a stylized TRACKING SHOT straight out of Goodfellas, we 
           glide through an extravagant DINNER PARTY inside Trump Tower, 
           the whole family in attendance. 

           Here’s Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, bickering quietly -

                                 JARED
                        All I’m saying is I’d feel much 
                        more comfortable if he didn’t grope 
                        your ass on stage, alright?

                                 IVANKA
                        He’s my father, Jared. Don’t be a 
                        pervert. 

                                 JARED
                        Oh, now I’m the pervert?!

           And here’s TIFFANY TRUMP, ranting to Melania -

                                 TIFFANY
                        How would you feel if someone told 
                        you they wouldn’t be photographed 
                        with you because you were too fat?

                                 MELANIA
                        Your father loves you, Tiffany.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Bullshit! He only loves his money.

           Now ERIC TRUMP shows his wife LARA a series of PHOTOS on his 
           phone - and she looks horned up as hell. 

                                 ERIC
                        This is me, right after I slayed 
                        the elephant. I looked him right in 
                        the eyes until the lights went out. 

                                 LARA
                        Fuck, that’s hot.
           Finally, at the end of the absurdly long table, we find 
           Barron seated next to OLGA (12) - the Russian child beauty 
           queen. She’s wearing way too much makeup for her age - and is 
           a good foot taller than him. 

                                 BARRON
                        So you, uh, won a beauty pageant? 

                                 OLGA
                        This is true. For talent, I juggle 
                        egg, then - I crack into omelette. 
                        And I call it...egg show. 

                                 BARRON
                        Wow. That must take a lot of 
                        practice.

                                 OLGA
                        Yes, I practice egg show every 
                        night before bed. So, Barron - are 
                        you looking for simple girlfriend, 
                        or lifelong wife?

           Barron CHOKES on his caviar. Time to tap out.

                                 BARRON
                        Will you please excuse me, Olga?

                                 OLGA
                        Bring back eggs! I will show you my 
                        talents. 

           Barron quickly speed walks away from the table, but he’s 
           intercepted by DONALD TRUMP JR. -

                                 DONALD JR.
                        Where do you think you’re going, 
                        Mr. Cool Guy?

                                 BARRON
                        Out of my way, Jr.

           But Jr. cuts him off again -

                                 DONALD JR.
                        Let’s get one thing straight. When 
                        dad becomes president, I’m the 
                        first boy - got that?

                                 BARRON
                        You do realize the first boy 
                        doesn’t mean the favorite, right?
                                 DONALD JR.
                        Are you stupid? Of course it does.

                                 BARRON
                        And don’t you think you’re getting 
                        a little ahead of yourself? Dad’s 
                        not actually running for president. 

                                 DONALD JR.
                        Shows how much you know.

           Barron eyes Jr. carefully. Can’t tell if he’s bluffing.

                                 BARRON
                        What do you mean?

                                 DONALD JR.
                        NBC thinks his politics are 
                        “hateful” and “prejudice” - 
                        whatever that even means. Anyway, 
                        they’re pulling the plug on The 
                        Apprentice. So we’re pivoting. 

                                 BARRON
                        Pivoting? Pivoting how?

                                 DONALD JR.
                        Our analysts ran the numbers. Dad 
                        has a real shot at the presidency. 
                        So - we just booked two more 
                        rallies. 

                                 BARRON
                        That’s- that’s not possible. 

                                 DONALD JR.
                        Anything is possible, SB. 
                             (then)
                        That stands for Second Boy.  

                                 BARRON
                        Yeah. I got that. 

           Barron rushes past Jr. and gets the fuck out of there.

                                 ISABEL (PRE-LAP)
                        So let me get this straight...

           INT. BARRON’S BEDROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Barron’s on an emergency SKYPE CALL with Isabel. DEFCON 5.  
                                 ISABEL (O.S.)
                        Your dad “faked” a presidential 
                        campaign just so NBC would give him 
                        a raise, but because of the racist 
                        crap he said, they cancelled his 
                        show - so now he’s gonna run for 
                        president for real - and people 
                        actually said they’d vote for him?!

                                 BARRON
                        That’s the gist of it. Isabel...my 
                        father is a bad, bad man. I mean 
                        like, Darth Vader bad. And if he 
                        becomes president, a lot of people 
                        are going to get hurt - including 
                        my mother. 

           A beat. Then, Isabel has an idea -

                                 ISABEL (O.S.)
                        Maybe there’s a way to stop him.

                                 BARRON
                        How?

                                 ISABEL (O.S.)
                        My parents watch this show called 
                        House of Cards. It’s all about 
                        politics and other boring crap. 
                        People sabotage each other all the 
                        time. Mind games. ‘Nipulation.

                                 BARRON
                        If my father ever caught me doing 
                        something like that, he’d probably 
                        send me away for life. 

                                 ISABEL (O.S.)
                        But if he’s really as bad as you 
                        say he is, I’d say this is pretty 
                        freakin’ important, wouldn’t you? 
                             (beat)
                        What if I helped?

           Now this gets Barron’s attention -

                                 BARRON
                        Seriously? You’d do that?

                                 ISABEL (O.S.)
                        Duh. We could be partners.

                                 BARRON
                        And if we get caught?
                                 ISABEL
                        Heck ‘em. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           TRUMP CAMPAIGN MONTAGE - SET TO KANYE WEST’S “STRONGER”

           - Various NEWS CLIPS show PUNDITS dismissing Donald openly.

                                 PUNDIT
                        All I’m saying is - we better be 
                        ready for the fact that Donald 
                        Trump might be leading the 
                        Republican ticket. 

           The entire panel BURSTS INTO LAUGHTER.

           - Meanwhile, Donald Trump ramps his rallies up to 11 as he 
           stirs up aggressive crowds and incites violence, again -

                                 DONALD TRUMP 1
                        If you see somebody getting ready 
                        to throw a tomato, knock the crap 
                        out of ‘em, will ya? Seriously!

           And again...

                                 DONALD TRUMP 2
                        Try not to hurt him. If you do, 
                        I’ll defend you in court, don’t 
                        worry about it!

           And again.

                                 DONALD TRUMP 3
                        And you know what? The audience 
                        swung back. And I thought it was 
                        very, very appropriate. 

           - MICHAEL MOORE appears on various NEWS PROGRAMS, warning 
           people of the upcoming apocalypse. But no one listens. 

                                 ANCHOR
                        Most of our analysts have predicted 
                        that Trump’s odds of winning the 
                        2016 election are virtually 
                        impossible, Michael. 
                                 MICHAEL MOORE
                        Look, we're sitting in our little 
                        bubble having a good laugh at this 
                        shitshow, but the truth is that 
                        Donald Trump appeals to a lot of 
                        people in this country. It’d be a 
                        mistake to write him off as a joke. 

           - Finally, Donald Trump wears his signature smug smile while 
           his supporters eat up his bullshit:

                                 TRUMP SUPPORTERS
                             (chanting)
                        BUILD THAT WALL! BUILD THAT WALL!

           END MONTAGE - END MUSIC

           EXT. COLUMBIA PREP - CAFETERIA - A FEW WEEKS LATER

           Barron and Isabel share earbuds (and a creme brulee) while 
           watching House of Cards on an iPad.

                                 BARRON
                        I like the way this Frank Underwood 
                        fellow thinks.

                                 ISABEL
                        Kevin Stacey is easily the best 
                        actor of all time. I heard he’s 
                        also like, the nicest guy ever in 
                        real life. 

                                 BARRON
                        Okay, what have we got so far?

           Isabel pulls up her notes -

                                 ISABEL
                        The only thing I wrote down is 
                        “push someone off a train.”

                                 BARRONS
                        Definitely too illegal.
                             (thinking)
                        What about a tax invasion?

                                 ISABEL
                        What’s that again?

                                 BARRON
                        It’s when you lie about your taxes, 
                        and the government invades your 
                        house to arrest you.
                                 ISABEL
                        A tax invasion. Of course!

                                 BARRON
                        Who was that girl that got in 
                        trouble for hacking into the school 
                        and changing her own grades? Maybe 
                        she can help.

                                 ISABEL
                        You mean...Roberta Norton? 

                                 BARRON
                        Yeah, isn’t she the granddaughter 
                        of some computer engineer? 

           But Isabel doesn’t seem too keen on the idea -

                                 ISABEL
                        Maybe we try somebody else. 

                                 BARRON
                        What? Why?

                                 ISABEL
                             (finally spilling)
                        Last year, she passed me a note 
                        that said she liked me - and I 
                        threw it away. 

                                 BARRON
                        Danggggg. That’s cold. 

                                 ISABEL
                        Look, it’s not like I’m against 
                        lezbeans or anything. I just 
                        couldn’t read her handwriting. 
                        Anyway, I’m pretty sure she still 
                        hates me.  

                                 BARRON
                        I bet she barely remembers you.

           EXT. COLUMBIA PREP - PLAYGROUND - LATER

           Barron and Isabel stand on the sidelines, watching a group of 
           kids playing FOUR SQUARE, taking it way too fucking 
           seriously. 

           ON THE COURT

           ROBERTA NORTON (11, short curls and coke bottle glasses) lets 
           out a guttural VICTORY SCREAM with her finishing move -
                                 ROBERTA
                        Get out of my house, fool!!

           Then, Roberta clocks Barron and Isabel watching from the 
           sidelines. She approaches. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        Greetings, Isabel. What brings you 
                        to the four square court? Here to 
                        break my heart again?

                                 BARRON
                             (whispers)
                        She remembers.

                                 ISABEL
                        I come in peace, Roberta. 

                                 BARRON
                        Barron. Pleased to meet your 
                        acquaintance. 

           Barron extends a handshake - but Roberta refuses it.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Well this is richer than a trust 
                        fund baby on his eighteenth 
                        birthday. You’re dating a Trump 
                        now? 

                                 BARRON
                        Uh, we’re just-

                                 ISABEL
                        Look, Roberta - we need your help. 
                        It’s technology related.

                                 ROBERTA
                        It’s 2015. Many things are 
                        technology related. 

           Isabel sighs, frustrated with Roberta’s smartass remarks.

                                 ISABEL
                        Is there somewhere more private we 
                        could talk? Please? 

           Roberta considers it -

                                 ROBERTA
                        Meet me in the computer lab in five 
                        minutes.

           Roberta stomps back to the court -
                                 BARRON
                             (to Isabel)
                        She seems nice. 

                                 ROBERTA (O.S.)
                        Serve it up and prepare to die, 
                        pipsqueak!

           INT. COLUMBIA PREP - COMPUTER LAB - FIVE MINUTES LATER

           Barron, Isabel and Roberta sit in the very back row of the 
           lab - their faces lit by the glow of the computer screens.

                                 ROBERTA
                        So what do you guys need? Key 
                        cards? Better grades? Wiped 
                        tardies?

                                 ISABEL
                        It’s something a little 
                        more...serious. 

                                 ROBERTA
                             (intrigued)
                        I’m listening. 

                                 BARRON
                        As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, my 
                        father is running for president. 
                        Isabel and I...have decided to 
                        sabotage his campaign. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        Double crossing your own family? 
                        That’s hardcore, man. 

                                 ISABEL
                        We were hoping you could help us 
                        create a tax invasion.

                                 ROBERTA
                        You want me to hack into your dad’s 
                        records and try to find evidence of 
                        fraud - is that what you’re asking? 

                                 BARRON
                        Could you do that? 

           Roberta mulls it over. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        Of course I could. Although, it’s 
                        highly unethical. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROBERTA (CONT'D)
                                 ROBERTA (CONT'D)
                             (to Isabel)
                        As is breaking someone’s heart.
                             (to Barron)
                        And it ain’t gonna be cheap.

                                 BARRON
                        Money is no object. 

           Roberta BREATHES onto her glasses dramatically - then wipes 
           them clean. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        Let’s get started then, shall we? 

           INT. TRUMP TOWER - BARRON’S LIVING ROOM - AFTER SCHOOL

           Barron and Isabel sit on beanbags, watching as Roberta CRACKS 
           her knuckles and begins typing absurdly fast on her laptop.

                                 BARRON
                        So...how does this work? Do you 
                        need the wifi password or-

                                 ROBERTA
                        I’m already in.

                                 BARRON
                        Like, in in?
                             (to Isabel)
                        Dang, she’s good.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Alright, let’s see here. I’ll just 
                        try to access the servers and...
                             (beat)
                        Huh. 

                                 BARRON
                        What’s “huh?”

                                 ROBERTA
                        Someone just kicked me out. 

           Barron hovers over her - 

                                 BARRON
                        Well can you get back in?

                                 ROBERTA
                        Can you give some space, bro?

                                 BARRON
                        Sorry.
           Roberta tries again. Begins TYPING UP A STORM. Then -

                                 ROBERTA
                        What the frickin’ heck! 

                                 ISABEL
                        Can you see who it is?

                                 ROBERTA
                        Not who, but I can see where. Looks 
                        like the IP address is coming 
                        from...Russia.

           Dun dun dun.

                                 ISABEL
                        Why would someone in Russia be 
                        protecting your dad?

                                 BARRON
                        I have absolutely no clue. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        This is way past my pay grade, man. 

           Roberta gets up, closes up her laptop.

                                 BARRON
                        Wait, hold on - there’s gotta be 
                        someone you know who can help us. 

                                 ISABEL
                        Please, Roberta. 

           Roberta considers it, finally caves -

                                 ROBERTA
                        There’s some South Korean dudes in 
                        my WoW guild. They can hack into 
                        pretty high-level stuff. But I’m 
                        warning you, they’re kinda crazy. 

                                 BARRON
                        I’m willing to risk it. 

           Roberta eyes Barron with concern, like he has no idea what he 
           just agreed to. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        Suit yourself, dude. 

           Barron walks her out -
           And when he turns back, he sees that Isabel is walking around 
           his place, eyeing the various POSTERS on the walls. She lands 
           on one in particular: a one-sheet for Return of the Jedi. 

                                 ISABEL
                        What’s this? 

                                 BARRON
                        That’s the third film in the 
                        franchise. Well, it’s the sixth 
                        episode, but it’s the third one 
                        that came out. 

                                 ISABEL
                        That seems dumb and confusing. 

           Isabel points to SLAVE LEIA -

                                 ISABEL
                        And this bikini looks like it was 
                        designed by pervs. 

                                 BARRON
                        That’s because it’s Leia’s slave 
                        outfit - she’s forced to wear it by 
                        Jabba the Hutt.

                                 ISABEL
                        Jabba the who?

                                 BARRON
                        The slug guy.
                             (pointing)
                        Him.

           Isabel CRINGES -

                                 ISABEL
                        Ew. I hate his fat face. 

                                 BARRON
                        He’s one of the galaxy’s most 
                        powerful and corrupt gangsters. 

           Sounds familiar, eh? 

                                 ISABEL
                        What is it you like so much about 
                        these space movies? 

           Barron reflects on this for a super serious beat - 
                                 BARRON
                        Because even when the Rebels are 
                        outnumbered, they always find a way 
                        to defeat the Empire - and restore 
                        order to the galaxy. 

           For a moment, Isabel seems oddly touched by this. Then - 

                                 ISABEL
                        You are the biggest nerd on the 
                        entire planet. 

           INT. BARRON’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           It’s late and Barron’s still awake - his face illuminated by 
           the blue glow of his phone. He’s going through his father’s 
           TWITTER FEED. It’s a steady stream of hate fueled bullshit, 
           with some hilarious typos thrown in here and there. 

           Finally, Barron can’t keep his eyes open any longer, and as 
           he nods off, we CUT TO...

           BARRON’S DREAM

           Barron wanders through the EMPTY HALLWAYS of some eerily 
           prestigious building - the space is vast and never-ending...

           Then, he hears something -

           A WOMAN’S SCREAM

           Barron books it down the hallway, turning corner after 
           corner, finally realizing he’s inside -

           THE WHITE HOUSE

           Now, he stands before the OVAL OFFICE. Most definitely the 
           source of the scream. He pushes open the door to reveal...

           PRESIDENT JABBA THE TRUMP - a slug-creature with the body of 
           JABBA THE HUTT and the head of DONALD TRUMP - a disturbing, 
           surreal sight...

           Jabba the Trump YANKS A CHAIN - which is revealed to be 
           attached around SLAVE MELANIA’s neck. She’s wearing the 
           iconic golden bikini - choking in pain...

                                 SLAVE MELANIA
                        <Go back to bed, Barron.>

                                 BARRON
                        <But he’s hurting you!>
           Jabba the Trump LAUGHS as he continues choking his slave wife-

                                 JABBA THE TRUMP
                        HA HA HA HO HO HO

           Then, Barron CHARGES at his slug-father - 

           And begins PUMMELING HIM with PUNCHES -

           But Jabba the Trump is unaffected - and he WHIPS HIS SLUG-
           TAIL AT BARRON - KNOCKING HIM BACK TO THE FLOOR!

                                 BARRON
                             (down for the count)
                        <Mother...>

           Jabba the Trump YANKS THE CHAIN HARDER as Melania’s SCREAMS 
           haunt Barron’s dreams...

                                                         SMASH BACK TO:

           BARRON’S BEDROOM

           As he jolts awake. Out of breath. Scared out of his mind. 

           Then, he smells something. Pulls the sheets back to reveal - 
           he wet the bed. 

           INT. BARRON’S LAUNDRY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Barron, now dressed in a silk robe and slippers, carries a 
           heap of wet sheets - and tosses them into the washer. 

           INT. BARRON’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Barron CLICKS on the TV. More coverage of his father’s 
           campaign. The election is rapidly approaching. And like any 
           good cult leader, Donald’s following is growing.

           Fuck. 

           INT. COLUMBIA PREP - HALLWAY - THE NEXT DAY

           Barron and Isabel head down the hallway before class. Barron 
           looks like shit. YAWNS like a lion.

                                 ISABEL
                        Didn’t sleep well?
                                 BARRON
                        You could say that...

           Just then, they notice a GROUP OF STUDENTS gathering 
           suspiciously in the distance. That’s weird. Barron pushes his 
           way through to find the CROWD gathering around a BLOWN UP 
           PHOTOGRAPH taped up on the wall...

           It’s of TWO NUDE WOMEN posing erotically - and someone’s 
           written a message, too:

                                   FIRST (NAKED) LADY

           And finally, Barron puts two and two together... 

                                 BARRON
                        Ohmygod. 

           Right on cue, Tanner pokes out from the CROWD -

                                 TANNER
                        I gotta hand it to you, Tiny Trump - 
                        your mom is gonna be the hottest 
                        first lady ever.

                                 BARRON
                        Where did you find this?! 

                                 TANNER
                        Uh, it’s all over the news.

           Barron has a mini panic attack as the students LAUGH and 
           POINT at his very naked mother. He TEARS the poster off the 
           wall before storming off.

                                 TANNER
                        Hey, that’s no way to treat a lady!

           More howling laughter from the peanut gallery. 

           INT. COLUMBIA PREP - COMPUTER LAB - SOON AFTER

           Barron, Isabel and Roberta are back in the COMPUTER LAB. 
           Pulling up recent NEWS ARTICLES - 

                                 BARRON
                        “Korean hackers leak previously 
                        buried nude photos of Melania Trump 
                        from French Magazine...”

           Barron shoots a look of blame at Roberta. 
                                 ROBERTA
                        Don’t look at me! I told you those 
                        guys were crazy. You didn’t listen.

                                 BARRON
                        But how was I supposed to know 
                        they’d do...this?!

                                 ISABEL
                        Did your friends find anything at 
                        all that could help us with the tax 
                        invasion? 

                                 ROBERTA
                        Negative. But hey - this is what 
                        you guys wanted, right? For your 
                        dad to look bad?

                                 BARRON
                        Not at the cost of my mother’s 
                        naked body being put on display for 
                        the whole world to see!

           Just then, the BELL RINGS. Roberta grabs her backpack -

                                 ROBERTA
                        Well, I’ve got a science test. Good 
                        luck, dudes.  

                                 BARRON
                        Wait, you’re just gonna leave? We 
                        need to fix this!

                                 ROBERTA
                        Rule number one of the internet - 
                        once something’s out there, it’s 
                        out there. 

           And Roberta heads off, leaving Barron and Isabel alone. 

                                 BARRON
                        Can kids have heart attacks? I 
                        think I’m gonna have a heart 
                        attack. 

                                 ISABEL
                        It’s not your fault, Barron. You 
                        were just trying to help-

                                 BARRON
                        It’s literally all my fault.
                                 ISABEL
                        Hey - did things work out for Frank 
                        Underwood right away?

           Barron breathes. Shakes his head.

                                 ISABEL
                        These things take time. We’ll get 
                        him. I promise. 

           Barron nods with uncertainty. He fucking hopes she’s right.  

           INT. COLUMBIA PREP - CLASSROOM - LATER

           Barron sits slumped in his seat. Still feeling the judging 
           eyes of his peers all over him. Just then, someone tosses a 
           folded up PIECE OF PAPER onto his desk -

           He unfolds it to find yet another printed photograph of NUDE 
           MELANIA. Barron CRUMPLES the photo, but before he can dispose 
           of it, Mrs. Hawthorne walks by, SNATCHES it away -

                                 MRS. HAWTHORNE
                        Passing notes in class, Mr. Trump?

                                 BARRON
                        Wait, Mrs. Hawthorne-

           She opens it up. And her expression says it all. 

                                 MRS. HAWTHORNE
                        This is incredibly inappropriate. 

                                 BARRON
                        You think I don’t know that?

                                 MRS. HAWTHORNE
                        Don’t take that tone with me. 

                                 BARRON
                        What, this tone?

           But before Mrs. Hawthorne can start yelling, Barron simply 
           gathers his stuff and walks out.

                                 MRS. HAWTHORNE
                        Where do you think you’re going??

                                 BARRON
                        I’m sending myself to the 
                        principal’s office.

           The door SLAMS - and he’s gone. 
           INT. COLUMBIA PREP - PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Barron storms into the office and sits down in front of Katz. 

                                 KATZ
                        Barron, what brings you-

                                 BARRON
                        I need to hide out for a while. 

           Katz is surprisingly cool with this. 

                                 PRINCIPAL KATZ
                        Right. I’m assuming this is about 
                        the photos going around? 

                                 BARRON
                        Great - even the principal has seen 
                        my mom naked. 

                                 PRINCIPAL KATZ
                        You know, Barron - in Europe and 
                        other parts of the world, it’s 
                        perfectly natural to celebrate the 
                        female form. 

                                 BARRON
                        It’s not natural, it’s gross. I 
                        hate it and I hate this stupid 
                        school.

           Barron crosses his arms, forms a frowny face. Angsty as hell. 
           Then, Katz has an idea...he opens up his special drawer. 
           Pulls out a bottle of wine and two coffee mugs. 

           Barron stares at his principal in utter disbelief. 

                                 BARRON
                        What’s...happening right now? 

                                 PRINCIPAL KATZ
                        In Europe, it’s also perfectly 
                        normal for children to have a sip 
                        of wine with lunch. And since 
                        you’ve had quite a day...

                                 BARRON
                        Principal Katz, we could both go to 
                        jail!

                                 PRINCIPAL KATZ
                        I won’t tell if you don’t. 

           Katz pours Barron the tiniest sip of Chardonnay. 
                                 PRINCIPAL KATZ
                        Go ahead. Try it.

           Barron eyes the mug suspiciously. 

                                 BARRON
                        Is this some kind of test?

                                 PRINCIPAL KATZ
                        No test. Just a toast. To bad days. 

           They CLINK mugs and Barron tries his first sip of wine. 
           CRINGES as if he drank pure gasoline. 

                                 PRINCIPAL KATZ
                        How do you feel? 

           Barron considers the question for a solid beat -

                                 BARRON
                        Better. 

                                 PRINCIPAL KATZ
                        And we call that: the miracle of 
                        the grape. 

                                 BARRON
                             (beat)
                        Principal Katz, what did your dad 
                        do for a living? 

                                 PRINCIPAL KATZ
                        Why - he was principal of this very 
                        school until I took over. Why do 
                        you ask? 

           Long pause. Then, Barron holds his mug out, stone-faced:

                                 BARRON
                        One more alcohol, please. 

           INT. TRUMP TOWER - BARRON’S OFFICE - A FEW DAYS LATER

           Barron sits at his desk, absentmindedly watching the 
           surveillance monitors, like there’s nothing good on TV. 

           Then, something catches his eye - a WOMAN exiting DONALD’S 
           PENTHOUSE. Fur coat, high red heels. This is DESTINY (21, 
           elegant as fuck).

           Barron’s chair SQUEAKS with interest as he slowly sits up...
           INT. TRUMP TOWER - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Barron rushes out of the ELEVATOR and looks around - finally 
           clocks Destiny exiting the building. He follows.  

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           Barron trails Destiny, keeping a safe distance. But after a 
           CROWD OF TOURISTS obscures his view - he loses her.

           Barron runs up ahead, surveys the scene - nothing. His eyes 
           track over to an UPSCALE HOTEL...

           INT. UPSCALE HOTEL - FRONT DESK - MOMENTS LATER

           Barron stands at the FRONT DESK. He can barely see over it. 

                                 BARRON
                        Excuse me, did a woman just pass 
                        through here? High heels, fur coat, 
                        big...personality?

           The HOTEL WORKER eyes Barron suspiciously. 

                                 HOTEL WORKER
                        I’m afraid I can’t give you that 
                        information.

           Barron pulls out a WAD OF CASH from his wallet. Tries to 
           discreetly hand it over. 

                                 BARRON
                        Are you sure about that?

                                 HOTEL WORKER
                        Should I call security, little boy?

                                 BARRON
                        Or should I call the police - 
                        considering you’ve just allowed a 
                        protestant onto the premises?

                                 HOTEL WORKER
                        Do you mean a prostitute?

                                 BARRON
                        That’s what I said. Now what’ll it 
                        be, mister - jail or no jail? 

           The Hotel Worker stares at Barron for a beat, stunned. Who 
           the fuck is this little shit? He finally leans in, whispers:
                                 HOTEL WORKER
                        33rd floor. 

           INT. UPSCALE HOTEL - 33RD FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Barron wanders through the long hallway, on the prowl for 
           anything suspicious. Finally, he hears something - VOICES - 
           coming out of room 3329.

           Barron creeps up to the door - nestles his ear to it...

                                 DESTINY (O.S.)
                        You like that? 

                                 WHIMPERING MAN (O.S.)
                        Yes. I like it very much.

                                 DESTINY (O.S.)
                        Tell me how bad you are, Senator.

                                 WHIMPERING MAN (O.S.)
                        I’m so bad. Punish me!

           The Whimpering Man lets out an embarrassingly loud ORGASM - 
           and we’re gauging Barron’s reaction here: he’s equal parts 
           disturbed and fascinated.

           Then, Barron shuffles away from the door as he hears the 
           CLACKING of heels approaching. He plants himself a safe 
           distance around the corner, HIDING behind the ice machine.  

           The door OPENS -

                                 DESTINY
                        See you next week, Arthur. 

           And she heads down the hall, cleaning her hands with a wet 
           wipe. Barron peeks around the corner, watching her...

           But Destiny, seemingly sensing Barron’s presence, stops dead 
           in her tracks -

                                 DESTINY
                        Who’s there? 

           Barron DUCKS into hiding again. Waits...

                                 DESTINY
                        I know you’re watching. 
                             (finally)
                        I’ve got mace!

           Barron finally pops out and reveals himself. 
                                 BARRON
                             (totally serious)
                        Do...do you have a spider-sense?

                                 DESTINY
                        Just killer instincts. Look, if 
                        that was your dad in there, I don’t 
                        know what to tell ya-

                                 BARRON
                        No- I’m Barron. Barron Trump? 

                                 DESTINY
                        Well ho-ly shit. I don’t know how I 
                        didn’t put that together. You look 
                        exactly like him.

                                 BARRON
                        I wouldn’t say exactly...

           Barron steps closer, lowers his voice -

                                 BARRON
                        Look, I know this might sound 
                        crazy, but-

                                 DESTINY
                        Let me guess - you’re gonna Frank 
                        Underwood your own pops’ campaign 
                        and want me to spill all the dirty 
                        things he’s done to me? 

                                 BARRON
                             (shocked)
                        How are you doing this?!

                                 DESTINY
                        I’ve seen it all, kid. Now if 
                        you’ll excuse me...

           She turns and walks off. Barron follows -

                                 BARRON
                        Wait, do you have any interest in 
                        detailing your experiences to me? I 
                        could get you a book deal, maybe 
                        some interviews-

                                 DESTINY
                        Sorry sweetie, but I’ve signed my 
                        life away to your old man. I’d be 
                        in court for years if I squeal. 
                                 BARRON
                        I have money. Tons in my savings-

                                 DESTINY
                        Keep your money - buy something 
                        nice for your girlfriend. A lady 
                        killer like you must have a 
                        girlfriend, right? 

                                 BARRON
                        Well, not exactly.

                                 DESTINY
                        I’m sure there’s someone you’ve got 
                        your eye on. 

                                 BARRON
                        There is. But...I don’t know how to 
                        take our relationship to the next 
                        level.

                                 DESTINY
                        Clueless young love - how romantic. 
                        You seem like a smart kid. I’m sure 
                        you’ll figure it out.

           Barron’s got one last idea - 

                                 BARRON
                        New proposal: I buy you lunch and 
                        you tell me everything I want to 
                        know about the female species. 

           She thinks it over. Checks her fancy watch.

                                 DESTINY
                        Make it steak and you’ve got 
                        yourself a deal, sweet pea. 

           INT. FANCY STEAK HOUSE - LATER

           An upscale STEAK HOUSE on the Upper West Side. Super fucking 
           expensive. Bubbly water only. You get the idea. 

           Barron sits across from Destiny, watches her power through a 
           filet mignon like an absolute champ.

                                 DESTINY
                             (mouth full)
                        Tell me more about the girl.  
                                 BARRON
                        Her name is Isabel and she’s the 
                        most beautiful creature I’ve ever 
                        laid eyes on. We’re friends...but I 
                        think there’s something there. 
                        Something special. 

                                 DESTINY
                        I’ll spit some wisdom for you, kid. 
                        The biggest problem between men and 
                        women is a lack of communication. 
                        If they were better at it, I’d be 
                        out of a job. So - you need to be 
                        upfront, honest, and communicate 
                        your true feelings to her. 

                                 BARRON
                        Communication. Copy that. 

                                 DESTINY
                        Second, you can’t just ask her to 
                        be your girlfriend. You’ve got to 
                        make an event out of it. You’ve got 
                        to woo her. Take her out on the 
                        town. To dinner, maybe a show. When 
                        the moment is right, gift her some 
                        jewelry - and boom - ask her to be 
                        your bae. 

                                 BARRON
                        “Be my bae...” Okay. I think I can 
                        do that.

                                 DESTINY
                        And one last thing - if she says 
                        no, that’s the end of the line. 
                        None of this romantic comedy 
                        bullshit where you persist until 
                        she finally surrenders, alright? 
                        That shit is toxic. 

           Barron nods in agreement. 

                                 BARRON
                        I can’t thank you enough for your 
                        help, Destiny. 

                                 DESTINY
                        Don’t mention it. Love is simple. 
                        People tend to overcomplicate 
                        things.  

           Destiny finishes her steak, BURPS loudly, drawing stares from 
           nearby RICH SNOBS. 
                                 BARRON
                        You know - you remind me of my 
                        sister, Ivanka. I feel like you two 
                        would really get along. 

                                 DESTINY
                        Funny you should mention that - 
                        your dad said the same thing. 

           Yikes.

           EXT. ISABEL’S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

           A beautiful, 3-story home out in the suburbs - an hour or so 
           from the city. Barron’s CADILLAC pulls to a stop out front. 

           INT. CADILLAC - CONTINUOUS

           Frederik looks back at Barron - the kid looks scared 
           shitless. First date jitters. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        You alright, little buddy?

                                 BARRON
                        I’m perspiring. Heavily. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        Hey - you got this. 

                                 BARRON
                        What if they think I’m a racist? 

                                 FREDERIK
                        Barron, you aren’t your dad - 
                        you’re you.

                                 BARRON
                             (deep breath)
                        Here goes nothing.

           EXT. ISABEL’S FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Barron KNOCKS on the door, waiting for what seems like an 
           eternity before Isabel’s mom SAMANTHA (late 30s, warm) greets 
           him with a smile.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        You must be Barron. 
                                 BARRON
                             (voice cracks)
                        Yes, ma’am. 

           Barron looks back at Frederik once more - who gives him a big 
           ol’ THUMBS UP before he heads inside...

           INT. ISABEL’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Samantha leads Barron into the house - 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        That’s a beautiful suit, Barron.

                                 BARRON
                        Thanks. It’s Armani. 

           And finally, they arrive in the LIVING ROOM - where Isabel’s 
           father HUGO (40s, Mexican-American, thick dad-stache) sits on 
           the couch, a beer in hand. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Honey, this is- 

                                 HUGO
                        The man of the hour. I’ve heard a 
                        lot about you, Mr. Trump. 

                                 BARRON
                             (shaking)
                        Good things, I hope?

                                 HUGO
                        Well, that depends - are you here 
                        to deport me?  

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Hugo.

                                 HUGO
                        What? I’m just jokin’ around. 

           Barron CHUCKLES nervously. Samantha tries to lighten the mood-

                                 SAMANTHA
                        So where are you and Isabel off to 
                        tonight?

                                 BARRON
                        We’re going to a broadway show.
                                 SAMANTHA
                        Isn’t that romantic! And you’ll be 
                        supervised, I presume?

                                 BARRON
                        Yes, ma’am. My bodyguard will be 
                        with us the whole time. 

                                 HUGO
                        Let me ask you a question, kiddo. 
                        You really think Mexico’s gonna pay 
                        for this wall?

                                 ISABEL (O.S.)
                        Dad! Are you harassing Barron?

           Finally - Isabel appears at the top of the stairs. 

                                 HUGO
                        We’re just talking, mija. 

           Barron lights up as he watches Isabel head down the stairs in 
           a beautiful black dress. It’s the first time he’s seen her in 
           anything other than a uniform - and he’s shook.

                                 SAMANTHA 
                             (tears)
                        My little girl is all grown up.

                                 ISABEL
                        Mommmmmm.
                             (to Barron)
                        We should probably get going, 
                        right? 

           Barron nods aggressively, like - yes please for the love of 
           God get me the fuck out of here.

                                 ISABEL
                        Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad! 

                                 BARRON
                        It was a pleasure meeting you both.

           Barron and Isabel hurry out the door. After the kids are 
           gone, Samantha gives Hugo the death stare. 

                                 HUGO
                        What?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        He’s a ten year-old boy, Hugo. Cut 
                        him some slack.
           Hugo sips his beer dismissively. 

           INT. CADILLAC (MOVING) - LATER

           Frederik chauffeurs the kids through town. Barron and Isabel 
           sit in awkward silence in the backseat. 

                                 ISABEL
                        Sorry about that. My family’s kinda 
                        crazy.

                                 BARRON
                        Are you kidding? I don’t think you 
                        have any idea what crazy is.

           Isabel looks out the window - watches as they pass THE 
           THEATRE. 

                                 ISABEL
                        I thought we were seeing Hamilton? 

           Barron holds back a smile -

                                 ISABEL
                        You guys aren’t kidnapping me, are 
                        you? I have a taser.

                                 BARRON
                        Do you really?

           Isabel showcases a PINK TASER on her keychain.

                                 ISABEL
                        Birthday gift from my dad. 
                             (pointing it)
                        Now tell me where we’re going or 
                        I’ll zap you!

                                 BARRON
                        Madison Square Garden. Backstage 
                        passes. Kanye West.

           At first, Isabel looks too shocked to speak. Then - she 
           SCREAMS at the top of her lungs. 

           EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT

           Barron, Isabel and Frederik roll up to the VIP ENTRANCE near 
           the back of the venue. A SECURITY GUARD blocks the way. 
                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        This is a VIP entrance only. You’ll 
                        need to go around the front, like 
                        everyone else. 

                                 BARRON
                        We are VIP. It’s under “Lil’ B.” 

           Suddenly - the Guard looks starstruck. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        You’re Lil’ B? Holy shit - can I 
                        get a selfie with you?

                                 BARRON
                        Sure? 

           Barron poses accordingly, throws up a peace sign while he 
           SNAPS a photo. Then, the gang heads inside...

           INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Barron, Isabel and Frederik huddle up on the side of the 
           stage. They’re literally RIGHT next to the action. 

                                 ISABEL
                        I’m fully freaking out right now.

           Then, the LIGHTS GO DOWN and the audience ROARS. And finally, 
           Kanye West appears - SUSPENDED IN THE AIR BY WIRES - his arms 
           held out like Jesus. 

                                 KANYE
                             (screams into mic)
                        I AM A LITERAL GOD!

           The crowd goes apeshit. 

                                 KANYE
                        This first song is dedicated to a 
                        very special young lady. Isabel - 
                        this is for you.

           As the INSTRUMENTAL FOR “BOUND 2” kicks in...Isabel dies and 
           goes to heaven. 

           INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - GREEN ROOM - AFTER THE SHOW

           Frederik helps himself to a buffet of snacks - chips, 
           popcorn, and candy - while Isabel paces around the room in 
           circles. A nervous wreck. 
                                 ISABEL
                        I changed my mind. I don’t want to 
                        meet him. Let’s just leave. Barron?

           But Barron’s distracted by a LAPTOP that’s been left on a 
           nearby desk. He inspects it carefully...

                                 ISABEL
                             (quietly)
                        Don’t touch that! 

                                 BARRON
                        I’m just looking...

           Barron slides his finger along the trackpad - killing the 
           screensaver. There’s not even a password in place.

                                 ISABEL
                        You literally just touched it!!

           Kanye’s browser is opened up to his Twitter. And he’s still 
           signed in. Barron looks to Isabel - and she knows exactly 
           what he’s thinking. 

                                 BARRON
                        Twenty nine million followers, 
                        Isabel. We could send any message 
                        we want. Anything. 

           Isabel’s torn. This is a huge opportunity...

                                 ISABEL
                        Do it fast.

           And Barron launches into action. 

                                 BARRON
                        Frederik, lock the door!

           Frederik obeys - and Barron begins composing a TWEET:

                                 BARRON
                             (typing out loud)
                        “If you vote for 
                        @RealDonaldTrump”...then what? 

                                 ISABEL
                        Then you’re a dumb idiot.

                                 BARRON
                        That’s not edgy enough-

                                 ISABEL
                        Just hurry up and write something!
           Just then - KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

                                 KANYE (O.S.)
                        Open up! It’s Ye. 

                                 FREDERIK
                             (quietly, to Barron)
                        Little buddy?

                                 BARRON
                        Stall him for a minute. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        One second, Mister Kanye! I’m 
                        trying to unlock the door-
                             (stumbling for this)
                        But my fingers are greasy from 
                        these potato chips - let me get a 
                        napkin! 

                                 KANYE (O.S.)
                        Open the damn door, fool!

           Barron finally finishes typing the tweet -

                                 BARRON
                        Done!

           Then, he closes up the laptop and does his best to act 
           natural - while Frederik unlocks the door... 

           And Kanye walks inside with Romeo. Thankfully, he’s wearing a 
           big dumb grin - and doesn’t suspect any foul play.

                                 KANYE
                        Ya’ll up to no good in here? 

           Isabel tries to hold it together as her idol approaches -

                                 ISABEL
                        It’s so nice to meet you, Kanye. I 
                        just wanted to say that you’ve 
                        changed my life. I’ve been teaching 
                        myself ProTools, too. 

                                 KANYE
                        Thanks, little lady. Send over your 
                        stuff, I’ll have a listen. 

           Isabel nearly loses it over the offer. Kanye makes his way 
           over to Barron - boom - handshake hug.

                                 KANYE
                        Glad you could roll through, B.
                                 BARRON
                        Great show, Mr. West. I especially 
                        loved the part where you autotuned 
                        your voice and sang about the 
                        injustices of the world. 

                                 KANYE
                        You know me. Gotta keep it real.

           Just then - Kanye’s phone BUZZES. 

                                 KANYE
                        One sec - my publicist is calling. 
                             (answers)
                        Yo, let me hit you back. I’m 
                        hanging with some-

           A dramatic beat as Kanye seemingly gets some bad news. Barron 
           eyes Isabel...

                                 KANYE
                        The fuck you mean it’ll “alienate 
                        fans?” What tweet?

                                 BARRON
                        Well, Kanye...thanks again but 
                        we’ve got school in the morning so 
                        we’re just gonna take off-

                                 KANYE
                             (snaps)
                        Romeo. 

           Romeo closes the door, blocks the exit. Kanye hangs up, pulls 
           up Twitter on his phone -

                                 KANYE
                             (reading)
                        “Anyone who votes for 
                        @RealDonaldTrump will burn in hell 
                        for all of eternity.” 

           Frederik and Isabel shoot Barron a look - like Jesus, kid!

           Kanye clocks the laptop, then looks accusingly to Barron - 
           genuine anger in his eyes now. 

                                 KANYE
                        Did you disrespect my Twitter page?

           Kanye looms over Barron. Frederik tries to intervene -

                                 FREDERIK
                        Hey, go easy on the kid-
           But Romeo grabs Frederik, holds him back. 

                                 KANYE
                        Why would you do me like this, B? 
                        You know me and your pops are tight 
                        as hell. 

                                 BARRON
                        Don’t you get it? If he becomes 
                        president, he’ll destroy us all!

                                 KANYE
                             (laughing)
                        You’ve got it all wrong, fool. Your 
                        pops is gonna save us. He’s the 
                        truth. The light. So imma delete 
                        this blasphemy right here-

           Kanye dramatically DELETES the TWEET on his phone.

                                 KANYE 
                        And poof! It’s gone like the wind.  

                                 BARRON
                        Rule number one of the internet, 
                        once something’s out there, it’s 
                        out there. 

                                 KANYE
                        Unless you’re Kanye West. 

           Barron looks to Isabel - what does that even mean?!

                                 KANYE
                        It pains me to say this, Lil’ B - 
                        but you and your friends are 
                        officially off the homie list.

           Isabel grabs her heart, like she just took a knife to the 
           chest. 

                                 KANYE
                        Romeo, get ‘em outta here. 

                                 ISABEL
                        Wait- can I still send you my 
                        beats? Can I get your email?!

           Romeo quickly corrals everyone out of the room. Frederik 
           grabs a handful of popcorn before being dragged out. 
           EXT. ISABEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Barron’s at the front door with Isabel. What a night. 

                                 BARRON
                        I’m really sorry, Isabel. 

                                 ISABEL
                        Barron, you had the chance to reach 
                        thirty million people with the 
                        click of a button. I mean - that’s 
                        a huge opportunity. 

                                 BARRON
                        It’s not just that, though. 
                        Sometimes...I feel like there’s 
                        this voice inside of me, telling me 
                        to do bad things. It’s like a 
                        curse. 

                                 ISABEL
                        The Trump curse?

           Barron nods somberly. 

                                 BARRON
                        I just...I really wanted tonight to 
                        be perfect. But instead, I got you
                        blacklisted by your favorite 
                        musical artist.

                                 ISABEL
                        If he’s voting for your dad...
                        then heck ‘em. 

           Barron manages a tiny smile, then reaches inside his suit 
           pocket - pulls out a JEWELRY BOX.

                                 BARRON
                        I meant to give this to you at the 
                        concert. Before we got escorted 
                        out. 

           He pops it open, revealing: a gorgeous DIAMOND NECKLACE. 
           Isabel’s eyes bulge - this thing looks really, really, REALLY 
           expensive. 

                                 ISABEL
                        Barron, I don’t know what to say...

                                 BARRON
                        You don’t like it? 
                                 ISABEL
                        I do, it’s just...it’s something my 
                        mom would wear, you know? I’m 
                        pretty sure a mugger would beat me 
                        up and steal it.  

                                 BARRON
                             (fake smile)
                        Oh. Yeah, you’re probably right.

           Awkward silence.

                                 ISABEL
                        Well, I should get to bed. 
                        Goodnight, Barron. Thanks again for 
                        the concert. 

                                 BARRON
                        Goodnight, Isabel.

           And she disappears into the house. 

           INT. CADILLAC - MOMENTS LATER

           Barron SLAMS the door. Stays silent for a beat.

                                 FREDERIK
                        So...?

                                 BARRON
                        She rejected the necklace. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        Keep your head up, little buddy. 
                        The diamonds were a big swing. 

                                 BARRON
                        Too big, apparently.
                             (beat)
                        How’d you get your wife to like 
                        you, Frederik? 

                                 FREDERIK
                        Didn’t have to do much. It was love 
                        at first sight. 

           Barron sighs. That isn’t helpful. Just then, they hear 
           Donald’s name on the car radio -

                                 BARRON
                        Hey, turn it up.

           Frederik pumps the volume -
                                 NEWS ANCHOR (O.S.)
                        Donald Trump has just passed the 
                        threshold required to secure his 
                        delegates for the Republican 
                        ticket. Trump and his running mate, 
                        Mike Pence, are set to be announced 
                        as the official ticket nominees 
                        next month at the Republican 
                        National Convention...

                                 BARRON
                        I can’t believe it. He’s doing it. 
                        He’s really doing it. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        Wanna drive through-

                                 BARRON
                        No. Just take me home, Frederik.

           Frederik nods, drives off.

           INT. TRUMP TOWER - MELANIA’S FLOOR - NIGHT

           Barron heads towards his mother’s bedroom, stops at the door. 
           Peeks through the crack to find...

           MELANIA

           Weeping on the bed. An absolute mess. Surely the result of 
           the latest news. 

           Barron watches her for a beat, then leaves the JEWELRY BOX 
           outside her door - and quietly creeps off into the night. 

           INT. TRUMP TOWER - PRESS ROOM - BACKSTAGE - THE NEXT DAY

           Barron and Frederik sit around backstage while PRODUCERS and 
           TEAM TRUMP VOLUNTEERS zip around in a frenzy. The swirling 
           shitstorm that precedes any live event. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        This is a highly stressful 
                        environment.

                                 BARRON
                        Exactly why I never want to be on 
                        TV.

           Just then, Barron notices a SPEECHWRITER (40s, bald, 
           underpaid) running over to nearby PRODUCER -
                                 SPEECHWRITER
                        Where’s the teleprompter guy? I’ve 
                        got Donald’s revised speech. 

                                 PRODUCER
                        Down the hall. Make a left.

           And as Barron watches the Writer disappear down the hall, he 
           has an idea... 

                                 BARRON
                        I need you to cover for me. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        But the broadcast is about to start-

                                 BARRON
                        I’ll be gone two minutes, tops. 
                        Tell them I’m in the bathroom. 

           Frederik’s still not convinced...

                                 BARRON
                        Who cleaned up your mess when you 
                        puked up Butterfinger McFlurry all 
                        over the elevators?

                                 FREDERIK
                        You did.

                                 BARRON
                        And who lied about being your 
                        biological son so you could get the 
                        father’s day discount at Arby’s?

                                 FREDERIK
                        You did. 

           Barron pleads with his most Pixar-esque eyes - 

                                 BARRON
                        Two minutes. Pleeeeease.

           And Frederik can’t help but cave.

                                 FREDERIK
                        Two minutes! Or I’m comin’ after 
                        ya.

           Barron scurries off, into the...
           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Creeps down the hall. And into the...

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Barron quietly enters the room - clocks a NERDY TECH GUY 
           (30s, stache and pedo glasses) typing up Donald’s new speech 
           into the TELEPROMPTER. 

           He hears Barron’s footsteps, turns around -

                                 NERDY TECH GUY
                        You’re not allowed to be in here.

                                 BARRON
                        My father owns the building - I’m 
                        allowed to be wherever I want. 
                             (with authority)
                        Also, I need to make some changes 
                        to the speech. 

                                 NERDY TECH GUY
                        Look kid, I don’t have time for 
                        your little jokes. Get the hell-

                                 BARRON
                        Do I look like I’m joking?

                                 NERDY TECH GUY
                        That’s it, I’m calling security-

           The Man picks up his PHONE -

                                 BARRON
                        I wouldn’t do that if I were you.

           Barron edges forward...

                                 BARRON
                        Security comes in here, I tell them 
                        I wandered in by accident, looking 
                        for the bathroom. I tried to leave, 
                        but you wouldn’t let me. 

                                 NERDY TECH GUY
                        What the fuck-

                                 BARRON
                        I tell them everything you did to 
                        me. How scared I was. And how you 
                        smiled the whole time.

                                 BARRON (CONT'D)
                        My father’s lawyers will make sure 
                        you end up in jail - a life 
                        sentence. And I’m sure you’ve heard 
                        what they do to little kid fiddlers 
                        in jail.

           Nerdy Tech Guy nearly swallows his tongue. He shakes his head 
           in disbelief - 

                                 NERDY TECH GUY
                             (stuttering)
                        Are you off your medication, kid? 
                        No one’s gonna buy that-

                                 BARRON
                        I’m the son of one of the most 
                        powerful men in America. You’re a 
                        creep with pedo glasses and a dirty 
                        stache that probably took two 
                        months to grow. Who do you think 
                        they’re gonna believe? 

           Nerdy Tech Guy comes to the ultimate realization that this 
           kid is right. 

                                 NERDY TECH GUY
                        And when they ask what happened?

           If Barron had a pair of sunglasses, he’d put them on before 
           delivering this next line:

                                 BARRON
                        Blame it on the democrats. 

           Nerdy Tech Guy visibly GULPS. Prepares to take dictation. Off 
           Barron’s very Walter White-esque smile...

                                                         SMASH BACK TO:

           INT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Barron returns to Frederik - who’s sweating bullets now. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        There you are! Cutting it awfully 
                        close, little buddy.

                                 BARRON
                        Told you I’d be back.

           They exchange discreet fist bumps.
                                 PRODUCER (O.S.)

                                 ANCHOR 1
                        Donald Trump ended his speech early 
                        tonight due to technical issues 
                        with the teleprompter. His 
                        detractors on Twitter were quick to 
                        point out that Trump previously 
                        slammed President Obama as being a 
                        “teleprompter guy.” 

           FLIP!

                        Sources close to the Republican 
                        candidate said the incident was a 
                        technical issue, but Trump has some 
                        theories, citing that he believes 
                        he was “hacked by the democrats.”

           Barron and Frederik sip from champagne flutes filled with 
           apple juice and watch the NEWS CLIPS of NERDY FANS gathering 
           by the thousands for the new Star Wars. 

           Nearby, Melania sleeps soundly in her 24k gold eye mask. 
           Donald’s in the bathroom shitting. Obviously.

                                 FREDERIK
                        Remind me who your parents are 
                        meeting with again? 

                                 BARRON
                        I dunno, some Russians. Their 
                        daughter realllly like eggs. Also, 
                        I think she wants to marry me.

                                 FREDERIK
                        Yeesh. 
                             (beat)
                        Hey, do you think the McDonald’s in 
                        Paris serves croissants instead of 
                        fries?

           They both reflect on this for way too long.

           EXT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - DAY

           On the secluded outdoor patio area of a fancy French 
           restaurant, Barron is yet again forced to spend time with 
           Olga while the adults discuss business inside. Baguettes and 
           shit are spread across their table. 

           Frederik’s off on the other side of the patio, on the phone 
           with his wife. 

                                 BARRON
                        What do you think our parents are 
                        talking about in there? 

                                 OLGA
                        I think they are discussing 
                        election strategies. My father is 
                        very good at winning American 
                        politics.  

                                 BARRON
                        But...our elections are decided by 
                        a democracy.

           Olga chuckles to herself -

                                 OLGA
                        Everyone knows that whoever has 
                        money can buy U.S. presidency. 

           Barron looks down at his plate in frustration. 

                                 BARRON
                        Stupid founding fathers.
                                 OLGA
                        You seem upset by this. Do you not 
                        want to live in the big white 
                        house?

                                 BARRON
                        It’s...kind of hard to explain. 

                                 OLGA
                             (beat)
                        May I ask question?

           Barron nods. 

                                 OLGA
                        It seems you have no interest in 
                        marriage with Olga. Is this true?

           Barron gets awkward, starts fumbling his words. Trying to be 
           gentle -

                                 BARRON
                        I mean...I think you’re really 
                        nice. I do. I just...there’s sort 
                        of already someone back home that I 
                        like.

                                 OLGA
                        I see. Then you must follow heart. 

                                 BARRON
                        We could be friends, though. 

                                 OLGA
                        Friends. Yes. I’d like this. 

           They shake hands. But Barron can tell Olga is a bit bummed. 

                                 BARRON
                        Hey - you know what I’d love to see 
                        right now? Your...egg thing.

                                 OLGA
                             (excited)
                        You want to see egg show? 

                                 BARRON
                        Heck yeah I do.
                             (to Frederik)
                        Frederik, can you go get some eggs 
                        from the chef? 

                                 FREDERIK 
                        Coming right up, little buddy.
                                 OLGA
                        Bring hot skillet, too!

                                                                CUT TO:

           AN UNKNOWN POV

           As someone watches Olga and Barron laughing via a LONG CAMERA 
           LENS. Most definitely some no good paparazzo. Various PHOTOS 
           are SNAPPED as they continue to laugh and talk. 

           INT. TRUMP PRIVATE JET - LATER

           The gang jets back home. Brunch in Paris. Just like that. 
           Being rich is fun. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        I’ve never seen anyone handle eggs 
                        like that. I mean, she must be some 
                        sort of prodigy, right?

                                 BARRON
                        Some people are born with special 
                        egg skills, I guess. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        So - when we touch down, we head 
                        straight to the theater. And stay 
                        off your phone. No spoilers!

           Barron nods in agreement, then looks over and clocks the 
           PILOT flirting with an exotic FLIGHT ATTENDANT -

                                 BARRON
                        Excuse me sir, shouldn’t you be 
                        flying the plane right now?

                                 PILOT
                        Your dad wanted a turn. 
                             (winking)
                        Don’t worry, the thing practically 
                        flies itself. 

           Barron and Frederik share a look of pure WTF. 

           INT. MOVIE THEATER, TIMES SQUARE - THAT NIGHT

           Swarms of STAR WARS FANS (complete with costumes and toy 
           lightsabers) exit out of a packed screening. Eventually, we 
           find Barron and Frederik - both dressed in JEDI ROBES. 
                                 FREDERIK
                        Soooooo...?

           Barron mulls it over for a prolonged beat -

                                 BARRON
                        Meh.

                                 FREDERIK
                        Meh?! Come on, what else could you 
                        possibly want in a new Star Wars 
                        film?

                                 BARRON
                        That wasn’t a “new” film - it was a 
                        soft reboot of A New Hope and you 
                        know it.

                                 FREDERIK
                        I’ll respond to that - right after 
                        I take a leak. 

           Frederik heads into the nearby BATHROOM. Barron lingers 
           amongst the JEDIS and FANBOYS. 

                                 TANNER (O.S.)
                        Well look who it is. 

           Barron looks up to find Tanner approaching...

                                 TANNER
                        Nice dress, Tiny Trump.  

                                 BARRON
                        This is a cloak - and it’s 
                        exclusively worn by Jedi Masters. 

           Tanner gets in his face - 

                                 TANNER
                        You’re no Jedi Master - you’re just 
                        a weak little biotch. 

                                 BARRON
                        I’m warning you, Tanner...

                                 TANNER
                        I’m sooooo scared. 

           CLOSE on Barron’s HAND as he makes a FLICKING motion - and 
           suddenly...

           A TOY LIGHTSABER is MAGICALLY PLUCKED from a nearby child -  
           And SOARS through the air before PERFECTLY LANDING in 
           Barron’s hand!

                                 BARRON
                        Walk away - or you will face the 
                        righteous sting of my saber.

           Tanner smiles an evil smile -

           Then, ANOTHER TOY LIGHTSABER - this time owned by an 
           OVERWEIGHT FAN - SHOOTS across the hallway - right into 
           Tanner’s hand. 

           Barron positions himself in a fencing stance - and his toy 
           lightsaber is revealed to be no toy at all as the GREEN 
           LUMINESCENT BLADE comes to life - VVVVWWWOOOOOOOOM!

           Bystanders start to gather as Tanner does the same - his 
           DOUBLE RED LIGHTSABER now on display.

                                 TANNER
                        You’re dead.

           Tanner CHARGES AT BARRON -

           And the two boys begin DUELING IN THE PACKED HALLWAY!

           Barron LEAPS here and there with the agility of a Jedi Master 
           - simply too fast for Tanner to keep up. 

           As the two boys fight their way through the space - a DOPEY 
           FAN DRESSED AS JAR JAR BINKS gets in the way -

           And accidentally gets his HAND CHOPPED OFF VIA BARRON’S 
           LIGHTSABER!

                                 BARRON
                        Crap! I’m sorry!

           Barron tries to escape the crowd, heads through a nearby 
           door, which leads to -

           THE PROJECTION ROOM

           Where the boys battle it out in the darkness - cinematic as 
           fuck with the BEAMING LIGHT emanating from a massive FILM 
           PROJECTOR - 

           Finally, Tanner becomes enraged - and RAISES HIS HAND - as 
           the FILM PROJECTOR IS RIPPED FROM THE GROUND -  

                          BARRON
                                                         TANNER
           Don’t do it, Tanner!
                                              AGGGGHHHH
           And Tanner uses all of his strength to HEAVE THE PROJECTOR AT 
           BARRON -

           Who narrowly dodges it as the HEAPING MACHINE BURSTS THROUGH 
           THE WALL - 

           And as the dust clears, the boys now land back in...

           THE MAIN THEATER LOBBY 

           Where Barron decides to end this once and for all. 

           He BLACKFLIPS ONTO THE TOWERING POPCORN STAND - looming large 
           over his nemesis...

                                 BARRON
                        It’s over. I have the high ground.

                                 TANNER
                        You underestimate my power...

                                 BARRON
                        Don’t try it!

           Because he didn’t learn anything from Episode III, Tanner 
           LEAPS into the air towards Barron -

           And with one fell swoop - Barron SWINGS HIS LIGHTSABER - 
           severing Tanner’s torso from his legs. 

           The CROWD GASPS in horror as Tanner SCREAMS IN AGONY...

           Wait - can you cut a ten year-old kid in half if it’s just a 
           dream sequence?? Whatever.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE TWO BOYS

           Back in the HALLWAY near the crowded theater - as Barron 
           snaps out of his DAYDREAM...

           And faces Tanner in reality.

           Tanner SHOVES Barron against the wall now - who’s unwilling 
           to fight back...

                                 TANNER
                        Come on, do something!

           And just when it looks like things are about to get ugly for 
           Barron -
                                 FREDERIK (O.S.)
                        Whoa there, little man!

           Frederik returns from the bathroom - cuts a path between the 
           boys. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        Let me guess - you’re Tanner 
                        Hampton.

           Tanner looks up at Frederik - a massive, intimidating force 
           compared to his scrawny ass.

                                 TANNER
                        That’s right. I’m a friend of 
                        Barron’s.

                                 FREDERIK
                        Friend? Didn’t seem like it from 
                        what I just saw. 

                                 TANNER
                        We were just messin’ around, right 
                        buddy?

           Barron doesn’t offer Tanner any phony backup. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        Let me give you some advice, kid. 
                        Just because you can push somebody 
                        around, doesn’t mean you should. I 
                        mean - look at me. I could push you 
                        around right now, but I’m not 
                        gonna, because I’m merciful as 
                        heck.

                                 TANNER
                        You can’t touch me. You’re old. 
                        You’d go to jail-

                                 FREDERIK
                        Section 2980 of the Bodyguard’s 
                        Handbook states that if you lay a 
                        hand on my subject, I’m legally 
                        allowed to take you out, no matter 
                        your age. 

           Tanner’s nearly pissing his pants now. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        Now scat, you little turd. 
                                 TANNER
                             (to Barron)
                        This isn’t over. 

           Tanner runs off, disappears into the crowd. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        Whatta little punk.

                                 BARRON
                        The “Bodyguard’s Handbook?” 
                        Frederik, that was impressive. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        You like that, huh? It just came to 
                        me. Maybe I should get into improv.

           INT. TRUMP TOWER - BARRON’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           It’s late as Barron heads inside. On his couch - there’s 
           Melania, waiting for him. Her makeup’s smeared. Looks like 
           she’s been crying for days. 

                                 BARRON
                        <Mother, are you alright? Did 
                        someone hurt you?>

           She sniffles. Shakes her head. 

                                 MELANIA 
                        <Your father knows about the 
                        teleprompter, Barron.>

           Oh, fuck. 

                                 MELANIA 
                        <Why did you do it?>

                                 BARRON
                        <I was...just trying to help. I 
                        know how upset you’ve been. I know 
                        you don’t want this.>

                                 MELANIA
                        <It doesn’t matter what I want. 
                        It’s too late now.>

                                 BARRON
                        <It’s not too late! We can stop 
                        him! Let me fix this!>

           Melania shakes her head -
                                 MELANIA
                        <It’s over, Barron. I tried to talk 
                        some sense into him, but he 
                        wouldn’t listen...>

           A confusing beat as Barron tries to parse this out. 

                                 MELANIA
                        <Your father has decided that you 
                        will finish out the rest of the 
                        semester at a Military Academy in 
                        Alaska.>

                                 BARRON
                        <What?! No, he can’t- if he really 
                        wants to send me away, he should 
                        tell me himself!>

                                 MELANIA
                        <You know that’s not how he 
                        operates.>

           Barron shifts gears. Goes into last resort mode. 

                                 BARRON
                        <Wait. Please. You’ve got to let me 
                        talk to him. I’ll apologize! I’ll 
                        do anything!>

                                 MELANIA
                        <I’m afraid there’s nothing we can 
                        do. Your plane leaves on Monday 
                        morning.>

           Melania wipes her smeared makeup, and walks out - leaving 
           Barron alone in the dark. 

           LATER

           Barron calls Isabel via Skype. After a never-ending number of 
           rings, she finally answers -

                                 BARRON
                        Isabel. It’s good to see your face.
                        Listen, something terrible has 
                        happened. My dad found out that I 
                        messed with his teleprompter. And 
                        now he wants to send me away.

                                 ISABEL
                        Away to where? 
                                 BARRON
                        I don’t know, some military camp in 
                        Alaska. I don’t know when I’ll be 
                        back. But I just...I have to tell 
                        you that I like you. I really, 
                        really like you. And even it takes 
                        a hundred years, I’ll come back for 
                        you.

           Barron is expecting a dramatic reaction here on par with 
           Romeo and Juliet. Two young lovers, declaring their affection 
           for one another right as they are torn apart by unfair 
           circumstances...

           But instead, Isabel is surprisingly cold to this revelation.

                                 ISABEL
                        I had feelings for you too, Barron. 
                        But you broke my heart. And I don’t 
                        know if I can ever trust you again. 

                                 BARRON
                        What?? Wait, what are you talking-

                                 ISABEL
                        Check your texts.

           CLICK. She hangs up. 

           Barron’s phone BUZZES. A text from Isabel - it’s a link to a 
           TMZ ARTICLE. The headline: “The Tiniest Trump cozies up with 
           Russian Beauty Queen in Paris.”

                                 BARRON
                        Oh, no-

           Barron clicks through, finds PHOTOS someone took of him 
           talking to Olga at the restaurant in Paris. The platonic 
           nature of their relationship was not captured at all. In 
           fact, they look like young lovers on some fancy date. 

                                 BARRON
                        No, no, no! This is fake news!

           Barron goes into a rage and CHUCKS his phone across the room. 
           Then, he SMASHES his LEGO NEW YORK CITYSCAPE to smithereens. 

           CLOSE on the Lego Trump Tower - completely obliterated. 
           Metaphors! 

           And finally, Barron buries himself in his pillows, and allows 
           himself to do something for the first time since he was a 
           baby - he cries.
           THE NEXT DAY

           Daylight now, but the curtains are drawn. 

           Cartoons on the TV. Ice cream sandwich wrappers litter the 
           floor. Chocolate all over Barron’s tiny little face.

           This is rock bottom. 

           Just then, Frederik enters. Eyes the space, concerned -

                                 FREDERIK
                        It’s noon o’clock, little buddy. 
                        Why’s it so dark in here? 

           Barron offers no response.

                                 FREDERIK
                        And jeez kid, how many ice cream 
                        sandwiches did you eat? You’re 
                        gonna be sick.

                                 BARRON
                        Sickness cannot affect me anymore, 
                        Frederik. I’m a dead man walking. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        Dude. What??

                                 BARRON
                        My dad found out about the 
                        teleprompter. On Monday morning, 
                        I’m headed to Alaska. 

           Frederik plops down on the couch next to Barron. In shock.

                                 FREDERIK
                        Holy spumoni.

                                 BARRON
                        You can say that again. 

           A long beat. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        So - what’s the plan? 

                                 BARRON
                        No plan. 

           Barron reaches for another ice cream sammy. 
                                 FREDERIK
                        Of course there’s a plan. There’s 
                        always a plan. Can we send someone 
                        in your place? Or maybe we go on 
                        the run, start a new life on the-

                                 BARRON
                        Cut it out, Frederik. 

           Barron means it. Frederik retracts into his shell. 
           Emotionally wounded. 

                                 BARRON
                        It’s over. The Empire won. We lost. 
                        There’s no other way to put it.

                                 FREDERIK
                        So that’s it? You’re just gonna sit 
                        here, eating ice cream sandwiches 
                        and watching cartoons until they 
                        send you off? What about Isabel?

                                 BARRON
                        She’s ignoring me. Stupid TMZ set 
                        me up. Now I know why Kanye hates 
                        them so much. 

           Frederik shakes his head and gets up. Stops at the door -

                                 FREDERIK
                        The Barron I know wouldn’t have 
                        given up so easily.

           Frederik walks out. Barron finishes the last ice cream 
           sandwich - GROANING in pain. 

           Then, he reclines. Drifting in and out of consciousness...

                                                                CUT TO:

           BARRON’S DREAM

           Barron’s running up a STAIRWELL inside the White House, 
           pursued by STORMTROOPERS!

           Barron DODGES their blasters, reflecting some back with his 
           lightsaber, continues onward -

           Until he bursts through the final door onto the ROOFTOP DECK 
           of the White House - where there’s a dramatic thunderstorm 
           unfolding.
           It’s the end of the line for Barron. Because up here, waiting 
           for him, is...

           DARTH DONALD 

                                 DARTH DONALD
                        There is no escape, Barron. It’s 
                        time to put an end to this and join 
                        the dark side!

                                 BARRON
                        I’ll never join you! I’m a 
                        Democrat!

                                 DARTH DONALD
                        When I was your age, I too was a 
                        Democrat...

                                 BARRON
                        No! That’s impossible!

           Darth Donald approaches, pushing Barron closer and closer to 
           the edge...

           Until there’s no where left to go -

                                 DARTH DONALD
                        This is your destiny, Barron. Join 
                        me and we can rule the Republican 
                        party as father as son. Together, 
                        we can Make America Great Again!

           Barron is trapped. This is it. He makes a decision - 

                                 BARRON
                        I’d rather die than join you.

           Right on cue, THUNDER overhead. And finally -

           Barron lets himself FALL BACKWARDS OFF THE ROOF -

           He moves in SLOW MOTION -

           down

           down 

           down

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. BARRON’S LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Barron screams in his sleep -

                                 BARRON
                        NOOOOOO!

           He finally wakes up. Catches his breath for a beat. DRY 
           HEAVES. Runs to the bathroom, and we hear him VOMITING off 
           screen. 

           One too many ice cream sammies. 

           Finally, the toilet FLUSHES and Barron returns to couch, pale 
           as a ghost and covered in sweat. He FLIPS to the NEWS - where 
           a panel of NEWS ANCHORS discuss Donald’s unstoppable 
           campaign.

                                 ANCHOR 1 (O.S.)
                        Donald Trump is continuing to poll 
                        strong even after the latest 
                        teleprompter snafu, leading us to 
                        wonder - can anything stop Team 
                        Trump?

                                 ANCHOR 2 (O.S.)
                        I’d say the only thing that could 
                        derail his campaign at this point 
                        is a sex tape, and even then...I’m 
                        not so sure.

           The anchors both LAUGH. 

           And we can practically hear the bell go off in Barron’s 
           brain. The tape! Why didn’t he think of that before??

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Barron sits on a bench in Central Park, waiting. Finally, 
           Isabel appears. Takes a seat next to him.

                                 BARRON
                        I was starting to worry you 
                        wouldn’t show up. 

                                 ISABEL
                        I’m in a hurry, so whatever you’re 
                        gonna say, make it quick.

                                 BARRON
                        Look, Isabel - I know what it looks 
                        like.

                        But that article is complete BS. 
                        Olga is a family friend. And 
                        nothing happened between us. 

           Isabel sticks with the silent treatment. 

                                 BARRON
                        Okay, truthfully - I think she 
                        wanted to be my wife. But we were 
                        completely wrong for each other. I 
                        told her straight up that I had 
                        feelings for someone else.
                             (beat)
                        You’re the only person in the world 
                        who sees me as my own person, and 
                        not a clone of my father. I care 
                        about you a lot, Isabel-

                                 ISABEL
                        I care about you too. But do you 
                        have any idea how horrible it is 
                        seeing the boy you like on the 
                        cover of TMZ with some hussie?

           Barron’s taken aback. Because when you’re ten, admitting you 
           “like” someone is A BIG FUCKING DEAL. 

                                 BARRON
                        Wait...you like me? 

                                 ISABEL
                        Of course I do. Isn’t it obvious?

           Barron blushes all over again. But then, he remembers -

                                 BARRON
                        I wish we had more time. 

                                 ISABEL
                        We’ve got the weekend. What do you 
                        wanna do? 

                                 BARRON
                        I want to put an end to this. I 
                        want to finish our mission. Once 
                        and for all.

                                 ISABEL
                        Then let’s rally the heckin’ 
                        troops...
           BEGIN HEIST PLANNING SEQUENCE - SET TO KANYE WEST’S “POWER” 

           - Barron, Frederik, Isabel, and Roberta are all gathered in 
           Barron’s LIVING ROOM. 

                                 BARRON
                        As you all know, my father has 
                        proven to be immune to all our 
                        previous attacks. But we still have 
                        one option left. 

           Barron dramatically RIPS A SHEET off a whiteboard to reveal 
           two words scrawled in marker: THE TAPE.

                                 BARRON
                        A while back, I heard about a 
                        mysterious tape he keeps locked in 
                        a safe on the penthouse floor.  

                                 ISABEL
                        What kind of tape? 

                                 ROBERTA
                        I’ve got a few guesses...

                                 BARRON
                        Whatever it is, he paid a lot of 
                        money to keep it hidden. We are 
                        going to steal that tape and leak 
                        it to the press, destroying any 
                        remaining chance my father has of 
                        winning.  

           - Barron spreads out pages of BLUEPRINTS now.

                                 BARRON
                        This is the floor plan for the 
                        penthouse. There’s a security guard 
                        who monitors this desk 24/7. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        An armed security guard, might I 
                        add. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        Dude, you don’t have a gun? 
                        That seems kind of lame.

                                 BARRON
                        Jedis don’t use blasters - and 
                        they’re still awesome.

                                 FREDERIK
                        Boom - what he said. 
           - In Barron’s OFFICE, the gang watches a live feed of the 
           PENTHOUSE LOBBY - the TWO SECURITY GUARDS trading shifts.

                                 BARRON
                        They trade off every six hours. 

           Isabel looks closely - sees the guard chugging his DIET COKE.

                                 ISABEL
                        Guy loves his Diet Coke. 

                                 FREDERIK
                             (lightbulb)
                        I used to add crushed up sleeping 
                        pills to my grandma’s Diet Coke 
                        when she was being cranky. She’d 
                        sleep all day. 

                                 BARRON
                        Great idea. Frederik, you’re on 
                        Diet Coke duty. 
                             (then)
                        Roberta, status?

           Roberta pulls up DONALD TRUMP’S iCal on her computer. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        It looks like we’ve got a brief 
                        window tomorrow morning while he’s 
                        at a fundraising brunch for the 
                        NRA. 

                                 BARRON
                        Perfect. Step 1 - we distract. Step 
                        2 - we infiltrate. Step 3 - we 
                        escape. And remember, if anything 
                        goes wrong...

                                 EVERYONE ELSE
                        Blame it on the democrats. 

           END SEQUENCE - END MUSIC

           EXT. TRUMP TOWER - THE NEXT MORNING

           A busy morning - NEW YORKERS cussing each other out. Taxis 
           gridlocked. We track down the sidewalk to find Barron - 
           disguised in sunglasses and a baseball cap. 

           He stands inconspicuously amongst the crowd. Finally, the 
           order comes in via his BLUETOOTH EARPIECE -
                                 ROBERTA (O.S.)
                        Solo to Skywalker. Commence Phase 

                                 BARRON
                        Skywalker commencing Phase 1.

           Barron walks over to a nearby HOMELESS MAN.

                                 BARRON
                        Excuse me, sir. How’d you like to 
                        make a thousand bucks?

           The HOMELESS MAN eyes him curiously.

           INT. TRUMP TOWER - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           At the TRUMP TOWER CAFE, Isabel sits at a table, disguised 
           via a PINK WIG, pretending to read a celebrity gossip 
           magazine. 

           Then, Isabel clocks the Homeless Man wandering into the busy 
           lobby - he DROPS the DUFFEL BAG nonchalantly and walks off. 

                                 ISABEL 
                             (bluetooth)
                        The eagle has landed. I repeat, the 
                        eagle has landed. Kill the security 
                        feeds. 

           INT. BARRON’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Roberta’s turned Barron’s office into a makeshift command 
           post. Monitors up. Bluetooth headset on. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        Copy that. Killing security feeds.

           We watch as Roberta KNOCKS OUT the SECURITY CAMS in the 
           building, one by one. 

                                 ROBERTA
                        Security down. Requesting 
                        permission to make the call.

                                 BARRON (O.S.)
                        Permission granted. 

           Roberta CLICKS a button and sits back as a COMPUTER GENERATED 
           DONALD TRUMP VOICE interacts with the 911 OPERATOR -
                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        911, what’s your emergency?

                                 COMPUTER GENERATED TRUMP (O.S.)
                        Yes, this is Donald Trump. I’m 
                        rich. Very, very rich. And I’d like 
                        to report a potential bomb threat 
                        in the Trump Tower lobby.

           It sounds just like him. Also, you know this technology 
           exists, right? Shit is out of control.

                                 OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        We’re dispatching a team right now, 
                        Mr. Trump.

           Roberta leans back, satisfied.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Showtime. 

           INT. TRUMP TOWER - LOBBY - SAME TIME

           Frederik stands near the elevators, waiting nervously. 
           Finally, a SECURITY GUARD rallies the attention of everyone 
           in the lobby -

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        This lobby is now being evacuated 
                        for a security breach. Please 
                        remain calm and exit the building 
                        in an orderly fashion. 

           As TOURISTS scatter this way and that, completely panicked, 
           Frederik steps into the ELEVATOR, cool as ice...

           INT. TRUMP TOWER - PENTHOUSE LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           The Penthouse DESK GUARD chugs his Diet Coke, watching a live 
           feed of the chaos in the lobby. Gets on his walkie -

                                 DESK GUARD 
                        The hell’s going on down there?

           KSSSSSHHHHT. Static. Then -

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                        Potential bomb threat - probably 
                        bullshit. Remain at your post until 
                        this blows over. 
                                 DESK GUARD
                        Copy that. 

           Just then, the ELEVATOR DINGS and Frederik steps off. 

                                 DESK GUARD
                        Freddy Boy! Hey man, where’s your 
                        gun at? Oh, that’s right - you 
                        don’t have one. 

           Frederik hangs his head in embarrassment. It’s clear Donald’s 
           guards shit on him all the time for being weaponless. 

                                 DESK GUARD
                        Hey, let’s do it like the Wild 
                        West. Come on! Ready, set, draw!

           Desk Guard pulls his GUN on Frederik - laughs his ass off at 
           his flinching reaction. 

                                 DESK GUARD
                        Seriously - you gotta get armed, 
                        bro. It’ll make a man out of you.

           Frederik accepts the verbal beating. Remembers his mission.

                                 FREDERIK
                             (”acting”)
                        Hey - did you see the feds are down 
                        there? Those guys mean serious 
                        business.

           Desk Guard wanders over to the WINDOW - curious.

                                 DESK GUARD
                        Shit, I coulda been a fed if I 
                        wanted...just too much bullshit 
                        paperwork. 

           While he’s distracted at the window, Frederik discreetly 
           opens a baby ziplock baggie, pours WHITE POWDER into the can 
           of Diet Coke...

           A LITTLE BIT LATER

           The PENTHOUSE ELEVATOR DINGS - Barron, Isabel and Roberta 
           step off to find Frederik holding up the unconscious Security 
           Guard, moving his limbs around like a puppet.

                                 FREDERIK
                        Guys, check this out-
                             (impression mode)
                        I’m a dumb, stupid security guard 
                        and I carry a gun, whoop-de-doo.
                                 BARRON
                        Jeez, Frederik - how much did you 
                        give him?

                                 FREDERIK
                        A little extra for being a jerk.

           The gang finally heads over to DONALD’S DOOR - 

                                 BARRON
                             (to Roberta)
                        How long do you need? 

                                 ROBERTA
                        Sixty seconds and we’re gucci.

           Roberta places a dummy KEY CARD in the slot - which is 
           connected to a small iPad. On the SCREEN: a decoder program 
           runs - 25%, 50%, 75%, then... “Access Denied.” 

           She tries again. Same shit. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        What’s happening??

                                 ROBERTA
                        I think our Russian friends have 
                        returned.

                                 BARRON
                        Hack them back!

                                 ROBERTA
                        Not how it works, but I’m on it.

           Roberta continues working. Just then - 

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Hey!

           A second SECURITY GUARD appears via the elevator.

                                 BARRON
                        Crap. 

           New Guard clocks Sleeping Beauty, slumped over at his desk, 
           immediately pulls his GUN - 

           But Barron steps forward, not phased in the slightest...

                                 NEW GUARD
                        Keep your hands where I can see 
                        them!
                                 BARRON
                        Let’s slow down a minute, buddy. 
                        You do realize who you’re pointing 
                        a gun at right now, don’t you?

                                 NEW GUARD
                             (nervous)
                        You’ve incapacitated one of our 
                        men. You’re a threat to security-

           Barron gets EVEN CLOSER...

                                 BARRON
                        I’m a child. Are you really gonna 
                        shoot a child? 

           The Guard pulls his walkie -

                                 NEW GUARD
                        I’ve got some kids up on the-

           BZZZZZZZZZTTTT! 

           Suddenly, he falls to the floor, unconscious, as we REVEAL: 
           Isabel behind him, holding up her PINK TASER.

                                 ISABEL
                        Oh God! Am I gonna go to jail?!

                                 BARRON
                        Don’t worry, kids can’t go to jail.

                                 ROBERTA (O.S.)
                        Guys - I’m in!

           The KEY PAD on Donald’s penthouse door turns GREEN. Barron 
           and Isabel give each other the obligatory go time nod - and 
           head inside...

           INT. TRUMP’S PENTHOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Inside Donald’s lavish foyer, everything is coated in GOLD. 
           We spot an original Picasso on the wall. On the ceiling 
           speakers, a slow jazz version of Creed’s “CAN YOU TAKE ME 
           HIGHER.” 

           Barron signals to Isabel - follow me - and they quietly head 
           up the stairs...
           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           As they slowly step down the hallway, Isabel can’t help but 
           notice the PHOTOS lining the walls - odd snapshots of the 
           Trump Klan. 

           There’s a photoshoot of Barron as a baby, asleep in his crib, 
           covered in 100 dollar bills. And one of Ivanka as a teenager, 
           sitting on Donald’s lap - his greasy paws all over her. 

           And of course, Eric and Donald Jr. in the Outback, smiling as 
           they pose next to various DEAD ENDANGERED ANIMALS.

                                 BARRON
                        Don’t ask. 

           Barron and Isabel finally arrive at their final destination, 
           and push Donald’s bedroom door open...

           INT. DONALD’S MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The place is a delightfully distasteful disaster. Bedsheets 
           made of real gold, and greasy KFC buckets strewn across the 
           bed. 

           A WWE HALL OF FAME placard with Donald’s name on it is on a 
           nearby dresser, along with way too many photos of Ivanka...

                                 ISABEL
                        Where do you think the safe is?

                                 BARRON
                        Well, in movies, it’s usually 
                        hidden behind a piece of art.

           Isabel and Barron look to the “art” in the room - it’s all 
           posters of SUPERMODELS and PORNSTARS. Barron heads over to 
           one in particular - STORMY DANIELS. A glamorous bikini shot. 

                                 BARRON
                        Gotta be this one. 

                                 ISABEL
                        What makes you so sure? 

                                 BARRON
                        My dad likes blondes. Trust me.

           Barron and Isabel carefully REMOVE the heavy framed poster 
           from the wall. And of course...there’s the SAFE. 

                                 BARRON
                        Bingo. 
                                 ISABEL
                        What about the code?

                                 BARRON
                        There are a few simple combinations 
                        which comprise almost 20% of 4 
                        digit passwords.

                                 ISABEL
                        Seriously? God, people are dumb.

           Barron tries the combos out: 1234. 1111. 0000. No luck.

                                 ISABEL
                        Plan B?

                                 BARRON
                        Birthdays. 

           Barron keeps trying combos. Comes up cold. 

                                 ISABEL
                        What does your dad care about more 
                        than anything in the whole world?

           Barron thinks hard, scans the room. Finally lands on a 
           promotional POSTER for The Apprentice - Donald smiling and 
           giving a cheesy thumbs up.

                                 BARRON
                             (realizing)
                        January 8, 2004. That’s when his TV 
                        show first aired. 

           Barron enters 1804 and the safe OPENS - revealing mounds of 
           cash, a collection of passports, and a single VHS TAPE. 

           Barron grabs the TAPE - Barron and Isabel both stare at it 
           for an extended beat. It’s incredibly obvious that neither 
           has ever seen a VHS before. 

                                 ISABEL
                        Why’s it shaped like that?

                                 BARRON
                        I don’t know. Maybe there’s a USB 
                        port somewhere?

                                 ISABEL
                        Let me see.

           Isabel inspects it curiously. Meanwhile, Barron finds 
           something else inside the safe - it’s an old PHOTOGRAPH. 
           Weathered and folded up. 
           Barron opens it up and his eyes go wide upon seeing...

           A PORTRAIT OF 10 YEAR-OLD DONALD - the spitting image of 
           Barron. It’s completely uncanny. Barron inspects the date 
           scrawled in the corner of the image: July, 1956.

           Even Isabel is disturbed by the likeliness -

                                 ISABEL
                        Now that is creepy.
                             (beat)
                        Barron? Are you okay? 

           Barron is definitely not okay. In fact, he’s completely 
           paralyzed by the photograph...

                                 ISABEL
                        Crap!

           Isabel points to the overhead CCTV MONITOR in the corner of 
           the room: TWO PEOPLE are now headed up the stairs!

                                 ISABEL
                        We have to put this back. Hurry!

           Isabel gestures to the STORMY POSTER - waiting for Barron to 
           help, but he is frozen - crippled by the truth of what he’s 
           feared all along -

                                 ISABEL
                        They’re coming!!

           The TWO FIGURES get closer and closer on the CCTV...

           And at last, Barron finally snaps out of his state - he 
           places the photograph in his pocket, closes up the safe, and 
           helps Isabel put the POSTER back on the wall. 

           Then, they both frantically search for a place to hide -

                                 BARRON
                        Under the bed!

           They crawl underneath it, just narrowly evading the TWO 
           VISITORS...

           BARRON AND ISABEL’S POV UNDER THE BED:

           A pair of GUCCI LOAFERS slide into the room, followed by HIGH 
           HEELS that CLACK elegantly on the marble. 

                                 DONALD TRUMP (O.S.)
                        Can I get you something to drink? 
                        I’ve got a great scotch, the best.

                                 DONALD TRUMP (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Single malt Macallan. Eighty grand 
                        a bottle. 

                                 STORMY DANIELS (O.S.)
                        I told you I’m only here to sign 
                        your permission slip, Donald - 
                        which you apparently keep in your 
                        bedroom...

                                 DONALD TRUMP (O.S.)
                        What can I say? I do all my 
                        business in the bedroom.

           Donald walks over to the dresser, shuffles some papers. 

                                 DONALD TRUMP (O.S.)
                        This agreement means you’re waiving 
                        your right to-

                                 STORMY DANIELS (O.S.)
                        Yeah, yeah. My lawyer already gave 
                        me the spiel. 

           She waltzes over. Scribbles her name down. 

                                 DONALD TRUMP (O.S.)
                        Wonderful. I’ll send this over to 
                        Cohen and we’ll get you paid.

                                 STORMY DANIELS (O.S.)
                        Great. 

           As her heels CLICK CLACKITY CLACK towards the door -

                                 DONALD TRUMP (O.S.)
                        Stormy, before you go...how about 
                        one last sloppy joe? For old time’s 
                        sake.

                                 STORMY DANIELS (O.S.)
                        Are you kidding me?

                                 DONALD TRUMP (O.S.)
                        I just came from brunch. You know 
                        bacon makes me horny. 

           A prolonged beat. Even though we can’t see her face, we can 
           take a wild guess how she looks right now.

                                 STORMY DANIELS (O.S.)
                        Go fuck yourself, Donald. 

           After she’s gone, Barron and Isabel hold their breath as 
           Donald walks over, sits down on the bed - UNZIPS his pants.
                                 DONALD TRUMP (O.S.)
                        Ungrateful bitch. 

           Then, as the bed starts shaking - Barron and Isabel eye each 
           other in absolute horror. 

           What the fuck do we do now?!

           But thankfully, Donald’s CELL RINGS - and he’s forced to put 
           his dick away. 

                                 DONALD (O.S.)
                        This is Donald. 
                             (sighs)
                        Sure, put her through. 

           Donald ZIPS up his pants.

                                 DONALD (O.S.)
                        Hilary! So good to hear from you.

           Donald’s voice trails off as he walks down the hallway. And 
           when the coast is clear, they get the FUCK out of there. 

           INT. BARRON’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The whole heist gang is circled up, waiting as Frederik hooks 
           up an old VHS PLAYER to Barron’s TV. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        Glad I kept this thing. 

                                 BARRON
                        What do you call it again?

                                 FREDERIK
                        V-H-S.

           Barron, Isabel and Roberta all shrug in confusion. 

                                 BARRON
                        Alright gang, consider this your 
                        final warning - what you’re about 
                        to see may disturb you. 

                                 ISABEL
                             (covering her eyes)
                        I can’t look.

           Frederik puts the TAPE in...

           ON THE TV
           There’s some STATIC. And finally, the tape rolls. 

           But surprisingly, there’s no Donald-Dong. There’s no naked 
           people at all, in fact. There’s simply a GIANT BUS that rolls 
           up to an undisclosed cameraman. And we’re hearing MICS that 
           have been left on...

                                 DONALD TRUMP (O.S.)
                        No, it’s true. I did try and fuck 
                        her. She was married. And now I see 
                        her - she’s got the big phony tits 
                        and everything...

           GIGGLES from another man. Billy Bush. The BUS finally pulls 
           to a stop.

                                 BILLY BUSH (O.S.)
                        That’s her! That’s your girl.

                                 DONALD TRUMP(O.S.)
                        You know I’m automatically 
                        attracted to beautiful — I just 
                        start kissing them. I don’t even 
                        wait. And when you’re a star, they 
                        let you do it!

                                 BILLY (O.S.)
                        Whatever you want.

                                 DONALD TRUMP (O.S.)
                        Grab them by the pussy. You can do 
                        anything!

           LIVING ROOM

           Nobody speaks for a while. They’re all completely shaken by 
           Donald’s language. 

                                 ISABEL
                        He...he said the p-word.

                                 FREDERIK
                        He said “grab them by the p-word.” 
                        That’s way worse.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Congrats, dude. No one in their 
                        right mind will vote for your dad 
                        after hearing this. 

           Isabel places a congratulatory hand on Barron’s shoulder. 

                                 ISABEL
                        You did it, Barron. You beat him.
                                 BARRON
                        No, we beat him.

           Barron attempts to force out a satisfied smile, but it’s 
           clear he’s equally horrified by his findings. Such is life.

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        To whom it may concern: enclosed in 
                        this package you’ll find a 
                        previously unearthed videotape of 
                        one Republican Presidential 
                        candidate admitting that he freely 
                        sexually assaults women. 

           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - LATER

           Barron and Isabel arrive at a mailbox on the streets of New 
           York. Stand there for a beat. Dramatic as hell. 

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        I hope you find his comments as 
                        disgusting as I do - and above all - 
                        undeniable evidence that he is not 
                        the type of leader our country 
                        needs right now. Sincerely, L. 
                        Skywalker

           Barron PLACES THE PACKAGE into the mailbox.

                                 BARRON
                        That’s it. It’s finally over. 

           A beat as Barron and Isabel reflect on this bittersweet 
           moment. They’ve succeeded in their mission - but know that by 
           tomorrow, they’ll be on opposite ends of the country. 

                                 ISABEL
                        What time does your flight leave 
                        tomorrow? 

                                 BARRON
                        “Eight am, sharp.” 

                                 ISABEL
                        Well, we’ve got one night left. You 
                        got anything in mind?

           Off Barron’s smile -
           INT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - VIEWING DECK - NIGHT

           Barron and Isabel take turns looking through the VIEWING 
           SCOPES, overlooking the entire city. 

           A beautiful blur of moving lights. 

                                 ISABEL
                        Everything looks so small from up 
                        here.

           Barron looks up at the stars now -

                                 BARRON
                        Did you know that Earth and all the 
                        galaxies we’ve ever observed only 
                        make up 5% of the universe? 

                                 ISABEL
                        Whoa.

                                 BARRON
                        We think we’re so important. That 
                        everything revolves around us. But 
                        in reality, we’re just tiny little 
                        specks of sand. Not even sand. 
                        Dust. We’re nothing. 

                                 ISABEL
                        Are you saying I’m nothing?

                                 BARRON
                        No. You’re definitely something. 

           They share eye contact for a prolonged magical movie moment. 
           Then, Isabel closes her eyes - 

                                 ISABEL
                        Consent. 

           Barron takes a deep breath, leans in, and kisses Isabel. It’s 
           quick, but it’s everything. 

           Afterwards, they both avoid eye contact, blushing.

                                 ISABEL
                        Did we do it right?

                                 BARRON
                        I think so. 

           Beat.
                                 ISABEL
                        I wish you could stay.

                                 BARRON
                        Me too. But we’ll find a way to 
                        make it work. 

                                 ISABEL
                        Stupid adults. Always messing 
                        everything up.

                                 BARRON
                        Heck ‘em.

           INT. TRUMP TOWER - BARRON’S BEDROOM - BUTTCRACK OF DAWN

           CLOSE on a fancy-shmancy ALARM CLOCK as it strikes 6:00 AM. 

           Then - BANG BANG BANG! Someone at Barron’s DOOR. He shifts in 
           his sheets. 

           Again - BANG BANG BANG! 

                                 BARRON
                        I’m coming! 

           AT THE FRONT DOOR 

           Barron opens up, squinting at the hallway light. One of 
           Donald’s SECURITY GUARDS stares him down. 

                                 BARRON
                        My flight isn’t until-

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Your father would like to speak 
                        with you. 

           Barron rubs sleep from his eyes. 

                                 BARRON
                        In person?

           The Guard nods. Barron reflects on this for a beat. 

           Simply stunned.

                                 BARRON
                        Let me put on my slippers. 
           INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Barron takes the slowest elevator ride of his life. Looks up 
           at the Guard curiously -

                                 BARRON
                        Did he seem mad, by chance?

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        He always seems mad. 

                                 BARRON
                        Right. 

           INT. TRUMP TOWER - DONALD’S PENTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The Guard leads Barron to Donald’s office. Gestures to enter. 
           Barron heads inside...

           INT. DONALD’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Barron finds his father sitting in an OMINOUSLY OVERSIZED 
           CHAIR, facing the window, overlooking New York City - the sun 
           now creeping up through the skyscrapers.  

                                 DONALD TRUMP (O.S.)
                        Sit down, Barron. 

           Barron obeys.

                                 DONALD TRUMP (O.S.)
                        This is my favorite time of the 
                        day. Do you know why?

                                 BARRON
                        No, sir. 

                                 DONALD TRUMP (O.S.)
                        Because the winners are awake, 
                        making money - while the losers are 
                        still asleep. 

           A long, pregnant pause as Donald swivels around in his chair - 
           making his first real appearance in the film. 

           RAYS OF SUN backlight Donald like an angel. Lens flares and 
           shit. The director’s gonna go ham here. 

                                 DONALD TRUMP 
                        I know what you did, Barron.

           And Barron’s heart drops. 
                                 DONALD TRUMP
                        The fake bomb threat. The sneaking 
                        around. I know everything. And I 
                        know you’ve got that tape. 

           But he remains steadfast - fuck the Empire.

                                 BARRON
                        You’re too late. I’ve already sent 
                        it to the press. Everyone’s gonna 
                        hear what you said. 

                                 DONALD TRUMP
                        Is that right. 

           Donald gets up, slowly walks over to the window. A monologue 
           surely incoming....

                                 DONALD TRUMP
                        When I was your age, my father 
                        didn’t pay much attention to me. He 
                        was always working, always closing 
                        deals. One day, I decided to skip 
                        school and take the train to 
                        Manhattan. I wanted to see The 
                        Searchers with John Wayne. I always 
                        liked that guy. He was in charge. A 
                        true American.

           Barron listens carefully, but has no fucking idea where this 
           is going...

                                 DONALD TRUMP
                        I covered my tracks perfectly. 
                        Drafted up a fake letter on my 
                        dad’s typewriter, dropped it by the 
                        school, and hopped on the train. I 
                        thought I fooled everyone. But when 
                        I got back, my mother told me Dad 
                        wanted to see me in his office. 
                        Boy, I was pissing my pants. How 
                        the hell did he find out? I 
                        couldn’t believe it. So I go up to 
                        his office. And you know what 
                        happened next?

           Barron shakes his head. 

                                 DONALD TRUMP
                        He said, “Donald, I know what you 
                        did.” I was ready for the beating 
                        of a lifetime, I really was. But he 
                        didn’t raise his fist. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DONALD TRUMP (CONT'D)
                                 DONALD TRUMP (CONT'D)
                        Instead, he pulled me in 
                        close...and he hugged me. I’ll 
                        never forget the look on his face 
                        when he said - “Son, you really are 
                        a Trump.” 
                             (beat)
                        You see, my act of deception 
                        brought us closer than ever...

           Donald looks Barron directly in the eye now. 

           For the first time, maybe ever. 

                                 DONALD TRUMP
                        There’s been times I wasn’t so sure 
                        about you, Barron. Times where I 
                        thought I’d failed as a father. But 
                        now, after seeing what you’re 
                        capable of - the planning, the 
                        ploying, the pure genius of it all - 
                        you’ve proven to me without a doubt 
                        that you really are my son. 

           Finally, Donald pulls Barron in for a hug - nearly squeezing 
           the life out of him.

                                 BARRON
                        You’re...not mad?

                                 DONALD TRUMP
                        Don’t get me wrong, if you cross me 
                        again, I’ll destroy you. But right 
                        now, you need to keep nourishing 
                        that brain of yours - which would 
                        be completely wasted at some 
                        military academy. 

                                 BARRON
                        So - I can stay in New York?

                                 DONALD TRUMP
                        For the time being, yes. 

           Barron can’t believe this shit. What a twist, amirite?

                                 BARRON
                        One last question: why would you 
                        hold onto the tape for all these 
                        years? Why wouldn’t you just 
                        destroy it?
                                 DONALD TRUMP
                             (shrugs)
                        Why do serial killers keep mementos 
                        of their victims? I got a kick out 
                        of watching it every now and then. 
                        Never thought my own flesh and 
                        blood would use it against me.
                             (then)
                        Now go get ready for school, son.

           Barron nods, then turns to walk out. When he reaches the door- 

                                 DONALD TRUMP
                        Oh, and Barron-
                             (thumbs up)
                        Keep up the good work. 

           INT. COLUMBIA PREP - HALLWAY - LATER

           Isabel hangs out by herself, waiting for class to start. Emo 
           as hell about Barron’s departure. But suddenly - Barron comes 
           RUSHING through the hallway!

                                 ISABEL
                        Barron! Shouldn’t you be on a plane 
                        right now-

                                 BARRON
                        We made a mistake. 

                                 ISABEL
                        What are you talking about?

                                 BARRON
                        My dad found out that I took the 
                        tape. And he wasn’t mad. He was 
                        proud! He said that I proved to him 
                        without a doubt that I really am 
                        his son. 

                                 ISABEL
                        That’s...horrible.

                                 BARRON
                        I have to get the tape back and 
                        destroy it. I have to show him that 
                        I’m not a Trump!

                                 ISABEL
                        I’m coming with you. 

           Barron and Isabel turn to head down the hall, only to find... 
           TANNER FUCKING HAMPTON - blocking the way.
                                 TANNER
                        Going somewhere, Tiny Trump?

                                 BARRON
                        This really isn’t a good time, 
                        Tanner.

                                 TANNER
                        Not so tough when your big fat 
                        bodyguard isn’t here to fight your 
                        battles, huh?

           Tanner PUSHES Barron - hard. 

                                 ISABEL
                        Leave him alone, Tanner!

                                 TANNER
                        Go back to Mexico, you dirty 
                        immigrant.

           GASPS from the crowd. 

                                 BARRON
                        Take it back. 

                                 TANNER
                        Come on. Just like your old man 
                        says, right? 

                                 BARRON
                        Apologize to Isabel right now!

                                 TANNER
                        What are you gonna do, punch me? 
                        Come on, give it your best shot. 

           The boys are now nose to nose - and Barron knows he can’t 
           physically win this fight. 

           He has to think up a new strategy...

                                 BARRON
                        No. There’s no point.

           Tanner looks at him puzzlingly. 

                                 BARRON
                        Sure - you could beat me up. Give 
                        me a wedgie. Do any number of 
                        things to make yourself feel 
                        better. But in the end, it won’t 
                        matter. 
                                 TANNER
                        The heck are you talking about? 

                                 BARRON
                        The planet, you dumb idiot. 
                        Overpopulation, carbon missions, 
                        plant and animal ‘stinction. Earth 
                        will run out of resources by 2050.

                                 TANNER
                        That’s a bunch of bull. You’re just 
                        trying to scare me. 

                                 BARRON
                        Google it. The marine crisis, 
                        pollution, shrinking forests, 
                        ‘dangered wildlife - we’re screwed, 
                        man. And that’s if we don’t blow 
                        ourselves up in a nuclear war. 

                                 TANNER
                        Nuclear...war?

                                 BARRON
                        Ever heard of a little place called 
                        North Korea? They could launch 
                        their entire arsenal of nukes 
                        tomorrow - and even if a small 
                        percentage were to make it through - 
                        we’d all be dead. 

           Tanner looks genuinely scared now. Barron’s existential 
           bullying is working...

                                 BARRON
                        But let’s say none of that happens - 
                        you’re still left with the fact 
                        that someday, everything you know 
                        and love will be gone forever. Your 
                        parents, teachers, pets and all the 
                        rest. 
                             (finish him!)
                        So go ahead and beat me up, just 
                        know that in the end, it won’t save 
                        you. In fact, it’ll only make you 
                        weaker.

           Barron’s monologue has physically backed Tanner into a 
           corner. The information is simply too much for his tiny brain 
           to process. 

           And in a state of pure existential dread, Tanner begins 
           WEEPING uncontrollably. 
           Then, all of the students LAUGH at Tanner, pointing, filming 
           his meltdown on their PHONES and posting it to SOCIAL MEDIA.

                                 BARRON
                             (to himself)
                        Wow, I can’t believe that worked.

                                 ISABEL
                        Barron, come on!

           Isabel and Barron SPRINT down the hall - escaping...

                                 ISABEL
                        That was some Kevin Stacey level 
                        acting! Where’d you come up with 
                        that crazy story? 

                                 BARRON
                        Story? That was all true. 

           INT. THE WASHINGTON POST - LATER

           Barron and Isabel rush into the MAIL ROOM, where an INTERN 
           (20s, Brooklyn hipster) is sifting through various packages -

                                 BARRON
                        Excuse me, I mailed a package here - 
                        but I need to retrieve it. It’s 
                        about the size of a videotape. 
                        Return address should say “L. 
                        Skywalker.” 

                                 HIPSTERN
                        You mean...this package?

           Miraculously, Hipstern produces the tape, but SNATCHES it 
           away when Barron grabs for it.

                                 HIPSTERN
                        Not so fast. I can’t just let you 
                        steal our mail. 

                                 BARRON
                        Listen, I’m at a fork in the road 
                        right now. My entire destiny rides 
                        on whether or not I get that tape. 

                                 HIPSTERN
                        Then I’d say you better start 
                        convincing me, kid. 

                                 BARRON
                        How much do you want for it? 
           Barron pulls out his wallet - but instead, Hipstern eyes 
           Barron’s ROLEX WATCH.

                                 HIPSTERN
                        I want the watch.

                                 BARRON
                        My mother gave me this watch. I can 
                        pay you in cash-

                                 HIPSTERN
                        Look, I’ve gotta get back to work, 
                        so if you little 1-percent 
                        preschoolers want your tape back, 
                        then fork over the watch. 
                        Otherwise, get the hell out of 
                        here.

           A beat as Barron and Isabel think it over. Then...

           BARRON SNATCHES THE TAPE - and runs!

                          BARRON
                                                         HIPTERN
           Run, Isabel!
                                              You little shit!

           Hipstern chases them out of there -

           EXT. WASHINGTON POST / STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Barron and Isabel run down the sidewalk, the Hipstern hot on 
           their trail - 

                                 HIPSTERN
                        I ran track in high school, you 
                        fuckers!

                                 BARRON
                        This way, Isabel!

           Barron cuts into a nearby -

           ALLEY

           And clocks the quickest, easiest hiding spot -

                                 BARRON
                        In that dumpster!

                                 ISABEL
                        Are you kidding?!

                                 BARRON
                        Isabel!
           Barron boosts her up - and she climbs in. Then, she pulls 
           Barron up. Together, they SHUT THE LID just as Hipstern cuts 
           through the alley - 

           Not suspecting a thing as he continues past them...

           And when the coast is clear, Barron and Isabel climb out, 
           covered in trash. 

           Finally, Barron ceremoniously STOMPS out the tape, SMASHING 
           it to bits, ensuring no one can ever release it.

                                 BARRON
                        Alright. Now it’s over.  

           Barron stares at the smashed plastic for a beat, 
           contemplating his decision. 

                                 ISABEL
                        You did the right thing, Barron. 

                                 BARRON
                        Let’s hope you’re right...

           Barron and Isabel turn around and head back to school.

           And now, the opening piano notes of Kanye West’s epic 
           “RUNAWAY” ring out, carrying us through the remainder of the 
           film...

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        You’re probably wondering how the 
                        tape got released, considering I 
                        smashed the living crap out of it. 

           INT. TRUMP TOWER - MELANIA’S OFFICE - DAY

           Melania sits at her desk, clearly struggling to make an 
           important decision.

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        And I’m not really sure, to tell 
                        you the truth. All I know is 
                        someone close to my father must 
                        have made a copy...

           And finally, Melania opens up her desk drawer, pulling out a 
           DUPLICATE COPY OF THE TAPE. Then, she leaves the room with 
           purpose. 
           INT. HILTON HOTEL, MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - DAY

           It’s ELECTION NIGHT - the scene from our cold open, but we’re 
           BACKSTAGE - moments before the Trump family walked out. 
           Barron watches his mother weep openly. 

           Tears of shame. Regret. And years of bad choices. 

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        In the end, it didn’t matter that 
                        my dad said “grab them by the p-
                        word.” People still voted for him 
                        anyway. 

           EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING, WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

           Barron watches as his father is sworn in. A SWEEPING OVERHEAD 
           shot shows us how poorly attended the Inauguration is...

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        When my father was sworn in, he had 
                        them photoshop the pictures to make 
                        it look more crowded than it really 
                        was. Because that’s the kind of 
                        stuff he really cares about. 

           EXT. STREETS OF AMERICA - DAY

           Armies of POWERFUL WOMEN carry signs like “PUSSY GRABS BACK” 
           etc. Barron marches alongside Isabel, who carries a PRINCESS 
           LEIA SIGN captioned “WE ARE THE RESISTANCE.” 

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        Though the tape failed to defeat 
                        him, it still started a national 
                        conversation - and even an entire 
                        movement...

                                                                CUT TO:

           VARIOUS NEWS CLIPS

           Detailing the #MeToo movement -

           The downfall of Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby and other serial 
           sex offenders, hidden in plain sight throughout the 
           entertainment industry...
           INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Kanye West and President Trump shake hands and pose 
           accordingly - both seasoned pros, thriving on the attention. 

           Finally, Donald signs Kanye’s MAGA HAT while the media 
           obsessively SNAPS photos, their brains melting over this 
           bizarre and absurd meeting of the minds. 

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        Oh yeah. This happened.

           Afterwards, Kanye passes by Barron. The two eye each other 
           like arch rivals - 

                                 KANYE
                        What’d I tell you, B? Your pops is 
                        the leader of the free world - and 
                        I don’t see no apocalypse in sight.  

           Kanye pulls off his red MAGA HAT - and offers it up to 
           Barron.

                                 BARRON
                        Take it. I think you need this more 
                        than I do.

           But Barron shakes his head, standing his ground - 

                                 BARRON
                        You might have been right about the 
                        election, Mr. West - but you’re 
                        dead wrong about me. I’ll never be 
                        like him. And you can put that on 
                        my gravestone. Yo. 

           After a beat - Kanye extends a fist. 

                                 KANYE
                        Respect.

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        And I got us back on the homie 
                        list. 

           INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - LIBRARY - DAY

           Barron shakes hands with an FBI AGENT. 

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        I’ve also made some new friends.  
                                 FBI AGENT
                        As always, thanks for your 
                        cooperation, Barron. We’ll keep you 
                        posted on the Russian 
                        investigation. 

                                 BARRON
                        Do you think you have enough 
                        information to put my father in 
                        prison?

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Only time will tell. 

           As the Agent heads out -

                                 BARRON
                        Hey - what are you guys calling 
                        this thing? Is there, like, an 
                        official codename or something?

           He leans in, whispers:

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Operation “Crossfire Hurricane.” 
                        You know, like the Stones song. 

           Barron chuckles to himself -

                                 BARRON
                        You’re kidding, right? 

                                 FBI AGENT
                        What else would you call this 
                        shitshow like this? 

           This was literally the FBI’s codename for the Trump 
           Investigation. Fucking amazing, I know.

           INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Barron walks over to the microwave, but he’s cut off by STEVE 
           BANNON, who’s hoarding a bunch of HOT POCKETS. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Out of the way, kid. 

           Barron glares at Bannon - mentally marking him as a bad egg.

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        And some enemies, too...
           INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - BARRON’S QUARTERS - DAY

           Barron builds a new LEGO CITYSCAPE - this time of Washington 
           D.C., with the titular White House at its center.

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        It’s been about a year since I gave 
                        up my life of spying, blackmailing, 
                        plotting and ploying. And things 
                        are going pretty well. 

           Frederik pokes his head inside Barron’s room - now dressed in 
           a SLICK SUIT. Secret Service status. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        You’ve got a visitor, little buddy.

           In walks Frederik’s wife, MAGGIE (30s) - holding their 
           newborn baby. 

                                 FREDERIK
                        His name is Luke. 

           Barron and Frederik share a knowing look. 

           EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE GARDENS - DAY

           Barron and Isabel take a stroll along the gardens -

                                 ISABEL
                        So do you know all of the deepest 
                        darkest government secrets now? 

                                 BARRON
                        Pretty much. Is there anything you 
                        wanna know? 

                                 ISABEL
                        Hmm. Are aliens real? 

                                 BARRON
                        Yeah, but they don’t look anything 
                        like the ones in the movies. 

                                 ISABEL
                        Government mind control? 

                                 BARRON
                        Real. And surprisingly scientific. 

                                 ISABEL
                        And the illuminati?
                                 BARRON
                        Kanye runs the meetings, actually.  

           Isabel LAUGHS. 

                                 ISABEL
                        How’s everything at your new 
                        school? 

                                 BARRON
                        Kind of quiet. I’ve been sort of 
                        keeping a low profile. 

                                 ISABEL
                        Wow, you really have changed. 

                                 BARRON
                        I like to think I’ve enrolled 
                        myself in Trumps Anonymous. 

           INT. BARRON’S NEW PREP SCHOOL - DAY

           Barron stands in front of a small group of students. Written 
           on the chalkboard behind him: YOUNG DEMOCRATS CLUB

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        I’ve also become somewhat of a 
                        leader myself.

           INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

           Barron sits at yet another family dinner, surrounded by his 
           many brothers and sisters -

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        The truth is, nobody gets to choose 
                        their family - but you can choose 
                        whether or not you want to follow 
                        in their footsteps.

           A HEAP OF MASHED POTATO flies across the table and NAILS 
           Barron right in the face. REVEAL: Don Jr. pointing and 
           laughing -

                                 DON JR.
                        Suck it, SB!

           Barron readies a SPOONFUL OF MASHED POTATOES in retaliation - 
           but finally decides against it. 
                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        And whether or not you fight back - 
                        or take the high road. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           NEWS CLIPS

           NANCY PELOSI formerly announces Donald Trump’s impeachment 
           inquiry - and Donald continues lashing out at the press, 
           citing the whole scandal as nothing more than a witch-hunt.  

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        Like I said before, on November 9, 
                        2016 - America became a very F’d up 
                        place. And I suppose now...all we 
                        can do is wait and see what 
                        happens. 

           INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Barron stands in the empty OVAL OFFICE, staring at a photo of 
           PRESDENT DONALD J. TRUMP. 

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        I know that I have a lot in common 
                        with my father. We look alike, wear 
                        the same clothes, and even have the 
                        same haircut. But at the end of the 
                        day, I’m not him...

           EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - ROOFTOP DECK - DUSK 

           Barron watches the sunset. A glowing orange orb in the sky. 
           He stares up at it, just like Luke in A New Hope. 

           A boy, just getting started in fulfilling his destiny. 

                                 BARRON (V.O.)
                        I’m me. 

                                                              FADE OUT.
