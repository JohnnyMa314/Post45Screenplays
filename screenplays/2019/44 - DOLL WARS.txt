           INT. FACTORY - CHINA - DAY 

           SUPER: 2004

           Inside a brutal sweatshop, a FACTORY WORKER on an assembly 
           line presses a button and we hear the HISS of machines 
           turning on.

           As the line churns, we trace the path of each identical piece 
           of plastic as it gets molded and shaped, while hundreds of 
           WORKERS IN MASKS eke out a dreary existence. 

           CLOSE ON: the object on the line: Dolls. A piece of machinery 
           methodically pops blonde wigs on each one, then snaps on 
           their pink heels. It only takes a millisecond for us to 
           realize: this is BARBIE. The All American dream girl. 

           A made in China sticker gets stamped on the bottom of the 
           box.

           Over the ubiquitous, grating pop song “Barbie World” by Aqua - 
           we enter...

           INT. BIG BOX RETAIL STORE - LOS ANGELES - DAY

           - An entire toy section filled with a variety of items: 
           Transformers, Legos, Elmos...gets WIPED AWAY in a swift 
           magical stroke as this year’s new Barbies take their rightful 
           place dominating the shelf.

           After all, this is early 2000s. Before #metoo, before 
           “Wokeness,” there’s still only one type of Barbie: blonde, 
           big tits, white.

           The song reaches its brutal crescendo, repeating the “come on 
           Barbie, let’s go party” line that we all despise.

           At the register, JENNIFER KELLER, late 30s, a firecracker, 
           slightly tomboyish lawyer, and the polar opposite of Barbie, 
           talks to a TEENAGED CLERK who’s humming along to the song. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Is this a good one for getting a 
                        nine year old not to hate you? 

           The Clerk sizes up Jennifer and thinks for a second.

                                 CLERK
                        All the Barbies put a smile on any 
                        child’s face!

                                 JENNIFER
                        So it’s like Zoloft for kids.
           Off the Clerks confused look, Jennifer hands him a coupon.

                                 CLERK
                        Actually that coupon is for the 
                        older Barbie model, not this newer 
                        one that just came out yesterday. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        What’s the difference?

                                 CLERK
                        The newer model has a pink beret.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Revolutionary. I’ll just take the 
                        old one.

                                 CLERK
                        We don’t have them in stock 
                        anymore. I’m sorry. If you’re 
                        looking for something on a budget, 
                        these are being pulled from our 
                        stores.

           The Clerk reaches for a Bratz doll off the discount bin next 
           to the register. It’s got oversized bulging eyes, an 
           ethnically ambiguous look, and a punk rock outfit. Jennifer 
           sizes up the doll. It sure ain’t Barbie.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’m not gonna buy a faulty product. 

                                 CLERK
                        Nothing like that. They used to fly 
                        off the shelves. Then Barbie sued 
                        them into oblivion. Last stop 
                        before oblivion: the bargain bin.

           Jennifer clocks that. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        A little bit trashy for my taste. 
                        No offense.
                            (to the Clerk)
                        I’ll just stick with Tits Mcgee, I 
                        mean, Barbie. 

                                 CLERK
                        I’m sorry ma’am. Like I said, we 
                        can’t honor that coupon.

           Jennifer smiles at the clerk and goes full lawyer.
                                 JENNIFER
                        Hey, it’s not your fault. It’s 
                        really the company’s fault for 
                        breaching multiple false 
                        advertising laws--

           A MANAGER overhears them chatting and the word “law” spoken 
           loudly causes him to inject himself.

                                 MANAGER
                            (obnoxious)
                        Excuse me, ma’am. We get a lot of 
                        people coming in here trying to 
                        scam us. 
                            (sizing her up)
                        I can see you’re probably not one 
                        of those people, so we will honor 
                        the coupon...as a courtesy.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I appreciate that. But I just want 
                        to be clear on something: you’re 
                        not honoring it as a courtesy. 
                        You’re honoring it because it’s 
                        Federal Law.  Under both the FTC 
                        and California 325F-1-b, your 
                        coupon would qualify as a material 
                        assertion that is both deceptive 
                        and misleading. It’s designed to 
                        lure people into the store for a 
                        doll that isn’t stocked. Classic 
                        bait and switch. Some people might 
                        call that a scam.

           The Manager and Clerk both look intimidated. Jennifer’s phone 
           rings.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                            (on phone)
                        Keller Simpson, this is Jennifer 
                        Keller. 
                            (listens, then:)
                        Fuck yes!

           All the PARENTS nearby earmuff their kids. Jennifer gives a 
           semi-apologetic shrug.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                         I’ll see you in court at 4. 

           She turns back to the Employees without missing a beat.
                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Not to mention you’re also running 
                        afoul of the Electronic Transfer 
                        Funds Act and the 28th amendment. 

                                 MANAGER
                        You know what, just take the doll 
                        for free. I’ll let corporate know 
                        about the mix-up.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Thank you. That’s too kind! You 
                        shouldn’t have! 
                            (whispers to Clerk)
                        There is no 28th amendment.

           She winks at him. He chuckles. Jennifer has a look of self 
           satisfaction like she just crushed someone in court.

           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

           Jennifer rushes through the halls while tugging at a heel 
           that’s out of place. She slows down before reaching the 
           doorway that’s open.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           AMANDA, 20s, youthful and over eager teacher, sits with 
           Jennifer’s nine year old precocious but difficult niece, 
           SUZIE, and helps her with her homework.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Knock, knock!

           Amanda gets up to greet her while Suzie barely acknowledges 
           her. Amanda gently pulls her into the corner of the room.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Sorry I was late, court ran long, 
                        traffic was a nightmar--

                                 AMANDA
                        How are you holding up?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Getting jerked around on a 
                        settlement. Have a jury closing 
                        tomorrow.

           Amanda looks her in the eyes and gently touches her shoulder.
                                 AMANDA
                        I meant how are you? 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Really, I’m fine. How’s she?

                                 AMANDA
                        Suzie’s withdrawing. It’s very 
                        typical for someone who’s 
                        experienced such a profound loss at 
                        this age. Have you found an 
                        activity you two could share, like 
                        we discussed?

                                 JENNIFER
                        She doesn’t like Law & Order. And I 
                        tried watching something called 
                        Drake and Josh, but the character 
                        development was shit, and the 
                        acting was piss poor. 
                            (then, candidly)
                        Also, she doesn’t like being in the 
                        same room as me. 

                                 AMANDA
                        She’s tough, like her aunt! I know 
                        it’s not my place to ask, but is 
                        there anyone else who could help 
                        out? Anyone who has a little more 
                        experience with kids-- 

                                 JENNIFER
                        You’re right. It’s not your place. 

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Jennifer reaches over the backseat and pulls the Barbie out 
           and hands it to Suzie. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        I got you something. 

                                 SUZIE
                        Why?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Because...I’m trying. 

           Suzie casually drops the doll on the ground. 

                                 SUZIE
                        I’m never gonna call you mom.
           Jennifer tries not to let that sting. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        You know when your mom was a kid, 
                        she had that exact Barbie doll.

           Suzie lets her guard down a bit.

                                 SUZIE
                        What did she want to be when she 
                        grew up? 

                                 JENNIFER
                        First a nurse, then a ballerina, 
                        then a Rockette, then a she settled 
                        on teaching. But her best job was 
                        being a mom. 

                                 SUZIE
                        What Barbie did you have?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Well, I never liked...er, I never 
                        really played with Barbies. 

                                 SUZIE
                        Why not?

           Jennifer pauses to think about her answer for a moment.

                                 JENNIFER
                        They didn’t have a lawyer Barbie. 

           Suzie picks the Barbie doll back up and cradles it. 

                                 SUZIE
                        I’m calling her Rebecca.

                                 JENNIFER
                        The best name I’ve ever heard. Hey, 
                        I have a fun idea. Why don’t you 
                        come with me to court tomorrow? 

                                 SUZIE
                        Is this because you can’t afford a 
                        baby-sitter? 

                                 JENNIFER
                        It’s because I want you to see that 
                        girls can do all kinds of jobs. And 
                        do them better than boys. Plus, 
                        they have a vending machine.
                                 SUZIE
                        Does it have donuts? 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Does the Pope wear a silly hat? 

           Suzie laughs. 

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t tell your teacher I said 
                        that. 

           INT. ISAAC LARIAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           ISAAC LARIAN, 60s bushy haired Iranian immigrant with a 
           unibrow, sits on the ground, playing with a Bratz doll. Bratz 
           is not just his company, it’s his baby, as evidenced by the 
           framed, blown up poster of him behind his desk. He’s on the 
           cover of “Toy Insider” under title “Look out, Barbie.” 

                                 ISAAC
                        We’ve got two weeks before retrial 
                        and our legal team is not inspiring 
                        confidence.

           MAX, his in-house counsel, 40s, stands behind Isaac, talking 
           to his back. We see that Isaac is playing with JASMIN, his 
           adorable 9 year old Persian princess.

                        Orrick is using a new lead counsel. 
                        They are sending their best 
                        litigators here tomorrow to explain 
                        the new strategy.

                        Do you really think they are going 
                        to be able to save us?

                                 MAX
                        You have a better idea?

                        What about boutique firms?

                        We can throw Boies in the mix in a

                        You’re my in-house counsel and you 
                        don’t seem to know what our problem 
                        is.

                        That we just lost a billion dollar 
                        case to Mattel and we’re about to 
                        go under?

                                 ISAAC
                        No! That our lawyers don’t 
                        represent me.

                        Bullshit. I’m an immigrant who 
                        worked his ass off, failed, failed 
                        some more, and then got some lucky 
                        breaks. Nobody at Orrick can relate 
                        to that.

                        They are the best lawyers on earth.

                            (yelling)
                        These so called best lawyers 
                        allowed Mattel to win a case 
                        claiming they own all of my 
                        intellectual property. How can they 
                        claim that? The design was based on 
                        my daughter. It’s like telling me 
                        Jasmin belongs to Radio Shack, 
                        because she was born while I worked 
                        there!

           Jasmin looks up at him.

                                 ISAAC (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, my Jasmin. Papa didn’t mean 
                        to yell. 

           Jasmin is too busy drawing on a California Lawyers Monthly 
           magazine to pay attention to them.

                                 ISAAC (CONT’D)
                        Jasmin, what does papa always say 
                        about instinct?
                                 JASMIN
                        It took you from the outhouse to 
                        the penthouse. 

           He starts to whisper in his daughter’s ear.

                                 ISAAC
                        Yes, it’s settled. We need to shake 
                        things up.

                                 MAX
                        Isaac, I know you tend to get 
                        emotional--

           Isaac puts his hand up to say “please go.” 

                                 ISAAC
                        Please drive Jasmin home with you. 
                            (to Jasmin)
                        Papa needs some alone time to 
                        think.

           She hugs him. Max walks her out.

           Isaac cleans up the mess she made and then stops himself. He 
           has tears in his eyes. He wipes them and gathers himself, 
           knowing he can’t give up now. He takes a look at the page in 
           the California Lawyers magazine that Jasmin was drawing on. 
           Something has piqued his interest.

           INT. JENNIFER KELLER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jennifer sits in her modest living room next to Suzie on the 
           couch watching SpongeBob. Jennifer looks at Suzie, clearly 
           trying to come up with something to talk about. Instead she 
           just starts laughing.

                                 SUZIE
                        You’re laughing at the wrong parts!

           Jennifer clams up and tries another approach.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Well, it’s funny because SpongeBob 
                        said “I used to have a dream, and 
                        the crab guy says I used to have a 
                        kidney stone and everything 
                        passes.”
                            (off Suzie’s non-reaction)
                        I think that joke was meant for 
                        adults.  
                                 SUZIE
                        You don’t have to explain it to me. 
                        I’m not stupid.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Of course you’re not stupid. You’re 
                        a Keller. We come from good stock. 

                                 SUZIE
                        My last name’s not Keller. I’m 
                        going to my room. 

           Suzie storms out.

                                 JENNIFER
                            (to herself)
                        That went well.

           She flips to NBC - “Law & Order” is on. The theme song comes 
           on. Suzie slams the door just as the famed prison cell 
           slamming sound plays.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Dun, dun. 

           INT. ISAAC’S OFFICE - DAY

           Max slides Isaac a spreadsheet across his desk.

                                 MAX
                        This wasn’t easy to do. We did some 
                        digging, called in a few favors, 
                        and ran a list of all the firms 
                        with the best litigation trial 
                        records in all of California, 
                        including every reputable boutique 
                        we could find. 

           Isaac puts his glasses on.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        It’s the usual suspects. There’s a 
                        reason they are all on here. 

           ON LIST: It is the usual suspects: Skadden, Kirkland, Latham. 

                                 ISAAC
                        What about Keller Simpson? 

           He hands the California Lawyers Magazine to Max. It’s a 
           picture of Jennifer Keller with a little blurb.

                                 MAX
                        Never heard of them.
                                 ISAAC
                        It’s an all-female law firm. They 
                        beat Sullivan & Boggs on a 
                        pregnancy discrimination case. 

                                 MAX
                        Isaac, please, let me do my job. 
                        That magazine is basically a paid 
                        advertisement for lesser firms. I 
                        promise you they’re small potatoes. 

                                 ISAAC
                        That’s what Mattel thinks I am! If 
                        I lose, it means you find another 
                        fucking CEO to work for. For me, it 
                        means I become just another 
                        immigrant with broken dreams! 

                                 MAX
                        I know you’re emotional right now, 
                        but we can’t just go hiring some 
                        rinky dink firm on a whim.

                                 ISAAC
                        I’m not asking you to hire them, 
                        just give them a meeting.

           He grabs the list back. His desperation is palpable.

                                 ISAAC (CONT’D)
                            (reading)
                        They won 22 out of 25 cases, that’s 
                        a higher percentage than Skadden, 
                        Latham or Orrick!

                                 MAX
                        And I guarantee 90 percent of them 
                        were small business squabbles, not 
                        complex intellectual property 
                        disputes. Besides, they haven’t 
                        been vetted. 

           Isaac puts his jacket on.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

                                 ISAAC
                        To vet them!

                                 MAX
                        Isaac, please you’re being 
                        irrational.
                                 ISAAC
                        My instincts and my whims created 
                        this billion dollar company, and 
                        it’s those same instincts and whims 
                        that are going to save it!

           Isaac storms out.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           This is where dreams go to die: Los Angeles Municipal court. 
           It’s bleakness in aesthetic is only matched by the bleakness 
           of spirit of all the LEGAL PROFESSIONALS milling about. 

           The JUDGE takes his duties seriously, in spite of the ticky-
           tack, small-time level of cases heard here. Jennifer stands 
           before the Judge, across the table from, CHARLOTTE aka 
           CHARLIE, 30s, polished, serious but with a good sense of 
           humor for an Assistant District Attorney. Suzie sits in the 
           first row, on her knees so she can see the action.

                                 JENNIFER
                        My client was utilizing his first 
                        amendment rights to free speech. Is 
                        making an honest living a crime? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Your client broke the law. 
                        Municipal Code 48b-2f. “No person 
                        shall stand in or upon any sidewalk 
                        in such a manner as to annoy or 
                        molest any pedestrian.” People 
                        don’t want to be bothered when they 
                        come to LA to see the sights.

                                 JENNIFER
                        These actors are the sights!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Give me a break. They aren’t 
                        actors! They’re vagrants.

           Jennifer turns to her CLIENT, a man dressed in a shoddy suit.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I have with me fourteen witnesses 
                        that would say otherwise. Why don’t 
                        we ask them, your Honor? 

           Jennifer points to three rows behind her filled with TOURISTS 
           FROM AROUND THE WORLD that she somehow convinced to come to 
           court. We clock Isaac Larian sitting in the back observing.
                                 CHARLIE
                        This is a pre-trial hearing. She’s 
                        making a mockery of your courtroom.

                                 JENNIFER
                        The only mockery is the outrageous 
                        abuse of power by this police 
                        state.

           Charlie scoffs.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        This man is dedicated to his craft 
                        and that should be lauded. After 
                        every door was closed to him, he 
                        persisted. I know actors that have 
                        crawled home after the slightest 
                        rejection. Hell, I know one actress 
                        that went to law school after they 
                        were written off a soap opera.

           Jennifer smirks. Charlie looks indignant. Oh Hollywood. 

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        The only reason we are here is 
                        because rich developers want to 
                        build condos on Hollywood Boulevard 
                        and these performers are in the 
                        way. And, if you think I’m making a 
                        mockery of this courtroom now, just 
                        wait until we get a class 
                        certification going.

                                 JUDGE
                        Ms. Keller, I’ve heard enough. I’m 
                        not about to turn this minor 
                        infraction into another cause for 
                        you. Mr. Goodwin, I’m granting the 
                        motion to dismiss. The misdemeanor 
                        charge is reduced to $25 dollar 
                        loitering fine. Case dismissed. 

           Jennifer turns to her CLIENT, who opens his shirt to reveal a 
           Batman costume underneath.

                                 FAKE BATMAN
                            (in deep voice)
                        Gotham thanks you, Commissioner 
                        Keller.  

           He runs off. Charlie approaches.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I told you that in confidence.
                                 JENNIFER
                        Aww. Did I hurt your feelings, 
                        pretty lady? 

           She’s clearly flirting.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Remind me to air your dirty laundry 
                        next time. Maybe some of your 
                        sexual peccadillos.

           Her smirk makes it clear she knows what those are.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Jennifer and Suzie walk back towards her car. 

                                 SUZIE
                        You kicked their butt.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I did, didn’t I.

                                 SUZIE
                        Is it weird to beat your friend in 
                        court?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Umm, Charlie and I are both grown 
                        ups, so sometimes you have to set 
                        aside your personal feelings and do 
                        your job. Should I buy her an ice 
                        cream to make her feel better? 

                                 SUZIE
                        Grown ups don’t do that!

                                 JENNIFER
                        Maybe we’re not that grown up.

           They both smile. Maybe the ice is finally thawing.

                                 SUZIE 
                        Can we get the ice cream?

                                 JENNIFER
                        I got two words for you. Waffle. 
                        Cone.

           Suzie smiles. Jennifer is not about to waste this moment of 
           thawing out between them. 
           INT. KELLER SIMPSON OFFICE - NIGHT

           The office is what you would expect for a small boutique in 
           the Valley, cluttered and drab. Though unlike most law firms, 
           it has prominently featured framed photos of Gloria Allred 
           and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  

           Jennifer, ALLISON, early 20s, savant second year associate 
           who may be on the spectrum, and KAY SIMPSON, late 20s, black, 
           rising star and very pregnant junior partner in their 
           fledgling firm, eat Chinese food, while Jennifer sips wine. 

                                 KAY
                            (sarcastic)
                        A few more big wins and we might 
                        have to move into a real office in 
                        the gentrified part of town.

                                 ALLISON
                        Moving can be a very traumatic 
                        experience.

                                 JENNIFER
                        She’s joking, Allison. It was a pro 
                        bono case. We’re sticking with 
                        “Keller Simpson - good lawyers, bad 
                        neighborhood!” 

                                 KAY
                        I’m still getting used the sound of 
                        my name on the door.

                                 JENNIFER
                        The door of a former hair salon, 
                        but still, you earned it. Now let’s 
                        try to keep the lights on.  

           Jennifer peruses a stack of bills - we see the word “OVERDUE” 
           on more than one of them.

                                 ALLISON
                        Just to be clear, we’re not moving? 
                        I moved once in middle school. Last 
                        time I was the most popular kid in 
                        school.

                        You were once the most popular kid 
                        in a school?

                                 ALLISON
                        I was home-schooled. 

           The phone rings. Jennifer picks up.
                                 JENNIFER
                            (into phone)
                        Hello, Isaac. 

           Makes the “I have no idea” motion with her fingers.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Bratz? The fugly looking dolls? 
                        Toys are not really my area of 
                        expertise, but send over the files 
                        when you get a chance, I’ll review 
                        them. I’ll let you know if it makes 
                        sense for us to work together.

           Kay and Allison try to overhear the convo. Jennifer hangs up.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Some older gentleman named Isaac 
                        Larian. He works at Bratz. I dunno. 
                        I’m assuming product liability. 
                        Anyone wanna do a little 
                        background? 

                                 ALLISON
                        Holy schnikes. Isaac freaking 
                        Larian. Isaac “the Prince of Toys” 
                        Larian. Oh my god, oh my god. 

           Allison starts freaking out a bit, which basically consists 
           of a lot of bodily contortions while she speaks.

                                 JENNIFER
                        The what? The who? 

                                 ALLISON
                        He doesn’t work at Bratz. He’s the 
                        C.E.O.! The most popular doll in 
                        the country. Or they were until 
                        Barbie got a hold of them.

                                 KAY
                        The one company that finally makes 
                        little brown and black girls with 
                        personality. I was hoping my 
                        daughter might be able to see 
                        herself represented in the toy 
                        aisle, but I guess Barbie isn’t 
                        ready for that. 

                                 ALLISON
                        Apparently, the designer of Bratz 
                        previously worked at Mattel and 
                        stole company secrets and gave them 
                        to Bratz.

                                 ALLISON (CONT'D)
                        Barbie just destroyed them in 
                        court. They have to pull all of 
                        their dolls off the shelf because 
                        of an injunction. So now Bratz is 
                        appealing and countersuing. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        I guess someone reads the legal 
                        journals around here! 
                            (beat)
                        Fudge. 

                                 KAY
                        What did you do?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Do you think he heard me call them 
                        fugly?

                                 KAY
                        He definitely heard you. That would 
                        be like me not hearing someone drop 
                        an N bomb.

                                 JENNIFER
                        How could it be that bad?

                                 KAY
                        He told the world he that he 
                        created those dolls in his 
                        daughter’s image. Fugly?! Really?

           Jennifer takes a big chug of wine.

           INT. ISAAC LARIAN’S OFFICE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Jennifer stands in the bathroom at the sink next to  
           MICHAELA, flawless, tall blonde lawyer, 20s, dressed to the 
           nines, not a hair out of place, who is applying lipstick.

                                 MICHAELA
                        I heard they were bringing someone 
                        on as advisory counsel for jury 
                        selection. As if we need a baby-
                        sitter. You with Latham? 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Nope.

                                 MICHAELA
                        Skadden?
                                 JENNIFER
                        Nope? Keller Simpson. Based out of 
                        the Valley.

           Michaela pouts her lips and smirks. 

                                 MICHAELA
                        I didn’t realize there were any 
                        legitimate firms all the way out 
                        there.

           Michaela walks out on that dig. Jennifer fluffs her hair and 
           pushes up her boobs. She pulls out lipstick, but then thinks 
           twice and shoves it back in her purse.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Isaac holds court for a TEAM OF ORRICK LAWYERS, including 
           MICHAELA from the bathroom. Max observes from the back.

           Jennifer, Kay and Allison are brought in by an ASSISTANT, and 
           stand in front of a large breakfast spread. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Whoops, sorry, we thought we were 
                        supposed to be here at 10:30.

                                 ISAAC
                        It’s ok, stay. Please continue, 
                        Michaela. 

                                 ALLISON
                            (whispering)
                        This is huge. Their breakfast 
                        spread is incredible. You have to 
                        get us hired!

                                 JENNIFER
                            (whispering)
                        Don’t get your hopes up. We’re just 
                        here for a initial consult. If it 
                        works out, maybe we get a week’s 
                        pay out of it.

           Allison literally hides behind Jennifer and stuffs a bagel 
           into her pocket. Isaac sidles up to Jennifer.

                                 ISAAC
                            (to room)
                        As you know, we need to shake 
                        things up. So I’ve asked Jennifer 
                        Keller and her firm to give things 
                        a second set of eyes.

                        I’m considering adding them to the 
                        team as backup. Her record on jury 
                        selection is indisputable. I’d like 
                        you to share your strategy.

           The ORRICK team all start murmuring making it clear they are 
           displeased to have a no name firm chiming in.  Kay stares at 
           the entirely white team.

                                 KAY
                            (whispers to Jennifer)
                        Is this a clan meeting or a law 
                        firm?

                                 JENNIFER
                            (whispering)
                        That’s how BigLaw rolls!

                                 MICHAELA
                        Is this a joke, Isaac? 

                                 ISAAC
                            (pissed)
                        Do I look like I’m joking?

           Michaela grudgingly walks to the front and clicks on a 
           Powerpoint slide. The page she’s focused on is a box of 
           potential jurors with pictures and descriptions. 

                                 MICHAELA
                        We’ve spent months culling through 
                        data, and this is the ideal pool to 
                        get us the verdict we want. 

           Isaac motions to Jennifer to examine it. Jennifer and 
           Michaela have a bit of a stare down. Jennifer hones in on a 
           few faces.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Why did you pick this juror?

                        I’m not sure someone of your 
                        pedigree is going to understand the 
                        complexities of our jury selection 
                        methodology.

                        Try me.

           Michaela looks to Isaac, who nods.
                                 MICHAELA
                        We believe that since the 
                        intellectual property is the crux 
                        of the case, certain jurors with a 
                        science background would be more 
                        sympathetic to our position and 
                        understand the nuances. 

                                 JENNIFER
                            (addresses room)
                        Possession is 9/10ths of the law. 
                        That’s about how much I know. 

                                 MICHAELA
                        Then why are you in this room?

                                 JENNIFER
                        I realize most of you have never 
                        heard of us. We don’t come from a 
                        traditional path. Before I was a 
                        lawyer, I was a dock worker. Kay 
                        was a school teacher and Allison, 
                        well, she’s was being studied in 
                        Area 51. 

           No one laughs at the joke. Michaela scoffs.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        We have worked alongside all kinds 
                        of people. Everyday ordinary people 
                        of all colors, shapes and sizes. 
                        That’s what juries are. If you have 
                        only been in an ivory tower, you’ll 
                        never know what drives them or what 
                        justice means to them. 

                                 MICHAELA
                        I’ve tried jury cases before so 
                        save us the pandering.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Pandering? I was asked to come here 
                        by Isaac, so clearly there’s some 
                        confidence issues.

                                 MICHAELA
                            (pissed)
                        The only confidence issue is a 
                        Hastings Law grad thinking she can 
                        understand on a whim a strategy 
                        that the best lawyers in the 
                        country spent nine months on.
                                 JENNIFER
                        Clearly these are not the best 
                        lawyers if you all thought this 
                        would be the best jury. If there’s 
                        one thing I know it’s winning 
                        juries...
                            (points to slides)
                        ...this is a losing hand. 

           Jennifer looks around the room. All she sees are dismissive 
           faces. Isaac looks to be deep in thought. 

                                 MICHAELA
                        Isaac, this is ridiculous. The 
                        leader of the Bad News Bears over 
                        here admitted she knows nothing 
                        about sophisticated IP law. Did you 
                        even take the patent bar?

                                 JENNIFER
                        No, but I go to Pat’s Irish Bar 
                        every Tuesday for their pot pies.

                                 MICHAELA
                        Sarcasm is a tool of intellectual 
                        cripples. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Actually, Powerpoint slides are. 
                        Even if you had the right jury, you 
                        have the wrong person selling it. 
                        It’s ironic, really. 

                                 MICHAELA
                        The only ironic thing here is that 
                        you probably think you look 
                        professional in that Forever 21 
                        suit. Maybe next time cut the tag 
                        off first. 

           Jennifer reaches over her shoulder. Shit. She rips it off. 
           She feels the Orrick team collectively scoffing at her.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Sale rack, Lane Bryant. Insult me 
                        all you want, but Isaac, you spent 
                        years running away from Barbie and 
                        yet this is who you hire to tell 
                        your story. She’s practically a 
                        walking Mattel ad. Did we check if 
                        she comes with batteries?
                                 MICHAELA
                        I’m not going to apologize for 
                        being both academically superior to 
                        you and more attractive. I went to 
                        Harvard. On full scholarship.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Isaac, the simple fact is, there 
                        are only two reasons a jury would 
                        ever respond to her.  

           Jennifer points to her fake breasts. The Orrick lawyers gasp 
           in horror.

                                 MICHAELA
                        Screw you, you ambulance chasing 
                        trash!

           Michaela surprises herself by losing composure. Jennifer 
           steps up like she’s ready to fight. The other Orrick Lawyers 
           step in between them.

                                 ISAAC
                        That’s enough. Thank you all for 
                        your time. This meeting is over. 

           They all start walking out. Michaela looks at Isaac and 
           storms out. 

                                 MICHAELA
                        I can’t work with that woman!

           Isaac points to Jennifer.

                                 ISAAC
                        You. Stay! 

           Isaac watches through the window as everyone trickles out.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I apologize. I didn’t mean to stir 
                        the pot like that.

                                 ISAAC
                        Yes. You did.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I planned on playing nice, but she 
                        basically called me a troll who 
                        lived under a bridge. 

                                 ISAAC
                        I bet nobody has ever talked to 
                        Michaela like that in her life.

                        I thought she was actually going to 
                        take a swing at you.

                                 JENNIFER
                        She’d tip over.

           They both laugh. 

                                 ISAAC
                        I like your style, but I doubt this 
                        arrangement will work. We’re going 
                        up against Quinn Emanuel, the 800 
                        pound gorilla. We need the 
                        resources of a big firm and I don’t 
                        see you guys meshing. I hope you 
                        understand that.

           He puts out his hand to shake hers. She can tell this is 
           probably goodbye.

                                 ISAAC (CONT’D)
                        I’ll sleep on it tonight before I 
                        give you my final answer in the 
                        morning. 
                            (beat)
                        And tell her the bagels are free.

           Isaac points to Allison. A bagel is sticking out of her 
           pocket. Jennifer walks out. Max approaches Isaac.

                                 MAX
                        I can see your wheels spinning. I 
                        like her too. But we simply cannot 
                        win a billion dollar case with a 
                        small time law firm. It’s a fact.

                                 ISAAC
                        Is it? 

                                 MAX
                        Do you want to win or do you just 
                        want to scorch the earth? 

                                 ISAAC
                        I want to destroy Mattel the way 
                        they destroyed my company. If we 
                        win, we do that.

           Isaac rips the head off a Barbie doll on his desk.
           INT. QUINN EMANUEL LAW FIRM - DAY

           Quinn is widely regarded at the top litigation firm in the 
           country and they’ve spared no expense to make sure everyone 
           knows it. It’s sleek, all glass, fancy artwork everywhere.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           The founder of the firm, JOHN QUINN, 60s, superfit, handsome, 
           a commanding presence. Above his head is a giant metal shark, 
           just to put a non-subtle button on how they view themselves.

           BOB ECKERT, 60s, obnoxious veteran CEO of Mattel stands by 
           his side and speaks quietly to him so as not to be heard by 
           the packed room of ASSOCIATES.

                                 BOB
                        My ass is on the line here, John. 
                        I’ve been CEO of six fortune 500 
                        companies and I’ll be damned if my 
                        career gets sidetracked by toys. I 
                        hate toys. Once we wrap this up, 
                        I’m gonna make a move to something 
                        a little more dynamic. Poultry. You 
                        can have my entire legal business. 
                        So long as you don’t fuck this up! 
                        Am I understood? 

                                 QUINN
                        Stick around. I want to you see the 
                        gravity with which I take this 
                        matter.

           John begins to hold court for a DOZEN ASSOCIATES, all dressed 
           in black suits, seated at an absurdly long table.

                        Ladies and gentlemen, we won the 
                        battle, but the doll war is far 
                        from over. Much like Heracles in 
                        Amymome, we’ve cut off the head of 
                        the Hydra only to see two more grow 
                        back. Isaac Larian is desperate, 
                        and a desperate man is a dangerous 
                        man. So on this appeal, we will do 
                        as Heracles did and dip our swords 
                        in venom to end him once and for 
                        all.  What’s the latest on his 
                        choice of additional counsel?
                                 ASSOCIATE
                        We believe they have narrowed it 
                        down to Skadden or Latham to back 
                        up Orrick. Maybe he’ll go outside 
                        the box with Boies. 

                                 QUINN
                        I don’t pay you to guess. Suit up 
                        and find out who else is joining 
                        the fray. Then find out what cereal 
                        they eat, what car they drive, 
                        which judges they play golf with 
                        and what their weaknesses are. Get 
                        some mud under your nails. 

           John pulls out a freaking Samurai sword and slams it on the 
           desk for all to see. The Associates look at him with a mix of 
           terror and admiration. Nobody dares even move an inch.

                                 QUINN (CONT’D)
                        When we win this case, we will have 
                        learned which of you gladiators are 
                        deserving of the spoils of your 
                        munus: large office, partnership 
                        track, wealth beyond your wildest 
                        dreams and which of you will be 
                        cast off with the plebians. 

           He spins the sword on the table. The Associates all pray it 
           doesn’t land pointing at them.

                                 QUINN (CONT’D)
                        They say the meek shall inherit the 
                        earth. Not on my watch. Dismissed.

           The Associates sprint out of the room, leaving John Quinn 
           alone with Bob. Bob massages the sword.

                                 BOB
                        I like what I’m hearing. Now slit 
                        their fucking throats.

           Bob walks out. 

                                 QUINN
                        Shmuck.

           John has got a pained expression on his face as he stares up 
           at a whiteboard. He sees the names of all of his peer law 
           firms written in columns with boxes underneath labeled 
           “Strengths” and “Weaknesses.” A final column next to the firm 
           names says “Unknown.” As a man who must know all, it’s this 
           word that’s vexing him.

           coitus. She flips through a case transcript. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        I just don’t know if I can do this.

                                 CHARLIE
                        This?

           Charlie leans over and kisses her.

                                 JENNIFER
                        No, not this. This is one of the 
                        good things. And don’t pat yourself 
                        on the back because I said 
                        something nice.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I won’t.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I don’t know if I can be a mom. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        News flash. You already are. I saw 
                        her watching you in court. She was 
                        impressed.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Everyone is impressed when they see 
                        the Globetrotters wipe the floor 
                        with the Generals. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re sexy when you gloat. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’m serious. Inappropriate aunt, I 
                        was great at. Take her to a movie, 
                        buy her the candy Rebecca wouldn’t. 
                        As a mom, I don’t know what the 
                        hell I’m doing. Maybe it’s for the 
                        best that Isaac doesn’t hire us.  
                        It would mean less time with her. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        They say absence makes the heart 
                        grow fonder. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Let’s hope.
                            (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                        You should have seen the way 
                        Orrick’s lawyers were looking at 
                        us. I’ve seen that look my whole 
                        life. I’m so damn tired of it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        So do something about it!

           Jennifer gets up and paces. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        It’s too late. We had our shot. I 
                        blew it running my mouth. Damn it. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You really want this, don’t you? 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Damn, I just realized I really do. 
                        But it’s too late. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        The Jennifer Keller I know would 
                        march right over to Isaac’s house 
                        if she wanted it badly enough.

           Jennifer hates Charlie for knowing her this well.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I can’t get a sitter for Suzie 
                        tonight at the last minute.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ll watch her.

                                 JENNIFER
                        You are good with kids. Better than 
                        me, actually. But...we’re not there 
                        yet...are we? 
                            (looks her in the eye)
                        Nope.  

           She shakes her head and scrambles to get dressed.

           INT. ISAAC LARIAN’S HOME - NIGHT

           It’s Friday and that means family night at the Larians. A 
           large gathering of his NUCLEAR FAMILY and MANY COUSINS. 

           The CHILDREN are all gathered in the den playing with Bratz 
           dolls. The doorbell rings.
           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jennifer waits at the door. JASMIN opens it.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Is your dad home?

                                 JASMIN
                        Papa! You work with my dad?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Umm, maybe. I hope so.

                                 JASMIN
                        Me too, I like your hair.

           Jennifer laughs and plays with her frizzy hair. Isaac comes 
           to the door.

                                 ISAAC
                        This is a surprise. Would you like 
                        to come in? 

                                 JENNIFER
                        I can’t. I won’t be long. I didn’t 
                        mean to interrupt your family meal.

                                 ISAAC
                        Family is everything.

                                 JENNIFER
                        That’s actually what I came here to 
                        tell you.

                                 ISAAC
                        Go on?

                                 JENNIFER
                        I read the entire transcript of 
                        your first case. 

                                 ISAAC
                        That would take weeks--

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’m a fast reader. The thing is, 
                        there was a whole lot about 
                        intellectual property, who owned 
                        what copyright, but there was 
                        virtually nothing about who you 
                        are.  
                                 ISAAC
                        My lawyers felt we should focus on 
                        the facts.

                                 JENNIFER
                        And how did that work out?
                            (off his look)
                        You are a man who came here from 
                        Iran with nothing, and had a dream. 
                        Their story is about ripping off 
                        people like you for a hundred years 
                        and stealing those dreams. If we 
                        show a jury that, I promise we will 
                        take them down. 

                                 ISAAC
                        We? So you think you can get along 
                        with Michaela?

                                 JENNIFER
                        To be frank, no. If we are backing 
                        them up, there’s no way they are 
                        going to listen to me. I’m better 
                        than her...for this case. 

                                 ISAAC
                        Did you really drive to my house to 
                        give me an ultimatum?

                                 JENNIFER
                        I drove here to tell you that when 
                        I’m in on something, I’m all in.

           Isaac notices that Jennifer didn’t come alone. Suzie is 
           sitting in the front seat of the car.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        I couldn’t find a sitter. She’s 
                        umm, my sister’s kid. She passed 
                        recently. Car accident. Now, 
                        she’s...all mine.

                                 ISAAC
                        Why don’t you and your daughter 
                        come in and we can discuss over 
                        Gormeh? I insist.

           INT. DINNER TABLE - NIGHT

           Jennifer sits at a large table and shares in the feast of 
           Persian dishes: rice, meats, fresh mint, etc. with Isaac and 
           his wife, ANGELA, 40s modest, exudes warmth.
           Jasmin and Suzie are in the den playing with the Bratz dolls. 
           Jennifer notices that they come in all shapes, sizes and 
           colors. Suzie giggles. It makes Jennifer smile.

                                 ISAAC
                        You’ve never seen a child play with 
                        a Bratz doll before.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I haven’t seen her giggle before.

           Angela smiles at her.

                                 ANGELA
                        Give it time. 

                                 ISAAC
                        My in-house counsel thinks I’d be 
                        crazy to go with an untested law 
                        firm. He said it would be like 
                        calling up a Triple A team to play 
                        in the World Series.

                                 JENNIFER
                        All do respect, I did criminal 
                        defense for a decade, in life or 
                        death situations. A couple of 
                        million dollars doesn’t scare me.

                                 ISAAC
                        It’s billion with a b. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        What’s a decimal point between 
                        friends?

           Angela and Isaac chuckle.

                                 ISAAC
                        How come you never worked at a big 
                        firm?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Oh, I started my career at Skadden. 
                        Lasted about six months.

                                 ISAAC
                        What happened?

                                 JENNIFER
                        I don’t play well with others.
                                 ISAAC
                            (chuckles)
                        Neither do I. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Who’s gonna be able to get those 
                        jurors to see you the way you want 
                        to be seen? Me or Lawyer Barbie? If 
                        you want to look like the underdog, 
                        then you need your firm to look 
                        like underdogs too. 

                                 ANGELA 
                        She has a point.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’ve been underestimated my whole 
                        life by male lawyers because I’m a 
                        woman. You know who else gave women 
                        the idea that they were only fit 
                        for certain things? Barbie. At 
                        least you created a diverse world 
                        where mothers can tell their 
                        daughters, white, black and brown, 
                        that they can be whatever they want 
                        to be and look however they want to 
                        look. Barbie wants to take that 
                        away. I’m not gonna let them. 

           Angela smiles approvingly. 

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        I may not know much about being a 
                        great mom, but I know I’m a great 
                        lawyer. 

                                 ANGELA
                        You seem to be doing a better job 
                        than you think on that front.

           Suzie and Jasmin are fully immersed in Bratz world and having 
           a great time. 

                                 ANGELA (CONT’D)
                            (in Farsi)
                        Bokhor. Bokhor.

                                 ISAAC
                        She says you need to eat more. 
                        You’re too skinny!

           They all have a good laugh. Jennifer stares at Suzie and 
           smiles, feeling like it’s all going to be ok. 
           INT. KELLER SIMPSON - NIGHT

           Jennifer, Kay and Allison commiserate again over Chinese food 
           and wine. 

                                 ALLISON
                        What kind of rugs did he have? 

                                 JENNIFER
                        I don’t know. Persian I guess, who 
                        cares?

                                 ALLISON
                        Who cares? You can trace most of 
                        the historical middle eastern 
                        conflicts through the patterns in 
                        the fabrics. The Mamluks, Seluq, 
                        and the Mongols, each infused the 
                        Persian tradition with their own 
                        ideas. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        If I ever need a fabric guru, 
                        you’re my gal. But maybe save some 
                        of that brain space for memorizing 
                        case law, because I don’t think we 
                        can afford Westlaw next month.

                                 ALLISON
                        Happy to go the library to memorize 
                        every relevant IP case of the past 
                        50 years if you want!

                                 JENNIFER
                        Let’s not put the cart before the 
                        horse.

                                 ALLISON
                        What does that mean? 

                                 KAY
                        It means, let’s not count our 
                        chickens before they hatch.

                                 ALLISON
                        I’m not following. I don’t like 
                        animals.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Are you sure you’re a genius? 

                                 ALLISON
                        Mensa says I am, but what do they 
                        know. 
                                 JENNIFER
                        It means we probably won’t get 
                        hired. Isaac sure loves his family. 
                        But also seems like a powder keg of 
                        emotion. He’d either make a great 
                        or horrible witness.

                                 KAY
                        I gotta hand it to you. As usual, 
                        you have balls of steel for even 
                        going over there. 

           The phone rings. They all suddenly go stiff with nerves. 
           Jennifer picks up.

                                 JENNIFER
                        This is Jennifer.
                            (beat)
                        I see. Understood. 

           She hangs up. Kay and Allison wait with baited breath.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        There’s good news and bad news. The 
                        good news is they do want us to 
                        help out on the Bratz case. 

                                 KAY
                        So what’s the bad news?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Unfortunately for us...we are LEAD 
                        COUNSEL! 

           Jennifer and Kay start hugging. They open the circle to 
           include Allison, who rebuffs them.

                                 ALLISON
                        I’m hugging you both in here.

           Allison points to her head. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        He wants us in his office at 9 AM 
                        to meet with Orrick, who are 
                        backing us up! How do you like ‘dem 
                        apples!

                                 ALLISON
                        I can’t go to his office. They 
                        caught me shoplifting!
                                 JENNIFER
                        They were free bagels...and we’re a 
                        team. We need a showing of 
                        strength.

           The phone rings.

                                 ALLISON
                        Don’t pick up! What if it’s Isaac 
                        and he changed his mind?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Then we’d need to know that.

           She picks up.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Isaac, you have nothing to worry 
                        about, I assure you, you made the 
                        right choice.

                                 QUINN (O.S.)
                        This is John Quinn. 

                                 JENNIFER
                            (whispers covering phone)
                        It’s John Motherfucking Quinn!

           She stands up and paces.

           INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

           INT. QUINN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           John sits alone at his desk sharpening a knife.

                                 QUINN
                        I’m calling to congratulate you. Or 
                        should I say: welcome to the 
                        majors.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Oh I’ve been playing the majors my 
                        whole life. Just never got credit 
                        for it from men like you. 

                                 QUINN
                        You should know that I’m taking 
                        personal responsibility for this 
                        case.
                                 JENNIFER
                        Then it will look even better for 
                        me when we win.

           Alison and Kay shake their head “No” as if to say don’t taunt 
           John Motherfucking Quinn! 

                                 QUINN
                        I want to be clear. Just because 
                        you’re a novice firm, you won’t get 
                        any special treatment. We’ll treat 
                        you how we treat all our rivals. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        And how’s that?

           Jennifer makes the “chatterbox” motion to Kay and Allison who 
           are now frantic, trying to get her to stop! 

                                 QUINN
                        I believe in Roman traditions. They 
                        are very misunderstood. The Romans 
                        didn’t kill as part of some 
                        barbaric human sacrifice. It was as 
                        much to appease the gods as it was 
                        to ensure all enemies respected 
                        their superiority as a culture and 
                        therefore made future conquests and 
                        assimilation easier. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Do people actually go for this 
                        nonsense? 

                                 QUINN
                        We don’t just win cases, we 
                        ritualistically slaughter our 
                        opponents. We leave their rotting 
                        corpses on display so all future 
                        challengers know never to enter the 
                        Colosseum with us. 

           Allison and Kay both wave their hands trying to get her not 
           to take the bait.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I have a philosophy too, Johnny 
                        Boy. It’s a bit simpler. It’s 
                        called “Go fuck yourself!” 

                                 QUINN
                        Classy. Discovery should be 
                        arriving any minute. 
                                 JENNIFER
                        You’re sending discovery files, at 
                        this hour?

                                 QUINN
                        Special delivery.

           There’s a loud beeping outside her office that they both can 
           hear through the phone.

                                 QUINN (CONT’D)
                        Have a good, long night.

           He hangs up. She walks to the window. 

           There’s a giant DELIVERY TRUCK, with TWO WORKERS, unloading, 
           no joke, hundreds of boxes, with millions of documents 
           inside. The boxes are so high they take up every parking 
           spot, and block their doorway. Even if they wanted to leave, 
           they’d have a hard time doing it. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Fucking Barbie.

           EXT. QUIET SUBURBAN STREET - MISSOURI - DAY

           Jennifer pulls up to a modest home in her rental car. 

                                 SUZIE
                        What are we doing here? I’m missing 
                        school.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I told you, we’re taking a little 
                        adventure?

                                 SUZIE
                        Nobody takes adventures to 
                        Missouri.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Just wait in the car.

           Jennifer walks up to the house holding a stack of files. She 
           rings the doorbell. MARJORIE BRYANT, 60s, answers but keeps 
           the screen door closed.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Does Carter Bryant live here?

                                 MARJORIE
                        Not if you’re a lawyer.
                                 JENNIFER
                        I understand he’s had a rough go of 
                        it. 

                                 MARJORIE
                        You jackals destroyed my sweet boy. 

           She slams the door in Jennifer’s face. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        I had nothing to do with that. I 
                        don’t work at one of those fancy 
                        firms. 

                                 MARJORIE
                            (through the door)
                        They couldn’t afford to hire a good 
                        lawyer to harass us?

                                 JENNIFER
                        I guess not...I’m here to do the 
                        right thing. I want your son to 
                        have his voice heard. 
                            (off silence)
                        I’m just gonna leave my card right 
                        here. I’m staying at the Best 
                        Western on Franklin until tomorrow. 

           She drops the card on the welcome mat and slowly walks to the 
           car. She gets in her car and starts the ignition. 

           Out of the corner of her eye, she barely spots CARTER BRYANT, 
           30s, gaunt, a deep sadness in his eyes, peeking at her 
           through the upstairs window. 

           INT. BEST WESTERN - DAY

           Jennifer shares a room with Suzie. Jennifer flips through old 
           case files, completely engrossed in her work.

                                 SUZIE
                        This TV doesn’t have any good 
                        channels. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Should I order us a pizza?

                                 SUZIE
                        We just ate!

           Suzie points to the empty pizza box.
                                 JENNIFER
                        Right. Do you want to play a game? 

           Suzie shrugs.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Gin rummy? 

                                 SUZIE
                        I don’t know how to play?

           Jennifer pulls out a deck of cards from her purse. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’ll teach you. This was your mom’s 
                        favorite game. She used to whip my 
                        butt. 

           Jennifer starts shuffling and hands out the cards.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        You need three or four of the same 
                        card, or three or four of the same 
                        suit in a row. You know what a suit 
                        is?

                                 SUZIE
                            (ignores her instructions)
                        So did you talk to Carter?

                                 JENNIFER
                        He didn’t want to talk to me.

                                 SUZIE
                        Why not?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Well, when people have been hurt, 
                        they tend to be a little closed 
                        off. And it takes them a while to 
                        warm up. They want to know if you 
                        have good intentions.

           Jennifer places a card down. Suzie picks it up. 

                                 SUZIE
                        Do you have good intentions?

                                 JENNIFER
                        I do. This poor boy has been 
                        through a lot and I think he 
                        deserved to be heard. 
                                 SUZIE
                        Gin.

                                 JENNIFER
                        What the---

                                 SUZIE
                        My mom and I played once or twice. 

           Suzie smirks.

           INT. QUINN’S OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Inside the conference room, Quinn’s ASSOCIATES work on their 
           case game plan, while one of them writes on a white board.

           It says “Keller Simpson lead counsel - Jennifer Keller” with 
           her picture taped to the board - “Strengths vs. Weaknesses”. 
           “Strengths - connects with juries, thinks outside the box, 
           can sell ice to Eskimos. Weaknesses - brash, prone to 
           outbursts, practices an alternative lifestyle?” 

                                 QUINN
                        What does that mean? 

                                 ASSOCIATE
                        She dates women. 

                                 QUINN
                        Well, there’s nothing wrong with 
                        that.

           He walks up to the Associate and whispers in her ear.

                        But keep digging.

           INT. HOTEL - MORNING

           Jennifer packs up a suitcase.

                                 SUZIE
                        So we’re leaving. I thought you 
                        said Carter was coming with us.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I was hoping he might. Sometimes 
                        things just don’t go the way you 
                        want and you have to come up with 
                        Plan B.
                                 SUZIE
                        So what’s plan B?

                                 JENNIFER
                        I have no idea. 

           Jennifer sits on the bed next to Suzie. 

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Should we stay for another day, and 
                        just see the sights?

                                 SUZIE
                        Don’t you have like a huge trial?

                                 JENNIFER
                        I sure do, but I find the best 
                        thing to do sometimes is to clear 
                        your head and make space for the 
                        right answer to come to you.

                                 SUZIE
                        You’re weird.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Don’t tell anyone.

                                 SUZIE
                        I think they know. 

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           MONTAGE

           - Jennifer and Suzie drive around town, passing a bowling 
           alley, a grocery store and a mall. 

           - They stop for some ice cream.

           - They drive past Carter’s house slowly.

           - They stop in front of his old high school.

           - They drive past his house one more time, even more slowly.

                                 SUZIE
                        Are we stalking?

                                 JENNIFER
                        What? Who taught you that word? 
                        That’s ridiculous. It’s a small 
                        town, there’s only so many places--
           Carter pulls up next to them in his car. 

                                 CARTER
                        Meet me at Denny’s.

           He drives off.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Sometimes stalking works! Don’t 
                        every tell anyone I said that. 

           INT. ISAAC’S OFFICE - DAY

           Isaac is in a full on fight with Max. 

                                 MAX
                        Isaac, I’ve been with you for 
                        fifteen years and I never once 
                        questioned whether you trusted my 
                        judgment.

                                 ISAAC
                        And I never questioned whether you 
                        trusted mine!

                                 MAX
                        She hasn’t called you back in 
                        hours. 

                                 ISAAC
                        I’m sure she has her reasons. 
                        Orrick called me every hour, how 
                        did that work out?

                                 MAX
                        What if you’re wrong?

           Isaac flips a beheaded Barbie doll to Max.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Isaac, please. If I see even the 
                        slightest sign that she’s in over 
                        her head, let me pull the plug.

                                 ISAAC
                        I’m not on a kamikaze mission. I’ll 
                        pull it myself. 

           INT. DENNY’S - DAY

           Jennifer and Suzie sit across from Carter. He’s devouring 
           pancakes. 
                                 CARTER
                        You have a crappy rental car.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I happen to like Hyundai.

                                 CARTER
                        The last guy had a BMW.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Snob!

                                 CARTER
                        You’re driving my mom crazy. What 
                        do you want?  

                                 JENNIFER
                        Your story.

                                 CARTER
                        Didn’t you hear. I’m a thief. I’m a 
                        traitor. I should be executed for 
                        treason. Mattel is the real genius. 
                        Bob Eckert the Mac and Cheese king, 
                        he created Bratz. Or maybe it was 
                        Isaac, since the world revolves 
                        around him.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I know the first trial was rough on 
                        you.

                                 CARTER
                        Hey Suzie, how old am I?

                                 SUZIE
                        Fifty?

                                 CARTER
                        I’m 31. Don’t do drugs. 

           Carter goes back to eating his pancakes. 

                                 CARTER (CONT’D)
                        Why did you drive to my old high 
                        school?

                                 JENNIFER
                        That’s where you came up with the 
                        inspiration for Bratz, wasn’t it?

                                 CARTER
                        You don’t believe me either?
                                 JENNIFER
                        I believe you. Do you know who Ruth 
                        Handler is?

                                 CARTER
                        Of course I do, I’m not stupid. She 
                        created Barbie.

                                 JENNIFER
                        No, she didn’t. She’s a fraud.

           Carter’s interest is piqued. 

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Suzie, put your headphones in.

           Suzie puts her iTunes headphones in and starts drawing on the 
           placement with crayons.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        1947. Berlin. Can you picture it?

           Jennifer recounts this story as we FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. TOY STORE BERLIN - DAY

           We follow Barbie’s founder RUTH HANDLER, 30s, beautiful 
           blonde American tourist, as she shops with her family in a 
           gift shop. She scans a collection of wooden and plastic 
           generic dolls. 

                                 JENNIFER (V.O.)
                        She didn’t “draw inspiration from a 
                        doll she saw there.” She didn’t 
                        “find her passion there.” She saw 
                        Barbie there! 

           Ruth spots something unique: a Barbie doll. Only it’s dressed 
           in a German army uniform. She asks the clerk about it.

                                 JENNIFER (V.O.)
                        Only back then these dolls were 
                        called Lilli. Lilli wasn’t some 
                        kids doll. It was made for the 
                        German soldiers. Some say it was a 
                        gag. I think it was because they 
                        were suffering from PTSD. Instead 
                        of therapy, they got dolls. Do you 
                        know what Barbie’s first job was?  
                        The world’s oldest profession. 
           INT. GERMAN SOLDIER’S BEDROOM

           A German soldier holds Lilli in one hand while masturbating 
           in the other.

                                 CARTER (V.O.)
                        Shut up!

                                 JENNIFER (V.O.)
                        That’s not all. 

           INT. CALIFORNIA BEACH HOUSE - DAY

           Ruth cuts the soldier outfit off the doll with a scissor and 
           replaces it with an outfit from another unknown doll.

                                 JENNIFER (V.O.)
                        Why the name “Barbie?” Because she 
                        had a daughter named Barbie. Why 
                        the name “Ken”...well, she had a 
                        son named Ken. 

                                 CARTER (V.O.)
                        Gross.

                                 JENNIFER (V.O.)
                        She’s about as imaginative as the 
                        company she founded.

           Ruth hands her kids the dolls to play with.

                                 JENNIFER (V.O.)
                        The German company only found out 
                        about it when Barbie became a 
                        household name and sure enough they 
                        took Barbie to court. They had the 
                        patents, they had the proof, should 
                        have been cut and dry. Barbie 
                        should have been toast.

           INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

           Barbie’s board hands two German engineers a check and wait 
           for them to sign some documents. They grudgingly agree.

                                 JENNIFER (V.O.)
                        But since the German company were 
                        small potatoes, they were bulldozed 
                        into a settlement. A couple of 
                        thousand dollars and a 
                        confidentiality agreement.

                                 JENNIFER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        So I find it quite rich that Barbie 
                        is now saying someone stole the 
                        idea for a doll, when their entire 
                        history is as fake as Barbie’s 
                        proportions.

           BACK TO: INT. DINER - DAY

                                 CARTER
                        I never heard any of this. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        I have the world’s greatest 
                        researcher. She can’t get through a 
                        cocktail hour without making 
                        everyone uncomfortable, but she can 
                        find a needle in any haystack. Let 
                        me tell you something about myself, 
                        Carter. I didn’t go to a fancy law 
                        school and I’m not an intellectual 
                        property expert.

                                 CARTER
                        Why did they hire you then? Are 
                        they broke?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Desperate, I guess. Maybe it’s 
                        because I don’t cower in Isaac’s 
                        presence. 

           Her phone rings. It’s Isaac.

                        Speak of the devil. Can you give me 
                        one minute? 

           Carter starts unconsciously drawing on his place mat. 

                                 CARTER
                        I’ll keep an eye on her.

           EXT. DINER - DAY

           Jennifer stands outside the window talking to Isaac while 
           watching Carter and Suzie. She turns away from them.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I told you that you need to let me 
                        do my job. 
                                 ISAAC (O.S.)
                        And I told you, that you have a 
                        short rope! 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Just have faith. I’ll meet you in 
                        your office tomorrow to discuss 
                        strategy. 

           She turns back around and Carter and Suzie are gone. She 
           hangs up the phone in a panic. She runs back into the diner.

           INT. DINER - DAY

                                 JENNIFER
                        There was a little girl here with a 
                        blonde haired young man. Did you 
                        see them? 

           The Waitress shrugs. Jennifer looks panic stricken. 

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Suzie? Suzie? 

           She hears a giggle coming from the table. She runs over and 
           sees that Suzie and Carter are under the table drawing and 
           laughing. She composes herself.

                                 CARTER
                        We like it better under here. Don’t 
                        we?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Goddamn it!

           Suzie shakes her head. Jennifer calms herself down, realizing 
           they didn’t do anything wrong. 

                                 CARTER
                        What did Isaac want?

                                 JENNIFER
                        He wanted to know my plan. 

           Carter gets back up out from under the table.

                                 CARTER
                        And what is your grand plan? 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Tell a different story this time 
                        around. A story of hope. Of 
                        optimism.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                        Of a young, fabulous, and gay...
                            (off Carter’s look)
                        ...yes we’re not hiding that part 
                        this time around. An imaginative 
                        designer and an immigrant dreamer 
                        who gave him a chance. It’s a story 
                        of how when you let people spread 
                        their wings they can fly. And a 
                        story of David beating Goliath, but 
                        instead of a slingshot, we had your 
                        magical fingers.

           He sips his soda and takes a deep breath. He closes his eyes 
           to get some clarity, then opens them. 

                                 CARTER
                        That sounds like a great story. I 
                        wish you luck.

           Carter abruptly gets up. He looks miserable.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Don’t you want to get the truth out 
                        there?

                                 CARTER
                        I can’t go through it again. My 
                        job, my relationship, my bank 
                        account. They’re all gone. And the 
                        only thing that’s kept me from 
                        hurting myself is being at home 
                        with my family far away from that. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’m truly sorry for what they’ve 
                        done to you. I want to make it 
                        right.

                                 CARTER
                        I don’t need it to be right. I’m 
                        here now and I may never make 
                        another doll, but nobody can hurt 
                        me anymore. So please leave me out 
                        of it.  

           Carter gets up to walk away. 

                                 SUZIE
                        You forgot your drawing.

                                 CARTER
                        You can have it. 
           Jennifer and Suzie look at it. It’s an awesome Bratz like 
           drawing of Suzie. 

           INT. QUINN’S OFFICE - DAY

           A TOP FEMALE ASSOCIATE walks in. John is busy putting 
           together a watch by hand with tweezers and a loupe.

                                 ASSOCIATE
                        I have something we might be able 
                        use.

           John puts down his tools.

                                 ASSOCIATE (CONT’D)
                        Ms. Keller went to Missouri to meet 
                        with Carter Bryant.

                                 QUINN
                        As we knew she would. As I would. 
                        She only has a couple of bullets in 
                        her chamber and the sympathetic 
                        loser is one of them.

                                 ASSOCIATE
                        She brought her niece, who she has 
                        legal custody over. 

                                 QUINN
                        I wouldn’t exactly call child 
                        services. I take my kid to Dodgers 
                        opening day every year. 

                                 ASSOCIATE
                        Keller left the girl alone with 
                        Carter. And then she had a mini-
                        meltdown.

                                 QUINN
                        You can verify this?

                                 ASSOCIATE
                        I have a statement from the hostess 
                        at Denny’s. 

                                 QUINN
                        You’ve done fine work. Go home 
                        tonight, open some wine, you earned 
                        it. Then put on some Andrea Bocelli 
                        and make love to your husband.

           She stands their awkwardly.

                        Dismissed. 

           INT. SCHOOL - DAY

           Jennifer walks the hall with Suzie to drop her off. As they 
           approach the classroom, Amanda, the school teacher stands 
           with CHANTEL, 30s, Child Services Social Worker.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’ll be here at 3 to pick you up. 
                        Go on in.

           Suzie walks into the classroom.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Really? You told me to bond with 
                        her so I bonded with her. Am I in 
                        detention?

                                 AMANDA
                        This is Chantel Simms from Child 
                        Services.

           Jennifer is stunned.

                                 JENNIFER
                        We know each other.

                                 AMANDA
                        We got a report that you left her 
                        alone with a disturbed person, so I 
                        had no choice but to call.

                                 JENNIFER
                        A report? From who? Nevermind, I 
                        know who. It was five minutes and 
                        he’s not a disturbed person, he’s a 
                        witness.

                                 CHANTEL
                        Do you think it’s appropriate to 
                        have a nine year old mixed up in 
                        legal drama?

                                 JENNIFER
                        She wasn’t mixed up. It was an 
                        adventure for her.
                                 CHANTEL
                        Did you leave her unattended at any 
                        point with a Carter Bryant, who 
                        recently spent a month voluntarily 
                        committed at a mental health 
                        facility? 

                                 JENNIFER
                        He’s a sweet kid. It was in a 
                        public place.

                                 CHANTEL
                        Did you know he’s been arrested for 
                        drug possession and solicitation. 

           Jennifer runs her hands over her eyes. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’m trying to be a mother to this 
                        child. I’m doing my best.
                            (to Amanda)
                        Tell her. 

                                 AMANDA
                        It’s been a struggle at times, but 
                        yes, I do think Jennifer has made 
                        some strides. 

           Chantel isn’t swayed. 

                                 CHANTEL
                        We’re going to have a visit on 
                        Friday and based on my examination, 
                        I’ll set a date for a hearing.

           She hands Jennifer her card. Jennifer just shakes her head. 
           She pulls out her phone and makes a call.

                                 JENNIFER
                            (into phone)
                        You son of a bitch.

                                 QUINN
                        I consider that a term of 
                        endearment. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        You think this is a game?
                                 QUINN
                        A battle. I told you that. If that 
                        little incident rattled you, you’re 
                        welcome to take your dolls and go 
                        home. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Rattled. No. Just pissed off. When 
                        I’m pissed off, I go for the 
                        jugular.

                                 QUINN
                        I look forward to deflecting your

           Allison and Kay are both deep in research, dropping papers as 
           they go, handing things off to each other across a messy

           room.

                                 CHANTEL
                        Are you home alone a lot?

                                 SUZIE
                        She takes me to the office.

                                 CHANTEL
                        And do you stay there late?

                                 SUZIE
                        Sometimes.

                                 CHANTEL
                        Do you get tired?

                                 SUZIE
                        They have a couch that I sleep on.

                                 CHANTEL
                        Do you ever have a baby-sitter 
                        here?

                                 SUZIE
                        Her friend, Charlie comes over 
                        sometimes. 

                                 CHANTEL
                        What do you guys do together?

                                 SUZIE
                        Just watch TV mostly. She makes 
                        macaroni and cheese.

                                 CHANTEL
                        So Charlie is a woman?

                                 SUZIE
                        She’s Aunt Jennifer’s best friend.
           Chantel takes notes. 

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jennifer stands across from Chantel.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Let me guess, I take her with me to 
                        the office too late, I let my 
                        girlfriend baby sit sometimes.

                                 CHANTEL
                        Are you two intimate?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Would you be asking that if she was 
                        a man?

                                 CHANTEL
                        Yes, I would. I’m only concerned 
                        about Suzie’s well-being.

                                 JENNIFER
                        We haven’t had that talk yet, but 
                        Charlie’s a responsible adult, a 
                        colleague and great with Suzie. 

                                 CHANTEL
                        Can I be frank?

                                 JENNIFER
                        I don’t have time for anything 
                        else.

                                 CHANTEL
                        When we placed Suzie with you, I  
                        did not think it was going to work. 
                        You had no aptitude and worse, no 
                        commitment to this child. But 
                        because I know what the system is 
                        like, I wanted Suzie to have a home 
                        here. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Maybe it’s not June Cleaver’s 
                        house, but she’s fed, clothed, does 
                        her homework, and we’re starting to 
                        bond. 

                                 CHANTEL
                        Are you? Or is she an inconvenience 
                        that you’re trying to fit in.
                                 JENNIFER
                        That’s not fair! I didn’t ask for 
                        my sister and her husband to die in 
                        a car crash. You think after 
                        choosing my career instead of a 
                        family of my own, it felt good for 
                        this to be shoved into my lap. 

           We see Suzie sitting at the top of the stairs.

                                 CHANTEL
                        I’m sure it hasn’t been easy.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Am I really that bad that you would 
                        take her away from me? I’m doing 
                        the absolute best I can. 

                                 CHANTEL
                        I sympathize with you. I really do. 
                        But my job is to make an assessment 
                        free of emotion.

                                 JENNIFER
                        No it’s not. You’re a human. I’m a 
                        human. Just give me a chance to 
                        work it out. She needs me.

           The door upstairs slams shut. Jennifer and Chantel both 
           realize Suzie has been listening to the conversation. 

           INT. KELLER SIMPSON OFFICE - NIGHT

           Jennifer, Kay and Allison continue to flip through documents 
           and swap notes. Copious amounts of wine and Chinese food are 
           smattered on the table. 

           Michaela opens the door holding a bag.

                                 MICHAELA
                        It’s Nozawa. 
                            (off their silence)
                        Sushi.

           Kay points to her pregnant belly.

                                 KAY
                        You literally trying to kill your 
                        rivals?

                                 JENNIFER
                        What are you doing here?
                                 MICHAELA
                        Isaac didn’t tell you? That’s 
                        pretty on brand for him. He 
                        instructed us to give you support, 
                        so here I am.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Yes, I called the firm three times 
                        and they never sent over any files.

                                 MICHAELA
                        Officially, they are willing to 
                        give you whatever you need. 
                        Unofficially they want you to fail.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Isn’t that what you want?

                                 MICHAELA
                        Actually, no. I’ve worked on this 
                        case for three years. If I can help 
                        get us over the finish line, I’ll 
                        do whatever it takes. I don’t like 
                        to lose. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Is this a setup?

                                 ALLISON
                        Just based on my analysis of her 
                        body, she’s twenty two percent 
                        false. Her breasts, her eyelashes, 
                        her height and her hair extensions.

                                 MICHAELA
                        My hair is real.

                                 ALLISON
                        Can I rip out a piece and test it?

                                 MICHAELA
                        I thought I was the bitch? 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Unlike you and I, she doesn’t mean 
                        to be. 

                                 MICHAELA
                        I swear I came here to help. 

           Jennifer looks at Kay.
                                 KAY
                        We need all the help we can get. If 
                        you screw with us, this won’t end 
                        well for you, Barbie. This isn’t 
                        Century City.

           Kay shoves a file in her chest. 

                                 MICHAELA
                        We got off on the wrong foot, but I 
                        know these companies like the back 
                        of my hand. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        So you know the real history of 
                        Barbie?  

                                 MICHAELA
                        You mean Lilli?

           Jennifer smiles and hands her a business card.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Welcome to the team. Your first 
                        order of business.

                                 MICHAELA
                        A towing company? 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Tell them the next round is on me 
                        at Patty McGee’s.

           INT. JENNIFER KELLER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Charlie is over watching TV with Jennifer and Suzie. Suzie 
           sits in Charlie’s lap. The show ends.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Ok, kiddo, time for bed.

                                 SUZIE
                        I’m not tired.

           She gives a pleading look to Charlie.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t look at me. I would totally 
                        have an all night marathon of Drake 
                        and Josh with you...but then I 
                        would miss work, you would miss 
                        school, we’d probably both get the 
                        flu and not be able to eat ice 
                        cream for a month. Does that sound 
                        fun? 

           Suzie shakes her head.  

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Good night.

           Charlie gives Suzie a hug. Suzie ignores Jennifer and walks 
           towards her room. Charlie motions for Jennifer to follows her 
           out into the hall. Jennifer gets up and follows her.

           INT. SUZIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

                                 JENNIFER
                        I know you heard me say something 
                        to that lady about your mom. The 
                        thing is, life is complicated. See 
                        I never thought about having a 
                        family and then the accident 
                        happened and all I could think 
                        about was wanting to be with you.

                                 SUZIE
                        Why didn’t you want a family?

                                 JENNIFER
                        I never saw myself as a mom type.

                                 SUZIE
                        But why?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Well...society said that people 
                        like me weren’t supposed to be 
                        moms. 

                                 SUZIE
                        What does that mean?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Hmm. For thousands of years 
                        everyone said men and women have to 
                        do things a certain way. 
                                 SUZIE
                        Why?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Mostly out of habit. People fear 
                        change.

                                 SUZIE
                        So what happened?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Well, it’s still happening, but 
                        some brave souls showed the world 
                        that all different types of people 
                        can do all different types of 
                        things, even if they don’t look 
                        like they can. So I’m trying to be 
                        brave and show everyone that I am 
                        every bit as good as any other mom.

                                 SUZIE
                        Except my mom.

           Jennifer sits silently thinking about their loss.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Well she was the best, so I’m gonna 
                        need some more time to get 
                        better...sort of like with you and 
                        math. There are some things I need 
                        to figure out. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jennifer walks back in to find Charlie watching TV.

                                 CHARLIE
                        How’d it go?

                                 JENNIFER
                        She hates me. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        She doesn’t.
                                 JENNIFER
                        Even if that’s true, child services 
                        is making their determination the 
                        same week I’m giving the biggest 
                        opening argument of my life on a 
                        case that’s a dog with fleas, not 
                        to mention I’ve now got a mole 
                        working with me, and did I mention 
                        the potential to lose a child I’ve 
                        come to love and a case that could 
                        define my life?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Career. Not life. Your life is 
                        defined by your character, and it’s 
                        unassailable.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Maybe you should give the opening.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re better than me. You’re 
                        better than John Quinn. You’re 
                        better than Mattel. The jurors will 
                        see it. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Are you trying to get laid?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’d be lying if I said no. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Isn’t there something about prize 
                        fighters staying chaste the night 
                        before a big fight?

           Charlie slides closer and puts her hand on Jennifer’s face.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Urban legend. I heard that the 
                        night Buster Douglas upset Mike 
                        Tyson, he and his lady were up all 
                        night long. The hotel clerk in 
                        Tokyo had to refund all his 
                        neighbors because of noise 
                        complaints.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Which one of us is Buster Douglas?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ll be your Buster Douglas.
                                 JENNIFER
                        Buster Douglas took all the grief 
                        from his mother’s death and 
                        channeled it into a blind rage.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That analogy would work here too.

           Charlie slides her hand into Jennifer’s thigh.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Did Buster Douglas have a nine year 
                        old in his suite?

           Jennifer gets up and opens the front door. They kiss. 

           INT. ISAAC’S HOME - NIGHT

           Isaac and his family pray around the table. 

           EXT. QUINN EMANUEL OFFICE - NIGHT

           John Quinn comes out of his skyscraper and walks towards the 
           parking lot. He sees a tow trucking pulling a Bentley with 
           the vanity plates “RNMAKER.”

                                 TOW TRUCK DRIVER (O.S.)
                        Jenny says hi, dipshit! 

           He speeds off giving John the finger and causing the Bentley 
           to spark from the bumper, rubbing the asphalt.

           INT. JENNIFER KELLER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jennifer paces the room acting out her opening. 

                                 JENNIFER (PRE-LAP)
                        Ladies and gentlemen of the jury--

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           The courtroom is packed. Jennifer stands in front of a JURY 
           to deliver her opening salvo.

                                 QUINN
                        Your honor, we’d like to make a 
                        motion to suppress.

                                 JENNIFER
                        After I’ve begun my closing?
           The JUDGE, 50s, no nonsense type, shakes his head.

                                 JUDGE
                        Counsel, in my chambers now. We’ll 
                        recess temporarily.

           INT. JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - DAY

           The Judge sits across from Quinn and Jennifer.

                                 QUINN
                        It’s come to our attention that 
                        they plan to use prejudicial and 
                        confidential settlement agreement 
                        info to paint a picture of my 
                        client that would far outweigh its 
                        probative value per section 403.

                                 JENNIFER
                        It’s come to your attention? How 
                        exactly? 

                                 JUDGE
                        Ms. Keller. Do you know what he’s 
                        referring to?

                                 JENNIFER
                        I sure do. We’ve uncovered Mattel’s 
                        history of using lawsuits to crush 
                        their competition dating back to 
                        their founding in the 1950s. The 
                        jury deserves to know the true 
                        nature of Mattel’s slimy business 
                        practices.

           She hands him the materials. The Judge reviews these. 

                                 JUDGE
                        I’ll take a look and we’ll resume 
                        when I have a ruling in the 
                        afternoon. 

           John and Jennifer walk out.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Did I see you show up in a rental? 
                        How’s your Bentley? 

           He smirks. 

                                 QUINN
                        Better than your case. 
           INT. HALLWAY - COURTHOUSE - DAY

                                 JENNIFER
                        The judge ruled against us. I can’t 
                        use any of the intel on Mattel’s 
                        heavy handed history.

           Isaac takes out his frustration on Jennifer. Max lurches in 
           the background.

                                 ISAAC
                        I can’t believe you were so naive 
                        as to think you could count on 
                        that?

                                 JENNIFER
                        I wasn’t counting on it. I was 
                        hoping he would see it my way. 
                        Quinn and his team play dirty, but 
                        it’s nothing we’re not prepared 
                        for.

           The Orrick team waits in the wings and watches a familiar 
           site: Isaac berating his counsel.

                                 ISAAC
                        Did I make a mistake? 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Isaac, this is why you hired me. If 
                        you don’t like what I have to say 
                        to the jury in my opening, send me 
                        packing.

                                 ISAAC
                        No more mistakes. 

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Everyone is seated. The Jury anxiously waits in the box.

                                 JUDGE
                        Ms. Keller will give her opening 
                        statement.

           Jennifer closes her notebook and stands up.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’m not going to lie to you, I’m 
                        probably not the ideal person to 
                        talk to you about dolls. I never 
                        played with dolls as a kid. I was a 
                        tomboy, still am. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                        The only thing I know about Barbie 
                        is that she was physically perfect, 
                        gigantic breasts, impossible 
                        proportions, she was every prom 
                        queen, every head cheerleader that 
                        bullied me in school. 
                            (beat)
                        I hated her. Bratz on the other 
                        hand: they’re pushy, loud, brash, 
                        not lady like at all. Loved them 
                        the second I saw them! 

           The Jury laughs.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        My client MGA, specifically Isaac 
                        Larian, had a vision.

           She walks over to Isaac. 

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        A different view of the world, 
                        through the eyes, the bulging eyes 
                        of the Bratz dolls. Freakish 
                        looking, a bit tawdry, imperfect. 
                        But isn’t that how we all are? A 
                        line of dolls that people of all 
                        shapes and sizes and colors could 
                        relate to. If they had Bratz dolls 
                        when I was growing up, I might have 
                        felt normal. Isaac put it out to 
                        the universe and the universe 
                        responded. Big time. Bratz quickly 
                        became the biggest toy in the 
                        world. 

           She walks over to Mattel’s table. 

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        But Mattel couldn’t have that. 
                        There’s too much at stake, too many 
                        billions on the line.

           Jennifer holds up a Barbie doll and shows it to the Jury.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        If Barbie fails, Mattel crashes and 
                        burns. But instead of innovating at 
                        any point in the past fifty years, 
                        they rested on their laurels. This 
                        is a Barbie from the 60s! And this 
                        is a Barbie today.

           Jennifer holds up an identical Barbie. 
                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        When Bratz blindsided them with a 
                        superior product, they resorted to 
                        the only measure they could, a 
                        lawsuit. I guess their brand slogan 
                        should be “if you can’t beat ‘em, 
                        sue.” They have the nerve to argue 
                        that the dolls named after Isaac 
                        Larian’s daughter belong to them. 
                        It’s an outrage. Simple bullying 
                        tactics, and I hope you do what I 
                        taught my niece to do when bullies 
                        come around. It’s time someone 
                        stands up to them. Thank you. 

           John Quinn rises out of his seat, fusses with his tie. He 
           takes a deep breath.

                                 QUINN
                        This case is about achieving the 
                        American dream. Long before MGA, 
                        Mattel was once a small business 
                        that grew from nothing to the 
                        biggest toy company in the world. 
                        But it’s so much more than that. 
                        Barbie is a cultural icon. 
                        Something that women have been able 
                        to share with their children for 
                        decades. It’s a ritual that is part 
                        of the fabric of this great 
                        country. Does that mean Mattel 
                        shouldn’t have competitors? Of 
                        course not. 

           John Quinn walks over to Jennifer and smiles.

                        But Ms. Keller will try to paint a 
                        picture of an evil empire. She’ll 
                        say that behind those innocent 
                        dolls lurks a beast ready to steal 
                        and pillage and plunder. 
                        Unfortunately for her, it’s pure 
                        fantasy. But there is one 
                        undeniable fact. 

           Quinn walks over to the jury box and leans in.

                        Carter Bryant, while working for 
                        Mattel, marched into Isaac Larian’s 
                        office and gave away company 
                        secrets in a backroom deal.
           John Quinn walks over towards Isaac.

                        MGA was a small company, no track 
                        record, struggling to make ends 
                        meet. They saw an opportunity and 
                        they took it. Who knows what any of 
                        us might have done in the same 
                        situation. But make no mistake, 
                        what they did was illegal under the 
                        terms of his work for hire 
                        agreement. 

           He walks by each end every juror for effect.

                        Carter Bryant entered into his 
                        contract with Mattel freely and for 
                        a good wage. You may not think it’s 
                        entirely fair, but the law says it 
                        is. We are a nation of laws. The 
                        law says MGA stole from Mattel. I 
                        ask you to speak loudly to them and 
                        say “thieves do not get rewarded in 
                        this country!” Thank you.

           INT. COURT ROOM - DAY

           Jennifer questions TOM HASKEL, 50s, buyer for Kohl’s 
           department store. Allison, Kay and Michaela sit at her table 
           taking notes.

                                 JENNIFER
                        How much inventory of Bratz 
                        products did you purchase in 2003? 

                                 TOM
                        Around three million dollars.

                                 JENNIFER
                        And how much did you purchase in 
                        2004?

                                 TOM
                        None.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’m sorry, I must not have heard 
                        you correctly. Did you say none? As 
                        in zero dollars?

                                 TOM
                        Correct.
                                 JENNIFER
                        Were people not buying Bratz? 
                        Because as I recall it was the 
                        number one toy in the country.

                                 TOM
                        They were. I just thought it was a 
                        fad, and I didn’t want to be stuck 
                        with millions of dollars of dead 
                        inventory.

           Jennifer nods her head and looks at the jury.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Hmm, that’s a drastic move. Did you 
                        really think they were going to 
                        sell zero dollars worth in 2004? 

                                 TOM
                        I didn’t think it was a fit for our 
                        store.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Did you feel bad when they sold 
                        more than any other toy the next 
                        year? Whoopsie, kinda missed the 
                        mark there.

                                 TOM
                        Not really. We did fine.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Of course you did. Because you were 
                        financially incentivized by Mattel 
                        to remove Bratz from their shelves, 
                        weren’t you? 

                                 TOM
                        That’s not why we did it.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Well, how much in incentives did 
                        Mattel offer? A couple of grand?

                                 TOM
                        Three million dollars.

           The Jury clearly registers the blow that Jennifer landed. Tom 
           tries to defend his actions.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                            (to Jury)
                        I assure you there’s nothing shady 
                        about this. It’s industry standard.
                                 JENNIFER
                        That might fly in your house, but 
                        it’s not gonna fly in mine. See, I 
                        have a niece, and when I take her 
                        to a toy store, they better have 
                        what I promised her. Have you ever 
                        been in a house with a pissed off 
                        pre-teen? Nevermind. Clearly not. 
                        Nothing further. 

           The Jury laughs. John Quinn rises from his chair.

                                 QUINN
                        Let’s go back a few years, do you 
                        recall any newer toy companies 
                        offering you incentives to get on 
                        the shelf for the first time?

                                 TOM
                        Yes, that happens a lot too.

                                 QUINN
                        And when you do that, doesn’t it 
                        sort of screw over the company 
                        whose toy you have to remove?

                                 TOM
                        That’s the nature of the beast.

                                 QUINN
                        So nobody is really an innocent 
                        victim in this universe?

                                 TOM
                        This is not the right business to 
                        play victim.

                                 QUINN
                        Did MGA ever offer you incentives 
                        to get shelf space?

                                 TOM
                        They sure did. In 2001, Isaac 
                        practically begged me, and offered 
                        to sell the products to me at a 
                        loss. It was huge financial 
                        windfall for us.

                                 QUINN
                        So you threw another toy off the 
                        shelf to make room for Bratz.

                                 TOM
                        I did.
                                 QUINN
                        Sounds like a raw deal for that 
                        other company.

           Jennifer gets up for re-direct.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Well, we’ve established that you 
                        have a different moral compass than 
                        the rest of us, but that doesn’t 
                        change a simple fact. Other than 
                        Bratz, can you recall another time 
                        where you moved the number one 
                        selling toy in the country from 
                        your store?

                                 TOM
                        This was a unique circumstance.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’ll say. Nothing further.

           Isaac pumps his fist. Jennifer motions for him to settle 
           down.

           INT. JENNIFER KELLER’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Jennifer rushes to get out the door, slipping on her shoe as 
           she eats a piece of toast, while holding case files.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Aren’t you forgetting something? 

           Charlie looks at Suzie holding her backpack.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Dang. Can you take her? I can’t be 
                        late for court. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I also have to be in court.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Pretty please?

           Charlie looks at Suzie and smiles. Jennifer rushes out of the 
           house without waiting for an answer.

                                 CHARLIE
                            (to herself and Suzie)
                        Of course, whatever you need. 
           INT. COURTROOM - HALLWAY - DAY

           Jennifer, Isaac and Kay huddle up.

                                 ISAAC
                        It was a good start, but we need to 
                        hit much harder! We need to show 
                        Mattel’s true colors! 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Patience. That’s exactly what we’re 
                        doing. We can’t get Mattel’s 
                        litigious history exposed, so we’ll 
                        just keep hammering at their shady 
                        business practices.

           Kay looks at the Jurors, she seems to make eye contact with a 
           few diverse members.

                        Child. Proactive, young, scantily 
                        clad. Bratz was fresh, exciting, 
                        diverse. Barbie was stale.

                        diverse market, people who look 
                        like me?

           The Jurors look at each other confused.

                        It goes directly to the argument at 
                        the core of this case. Mattel’s

                        the market or demographics in a

                        changed for the better. Would you 
                        say Mattel has a positive 
                        reputation in the industry?

                                 PETER
                        Overall, I’d say it’s average. 

                                 QUINN
                        They pay their workers a fair wage, 
                        they have a diverse workforce, they 
                        are known for their charitable 
                        efforts around the world. I know 
                        you’re a witness for MGA but is it 
                        that difficult to admit people 
                        think highly of Mattel?

                                 PETER
                        They do. 

                                 QUINN
                        And what about MGA?

                                 PETER
                        Well, they did not have much of a 
                        reputation before Bratz came out.

                                 QUINN
                        Because they didn’t have a single 
                        hit toy. But isn’t it true Mr. 
                        Larian had a bit of a reputation 
                        within the industry?

                                 PETER
                        Yes.

                                 QUINN
                        How would you characterize that?
                                 KAY
                        Objection, speculation about Mr. 
                        Larian is beyond the scope. He’s 
                        not opining on the toy industry.

                                 QUINN
                        It’s absolutely within the purview 
                        of a twenty six year veteran to 
                        speak generally on the business 
                        reputation of these companies and 
                        their executives.

                                 JUDGE
                        Overruled.

                                 PETER
                            (grudgingly)
                        Mr. Larian was known to be 
                        temperamental and difficult to deal 
                        with. 

                                 QUINN
                        Wasn’t there in fact one incident 
                        that he was widely known for prior 
                        to the rise of the Bratz dolls?

                                 PETER
                        He bought his brother out of the 
                        company after a nasty fight.

                                 QUINN
                        Was that before or after Bratz 
                        launched?

                                 PETER
                        I believe it was before.

                                 QUINN
                        Right before Bratz made a billion 
                        dollars. That seems convenient. 
                        Nothing further. 

           Isaac seethes in the crowd.

           INT. JENNIFER KELLER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jennifer and Charlie sit on the couch watching TV with Suzie. 
           The phone rings. Jennifer picks up.

                                 JENNIFER 
                            (into phone)
                        I can’t. Can we move it to the 
                        afternoon? Fine, I’ll be there.
                                 CHARLIE
                        What was that?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Damn it. Court got moved up. It 
                        resumes tomorrow morning, the same 
                        time as the other hearing.

           Jennifer motions towards Suzie, trying not to arouse her 
           suspicion. 

                                 SUZIE
                        I know you’re talking about me.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Well, then I guess I’ll just tell 
                        everyone. I have a little meeting 
                        tomorrow morning to explain to a 
                        judge what a good job I’m doing and 
                        how well the three of us are 
                        getting along. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        The three of us?

           Charlie shakes her head.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Yes, the three of us. And I may 
                        need everyone in this house to 
                        support my claim that this is a 
                        very stable, loving household. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Can I talk to you in the kitchen?

                                 SUZIE
                        You’re in trouble.

                                 JENNIFER
                        No, I’m not.

                                 SUZIE
                        Whenever adults ask to talk in 
                        another room, they are in trouble.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

                                 CHARLIE
                        You want me to tell them that we 
                        are in a relationship? Is that 
                        what’s going on here?
                                 JENNIFER
                        It’s just to get us over this hump 
                        with CPS. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Wow. How can you be so good in a 
                        trial but so bad in person.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Can we not do this now? I’m under 
                        an immense amount of pressure. 

           INT. FAMILY COURT - DAY

           Jennifer stands before the FAMILY COURT JUDGE and looks at 
           her watch.

                                 FAMILY COURT JUDGE
                        Are we keeping you from a pressing 
                        matter?

                                 JENNIFER
                        No, your honor. There is nothing 
                        more important to me than making 
                        sure Suzie’s needs are being met. 

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Kay pulls up to the courthouse. She suddenly feels pain in 
           her stomach and hunches over. She pulls out her phone.

                                 KAY
                            (into Voicemail)
                        Allison, you’re gonna have to get 
                        them to postpone, I have to go to 
                        the doctor.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           The Judge looks at Allison, who’s standing alone, frazzled. 

                                 JUDGE
                        Are Ms. Keller or Ms. Simpson 
                        planning to join us today?

           Allison looks back at the door and shakes her head furiously 
           like a maniac.
                                 ALLISON
                        They...um, caught...food poisoning. 
                        I didn’t get it because I’ve built 
                        up an immunity to salmonella. I’m a 
                        chronic carrier. Like Typhoid Mary.

           The Jury laughs.

                                 JUDGE
                        Are you ready to proceed?

                                 ALLISON
                        Me? Oh no, no, no, no, no. 

                                 JUDGE
                        I won’t have the jurors time 
                        wasted. Your name is listed on the 
                        docket. Proceed!

           Allison looks towards the door. Michaela leans in.

                                 MICHAELA
                        Do you want me to question him? I 
                        took his deposition.

                                 ALLISON
                        And sabotage this case for us? I 
                        think not. 
                            (to Judge)
                        Allison Zigfeld, not ready to 
                        proceed, your honor. 

                                 JUDGE
                        Excuse me? 

                                 ALLISON
                        Respectfully, Judge, we are asking 
                        for a very brief one hour recess.

                                 JUDGE
                        Counsel, please approach.

           Allison timidly approaches the bench.

                                 JUDGE (CONT’D)
                        I understand you are a boutique 
                        firm of three distinguished young 
                        women, but if you expect to be 
                        treated like everyone else, you 
                        need to play by the same rules. 

                                 ALLISON
                        I’m not asking for a special favor, 
                        your Honor. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALLISON (CONT'D)
                        I’m asking because I have multiple 
                        disorders recognized by the DSM 
                        Four: anxiety disorder, 
                        glossophobia, it’s a fear of public 
                        speaking, and a whiff of autism. 
                        You would be setting yourself up 
                        for an appeal on the grounds of 
                        ineffective assistance of counsel. 

                                 JUDGE
                            (smiles)
                        Well, I have to say, that is a 
                        novel argument, usually reserved 
                        for criminal trials. But I’ll just 
                        as soon continue...seeing as how 
                        Ms. Keller has finally decided we 
                        are worthy of her presence.

           Jennifer fumbles with her heel as she gets to her table. 

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Jennifer questions a witness, GARY JANUS, Head of Security 
           for Mattel, 50s, heavy set. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Please state your name and title 
                        for the record?

                                 GARY
                        Gary Janus. Head of global security 
                        for Mattel.

                                 JENNIFER
                        And in your role, is it typical to 
                        attend trade shows?

                                 GARY
                        From time to time.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Have you ever heard of anyone 
                        attempting to sneak into another 
                        companies trade booth using a fake 
                        ID? 

                                 GARY
                        I don’t recall.

                                 JENNIFER
                        You don’t recall? That seems like 
                        something you’d remember. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                        I’d like to enter into evidence 
                        Exhibit 412, 413 and 414. 

           Jennifer holds up a laminated badge. 

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Do you recognize this?

           Gary tries not to look at it. Jennifer presents Gary a fake 
           business card.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Or this?

           Gary still ignores her. Jennifer pulls out a plastic bag with 
           a mustache in it.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Surely you’d remember wearing a 
                        fake mustache to sneak into a trade 
                        fair.

                                 GARY
                        I don’t recall.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Right, just like I don’t recall 
                        where I was when I lost my 
                        virginity. Nothing further.

           John Quinn gets up.

                                 QUINN
                        As an employee of Mattel, have you 
                        also ever witnessed any other 
                        companies trying to sneak into one 
                        of your events?

                        Do you recognize this badge. 
                            (off Gary’s nod)
                        Who does it belong to?

           Quinn holds up a laminated badge and walks it up to Gary.

                        It was an MGA employee who tried to 
                        sneak into one of our trade shows 
                        and got nailed.
                                 QUINN
                        So I guess MGA probably thinks 
                        what’s good for the goose is good 
                        for the gander.

                        You lawyers and your cliches. I’d 
                        say all is fair in love and war. 

                                 QUINN
                        I don’t agree. And neither does my 
                        client. 

           Quinn goes on the offensive towards his client’s own 
           employee. His tone turns sharp.

                        MGA executives may be completely ok 
                        with their employees engaging in 
                        illicit activities, but Mattel 
                        prides themselves on doing things 
                        to the letter of the law!

                        It’s an internal memo directed at 
                        the entire company demanding that 
                        we not engage in any espionage

                        Come on, this was directed at you, 
                        wasn’t it? Isn’t it true that the 
                        only recorded instructions you ever 
                        received from Mattel’s executives 
                        was not to engage in this conduct 
                        and that you ended up getting 
                        demoted? 

                                 GARY
                        Yes.

                        Nothing further.

           EXT. COURT HALLWAY - DAY

           Jennifer stands and takes a verbal assault from Isaac.

                                 ISAAC
                        Where the hell were you? Or Kay? 

                                 JENNIFER
                        You hired the entire firm. Kay had 
                        a medical emergency. Allison had it 
                        under control.

                                 ISAAC
                        She’s unwell.

                                 JENNIFER
                        She’s not unwell, she’s...quirky. 
                        We didn’t miss a beat.

                                 ISAAC
                        You’re not even going to tell me 
                        where you were? I think I deserve 
                        that.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I had a family emergency. 

                                 ISAAC
                        From now until we win this case, 
                        this is your family. If you can’t 
                        find a baby-sitter, you bring Suzie 
                        and have her sit with us.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Fine. But if there’s any more dirty 
                        deeds in your closet, I need to 
                        know. We’re going for David vs. 
                        Goliath, not Spy vs. Spy here. 

                                 ISAAC
                        You need to put me on the witness 
                        stand so I can tell my story. Isn’t 
                        that what you said we needed?

                                 JENNIFER
                        We are telling your story. You 
                        can’t even control your emotions 
                        here with me. John Quinn will make 
                        you look like the bad guy. 

                                 ISAAC
                        I can handle him. If I’m going to 
                        go down, I will go down swinging. 
                                 JENNIFER
                        Who said anything about going down?

           INT. KELLER SIMPSON OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE ON TV: 

                                 REPORTER 
                        We’re outside the LA courthouse 
                        where jurors are hearing arguments 
                        in one of the biggest cases of the 
                        new millennium. Nicknamed the “Doll 
                        Wars” it’s a fight over the teen 
                        toy aisle and whether Bratz will be 
                        shut down, destroying the biggest 
                        rival to Barbie ever. So far, the 
                        biggest surprise is the choice of 
                        counsel. MGA hired a small, 
                        untested firm. Keller Simpson. 
                        After getting burned in the prior 
                        case, we’ll see if the gamble pays 
                        off.

           Jennifer shuts off the TV and looks at Kay and Allison who 
           are busy sifting through evidence. Michaela sits at another 
           table researching as well. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Kay, everything good with the baby?

                                 KAY
                        All good. A little scare is all. 
                        We’re just lucky Allison saved the 
                        day.

                                 ALLISON
                        All I did was stall for five 
                        minutes.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Yeah, but you stalled for five 
                        minutes in open court against John 
                        Motherfucking Quinn. 

           Allison lights up.

                                 ALLISON
                        I stalled in open court! In front 
                        of other homo sapiens. I did pee 
                        myself a tiny bit, but I don’t 
                        think anyone saw.
                                 JENNIFER
                        I’m damn proud of you.
                            (joking)
                        Maybe we should make you lead 
                        counsel.

                                 ALLISON
                        Don’t ever do that to me again or 
                        I’ll quit. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        I promise I will be there every 
                        step of the way from now on. 
                            (beat)
                        We need to dig deeper. If you were 
                        going to sabotage a rival 
                        dollmaker, what would you do?  

                                 ALLISON
                        I used to light my Barbie’s hair on 
                        fire. 

                                 KAY
                        As a young black teen, that stupid 
                        stick straight golden hair, always 
                        made me feel insecure. Ooh, I was 
                        more of a rip her head off girl.

           They look at Michaela. Carter Bryant walks into their office 
           and sees them all deep in conversation. Nobody clocks him, so 
           he just stands behind them as they chat.

                                 MICHAELA
                        I used to wrap a napkin around her 
                        like it was a wedding dress.

                                 JENNIFER
                        How is any of this helpful?

           They wait for her to dish. 

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        I would strip her naked and make 
                        her play with Jem.

                                 CARTER
                        I used to do the same thing.

           Allison spits out the lo mein she was chewing on. 

                                 CARTER (CONT’D)
                        But with Ken and He-Man.
                                 JENNIFER
                            (shocked)
                        Carter. When did you? Are you?

                                 CARTER
                        Just now. And yes. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        I can’t tell you how good it is to 
                        see you. This is Kay and Allison 
                        and that’s Tits Mcgh---Michaela.

                                 KAY
                        I love your work, Carter. You don’t 
                        know what it’s like to have those 
                        dolls on the shelf, for my daughter 
                        to be able to pick out a Bratz if 
                        she wants. 

                                 CARTER
                        Unless they lift the injunction, 
                        she may never get that chance.

                                 JENNIFER
                        You know Quinn is going to come at 
                        you hard if you do this? He’ll bait 
                        you and say awful things about you 
                        and you have to keep your cool.

                                 CARTER
                        I don’t know if I’ll be able 
                        to...but I’m willing to try. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        I believe in you. 
                            (beat)
                        What made you change your mind? 

                                 CARTER
                        If they win, that means Bratz is 
                        gone forever. I’m over living in a 
                        Barbie world. And I hate that 
                        fucking song!

           INT. JENNIFER KELLER’S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

           Charlie lays in bed with Jennifer. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You think Carter will hold up.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I don’t know. He’s a basket case.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Speaking of basket cases, how are 
                        you holding up?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Funny. The court didn’t outright 
                        rule I’m a danger to Suzie but I 
                        still don’t know if CPS is going to 
                        file a petition against me. I could 
                        actually lose her. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        They won’t. And you won’t.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Am I really cut out for all this? 
                        Trying to be a great lawyer, it 
                        takes everything I have. I can’t 
                        fail or I’m back to square zero. 
                        But I can’t lose Suzie either. 
                        That’s all that matters to me.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes, those two things are all that 
                        matter. 

           Jennifer turns towards Charlie. She’s clearly upset.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Oh Charlie. I’m such a shit. 
                        Obviously, I took it for granted 
                        that you know how I feel.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Take for granted is definitely the 
                        right phrase.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I know I’m not great at saying it. 
                        You mean a hell of a lot to me. I 
                        want to be in this together. All 
                        the time. Move in with us? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nice hallmark moment.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I mean it.

           Charlie gets out of bed and hurriedly gets dressed.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Bullshit. You never wanted anything 
                        more than a casual fling. I tried.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                        Many times. But now you need me. As 
                        a support, as a baby-sitter. I’m 
                        not your crutch.

                                 JENNIFER
                        That’s not how I see you. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes it is. But you know what, I 
                        don’t want to add extra drama to 
                        your life right now. 

           Charlie leaves.

                                 JENNIFER
                            (to herself)
                        Then don’t. 

           Jennifer puts the pillow over her face and mutters into it.

           INT. COURT ROOM - DAY

           Jennifer stands close to Carter, who’s in the witness box. 
           He’s dressed in a baggy t-shirt, unshaven. He looks awful.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I understand these last few years 
                        have been pretty hard on you. 

                                 CARTER
                        Yes they have.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’m truly sorry for how it all 
                        worked out, Carter. Let’s go back 
                        to a happier time. What did you 
                        want to be when you grew up?

           Carter closes his eyes for a second and then opens them.

                                 CARTER
                        My mom bought me a sewing kit when 
                        I was seven and I never looked 
                        back.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Were you excited when you were 
                        hired by Mattel?
                                 CARTER
                        It was the greatest day of my life. 
                        I always dreamed of being in 
                        Barbie’s car, of course, not with 
                        Barbie. But Ken. 

           He chuckles at his joke. The GALLERY does as well. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        You worked your way up there pretty 
                        quickly.

                                 CARTER
                            (proudly)
                        I was the youngest head designer in 
                        the entire Barbie line.

                                 JENNIFER
                        But then according to opposing 
                        counsel, you abruptly decided to 
                        quit and move home and create the 
                        Bratz line?

                                 CARTER
                        I didn’t abruptly do anything. I 
                        was miserable for a long time. I 
                        begged them to try new things. Any 
                        shred of creativity was shut down. 
                        So I walked away. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Was that easy for you?

                                 CARTER
                        It killed me to leave my dream job.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Would you say you have lost 
                        everything since the first case?

                                 CARTER
                        My boyfriend, my bank account and 
                        my sanity, but I still have my 
                        mom’s basement. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Still have your talent?

           Carter takes a breath and closes his eyes.

                                 CARTER
                        Who knows.
                                 JENNIFER
                        And the reason you don’t know is 
                        because no other toy maker would 
                        hire you right now. You’re kind of 
                        toxic?

                                 CARTER
                        It sure feels that way. 

           She walks over towards the jurors.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Let’s talk about the summer of 
                        1998. Great year, wasn’t it? 

                                 CARTER
                        Spice Girls, Shakira, Dixie Chicks. 
                        The iMac! Titanic.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Don’t forget Ally Mcbeal.
                        She’s my spirit animal. So you took 
                        time off, why?

                                 CARTER
                        A sabbatical is the corporate 
                        jargon. I was burnt out.

                                 JENNIFER
                        So what did you do during that 
                        sabbatical?

                                 CARTER
                        I went home to Missouri.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Did you do any work during that 
                        time?

                                 CARTER
                        I just sort of let myself take the 
                        world in again, trying to get 
                        inspired.

                                 JENNIFER
                        And did you?

                                 CARTER
                            (gets animated)
                        Yes. I saw these girls at my old 
                        high school, and it was nothing 
                        like the cruel monotony of what I 
                        endured there. It was diverse and 
                        they were brash. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CARTER (CONT'D)
                        I had this epiphany. I was like 
                        holy hell, there’s nothing out 
                        there that looks like them.

                                 JENNIFER
                        So what did you do next?

                                 CARTER
                            (passionately)
                        I raced home, and dusted off my 
                        sewing kid and just started 
                        drawing, cutting, stitching, 
                        Frankenstein-ing a bunch of parts 
                        together and voila, Bratz was born. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        That’s beautiful. No more 
                        questions.

           John Quinn drops his note pad. 

                                 QUINN
                        I’m sorry to hear about your 
                        troubles, Mr. Carter. I too 
                        sometimes need to unplug. I’m a big 
                        mountain biker. I draw inspiration 
                        from towering above the top of a 
                        mountain. However, if my hobby was 
                        writing legal briefs for another 
                        law firm in my spare time while I 
                        was under contract with my law 
                        firm, I don’t think they would take 
                        too kindly to that, do you?

                                 CARTER
                        I’m sure they wouldn’t.

                                 QUINN
                        So how is your situation any 
                        different? You were under contract 
                        with Mattel, weren’t you?

                                 CARTER
                        Well, yes, technically.

                                 QUINN
                        There is no technically. You were 
                        under contract. Period.

                                 CARTER
                        I was on a break.
                                 QUINN
                        It’s called a sabbatical because 
                        words have meaning. This isn’t like 
                        taking a break from a significant 
                        other to fool around.

                                 CARTER
                        They were stifling me.

                                 QUINN
                        Stifling you? You skyrocketed 
                        through the company. If that’s 
                        stifling, maybe I should stifle 
                        some of my associates. 

           The JURORS chuckle. 

                                 CARTER
                            (breaking down)
                        They had no vision.

                                 QUINN
                        Didn’t they? 

                                 CARTER
                        What is that supposed to mean?

                                 QUINN
                        They had the vision to hire you! 
                        Did you ever bring your new 
                        creation to anyone at Mattel?

                                 CARTER
                        No?

                                 QUINN
                        Not even a friend? Not even a 
                        trusted associate?

                                 CARTER
                        I knew they wouldn’t go for it.

                                 QUINN
                        So the company that did everything 
                        you asked, promoted you three 
                        times, let you go on sabbatical, 
                        didn’t deserve to at least see your 
                        creation? The one you were 
                        contractually obligated to bring to 
                        them? 

                                 CARTER
                        They just didn’t get it. And 
                        neither do you!
                                 QUINN
                        Oh I think I do. How much have you 
                        been paid to date on Bratz in 
                        royalties?

                                 CARTER
                        I don’t know.

                                 QUINN
                        Excuse me?

                                 CARTER
                        I said I don’t know. 

                                 QUINN
                        I do. It was FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. 

                                 CARTER
                        Could be.

                                 QUINN
                        And how much was your salary at 
                        Mattel?

                                 CARTER
                        One hundred and ten thousand 
                        dollars a year.

                                 QUINN
                        I’d say you had five million 
                        reasons to betray Mattel.

                                 CARTER
                        I just wanted to make people happy. 

                                 QUINN
                        Is it true you recently spent time 
                        in a mental institution? 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Objection.

                                 QUINN
                        She opened the door wide asking 
                        about his mental state.

                                 JUDGE
                        Sustained. But let’s get somewhere 
                        quickly.

                                 CARTER
                        Yes, I was in a loony bin! I’m 
                        crazy! 
                                 QUINN
                        I don’t think it’s crazy to seek 
                        help. Are you seeking help for your 
                        drug addiction as well? 

                                 CARTER
                        I’m clean if that’s what you’re 
                        asking.

           Carter breaks down. John Quinn hands him a handkerchief and 
           then goes in for the kill. 

                                 QUINN
                        Is it true you burned through all 
                        of the money? 

                                 CARTER
                        So?

                                 QUINN
                        So if Mattel wins, you won’t 
                        receive any more royalties, 
                        correct? 

                                 CARTER
                        I’m not doing this for the money!
                            (to Jury)
                        I didn’t do anything wrong.

                                 QUINN
                        Nothing further your honor. 

                                 JUDGE
                        Ms. Keller?

           Jennifer looks at Carter and shakes her head no to the Judge. 
           Carter mouths “I’m sorry” to her. Kay leans into Jennifer.

                                 KAY
                        You know the jury is gonna be 
                        thinking about that $5 million.

                                 JENNIFER
                        The jury heard his story. We don’t 
                        need to cause him any more pain. 

           INT. ISAAC LARIAN’S OFFICE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Isaac sits next to Jennifer and Max. 

                                 ISAAC
                        Damn it, why didn’t you follow up 
                        with Carter?
                                 JENNIFER
                        I took a calculated risk that they 
                        will see him as sympathetic.

                                 ISAAC
                        Your move backfired! Again!  

                                 JENNIFER
                        I disagree. I’m showing Mattel and 
                        Barbie for what they truly are. 
                        Monsters.

                                 ISAAC
                        So, what’s the next move?

                                 JENNIFER
                        I didn’t call this meeting, I 
                        thought you did?

           Michaela walks in. Bob Eckert and John Quinn linger in the 
           hallway.

                                 MICHAELA
                        Isaac, after today, I thought it 
                        made sense to have some preliminary 
                        discussions about alternatives.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Alternatives? You mean a 
                        settlement. Jesus, you really are 
                        spineless.

                                 MICHAELA
                        I’m just not stupid. You kept me on 
                        the payroll to help you, Isaac. 
                        Please hear them out.

           Isaac nods. Bob Eckert and John Quinn walk in and sit. 

                                 BOB
                        What you’ve built here, there’s no 
                        denying it’s impressive. Your 
                        margins are high, no union 
                        problems. It would be a really 
                        clean value add for us. 

                                 ISAAC
                        Value add? I thought you came here 
                        to discuss a settlement.

                                 BOB
                        And what better way to settle? We’d 
                        like to buy your company. 
           Bob has a shit eating grin. Isaac’s face looks like it’s 
           going to burst into flames. John Quinn slides the check 
           across the table. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        That’s six hundred million dollars! 
                        As I understand it you came to our 
                        country with almost nothing. It’s 
                        an incredible rags to riches story. 
                        Now it has a happy ending. It’s not 
                        personal, just business. 

           Bob puts his hand out.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Do we have a deal?

           Isaac looks to Michaela. She can’t hide her desperation to 
           have this case behind them. Isaac looks at Jennifer.

                                 ISAAC
                        Can we have the room for a minute?

           Everyone exits, except Jennifer, Max, Isaac and Michaela.

                                 ISAAC (CONT’D)
                        Would you excuse us? I already know 
                        where you stand.

           Michaela grudgingly leaves. 

                                 MAX
                        It’s a tremendous offer. You could 
                        do anything you want with this.

                                 ISAAC
                        Except start a new toy company. 

                                 MAX
                        Naturally, it comes with an 
                        ironclad non-compete.

                                 ISAAC
                        What would you do?

                                 JENNIFER
                        I know things are looking grim 
                        right now, but I believe in what we 
                        are doing. 

                                 ISAAC
                        Do you believe in yourself?
                                 JENNIFER
                        I do. On the other hand, I would 
                        also feel terrible--

                                 ISAAC
                        If I walked away from six hundred 
                        million dollars? 

                                 MAX
                            (to Jennifer)
                        I brought you in here because I 
                        trusted your judgment.

                                 JENNIFER
                        He’s right, Isaac. There’s a lot of 
                        good you could do with that money.  

                                 ISAAC
                        And you’ll make millions if we 
                        settle right now. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        I thought you knew I wasn’t doing 
                        this for the money.

                                 ISAAC
                        I thought you knew I wasn’t either!  

                                 MAX
                            (begging)
                        Isaac, this is the deal of a 
                        lifetime. 

           Isaac sits silently for a minute.

                                 ISAAC
                        Okay. I’ll take it--

                                 MAX
                        You’re doing the right--

                                 ISAAC
                        If Jennifer tells me to.

                                 MAX
                        Isaac, please. Think about your 
                        family.

                                 ISAAC
                        I always think of my family!  
                        Jennifer, what do you say? 

           The gravity of the situation weighs on Jennifer. Isaac locks 
           eyes with her. She doesn’t say a word.
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Everyone is seated as they were before.

                                 BOB
                        That was quick. Maybe I shouldn’t 
                        have written down such a large 
                        number. Overplayed my hand.

           Bob smirks. Quinn nudges him to shut him up.

                                 ISAAC
                        I’ve had a lot of great days since 
                        I started this company. The day my 
                        Jasmin was born, I was hocking 
                        Nintendo game boy accessories. The 
                        day I got to name Bratz after her. 
                        That was a good day too.

           He points to a framed photo of himself in Toy Quarterly.

                                 BOB
                        I’m sure you deserved it.

                                 ISAAC
                        It’s better than Forbes in my book. 
                        But you wouldn’t know that because 
                        your last job was as a cheese CEO.

                                 BOB
                        Kraft Foods, Dairy division. Before 
                        that Nestle, Mars, Pepsi, Krogers. 
                        I know what I need to know about 
                        toys now. What I know is that 
                        Mattel and Bratz need to join 
                        forces. 

                                 ISAAC
                        I agree.

                                 BOB
                        Fantastic. I knew you’d come to 
                        your senses.

           Bob puts out his hand to shake it.

                                 ISAAC
                        I’ll buy Mattel. 

           Bob starts laughing. Quinn has a look of disgust on his face.
                                 ISAAC (CONT’D)
                        Barbie is really the only 
                        successful product in your entire 
                        arsenal. 

                                 BOB
                        You know goddamn well you don’t 
                        have that kind of money.

                                 ISAAC
                        I’ll borrow it. I’ll come up with 
                        the next Bratz. Whatever it takes. 
                        But the one thing I’m not doing is 
                        selling my dream to a man with no 
                        vision.

                                 QUINN
                        You’re making a major mistake. Your 
                        case is dead in the water. Or did 
                        you not see what happened today?

                                 ISAAC
                        I saw it. But see my attorney, Ms. 
                        Keller, she’s just getting warmed 
                        up. Get the hell out of my office. 

                                 BOB
                        Goddamn amateurs, we’re going to 
                        destroy your pissant little 
                        company.

           They walk out and Bob slams the door.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I don’t think we’re getting invited 
                        to their Christmas party. 

           Isaac starts laughing. 

                                 MICHAELA
                        I’m sorry. That was a mistake. 

                                 ISAAC
                        The only mistake was hiring you in 
                        the first place. You’re fired. 

           Michaela walks out. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        It’s not her fault. She’s actually 
                        been a big help. She was only doing 
                        what a rational person would do. 
                        Unfortunately, you and I, we act 
                        from here.
           She points to her heart. Isaac stares at Jennifer.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        It’s time to show them who you are.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Isaac shifts in the witness box. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        How much money did you come to this

                        In it, you say that you came up 
                        with the idea for Bratz. There’s no 
                        mention of Carter Bryant. I find

                        a story. I thought it would make 
                        for a good story if I told people I 
                        came up with the idea and modeled 
                        it after my Jasmin. I did name it 
                        after her. That’s true.

                        up in your office with a full 
                        formed doll as he told us or not?

                        Well, yes, but it still needed 
                        work. Also, a doll needs to be

                        success was corporate 
                        restructuring? Laying off 
                        employees?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Let’s talk about antitrust laws put 
                        in place to prevent monopolies and 
                        cartels?

                                 BOB
                        We are neither a monopoly or a 
                        cartel.

                                 JENNIFER
                        What would you call strong arming 
                        retailers not to carry rival 
                        products? 

                                 BOB
                        I’m not aware of any such 
                        activities. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Have you ever discussed killing 
                        deals with licensees who were doing 
                        business with MGA?

                                 BOB
                        Every CEO does what’s best for 
                        their company. Let’s not be naive. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        So you consider it to be an act of 
                        integrity to sabotage a rival?
                                 BOB
                        That’s not sabotage, that’s 
                        business.

                                 JENNIFER
                        How about buying every ounce of 
                        Saran doll hair from the only 
                        manufacturer in the world, so your 
                        rival literally can’t make dolls. 
                        Trying to make Bratz go bald! 

                                 BOB
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.

           Jennifer gets close to Bob and hands him the Saran document 
           that Allison found.

                                 JENNIFER
                        It seems to me there are two 
                        possibilities here, Bob. You’re 
                        either lying and you knew about and 
                        condoned it...or you’re 
                        incompetent. Which is it? Dirty or 
                        dumb?

                        Sustained. Watch it, Ms. Keller.

                                 BOB
                        I’ve been at the top of my 
                        profession for 30 years, I’m ranked 
                        in Forbes as a leading CEO, how 
                        about you?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Me? Nobody has ever heard of me. I 
                        spent my career grinding it out 
                        representing the voiceless. So, I 
                        guess you got me there. 
                            (beat)
                        Why don’t we move on to the concept 
                        of work for hire. Do you believe 
                        that when an employee signs the 
                        agreement with Mattel, that Mattel 
                        has a right to all of their work 
                        product?

                                 BOB
                        Naturally. I thought you were 
                        familiar with corporate law.
                                 JENNIFER
                        Enlighten me. What about things 
                        they don’t write down?

                                 BOB
                        Ideas are specifically included in 
                        the contract for a reason.

                                 JENNIFER
                        What about work they do on the 
                        weekends, outside of the scope of 
                        employment?

                                 BOB
                        If they are related to their job as 
                        a toymaker, absolutely.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I can get onboard with that. What 
                        about if they came up with the idea 
                        a year ago, before they started at 
                        Mattel but then started to work on 
                        it again while working at Mattel.

                                 BOB
                        Yes. We own that.

                                 JENNIFER
                        What about five years ago?

                                 BOB
                        I’d say yes.

           The Jurors look surprised.

                                 JENNIFER
                        What about if a designer came up 
                        with a wild idea when they were 
                        eight years old, stuck it in a draw 
                        for twenty years, glanced at it 
                        while working for Mattel, then left 
                        to create a doll based on that idea 
                        they had as a little boy. Would 
                        Mattel own that intellectual 
                        property? Yes or no.

           Bob Eckert pauses.

                                 QUINN
                        Objection, calls for speculation.

                        I’d like to know where he thinks 
                        the line should be drawn.
                                 JUDGE
                        Overruled.

                                 BOB
                        If the contract is ironclad.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’m sorry, was that a yes to owning 
                        the ideas of an eight year old?

           There is an audible gasp from the Jury. 

                                 BOB
                        Well, not in every situa--

                                 JENNIFER
                        We get where you’re coming from. 

           The Judge looks at the clock. It says 4 PM.

                                 JUDGE
                        We’re going to break for the day

                        tomorrow. Jurors, you’re excused. 

           Jennifer walks back to the table and gives Kay a fist bump. 

           EXT. COUNTY FAIR - DAY

           Jennifer, Charlie and Suzie walk around a county fair. Suzie 
           eats a corndog, while Jennifer talks shop.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Thanks for coming.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m doing this for her. I promised 
                        we’d go to the fair.
                            (beat)
                        Any word from family court?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Radio silence. I guess that’s a 
                        good thing. 
                            (beat)
                        I’m sorry for taking you for 
                        granted. It wasn’t fair. Once this 
                        case is over, I’ll make it my 
                        mission to be more thoughtful.

                                 CHARLIE
                        There’s always gonna be more cases.
                                 JENNIFER
                        What are you saying, you don’t want 
                        to be with-- 

                                 CHARLIE
                            (smiling)
                        No, I’m saying I appreciate your 
                        apology, and I accept you for the 
                        flawed workaholic that you are. But 
                        also, when you win this case, we 
                        should start thinking about hiring 
                        a nanny. Or like a manny. We 
                        deserve a man servant. Down with 
                        the patriarchy!

                                 JENNIFER
                        I like the we part of that.

           Jennifer and Charlie kiss.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        But I don’t know about winning.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I thought you said you made Bob 
                        Eckert seem like a real weasel.

                                 JENNIFER
                        It’s not far enough. I have to show 
                        the jury that this guy is 
                        destroying a dream and he doesn’t 
                        even care. He knows absolutely 
                        diddly about the toy business. Bob 
                        Eckert may as well be selling 
                        cheese whiz.

           Suzie grabs Jennifer by the shirt. They come up to a game 
           called Matching Ducks. Jennifer hands Suzie a dollar. Suzie 
           bends down and picks up a duck. It has a brown hat. She picks 
           up another one. 

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Close, that one has a bowtie. See 
                        they have to be identical.

           Suzie puts it down and picks up another one. Jennifer stares 
           at the pond. Her eyes light up.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        We gotta go.

                                 SUZIE
                        But I didn’t get the matching duck.
           Jennifer bends down and grabs three of them at a time, 
           breaking the rules. All the other parents give her a look of 
           scorn. She hands Suzie two matching ducks to give to the 
           BARKER. She hands him $10 on the sly.

                                 BARKER
                        Congratulations. You won the big 
                        elephant! 

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Jennifer continues her questioning of Bob.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’d like to talk about the line you 
                        came out with this past year. The 
                        “Flavas” dolls. Tell me about that 
                        decision. 

                                 BOB
                        The market shifted. We reacted.

                                 JENNIFER
                        So let me get this straight, after 
                        you claimed that Bratz stole your 
                        IP, you went ahead and created a 
                        knock off of their doll? 

                                 BOB
                        We didn’t create a knock off of 
                        their doll. Barbie came out with a 
                        somewhat similar line. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Admit it, you ripped off Bratz. 
                        Because you knew you didn’t have a 
                        solid legal claim? 

                                 QUINN

                                 BOB
                        You’re reaching. I can smell the 
                        desperation on you. We all can.

                                 JUDGE
                        Anything further for this witness, 
                        Ms. Keller.
           Jennifer looks at John Quinn’s smug face and then turns and 
           goes for it.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’m sorry, where is my head today? 
                        I’d like to enter into the record 
                        Exhibit 2A.

           She pulls out a boxed doll. It’s in a Bratz box. She hands it 
           to Bob. He stares at it for a minute.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Do you know the name of this doll?

                                 BOB
                        I don’t.

                        You don’t?

                        I don’t make it a practice to 
                        memorize everyone of my competitors 
                        lines.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Really? I know the names of every 
                        partner I go up against. I know 
                        John Quinn loves to mountain bike, 
                        does iron mans, and owns a samurai 
                        sword that he scares the bejesus 
                        out of his associates with. Because 
                        that’s what competitors do.

                                 BOB
                        I know plenty about Bratz and 
                        Isaac. For instance, he sends 
                        people to sneak around and spy on 
                        competitors at toy fairs!

                                 JENNIFER
                        But you don’t know the name of this 
                        doll?

                                 BOB
                        I know it’s a Bratz doll.

                                 JENNIFER
                        You know it’s a Bratz. And how do 
                        you know that?

                                 BOB
                        Because I have eyes. 
           Jennifer walks over to the jury box. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Well, I have some bad news for you, 
                        Bob. That’s actually Mattel’s 
                        “Flavas” line. This is Spicy Sue. 

           There’s an audible gasp from the Jury. 

                                 BOB
                        What does that prove, that you’re 
                        capable of a dirty parlor trick?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Was that a trick? Some people know 
                        a fake when they see one. But you 
                        don’t because you don’t really care 
                        about the toy industry, isn’t that 
                        right?

                                 QUINN
                        Objection. Badgering. Are we here 
                        to insult a venerated Fortune 500 
                        CEO with an impeccable record?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Oh, there’s no doubt you’re the 
                        cheese king. But Isaac sleeps, eats 
                        and breathes toys. He named one 
                        after his daughter. Can you 
                        honestly tell me you care about 
                        toys the way he does?

                                 QUINN
                        Objection. This whole line of 
                        questioning is irrelevant. Don’t 
                        answer that.

                                 JUDGE
                        I’ll decide who answers what in my 
                        court room. 

                                 BOB
                        I’ll answer it. A great CEO’s job 
                        is to remove passion, make smart 
                        decisions. Isaac is a hotheaded 
                        thief and look where it got him. 
                        Carter Bryant signed a work for 
                        hire agreement and designed a

                                 JENNIFER
                        Well, you sure told us. 

           INT. ISAAC LARIAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Isaac has invited Jennifer, Charlie and Suzie over to have 
           dinner with his entire family. Suzie plays with Jasmin and 
           the kids in the den, while the adults eat and drink.

           Isaac starts to break down in tears. His wife, Angela, puts 
           her hand on his. Charlie holds Jennifer’s hand. 

                                 ISAAC
                        I can’t do it again. I’m not a 
                        young man. We’ll have to go to 
                        Arizona, buy a small condo and 
                        learn to golf or something.

                                 ANGELA
                        Even if we did that, he’d figure 
                        out a way to sell golf toys. 

           Jennifer and Charlie laugh. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        If we lose, I’ll have to go back to 
                        municipal court. You saw what it 
                        was like down there, it’s worse 
                        than any golf course in Arizona.

                                 ISAAC
                        This is true.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Gee thanks, guys. Maybe I should go 
                        work for Jennifer after she wins 
                        and you pay her a boatload of cash. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’d like that.

                                 ISAAC
                        Me too. 

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           The tension is palpable as Quinn gives his closing.

           INTERCUT WITH Jennifer’s closing.
                                 QUINN
                        You saw a lot of theatrics. On both 
                        sides. But it doesn’t change what 
                        this is really about at its core. A 
                        work for hire case. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        You can send a message to all the 
                        people who toil for minimum wage 
                        and let them know they won’t get 
                        screwed if they dare to be great. 

                                 QUINN
                        Carter Bryant rose up the ranks at 
                        Mattel. He was supported and loved 
                        and even given months to clear his 
                        head. Instead, he took that time to 
                        hatch a devious plot with Isaac 
                        Larian to cheat Mattel out of 
                        money. Lots of money. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Put yourself in Isaac Larian’s 
                        shoes. He worked his fingers to the 
                        bone to give his family a better 
                        life. He finally got the one chance 
                        that most immigrants never get and 
                        he ran with it. He ran so hard that 
                        he became the best toymaker in the 
                        world.

                                 QUINN
                        This isn’t good versus evil, this 
                        is a vengeful rich person asking 
                        regular folks to exact a price from 
                        Mattel because he couldn’t do it 
                        fair and square. Isaac’s a man who 
                        cut his brother out of the family 
                        business just as it was starting to 
                        take off. He’s no underdog! When 
                        this case is over win or lose, he 
                        goes back to his mansion. I ask 
                        that you not only make MGA pay, but 
                        Isaac Larian, hold him personally 
                        responsible for causing $1 billion 
                        in damages to Mattel. 

           The Jury soaks it all in. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Barbie had 50 years to do the right 
                        thing, and they squandered it.

                        of girls be boxed in, pardon the 
                        pun, I won’t be able to live it 
                        down, knowing that I had the chance 
                        to look twelve of my fellow 
                        citizens in the eye and ask them to 
                        put a stop to it. You see that man 
                        and his daughter right there. 
                            (points to Jasmin)
                        She knows that she can be anything 
                        she wants. All the kids out there 
                        who play with Bratz know that now. 
                        Hell, even Barbie knows it now. The 
                        world has changed. You have the 
                        power to prove it to Mattel, by 
                        awarding my clients justice.

           INT. MGA OFFICE - DAY

           HUNDREDS OF EMPLOYEES fill every crevice of the main floor. 
           Isaac stands on top of a desk to address everyone.

                                 WORKER 
                            (whispering)
                        I heard we’re filing for bankruptcy 
                        tomorrow.

                                 ISAAC
                        So many of you have been here since 
                        we sold Nintendo parts out of my 
                        garage. Even then, my ego and my 
                        temper was too big...
                            (off laughter)
                        ...but it was only because I 
                        believed in all of you, in what we 
                        were doing together. We took on the 
                        biggest behemoth to ever exist in 
                        the toy industry, and for a moment, 
                        we brought her to her knees. No one 
                        can take that from us.

           Some of the EMPLOYEES start to tear up. Isaac does as well.

                                 ISAAC (CONT’D)
                        I have let so many of you into my 
                        home and you have done the same for 
                        me. No matter what happens 
                        tomorrow, we will always be family. 

           They all give him a raucous applause. He wipes away tears.

           Jennifer drops Suzie off at school. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Have a great day. 

                                 SUZIE
                        Good luck, mom. I mean--

           Jennifer squeezes her really tight. Suzie runs into school. 
           Amanda, the young teacher, gives Jennifer a big smile. 
           Chantel, the Social Worker, walks up to her.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Is this a good visit or--

                                 CHANTEL
                        You missed part of the biggest case 
                        of your life and risked losing a 
                        billion dollars for that custody 
                        hearing. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        I would do anything for her. 

                                 CHANTEL
                        Don’t make me regret this. We are 
                        dismissing your case.

           Jennifer starts to break down in tears a little bit.

                                 CHANTEL (CONT’D)
                        Also, between you and me, it didn’t 
                        hurt that a pillar of the community 
                        spoke to the judge. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Isaac?

           Chantel walks away without answering.

           Quinn stares out from his office at the LA skyline.

           INT. KELLER SIMPSON - DAY

           Jennifer, Kay and Allison sit at their desks, anxiously.

                                 KAY
                        If they are taking this long, they 
                        could be calculated damages.

                                 JENNIFER
                        But for us or them?

                                 KAY
                        I consider it a win if they just 
                        lift the injunction. 

                                 ALLISON
                        I consider it a win that we got 
                        those free bagels.

           They all laugh. The phone rings. Jennifer picks up. She nods 
           and hangs up.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Anyone know any good prayers?

                                 ALLISON
                        Would you like an ancient native 
                        American rain dance, a 12th century 
                        Buddhist invocation for protection 
                        or my Jewish father’s prayer that 
                        he uses for the Dodgers?

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’ll take all three.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           A PACKED COURTHOUSE waits with baited breath. 

                                 JUDGE
                        Has the jury reached a verdict?

                                 JUROR
                        We have your honor.

           The Judge nods.
                                 JUROR (CONT’D)
                        On the matters regarding MGA 
                        culpability, on the question of 
                        copyright infringement, we find MGA 
                        not guilty. 

           Isaac claps his hands together in prayer.

                                 JUROR (CONT’D)
                        In the matter of tortious 
                        interference of Mattel’s employment 
                        contract with Carter Bryant, we 
                        find MGA guilty.

           Jennifer looks distraught. 

                                 JUROR (CONT’D)
                        We order MGA to pay Mattel in the 
                        amount of $10,000. 

           Jennifer smirks. Quinn looks exasperated. Isaac’s eyes well 
           up with tears of joy.

                                 JUDGE
                        Has the jury reached a verdict on 
                        the counterclaims against Mattel?

                                 JUROR
                        On the question of copyright 
                        infringement and trade secret 
                        misappropriation, we find Mattel 
                        guilty. We order them to pay MGA 
                        $300 million dollars plus attorneys 
                        fees and a reversal of the 
                        injunction. 

           The courtroom breaks out in CHEERS. The Judge bangs his 
           gavel. Everyone quiets down. John Quinn turns to Bob Eckert.

                                 QUINN
                        We’ll file an appeal in the 
                        morning.

                                 BOB
                        Do whatever you want. I’m already 
                        interviewing at Chick-fil-A.

           Isaac and Jennifer hug. Isaac’s Family sobs in the courtroom. 

           Jennifer walks up to Carter Bryant who was hiding in the back 
           of the courtroom. They embrace.

                                 CARTER
                        Thank you.
                                 JENNIFER
                        No, thank you. You’re free to start 
                        creating again.

                                 CARTER
                        Honestly, I’m just happy to be able 
                        to go outside again.

           INT. KELLER SIMPSON’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Jennifer, Kay and Allison are in full celebration mode. Empty 
           bottles of wine and Chinese food boxes are strewn about. 

                                 KAY
                        Don’t tell my baby girl I had a sip 
                        of wine at 8 months.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Hey, I barely survived a visit from 
                        child services so your secret is 
                        safe with me.

           They laugh. The place looks the same as before, except 
           there’s a giant blow up Barbie Doll, hung by a noose on the 
           ceiling fan.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Did you hear the one about the 
                        lesbian, black and the crackpot 
                        ...who toppled an empire.

           They toast. The phone rings. Allison picks it up.

                                 ALLISON
                        It’s John Quinn! He’s calling to 
                        congratulate you.

           She offers the phone of up to Jennifer. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        John, that’s quite magnanimous of 
                        you. Better luck next time. 

           Allison and Kay let out a giggle.

                                 QUINN
                        That’s not why I called. I called 
                        because I see a killer. You can 
                        come in as an equity partner, 
                        corner office. Bring your whole 
                        eccentric crew. 
                                 JENNIFER
                        Why would I do that?

                                 QUINN
                        Because this was a fluke. You are 
                        built for the big leagues, so why 
                        not capitalize on this moment?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Maybe I will. 

                                 QUINN
                        So you’ll consider it?

                                 JENNIFER
                        Don’t take this the wrong way, 
                        John. Or do. I find you repellent. 
                        Even if you hadn’t tried to fuck 
                        with my family, there’s no amount 
                        of money that would make me give up 
                        what we have here.

                                 QUINN
                        You got lucky. Bob Eckert is a 
                        cretin. And we always suspected 
                        that might turn a jury. In the 
                        grand scheme of things you’ll be 
                        forgotten. Companies aren’t going 
                        to beat down your door because of 
                        this one case. And if they did, 
                        they’d see what’s in your little 
                        mini-mall.

                                 JENNIFER
                        They sure would. They’d see we’ve 
                        got three fearless, brilliant women 
                        who kicked your ass. I’ll see you 
                        on the battlefield, Johnny Boy.

           She hangs up. Allison and Kay give her a look of admiration. 

           INT. JENNIFER KELLER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Isaac shows up with Jasmin. Jennifer has Suzie with her. 

                                 ISAAC
                        It’s a gift. My daughter made it 
                        for you. Girls, go play.

           The girls run off. Jennifer opens the box, it’s a Lawyer 
           Bratz named Jennifer, that is an exaggerated version of her.
                                 JENNIFER
                        I wish I had one of these as a kid.

                                 ISAAC
                        I’m sorry I was so harsh.

                                 JENNIFER
                        You had a lot on the line.

                                 ISAAC
                        You saved my company. My family. I 
                        owe you everything.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Nonsense. I owe you too. 

           She puts her hand on his.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        I know you made that call on my 
                        behalf. 

                                 ISAAC
                        I did what was right.

                                 JENNIFER
                        You also gave me a chance to become 
                        the lawyer I knew I could be. 

                                 ISAAC
                        When I heard you talk about me up 
                        there, it made me look into my 
                        soul. I want to be the person you 
                        described. 
                            (beat)
                        I am taking month long vacation 
                        around the world with my family to 
                        regain balance. And I’m going to 
                        try to release some of my anger. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Well deserved after this ordeal and 
                        maybe not the worst idea. But 
                        Isaac, something tells me you’re 
                        never going to become Zen. And 
                        neither will I.

                                 ISAAC
                        It’s not who we are. And it’s why 
                        we’re standing here. When I get 
                        back, we have plenty of other legal 
                        work for you.
                                 JENNIFER
                        I’m gonna need a bigger office. 

           Jennifer points to the stacks of boxes surrounding them.

           INT. MISSOURI - DAY

           Carter Bryant sits in front of a computer in his bedroom of 
           his parents house. He’s on eBay. There are dozens of sealed 
           boxes behind him.

           ON SCREEN - He hits “ACCEPT OFFER.” We see it’s for “ORIGINAL 
           BRATZ DOLLS - ENTIRE COLLECTION.”

           He closes one last brown box on his bed, containing dozens of 
           Bratz dolls. He then lays down on the ground, takes a deep 
           breath. That chapter of his life closed. 

           He wipes his tears, picks himself up and sits at a nearby 
           sewing machine. He grabs an old pair of jeans and starts 
           cutting furiously. Maybe we haven’t seen the last of Carter 
           Bryant. 

           INT. KELLER SIMPSON’S NEW OFFICE - DAY

           Jennifer walks in to see a bustling office, it’s much bigger, 
           not quite glamorous, but it’s not in a strip mall anymore.

           ASSOCIATES, PARALEGALS, and SECRETARIES mill about. KAY has 
           her own corner office, where she is breast-feeding her new 
           BABY GIRL. At this all female, powerhouse boutique, no one 
           has a problem with it. Allison walks up to Jennifer. 

                                 ALLISON
                        You have someone waiting in your 
                        office. I’ll give you a hint. She’s 
                        got an IQ of 142, a 36-24-34 body 
                        type, and she’s of Nordic descent.   

           Jennifer walks into her office and sees Michaela sitting 
           idly. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Didn’t think I’d be seeing you for 
                        a while. Should I alert security?

                                 MICHAELA
                        Actually, I’m here for a different 
                        reason.

           Michaela slides her resume across the table.
                                 JENNIFER
                        You wanna work for me?

                                 MICHAELA
                        No one is more surprised than I am. 
                        But I was blown away by you. I 
                        think we could complement each 
                        other. Did I mention I went to 
                        Harvard? 

           Jennifer ponders this unexpected turn.

                                 MICHAELA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry about how I acted. I’ve 
                        got anger issues, my therapists 
                        says I repress...everything.

                                 JENNIFER
                        I’m sorry, too. Don’t even get me 
                        started on my issues.

           They share a laugh.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        When can you start?

           Michaela offers her hand. Jennifer shakes it. 

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna have to introduce me 
                        to your facialist. 

           Michaela smiles and walks out.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        Can’t believe I’m hiring Lawyer 
                        Barbie. 

           She stares at Allison and the new and even more diverse team.

                                 JENNIFER (CONT’D)
                        But I guess I already have a bunch 
                        of Bratz.

           INT. JENNIFER KELLER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Suzie plays with dolls in her bedroom, while Jennifer and 
           Charlie watch from the doorway. Suzie talks to the dolls.

                                 SUZIE
                            (holding “Jennifer” Bratz)
                        I’m the best lawyer ever!
                            (as other Bratz)
                                 (MORE)
                                 SUZIE (CONT'D)
                        I’m gonna be lawyer when I grow up 
                        just like you mom.

           Jennifer almost breaks down in tears hearing Suzie call her 
           mom. Charlie kisses her on the cheek. 

                                 SUZIE (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to Disney world!

           Suzie puts the Bratz dolls in a little toy car. 

                                 JENNIFER
                        Are we really?

           EXT. HIGHWAY - PCH - DAY

           Jennifer and Charlie drive on the PCH with Suzie in the 
           backseat. The song BARBIE WORLD plays on the radio.

                                 JENNIFER
                        Oh hell no!

           She turns the dial to classic rock. They all start singing. 

                                 THE END
           CHYRON
