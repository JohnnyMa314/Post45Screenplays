           INT. DORA BISHOP’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           The basement of an old house, dusty and cluttered, lit by a 
           single hanging bulb that gently sways. 

           A human figure is on the floor. DORA BISHOP (27), a former 
           beauty queen, suddenly snaps awake with a GASP. As Dora 
           blinks, groggy, she realizes that her arms and ankles are 
           bound around a support column. 

           Dora SHRIEKS and violently struggles against the ropes. No 
           use. She SCREAMS at the top of her lungs for help.

           Nothing. Dora slumps back down and starts to sob.

           A NOISE. A SHADOWY FIGURE shifts in the darkness behind her. 
           Dora turns. The figure is looking for something on the 
           basement shelves. Dora’s eyes widen in terror.

                                 DORA
                             (whisper)
                        ...Who are you?

           The figure says nothing, continues rummaging.

                                 DORA (CONT’D)
                        What do you want from me?

           No answer.

                                 DORA (CONT’D)
                        Please. You can take anything. My 
                        bank card’s upstairs in my purse. 
                        My car keys are on the...

           Nothing. Dora loses it.

                                 DORA (CONT’D)
                        Why are you doing this? WHY ARE YOU 
                        DOING THIS? WHY?!

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        Why?
           At last, the figure finds what they’ve been searching for: a 
           gas can. Dora sees it glint in the dim light.

                                 DORA 
                        No.

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        Why did the killer use fire?

           The dark figure pulls the stopper and begins to splash gas 
           all over the floor around Dora, careful to not get any on 
           her.

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        After all, torching a house is 
                        hardly the most convenient way to 
                        kill someone. Especially in the 
                        state with the 3rd highest gun 
                        ownership rate in America.

                                 DORA
                             (sobbing)
                        Please don’t. Please don’t. Please 
                        don’t...

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        Fire was a choice.

           The dark figure steps forward into the light at last.

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        We can’t know what Dora Bishop saw 
                        that night.

           REVEAL: A man wearing a fetish dog mask made of glistening 
           black latex. Dora lets out an inhuman SCREAM of pure anguish.

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        We can’t know how she felt; how 
                        terrified she was in her final 
                        moments. But even though she’s 
                        gone, Dora can still tell us 
                        things...

           She begins to thrash and scream hysterically at the top of 
           her lungs again. The Dog-Masked Man pauses for a moment to 
           watch her flail helplessly. He puts down the gas can and 
           makes a “Shh” gesture with his finger. Dora doesn’t stop. 

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        Bruising on her forehead tells us 
                        that she was struck with a hard 
                        cylindrical object.
           THWIP. With a flick of his wrist the Dog-masked Man whips out 
           a telescoping baton. THUNK! He smashes Dora across the face 
           with it. Dora slumps and her screams become a low, ragged 
           moan. 

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        No such weapon was ever found at 
                        the crime scene.

           The Dog-Masked Man carefully folds his baton. Dora continues 
           to moan. The Dog-Masked Man cocks his head.

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        The .035 milligrams per liter of 
                        oxycodone the coroner found in her 
                        bloodstream tells us that, like so 
                        many others, Dora had a drug 
                        problem.

           The Dog-Masked Man inserts a syringe into a medical vial and 
           fills it with clear liquid. He flicks it. Once, twice. Then 
           he jams the syringe into Dora’s neck. She goes quiet. Her 
           breathing is barely audible now.

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        She was probably too high that 
                        night to even fight back.

           The Dog-Masked Man steps backward and strikes a match. It 
           burns for a moment between shiny black-gloved fingertips. 

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        Dora Lynn Bishop burned to death on 
                        the night of June 21st, 2015. That 
                        fire was a choice. 

           The Dog-masked Man flicks the match through the air. WHOOMP! 
           The gas ignites.

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        See, fire isn’t the easiest way to 
                        kill someone or dispose of a body.

           As the flames grow higher around Dora’s unconscious form, the 
           Dog-masked Man unzips his pants and starts to masturbate. 

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        But it is a damn good way to cover 
                        your tracks. Dora’s death could 
                        have been logged accidental. House 
                        fires happen. Especially when you 
                        live alone in the middle of 
                        nowhere.
           The fire spreads and Dora’s flesh starts to sizzle and burn. 
           The Dog-masked Man’s breathing accelerates. 

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        There would have been no 
                        investigation. No unsolved murder 
                        case. And most importantly no me -- 
                        in your earbuds while you’re 
                        sweating away on the elliptical -- 
                        trying to solve it.

           As the flames burn hotter, the Dog-masked Man finishes. He 
           quickly pulls out a wet wipe and cleans up.

                                 ANA 
                        Too bad for the killer, it didn’t 
                        go down like that.

           The Dog-masked Man disappears up the basement stairs.

           EXT. DORA BISHOP’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The Appalachian mountains. A beautiful old Victorian house 
           stands alone in the moonlight. All around are deep, dark 
           woods. A curvy two-lane mountain road passes by it. Black 
           smoke pours from the basement windows. 

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        A storm came. Five inches of rain 
                        in five hours. Local record.

           Lightning dances in the distance. THUNDER rumbles. The Dog-
           masked Man walks down the front steps of the house.

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        Enough rainfall to slow the burn at 
                        Dora Bishop’s house until the local 
                        fire department arrived at 5 AM the 
                        next morning and put out the blaze.

           The man removes his mask and gets into a nondescript gray 
           sedan and drives off, leaving the house to burn. 

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        So instead of ashes we a body. 
                        Instead of smoke we have evidence. 
                        Instead of an accident we have a 
                        mystery.

           A patter of rain starts to fall.
           INT. DORA BISHOP’S HOUSE - BASEMENT 

           Dora’s flesh is half melted off now, blackened and bubbling.

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        But it won’t be one forever. We 
                        will catch the person who did this. 
                        Because I won’t quit...

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. PODCASTING STUDIO - RECORDING BOOTH - DAY

           ANA COHEN (29), a cute hipster in cool glasses, sits at a 
           desk in a soundproof booth. She reads from a script into a 
           microphone. 

                                 ANA (CONT'D)
                        ...until there is justice for Dora 
                        Bishop. 

           A beat. Ana takes a sip of water. She looks at a different 
           sheet of paper.

                                 ANA
                        Are you tired of getting killed on 
                        overpriced mattresses from your 
                        local retailer? 

           SUPER: PRESENT DAY.

                                 ANA
                        Icarus offers a top-quality 
                        mattress for a fraction of the 
                        price. Your vacuum-sealed Icarus 
                        mattress is hand-delivered, right 
                        to your door. Sleep on it for 30 
                        days and if you don’t like it, 
                        return it for a full refund. You 
                        won’t, though. Because each Icarus 
                        mattress is handcrafted, right here 
                        in America, from nine different 
                        layers of patented Somni-foam to 
                        create the ultimate deep-sleep 
                        experience. Icarus: it’s like 
                        sleeping on a cloud. Only cheaper. 

           Ana takes another sip of water and rolls her neck a little.

                                 ANA
                        How was that?
           On the other side of the glass is SETH HOWARD (30), non-
           threatening and noticeably less trendy than Ana. Seth also 
           wears headphones and operates a mixing board. He gives Ana a 
           thumbs up. Ana nods, clears her throat and continues.

                                 ANA
                        This is I Heart Murder, the podcast 
                        where we investigate the killing of 
                        Dora Bishop. I’m your host, Ana 
                        Cohen...

           ANGLE ON Ana’s in-studio cork board, connecting various 
           photos, articles and documentary evidence from the case with 
           red yarn. At the top is a photo of Dora with the date 
           6/21/2015. Below are photos of her 3 main suspects. 

                                 ANA
                        Fire was a choice. Disguising a 
                        homicide as a house fire suggests 
                        premeditation. Planning. I think 
                        our killer knew Dora had the murder 
                        weapons -- a gallon of gas and 30 
                        feet of rope -- just sitting in her 
                        own basement. Maybe it was someone 
                        close to her... 

           ANGLE ON a photograph of JOE IVEY (mid 40s), a tall, fit man 
           in a khaki sheriff’s uniform. A little smirk on his face. 
           Handsome and he knows it.

                                 ANA
                        Someone like Joe Ivey? To recap 
                        Episode 4 -- currently available on 
                        iTunes, Spotify and everywhere you 
                        get your podcasts -- Joe is the 
                        married Sheriff’s Deputy who was 
                        allegedly having an affair with 
                        Dora at the time of her death. And 
                        Joe certainly does seem to have a 
                        mean streak...

           ANGLE ON a newspaper article “OFF-DUTY SHERIFF’S DEPUTY 
           ARRESTED IN BRAWL”

                                 ANA
                        Arrested in 2014 for beating a man 
                        unconscious. Dude lost an eye, by 
                        the way. Numerous Excessive Force 
                        complaints on the job. Yeah, we 
                        FOIA’ed those. Maybe Dora wanted to 
                        break it off and Joe got mad? Or 
                        maybe she threatened to tell his 
                        wife and he needed to shut her up? 
                        Then again... 
           ANGLE ON a mugshot of CODY VARGA (15) a hulking, dead-eyed 
           Goth kid with long, stringy black hair. He looks like every 
           mass shooter ever.

                                 ANA
                        ...perhaps the killer was an 
                        outcast. A creep who studied the 
                        details of Dora’s life from the 
                        shadows. In that case, Cody Varga 
                        might just be our man. Or boy, I 
                        guess. 

           ANGLE ON printouts of various social media posts that say 
           things like: “burn it all.” and “everything is an illusion. 
           only the pain is real. but the fire will outlast you-- the 
           last thing that you feel.”

                                 ANA
                        Judging from his social media 
                        profile, Cody is a pyro. The kid 
                        reputedly tortured animals. He was 
                        known to ride his 4-wheeler up and 
                        down the trails behind Dora’s

                        was obsessed with “Ms. Bishop” ever 
                        since he took her Marketing class 
                        in 8th grade.

                        Oops, almost forgot! Cody was 
                        arrested for the murder. Though 
                        later released without being

                        But maybe our killer was a bit of 
                        both: a psychopathic outsider  with 
                        a foothold in Dora’s personal life. 
                        Consider Ronnie Burnett...

           INT. PODCASTING STUDIO - OFFICE SPACE - DAY

           Seth and Ana walk out of the recording booth into a converted 
           Brooklyn loft. Artful, framed mugshots of famous killers hang 
           on the walls and a large, neon I HEART MURDER logo is 
           suspended from the ceiling. It would be a pretty cool space 
           if it weren’t so cluttered with boxes and papers.

           Ana shows Seth her phone: a nicely framed shot of the 
           evidence cork board and an accompanying social media post: 

           “the connections are becoming clearer mwahahahaha” [upside 
           down smiley face emoji]”

                                 ANA
                        ...How’s that look?

                                 SETH
                        Like every detective show ever. You 
                        sure somebody’s not going to sue 
                        us?
                                 ANA
                        Please. You can’t copyright the 
                        “crazy wall”. I’m posting it.

           She does. Nearby the podcast’s lone employee SHARON (22), a 
           chipper intern, sits at a laptop. 

                                 ANA
                        Speaking of which, Sharon, we need 
                        more push pins for the crazy wall. 
                        Red ones to match the yarn. The 
                        assorted colors look... too crazy.

                                 SHARON
                        On it.

           Ana notices the iTunes podcast rankings open on Sharon’s 
           computer.

                                 ANA
                        Where are we at?

                                 SHARON
                        Last week’s episode is still in the 
                        Top Ten! 

                                 SETH
                        Nice!

                                 ANA
                        What spot?

                                 SHARON
                        Well... ten. 

           Ana scowls.

                                 SHARON
                        Also happy to report #RonnieDidIt 
                        and #CodyDidIt are both trending in 
                        the U.S.

                                 SETH
                        Man, nobody ever thinks #JoeDidIt. 
                        Guy’s too handsome.

                                 ANA
                        That’s good. I’m posting that.

           Ana whips out her smartphone and posts Seth’s comment to 
           social media.

                                 ANA
                        Anything from the message boards?
                                 SHARON
                        Yeah, 400 new threads. The hot 
                        theory is that Dora was the victim 
                        of a heretofore unknown serial 
                        killer the fan community has dubbed 
                        “The Mountain State Murderer”. 

                                 ANA
                        Ha. Love it. Our fans are bonkers.

                                 SHARON
                        And a package came. Addressed to 
                        you.

                                 ANA
                        Does it look like anthrax?

                                 SHARON
                        Hmm. Kind of.

           Sharon holds out a dirty, beat-up manila envelope sealed with 
           lots of tape. Ana takes it gives a cursory glance. No return 
           address.

                                 ANA
                        Anything else?

                                 SHARON
                        Mmm. Somebody named Dan Pedrossian 
                        from Netflix called.

           Ana and Seth freeze.

                                 ANA
                        ...Okay, Sharon, I know this is 
                        your first media job or whatever 
                        but that’s what we journalists call 
                        “burying the lede”.

                                 SETH
                        Pedrossian is their True Crime 
                        development guy.

                                 SHARON
                        I took his number.

           Sharon holds up a Post-It. Ana snatches it and continues 
           toward the door.

                                 SETH
                        Thank you Sharon. Good job. You 
                        can, uh, take a break now or 
                        whatever. 
                                 SHARON
                        No thanks. Happy working. 

           Sharon puts her earbuds in and turns back to her computer. 
           Seth catches up with Ana.

                                 SETH
                             (to Ana)
                        ...So you’re a “journalist” now?

           Ana rapidly scans social media on her phone, liking and 
           sharing various I Heart Murder-related posts. 

                                 ANA
                        Of course I’m a journalist. The 
                        Times called me “Truman Capote in 
                        Warby Parkers”. 

           She points to a recent New York Times article about the 
           podcast, framed on the wall.

                                 SETH
                        Eight months ago you were a fact-
                        checker at Ladies’ Home Journal 
                        Googling unsolved murders at work.

           Ana pinches Seth’s cheek.

                                 ANA
                        And aren’t you lucky I found one?

           Ana goes back to her phone. Seth looks around the office and 
           takes it all in.

                                 SETH
                        God. This is nuts... right?

           Ana looks up.

                                 ANA
                        Nuts? 

                                 SETH
                        Like, we have a hit podcast and a 
                        real office and Dan Pedrossian is 
                        calling and we’re-- well you’re, 
                        like, quasi-famous because of it.

                                 ANA
                        Hey. Quasi-famous? I got recognized 
                        at the gym this week. I think I’m 
                        at least semi-famous. 
                                 SETH
                        You better watch out for the 
                        paparazzi at the panel thing 
                        tonight.

                                 ANA
                        Ugh. Do I have to go to that?

                        Ana. It’s the American Podcast

                        is like winning a beauty contest in 
                        the burn ward. 

           Seth shakes his head.

                                 SETH
                        Jesus. She’s already outgrown the 
                        medium that made her. Journalist 
                        Ana Cohen truly has become semi-
                        famous.
                             (yelling to no one)
                        I knew her when, folks. I knew her 
                        when.

           Across the office, Sharon pulls her earbuds out, confused.

                                 SHARON
                        Huh?

                                 ANA
                        Nothing, Sharon. Get back to work.

           INT. NYU AUDITORIUM - THAT NIGHT

           Ana sits on a panel onstage with OTHER PROMINENT PODCASTERS 
           and a MODERATOR before a LIVE AUDIENCE. This is the Q and A 
           portion of the panel.

           A GRUFF COMEDIAN speaks to the crowd. 

                                 GRUFF COMEDIAN
                        ...You know a lot of comics try to 
                        be tough guys. They don’t come on 
                        my show intending to cry. But I get 
                        ‘em all eventually.

           Audience CHUCKLES. Ana’s phone BUZZES. She discretely checks 
           it. 
           ANGLE ON a social media Direct Message from an anonymous 
           account called @southwillrise88:

           “why are you poking your nose where it don’t belong bitch?”

                                 PODCAST SUPERFAN (O.S.)
                        Question for Ana.

           Ana is startled. Out in the audience a SUPERFAN of the show, 
           wearing an official I Heart Murder t-shirt, holds a 
           microphone.

                                 MODERATOR
                        Go ahead, please.

                                 PODCAST SUPERFAN
                        Hi. Huge, huge fan of your work. 
                        What you’re doing is so important.

                                 ANA
                        Thanks. Cool shirt.

                                 PODCAST SUPERFAN
                        So... can you just tell us who you 
                        think did it?

           The audience LAUGHS. Ana grins. Coy.

                                 ANA
                        I could... But I won’t. I need 
                        proof. Until I have it my mind has 
                        to be open to every possibility.

                                 SUPERFAN
                        OK. I respect that. Blink once if 
                        it’s Ronnie Burnett.

           The audience LAUGHS again. Ana laughs too this time.

                                 ANA
                        I will say this: there are three 
                        suspects in this case. I am certain 
                        one of them murdered Dora Bishop. 
                        One day -- soon I hope -- we will 
                        all know, beyond a shadow of a 
                        doubt, which one of the bastards 
                        did it. 

           The audience APPLAUDS. The Superfan beams at this answer and 
           sits down. The Moderator scans the crowd.

                                 MODERATOR
                        Another question?
           A mousy UNDERGRADUATE takes the mic. She stares at her feet 
           and mumbles her question.

                                 UNDERGRADUATE
                        Yeah, um, what about the other two?

                                 ANA
                        The other two?

                                 UNDERGRADUATE
                        Like, the two guys that didn’t kill 
                        her. What about them? 

                                 ANA
                        They get to not go to prison.

           The audience LAUGHS.

                                 UNDERGRADUATE
                        No, but I mean their lives are--

                                 ANA
                        Look, you’re young so you may not 
                        understand this yet, but the world 
                        is a fucking dark place. Our only 
                        glimmer of hope is the truth. 
                        Before we started investigating, it 
                        had been four long years of nothing 
                        on the Bishop case -- no progress 
                        from the bumblefuck keystone cops 
                        down in Glencoe. Think about what 
                        that must have felt like for Dora’s 
                        family.

                                 UNDERGRADUATE
                        I read online that the family won’t 
                        even talk to you--

                                 ANA
                        I Heart Murder has over 30 million 
                        downloads. The Bishop case is 
                        actually in the news again. Not to 
                        brag, but that’s because of us. We 
                        are closer than ever to solving 
                        this thing. Is there going to be 
                        fallout from that? Sure, maybe. I 
                        can’t control that. 

                                 UNDERGRADUATE
                        OK. But how are you not, like... 
                        exploiting a tragedy?
                                 ANA
                        How about the murderer who is 
                        currently walking around free? How 
                        about the police who get paid to 
                        solve crimes and don’t? Me? I have 
                        no power. I have no authority. I 
                        have a microphone. All I’m trying 
                        to do is tell a story. Hopefully I 
                        can tell it well enough that it can 
                        make some small measure of 
                        difference against the darkness.

           The audience APPLAUDS drowning out the undergraduate.

                                 UNDERGRADUATE
                        I mean, do you really think it’s 
                        that black and--

                                 MODERATOR
                        Please. Let’s give everyone a 
                        chance to ask their question. You.

           The undergraduate reluctantly gives up the mic to a WILD-
           HAIRED WOMAN who blinks strangely.

                                 WILD-HAIRED WOMAN
                        I have a question for Ana.

                                 GRUFF COMEDIAN
                             (under his breath)
                        Jesus. Seriously?

                                 WILD-HAIRED WOMAN
                        Do you think the fact that Dora 
                        Bishop’s murder took place on June 
                        21, 2015 is significant.

                                 ANA
                        How-- how do you mean?

                                 WILD-HAIRED WOMAN
                        June 21st. That’s the Summer 
                        Solstice. Litha. A holiday of great 
                        significance to pagans and 
                        occultists everywhere. 

                                 ANA
                        Are you suggesting that Dora Bishop 
                        was murdered by... witches?
                                 WILD-HAIRED WOMAN
                        Well, as you just said: demonic 
                        influence seems to be pervasive in 
                        our sick, modern society.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT

           Ana steps out onto the dark, rain-slick street with the rest 
           of the crowd. She clutches a small lucite podcasting award 
           for “Outstanding Achievement In The Medium”.

           As Ana walks toward the subway, she looks only at her phone, 
           liking and sharing more I Heart Murder content. 

           ANGLE ON iTunes Rankings. “I Heart Murder - Episode 19: The 
           Choice of Fire” is currently at #8. 

           Ana grins. 

           Then she rereads the threatening message from earlier: 

           “why are you poking your nose where it don’t belong bitch?”

           She types back: “It’s a living.”

           Send. A beat. Ana’s phone BUZZES with a new message: 

           “not for long”

           Ana glances around. The crowd has thinned now. A few 
           stragglers here and there, hypnotized by their phones.

           An OLD MAN in a stained, threadbare suit sits on a nearby 
           stoop, clutching a bottle in a brown bag and glaring at Ana. 
           They lock eyes. The old man doesn’t blink. His gaze is pure 
           hatred. 

                                 ANA
                        ...What? 

                                 OLD MAN
                        I’ll eat your pussy.

                                 ANA
                        Fuck off.

           The old man gives a joyless HISSING LAUGH revealing that all 
           of his front teeth are missing. Ana keeps walking.
           INT. PODCASTING STUDIO - DAY

           Ana sits at her desk talking on her phone. 

                                 ANA
                        Yes, hi. I’m calling for Dan 
                        Pedrossian.
                             (beat)
                        Ana Cohen. Right, mm hmm. From the 
                        murder podcast. Oh, thank you. 
                        That’s very flattering... Well, if 
                        I told you who did it, you wouldn’t 
                        keep listening! Ha ha. OK. Sure 
                        just have him give me a call back 
                        when he gets in. Thank you.

           She hangs up and sees Seth standing nearby. He gazes 
           longingly at the little podcasting award now sitting on the 
           corner of her messy desk.

                                 SETH
                        Did they, by any chance, give you 
                        another one of these? For your, 
                        ahem, producer?

                                 ANA
                        No. You can have that one.

                                 SETH
                        Cool.

           Seth takes the award. He places it on his own desk three feet 
           away.

                                 ANA
                        Hey, check this out. Somebody wants 
                        me dead.

           Ana shows Seth the creepy messages on her phone.

                                 SETH
                        Jesus.

                                 ANA
                        Yeah. It’s only 20% worse than what 
                        I usually get online but still.

                                 SETH
                        I mean... Should we stop doing the 
                        podcast? Do I need to update my 
                        résumé? 
                             (beat)
                        Do you think I could be, like, a 
                        rodeo guy?
           Ana cracks a smile.

           INT. PODCASTING STUDIO - RECORDING BOOTH

           Ana records I Heart Murder - Episode 20. 

           ANGLE ON a detailed county map of West Virginia.

                                 ANA
                        ...West Virginia. Wild and 
                        wonderful. Forty-ninth poorest 
                        state in the union. Fiftieth in 
                        life expectancy. Coal mining is 
                        dead. Opioid addiction is alive and 
                        well. It’s a place where too many 
                        bad things happen to too many 
                        people. What’s another tragedy, 
                        more or less?

           ANGLE ON a photo of DALE HAMMOND (50s), a portly red-faced 
           man practically bursting out of his sheriff’s uniform.

                                 ANA
                        At least that seems to be the 
                        attitude of Corbett County Sheriff 
                        Dale Hammond. You’d think solving 
                        the grisly murder of a local high-
                        school-teacher-slash-former-Miss-
                        West-Virginia would be the 
                        department’s top concern. Nope. Not 
                        for
                             (hillbilly accent)
                        Sheriff Dale.

           ANGLE ON Ana’s crazy wall-- again the newspaper article with 
           headline that reads “SUSPECT ARRESTED IN GLENCOE MURDER 
           INVESTIGATION”

                                 ANA
                        The day after the murder, deputies 
                        made a single arrest: Cody Varga. 
                        Discharged without explanation 48 
                        hours later. Cool.

           ANGLE ON Cody Varga’s mugshot. 

                                 ANA
                        And since then... nothing. No more 
                        arrests. No indictments. No press 
                        conferences. Nada.

           Ana grabs a sheaf of printouts from a nearby stack and reads. 
                                 ANA
                        In the meantime, however, these 
                        amazing supercops have made... 19 
                        collars for underaged drinking, 8 
                        for marijuana possession, and 3 
                        for, get this, cow tipping. Oh and 
                        in February the whole department 
                        went to Morgantown to do a ropes 
                        course for “team building”. 
                        Priorities.

           ANGLE ON Joe Ivey’s picture. 

                                 ANA
                        Needless to say, the department has 
                        never acknowledged Deputy Ivey’s 
                        alleged affair with Dora, despite 
                        the ample evidence that we, here, 
                        at I Heart Murder were able to dig 
                        up on social media.

           ANGLE ON: Printouts of old Facebook posts between Joe and 
           Dora that strongly hint that the two are dating.

                                 ANA
                        That is, before Joe deactivated or 
                        deleted all his accounts. Enjoy 
                        that digital detox, Joe. Sometimes 
                        I wish I could unplug too.

           ANGLE ON Ronnie Burnett’s mugshot. 

                                 ANA
                        Ronnie Burnett wasn’t even 
                        questioned. Despite witnesses 
                        claiming they heard him say he 
                        would “like to choke that stuck up 
                        bitch”. Despite the fact that he’s 
                        got a mile-long rap sheet 
                        culminating in second degree 
                        murder.

           ANGLE ON various arrest records for Ronnie Burnett, mostly 
           for assault and possession of narcotics.

                                 ANA
                        Weird. Ronnie Burnett spent his 
                        entire adult life in and out of 
                        prison until approximately November 
                        8, 2011. The day Dale Hammond, was 
                        elected Sheriff of Corbett County, 
                        West Virginia. Fun fact: I recently 
                        discovered that Dale and Ronnie are 
                        first cousins.

           website, connecting Ronnie Burnett and Dale Hammond.

                        Yep. Thanks ancestry.com. Isn’t 
                        that quite a coincidence? But hey, 
                        everybody down there is related, 
                        right? And people can change. I 
                        used to love kombucha. Now I can’t 
                        stand the stuff. Maybe Ronnie, the 
                        wife-murderer with the Nazi neck 
                        tattoo simply woke up one day in 
                        2011 and decided not to do any more 
                        bad stuff. Maybe it’s got nothing 
                        do with his cousin running the 
                        local police. Yeah. Maybe...

           Ana picks a printout of a press release.

                                 ANA
                        But it seems I’m not the only one 
                        who’s disappointed in the Corbett 
                        County Sherriff’s Department. I’m 
                        thrilled to report that today the 
                        West Virginia State Police released 
                        the following statement:
                             (reading)
                        “After years of stalled progress, 
                        the West Virginia Bureau of 
                        Criminal Investigation’s cold case 
                        unit will officially open an 
                        investigation into the 2015 murder 
                        of Dora Lynn Bishop. We believe in 
                        devoting the resources and manpower 
                        necessary to finally solve this 
                        case. There will be justice for 
                        Dora.”

           Ana puts down the printout. She grins.

                                 ANA
                        Progress. And not for nothing 
                        but... it sounds we have some new 
                        fans of the podcast.

           INT. TRENDY RESTAURANT - THAT NIGHT

           A loud, hip restaurant. Ana is on a Tinder date with JASON a 
           square finance bro. She is already fairly drunk.

           As he drones on about his job Ana discretely compares him to 
           his profile photo. Photo is much better looking.
                                 JASON
                        ...So that’s basically what 
                        automated high-frequency currency 
                        arbitrage is all about.

                                 ANA
                             (quietly)
                        Jesus Christ, I’d kill myself.

                                 JASON
                             (yelling over the noise)
                        Huh?

           Ana downs the rest of her glass of wine.

                                 ANA
                        So, if I’m understanding correctly, 
                        your job is to make money for 
                        someone... somewhere?

                                 JASON
                        And hopefully myself.

                                 ANA
                        That’s what you want to spend your 
                        life doing?

                                 JASON
                        Sure. You should see my apartment. 

                                 ANA
                        What about, you know, right and 
                        wrong? The greater good? Morality?

           Jason laughs.

                                 JASON
                        In my experience, every do-gooder 
                        claiming to help other people is 
                        just as self-centered as me, only 
                        they can’t admit it. You know, Ayn 
                        Rand said that true altruism 
                        doesn’t even exist.

                                 ANA
                        Yep. You just dropped Ayn Rand. 
                        That means its time for the check.

           Ana gestures to a passing SERVER but Jason laughs and waves 
           them off. 

                                 JASON
                        No, no. I want to hear how exactly 
                        you make rent that’s so noble?
                                 ANA
                        I host a podcast. Investigate 
                        unsolved murders.

           Jason shudders.

                                 JASON
                        Morbid. That’s what you want to 
                        spend your life doing?

                                 ANA
                        Yeah.

                                 JASON
                        Why?

           Ana considers this for a long moment as she pours herself 
           another glass of wine.

                                 ANA
                        ...When I was 11 my cat Juniper got 
                        sick and died.

                                 JASON
                        I’m... very sorry for your loss?

                                 ANA
                        Only something was off. Juniper was 
                        young; healthy. And one day he just 
                        barfs up a bunch of blood and keels 
                        over? Plus my neighbor Jenny 
                        Chung’s cat had just died two weeks 
                        earlier. Something was off. I knew 
                        it. So I froze him. 

                                 JASON
                        You froze your dead cat?

                                 ANA
                        Yep. And I mailed his corpse to the 
                        Cornell University College of 
                        Veterinary Medicine requesting an 
                        autopsy.

                                 JASON
                        Did they... do that?

                                 ANA
                        For some reason-- maybe it was the 
                        adorable sixth-grade-girl 
                        handwriting on loose leaf notebook 
                        paper-- they did. Six weeks later I 
                        got a letter. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANA (CONT'D)
                        Cause of death: venlafaxine 
                        poisoning. Do you know what 
                        venlafaxine is? 

                                 JASON
                        No. No I don’t.

                                 ANA
                        It’s an antidepressant. Fatal to 
                        cats.

                                 JASON
                        So, what? Juniper got into the pill 
                        cabinet? 

                                 ANA
                        Nope. Nobody in my house was on 
                        antidepressants. Probably should’ve 
                        been. But they weren’t. So I start 
                        going through neighbors’ trash. 

                                 JASON
                        Oh my God.

                                 ANA
                        Sure enough, I find an empty pill 
                        bottle in Mrs. Shapiro’s garbage: 
                        Effexor. That’s the commercial name 
                        for venlafaxine. So I stake out the 
                        Shapiro house.

           Jason has become visibly uncomfortable.

                                 JASON
                        Uh.

                                 ANA
                        Four months I watch from the 
                        bushes. Before school. After 
                        school. It’s tough for a kid, you 
                        know. But one day I catch her. Mrs. 
                        Shapiro steps out on her back patio 
                        and puts out a plate of cat food. 
                        Mrs. Shapiro doesn’t have any cats. 
                        After she’s gone, I check the food. 
                        There’s some crushed up white 
                        powder on it. 

                                 JASON
                        No.
                                 ANA
                        Yep. Mrs. Shapiro killed Juniper. 
                        She killed Jenny Chung’s cat. She’d 
                        been doing it for years.

                                 JASON
                        But... why?

           Ana shrugs.

                                 ANA
                        Bitch didn’t like cats. And you 
                        know what happened when I called 
                        her on it? 

                                 JASON
                        What?

                                 ANA
                        I’m the one who got in trouble.

           Ana takes another swig of wine.

                                 ANA (CONT’D)
                        That’s when I learned that I don’t 
                        give up. And I don’t back down. And 
                        I don’t let people get away with 
                        it.

                                 JASON
                        But didn’t she get away with it?

                                 ANA
                        Nah. She left the neighborhood six 
                        months later. Couldn’t handle the 
                        thought of someone out there 
                        knowing who she really was.

           Ana stares intently at Jason for a long moment, sizing him 
           up.

                                 ANA (CONT’D)
                        Most people can’t.

           Jason waves to the server.

                                 JASON
                             (meekly)
                        Yeah, can we get the check?
           EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

           Ana, drunk, walks alone down an eerily deserted Brooklyn 
           street. Her phone BUZZES. She stops and looks at it. 

           ANGLE ON another Direct Message from @southwillrise88:

           “i told you to drop it jew cunt”

           Ana looks around. The dark street is empty. 

           Suddenly SOMEONE lurches into the streetlight ahead. Ana can 
           only make out a silhouette charging toward her, arms 
           flailing. 

           Ana stumbles backwards as the figure bears down on her. She 
           turns to run, but trips over a pile of garbage and falls 
           backwards. 

           The person rushes past her toward a nearby trashcan and 
           starts to LOUDLY VOMIT into it. Ana can see now that he is 
           just a drunken COLLEGE STUDENT.

           A group of LAUGHING COEDS follows behind, making fun of their 
           hammered friend. Ana catches her breath.

                                 ANA
                             (weakly)
                        Watch it, asshole. 

           The puking kid doesn’t hear her.

           INT. SUBWAY TRAIN 

           Ana stares at her phone. She overhears two nearby PASSENGERS 
           discussing her podcast.

                                 MALE PASSENGER
                        ...Cody absolutely did it. He is a 
                        textbook psychopath. 

                                 FEMALE PASSENGER
                        How can you, just, like diagnose 
                        someone from afar like that?

                                 MALE PASSENGER
                        No, I read a book about it. 
                        There’s, like, this test you can 
                        do...

           Ana smiles despite herself, and looks at her phone again. Ana 
           replies to @southwillrise88:
           “Please, Jew Cunt was my mother’s name. Call me Ana.”

           A beat. Ana’s phone BUZZES again.  

           “laugh now. soon you’ll scream”

           Ana frowns. She gets up and exits the train at the next stop.

           INT. PODCASTING STUDIO - NIGHT

           Ana enters the darkened studio and flicks on the lights.

           Ana hits a vape pen and studies her crazy wall: photos of 
           Ronnie Burnett, Cody Varga and Joe Ivey connected to other 
           pieces of evidence.

           She looks at her phone again. Across her desk she notices the 
           manila envelope. 

           Ana rips it open. Photocopied pages tumble out. She starts to 
           read them. Her face lights up. 

                                 ANA
                        Holy shit.

           INT. SETH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Seth and his girlfriend LISA sit on the couch watching a 
           baking competition show. 

           ONSCREEN a nervous BAKING CONTESTANT attempts to bake a 
           Swedish Princess cake.

                                 SETH
                        Never going to win with that 
                        showstopper, Brett.

                                 LISA
                        The layers are so uneven. 

           Suddenly there is a POUNDING on the door, startling them 
           both. Seth and Lisa look at each other. Seth gets up and 
           tentatively goes to answer it. 

                                 SETH
                        Hello?

                                 ANA
                             (through door)
                        Seth! Open up!

           Seth opens the door to see Ana standing on the other side.
                                 SETH
                        Ana, Jesus, it’s nearly midnight.

           Ana barges in.

                                 ANA
                        You have to look at this. Now.

           She hands Seth the manila envelope. Seth takes out the pages 
           and reads them.

           ANGLE ON photocopied pages of Corbett County Sherriff’s 
           Department Letterhead. It’s a confession written in an ugly 
           childlike scrawl.

                                 SETH
                             (reading)
                        My God. This is a handwritten 
                        confession. From Ronnie Burnett.

                                 ANA
                        Yep. Taken down on Corbett County 
                        Sheriff’s Department letterhead. 
                        Only nobody’s ever mentioned that 
                        Ronnie confessed to anything. They 
                        covered it up.

                                 SETH
                        This is proof. If it’s real.

                                 ANA
                        I think it is. And I think he knows 
                        it’s out there now. That’s why he’s 
                        fucking with me online. He can’t be 
                        happy about the state police taking 
                        up the case.

                                 SETH
                        Wait. You’re saying the death 
                        threats are coming from Ronnie 
                        himself?

                                 ANA
                        I looked it up and after he lost 
                        his murder trial he used the exact 
                        same phrase
                             (re: her phone)
                        He called his lawyer a “Jew Cunt”--

                        Uh, hi, Ana.
                                 ANA
                        Oh. Hello, Lisa. Sorry I’m being 
                        loud. Me and your boyfriend are 
                        solving a murder in your kitchen. 

                                 LISA
                        OK. Well... I guess I’m going to 
                        bed?

                                 SETH
                        Don’t worry, I’ll come soon--

           Lisa exits without another word to Seth.

                                 SETH
                             (to Ana)
                        Dude. You don’t have to be rude to 
                        her.

           Ana shrugs. 

                                 ANA
                        I’m rude. I thought I was clear 
                        about that. Anyway, we need to get 
                        down there. ASAP.

                        Down there? To-- to West Virginia?

                        We have to confirm the authenticity 
                        of this confession and nobody at 
                        the Corbett County Sheriff’s 
                        Department will return my calls. 
                        Plus I’d like to get something on 
                        tape with Ronnie himself.

                                 SETH
                        Seriously? An interview with the

                                 ANA
                        I don’t think he really wants to 
                        kill me. He’s trying to scare me.

                                 SETH
                        Ana, he’s a convicted murderer.
                                 ANA
                        Think about it: it would be super 
                        dumb of him to do anything to me. 
                        Semi-famous, remember? Anyway, yes, 
                        we need to go to Glencoe.

                                 SETH
                        But we’ve-- our podcast has forever 
                        associated that town with a 
                        horrible murder. I-- 
                             (lowering voice)
                        I’m not sure they like us very much 
                        down there. 

           Ana shrugs.

                                 ANA
                        Being liked isn’t the goal.

                        Plus it’s a bad time for me to 
                        travel right now. Lisa is going 
                        through some drama at work and-- 
                        Honestly, can the show actually 
                        afford a big trip like this? The 
                        budget is--

                                 ANA
                        Seth, this is why the show exists. 
                        I need you buddy. This thing has 
                        always been me and you. Looking for 
                        answers -- the truth. Nobody’s 
                        going to hand it to us. And there’s 
                        only so much we can do hiding in a 
                        recording booth in Brooklyn. 
                             (beat)
                        Plus I don’t know how to drive.

           Seth sighs deeply. A smile slowly spreads across Ana’s face.

                                 ANA
                        I know that sigh. That’s a “yes” 
                        sigh.

                        breaks this thing wide open.

           The figure cinches the garbage bag closed.

           INT. RENTAL CAR AGENCY - DAY

           Ana and Seth, carrying clamshell cases filled with recording 
           equipment, enter a rental car agency. A RENTAL CAR AGENT 
           stands behind the counter.

                                 ANA
                        Hi. I have a reservation. Nissan 
                        Versa for Cohen.

                                 RENTAL CAR AGENT
                        Alrighty Ms. Cohen. Just need to 
                        see your drivers license.

                                 ANA
                        Welp, you called my bluff. Seth?

           Seth puts his license on the table. The agent takes it then 
           types something into his computer.

                                 RENTAL CAR AGENT
                             (while typing)

                                 ANA
                        Nope. Supplemental insurance is a 
                        scam.

                                 RENTAL CAR AGENT
                        Hmm.

                        Cool, man. That’s... great.

                        And... you’re all set, Mr. Howard. 
                        Welcome to West Virginia.

           EXT. CAR - AFTERNOON

           Seth drives the winding mountain roads -- beautiful, green 
           woods dotted with abandoned, burned-out houses and occasional 
           pockets of post-industrial squalor: slag heaps, rusting 
           mining equipment, disused train tracks, covered in kudzu.

                        Check in to the motel. Then swing 
                        by the Sheriff’s department and try 
                        to talk to Hammond. After that, I’d 
                        like to pay a visit to the State 
                        Police cold case unit. See what 
                        they know. Then maybe grab a bite 
                        to eat at...

                        Either the Black Diamond Diner or

                        restaurant is... 
                             (checks phone)
                        134 miles away. In Pittsburgh.
           EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - AFTERNOON

           Their car tops a mountain. In the valley below, a tiny 
           defunct coal mining town of about 1,300 people glows in the 
           afternoon sun.

                        Glencoe, West Virginia.

           As the car descends into the valley, closer to town they pass 
           an abandoned drive-in movie theater, overgrown with weeds. 
           The letters on the old rusty marquee say “I KILLED DORA”.

                                 SETH 
                        Well, that’s not spooky at all.

           Ana leans out the window snaps a photo with her phone, which 
           she immediately posts to social media.

           EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

           The car pulls into the parking lot of the town’s only motel, 
           the CHIEF LOGAN INN. There are only two other cars in the 
           parking lot. The sign features a huge (racist) statue of a 
           stoic Indian chief. Seth winces.

                        I feel like staying here might

                        It’s this or sleep in the car.

           A bell on the door jingles as Ana and Seth enter the front 
           office of the motel. It’s deserted. Seth grins.

                                 SETH
                        Hey, check it out.

           On the counter is a small spinning rack of bootleg I HEART 
           MURDER keychains. Ana frowns and starts to manually jingle 
           the bell on the door. She doesn’t stop until an elderly man, 
           MR. MULLINS, emerges from a back room, blinking.

                                 MR. MULLINS
                        Sorry, just catching my forty 
                        winks. Four in the afternoon but 
                        the hospitality industry demands 
                        strange hours of a man. How can I 
                        help you fine folks?
                                 ANA
                        Room for two please. Two beds. 
                        Obviously. And one of these.

           She takes a keychain and slaps it on the counter. 

                                 MR. MULLINS
                        Oh are y’all fans of the podcast? 

                                 ANA
                        Heard a couple episodes. You like 
                        it?

                                 MR. MULLINS
                        Honestly, that girl’s voice gets to 
                        me--

           Ana grits her teeth.

                                 MR. MULLINS (CONT'D)
                        --but, hell, it put this little 
                        nothing town on the map. Folks 
                        around here hate it. But no press 
                        is bad press, you ask me.

           Mr. Mullins tips his bifocals down

                                 MR. MULLINS
                        You know, if y’all are interested, 
                        I do an informal I Heart Murder 
                        tour for out-of-towners. I can take 
                        you around to the high school, the 
                        trailer park where the Varga boy 
                        lives, Dora’s house. All the main 
                        attractions, so to speak. Very 
                        reasonable rates.

                                 ANA
                        Mmm. Maybe next time.

                                 MR. MULLINS
                             (lowering voice)
                        My two cents? It was Ronnie Burnett 
                        killed her. That boy always had a 
                        devil in him...

           He hands them two sets of keys.

                                 MR. MULLINS
                        Okey-doke, Room 126. 
                        Not gonna lie, the toilet is... 
                        tricky.
           INT. MOTEL ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Ana and Seth enter their motel room: acrylic bedspreads, 
           nicotine-stained wallpaper, Abstract Expressionist water 
           damage on the ceiling.

           Seth instantly recoils.

                                 SETH
                             (choking)
                        Jesus it smells like somebody died 
                        in here.

                                 ANA
                        Oh my god, how great would that be 
                        for the podcast?

           They toss their suitcases on the bed. Ana snaps a photo of 
           the room with her phone and attaches it to a social media 
           post:

           “Just checked into the Ritz-Carlton Glencoe, WV. Let the 
           sleuthing begin! #IHeartMurder #IHeartShagCarpeting”

           Send.

           INT. CORBETT COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - EVENING

           A one-story fluorescent-lit Sheriff’s Department office. A 
           receptionist, MRS. SYKES (50s) sits at a desk. 

           Her office phone RINGS. After a single ring, she presses a 
           button to send it to voicemail. A beat. The phone RINGS 
           again. She sends it to voicemail. The calls don’t stop. Each 
           time, a single ring and sent to voicemail.

           Ana and Seth enter. Seth carries a microphone and digital 
           recorder.

                                 MRS. SYKES
                        Can I help you?

                                 ANA
                        Yes, hi, my name is Ana Cohen and 
                        I’d like to speak to the Sheriff 
                        about the Dora Bishop case.

           Mrs. Sykes’s eyes narrow. The phone RINGS. She sends it to 
           voicemail.

                                 MRS. SYKES
                        Cohen?
           Ana nods. The phone starts RINGING yet again.

                                 MRS. SYKES
                        You got a lot of nerve showing your 
                        face down here.

                                 ANA
                        Do I? I’m just looking for the 
                        truth, ma’am.

           The phone keeps RINGING.

                                 MRS. SYKES
                        Twenty-four hours a day, seven days 
                        a week, this damn phone rings.

                                 ANA
                        Yeah, I noticed that. I left six 
                        messages. Nobody ever got back to 
                        me.

           The phone keeps RINGING.

                                 MRS. SYKES
                        Lunatics from all over the world 
                        keep calling, thinking they cracked 
                        the damn Bishop case!

                                 ANA
                        And I’m sure your officers are 
                        rigorously chasing down every lead.

                                 MRS. SYKES
                        Thanks to your little website--

                                 ANA
                        Podcast

                                 MRS. SYKES (CONT'D)
                        --it has become impossible to get 
                        anything done around here!

           Mrs. Sykes slams the button sending the call to voicemail.

                                 ANA
                        Oh, I think the department wasn’t 
                        getting anything done long before I 
                        came along.

           Ana peers past Mrs. Sykes through a glass door beyond. On the 
           other side, she spots Sherriff Hammond. He is having a heated 
           argument with Deputy Joe Ivey -- inaudible thanks to the 
           glass. Another deputy TONY YATES (mid 50s) -- a small, trim 
           man with a gray mustache -- watches impassively. 
           Joe is stricken with rage, veins bulging out of his neck. He 
           angrily points toward the front reception area. Hammond puts 
           a hand on Joe’s chest, trying to stop him from doing 
           something rash.

                                 ANA
                             (to Mrs. Sykes)
                        Is that Deputy Ivey? I’d love a 
                        word with him, too.

           For an instant Ana and Joe’s eyes meet. He looks furious, 
           like an animal.

                                 MRS. SYKES
                        Deputy Ivey is not available for 
                        comment at this time.

                                 ANA
                             (still staring at Joe)
                        That’s fine. Happy to direct all my 
                        questions to Sheriff Hammond.

                                 MRS. SYKES
                        Nobody is available for comment at 
                        this--

           Sheriff Hammond steps out from the back office with an 
           unctuous grin on his face.

                                 SHERIFF HAMMOND
                        Howdy. Can I help y’all?

           INT. SHERRIFF HAMMOND’S OFFICE - EVENING

           Ana and Seth sit across the desk in Hammond’s office. Hammond 
           takes a big sip from a “HILLARY FOR PRISON” mug.

                                 SHERIFF HAMMOND
                        Welcome to Glencoe, West Virginia.
                             (to Seth)
                        First things first, I’m going to 
                        need you to turn off your recording 
                        device, son.

           Seth looks at Ana.

                                 SETH
                        Uh.
                                 ANA
                        Nope. We’re journalists. We have a 
                        Constitutional right to record 
                        here.

                                 SHERIFF HAMMOND
                        Do you? Well maybe we can call the 
                        New York City ACLU to come sort it 
                        all out. In the meantime, I’m going 
                        to have to insist.

           Long beat as the Sheriff stares them down, weird, fake grin 
           still plastered on his red face. At last, Seth turns his 
           recorder off.

                                 SHERIFF HAMMOND
                        ...There’s a good boy. Now, what 
                        brings the liberal media to our 
                        little corner of the Mountain 
                        State. 

                                 ANA
                        Dora Bishop. You remember her. Or 
                        maybe not?

                                 SHERIFF HAMMOND
                        Regarding the Bishop case: it is 
                        not the policy of this department 
                        to comment on ongoing 
                        investigations.

                                 ANA
                        That’s fine. I just need to check 
                        your letterhead to authenticate 
                        this confession.

           Ana holds up Ronnie Burnett’s confession. Sheriff Hammond’s 
           smile drops.

                                 SHERIFF HAMMOND
                        Confession?

           Now Ana smiles.

                                 ANA
                        Yep. Your cousin Ronnie’s. 

                                 SHERIFF HAMMOND
                        He’s not my-- Look, I barely know 
                        that man-- We don’t-- No comment. 
                        No comment, goddammit. 

                                 ANA
                        You seem agitated, Sheriff. 
                                 SHERIFF HAMMOND
                        I don’t know a damn thing about a 
                        confession! You’re trying to stir 
                        up trouble. Come down here and make 
                        our town look foolish with your 
                        “gotcha” questions. Now you got the 
                        damn State Police breathing down 
                        our necks. For what? Look, I’m 
                        sorry you came all this way for 
                        nothing. No comment.

           Sheriff Hammond stands and gestures toward the door.

                                 ANA
                        You sure you don’t want to get out 
                        ahead of this Sheriff?

                                 SHERIFF HAMMOND
                        It’s fake news. You need to leave 
                        right now, Ms. Cohen.  

           Ana hesitates.

                                 SHERIFF HAMMOND
                        Leave right now or I reckon you’ll 
                        be staying the night.

           Ana lights up.

                                 ANA
                        ...Are you threatening to arrest 
                        me?

           EXT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE PARKING LOT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Seth and Ana walk back toward their car. 

                                 SETH
                        ...Was that, er, how you were 
                        hoping that would go?

           Ana is ebullient. 

                                 ANA
                        Absolutely. The Sheriff of Corbett 
                        County threatening to lock me up 
                        for solving the case? Audio gold.

                                 SETH
                        The recorder was off, Ana.

                                 ANA
                        Not mine. 
           Ana holds up her iPhone. She plays the audio.

                                 SHERIFF HAMMOND (AUDIO)
                        ...He’s not my-- Look, I barely 
                        know-- We don’t-- No comment. No 
                        comment!

           Ana stops the recording.

                                 SETH
                        I’m torn. That’s pretty impressive 
                        but the audio quality is...
                             (shuddering)
                        atrocious.

                                 ANA
                        I’m sure you can clean it up in 
                        post. Now let’s talk to some real 
                        cops.

           BEHIND THEM Joe Ivey stares out through the glass as the sun 
           sets on parking lot casting long, strange shadows. His face a 
           tight grimace, both his fists are balled tight.

           EXT. GLENCOE STREET - NIGHT

           Fully dark now. Ana and Seth walk Glencoe’s deserted main 
           street lined by mostly vacant storefronts. The town’s best 
           days are 100 years behind it. Seth still carries the digital 
           recorder. Ana stops at a storefront that clearly used to be a 
           dentist’s office.

                                 ANA
                        This is the address. 

           She peers through the window. Inside, it’s mostly empty. 
           Ratty carpet and the ghostly outlines of dental hygiene 
           posters that used to hang on the walls. A single cheap desk 
           is piled high with file boxes. An uncovered fluorescent light 
           flickers overhead.

           Ana knocks on the front door. 

                                 ANA (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           After a moment, TERRY WEBB (early 20s) a smooth, baby-faced 
           man in an ill-fitting suit rushes out of the bathroom toward 
           the door, still drying his hands with a paper towel.

                                 WEBB
                        Sorry, folks. This isn’t a 
                        dentist’s office anymore.
                                 SETH
                        Hi. No. We’re actually looking for 
                        the, uh, State Police cold case 
                        unit’s field office?

           Webb brightens.

                                 WEBB
                        Oh. You’re in the right place then. 
                        Come on in. 

           Seth and Ana enter.

           INT. STOREFRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 WEBB
                        Trooper Terry Webb. Bureau of 
                        Criminal Investigation. 

           Webb awkwardly hands Ana his card. 

                                 ANA
                        You’re eleven.

                                 WEBB
                        Twenty-two, ma’am.

                                 ANA
                        Great. Is there someone we can 
                        speak to? Like a sergeant or... 
                        maybe a parent?

                                 WEBB
                        Nope. Just me.

                                 SETH
                        You’re the... unit? 

                                 WEBB
                        Yes, sir. Got my own office and 
                        everything.

           He proudly waves to the grungy space around him. Off Seth and 
           Ana’s look, he catches himself.

                                 WEBB (CONT’D)
                        ...Pardon the mess. We’re still, 
                        uh, settling in.
                                 ANA
                        So let me get this straight, after 
                        that big announcement about 
                        “manpower and resources” the State 
                        Police devoted exactly one 
                        detective to solving the Bishop 
                        case?

                                 WEBB
                        No ma’am. I’m not a detective, not 
                        yet anyway. This is actually my 
                        first plainclothes assignment. So 
                        far it beats writing speeding 
                        tickets out on I-64 all day.

                                 ANA
                        This is bullshit--

           Seth cuts Ana off before she can go any further.

                                 SETH
                        What my colleague means to say is: 
                        here is some evidence that the 
                        Bureau of Criminal Investigation 
                        might find, uh, compelling. 

           Seth hands Webb a photocopy of the confession. Webb starts to 
           read it. A beat.

                                 ANA
                        ...You don’t strike me as a fast 
                        reader, so I’ll summarize: It’s 
                        Ronnie Burnett’s signed confession.

                                 WEBB
                        Uh huh. Interesting... And, um, who 
                        is that, exactly?

                                 ANA
                        Dude. Seriously?

           Webb waves to the file boxes. 

                                 WEBB
                        Ma’am, I just started this detail 
                        three days ago and I’m still 
                        familiarizing myself with all the 
                        ins and outs of the investigation. 
                        But for something like this,
                             (uncertain)
                        I’d probably need to pass it along 
                        to the state crime lab for 
                        analysis.
                                 SETH
                        And how long will that take?

           Webb thinks about this for a moment.

                                 WEBB
                        Four to six weeks? Could be longer.

           EXT. GLENCOE STREET - MINUTES LATER

           Seth and Ana walk away from the office. Ana nods to Seth’s 
           recorder, still running.

                                 ANA
                        You get all that?

                                 SETH
                        Oh yeah. 

                                 ANA
                        Call me a cynic, but Trooper Terry 
                        Webb didn’t strike me as the 
                        world’s greatest crime solver. 

                                 SETH
                        His fly was down the whole time.

           INT. PARKED CAR - CONTINUOUS

           SOMEONE sits in a parked car, clutching the steering wheel 
           with black-gloved hands and breathing heavily. They watch 
           Seth and Ana distance as they walk down the dark street. 

           EXT. GLENCOE STREET - CONTINUOUS

                                 ANA
                        So yet again it falls to us to do 
                        the cops’ job for them.

                                 SETH
                        Can we at least get dinner first?

                                 ANA
                        Yeah, we-- wait.

           Ana freezes. In the distance she spots a hulking figure 
           walking across a gas station parking lot. 

                                 ANA
                        Seth, I’m pretty sure that’s Cody 
                        Varga.
                                 SETH
                        Really?

           Ana starts to fast walk and then jog toward the him.

                                 ANA
                        Cody? Hey, Cody, I’d like to talk 
                        to you!

           Cody Varga -- a big teen with bad skin, dark baggy clothes, 
           and long black hair -- sees Ana stalking toward him.

                                 CODY
                        No. 

           Cody turns and bolts back across the parking lot. 

                                 ANA
                        Cody, stop!

           Ana chases after him and finds herself at a chainlink fence. 
           Beyond it are train tracks surrounded by tall weeds. Cody has 
           climbed over and disappeared into the darkness beyond the 
           streetlights.

           Seth arrives a few moments later, winded. 

                                 SETH
                             (panting)
                        He... dropped something... back 
                        there... 

                                 ANA
                        What? 

           Seth holds up a half-eaten pack of Skittles. 

           INT. THE BLACK DIAMOND DINER - NIGHT

           A quaint, small-town diner full of LOCAL PATRONS, many 
           elderly, chatting amiably as they eat.

           Ana and Seth enter, mid-conversation. 

                                 ANA
                        I still say you should’ve gone over 
                        the fence.

                                 SETH
                        And catch Lyme disease? No thanks. 
                        Why didn’t you do it if it was 
                        so...
           The diner falls quiet. Everyone in the place turns to stare 
           at them. It is instantly clear that they all know exactly who 
           Ana and Seth are.

           Seth hesitates.

                                 SETH
                             (quietly to Ana)
                        Um. Maybe... ah, Burger King?

                                 ANA
                        That’s ridiculous. Don’t be scared 
                        of these yokels.

           The two of them take a seat at a booth by the window. A 
           WAITRESS appears. She pulls out her pad and silently glares.

                                 ANA
                        Good evening. I will have the
                             (re: menu)
                        Western omelette with a fruit salad 
                        instead of home fries.

                                 SETH
                        And I’ll take the burger. Thanks.

           The waitress snatches their menus and disappears into the 
           kitchen. The other patrons still stare at Ana and Seth in 
           awkward silence. A few whisper darkly amongst themselves. It 
           is intensely uncomfortable.

           Seth struggles to maintain eye contact only with Ana. 

                                 SETH
                             (to Ana)
                        So... how about... the weather?

                                 LYNETTE (O.S.)
                        Y’all can get back to eating your 
                        dinner now. Go on now. It’s rude to 
                        stare. Even for hillbillies.

           The noise of the diner resumes, though at a somewhat lower 
           pitch. A cute, freckle-faced woman, LYNETTE HAGAN (30s), 
           approaches Seth and Ana’s booth. She sits down beside them.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Don’t mind them. This town just 
                        happens to be populated by a bunch 
                        of judgmental, dumbshit hicks. 
                        Pardon my language.
                                 ANA
                        The guy who runs the motel seems 
                        cool.
                             (extending hand)
                        My name’s Ana by the way.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Oh honey. Everyone knows who y’all 
                        are.

           She shakes Ana’s hand.

                                 LYNETTE
                        I’m Lynette. I’m-- I was friends 
                        with Dora.

                                 SETH
                             (looking around)
                        You sure you want to be sitting 
                        with us, Lynette?

                                 LYNETTE
                        Everybody in Glencoe already hates 
                        me. In case you didn’t know, I’m a 
                        slut and a home-wrecker.

                                 ANA
                        Wait, Lynette Hagan? You work at 
                        the high school, right?

           Lynette nods.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Administrative assistant. I just 
                        want to say I appreciate everything 
                        y’all are trying to do. 
                             (beat)
                        When-- when it happened. Those of 
                        us who knew her got... no answers. 
                        Nothing. And now the people around 
                        are more pissed off about your show 
                        than they ever were about Dora’s 
                        murder. Makes me sick.

           INT. PARKED CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Same car, now parked across the street from the Black Diamond 
           Diner. The gloved driver watches Seth and Ana talk to Lynette 
           through the window of the restaurant. 

           The car pulls out and drives off down the street. 
           INT. THE BLACK DIAMOND DINER - CONTINUOUS

                        Well, we’re here for a couple of 
                        days. Anything you think we should 
                        know? 

           Lynette grips Ana’s arm intensely and lowers her voice.

                                 LYNETTE
                        It wasn’t Joe Ivey. He’s got a 
                        temper on him. But... he would 
                        never do something like that. 
                        Never.

                                 ANA

                        Cody sure didn’t seem eager to talk 
                        to us.

                        Boy’s certainly odd. Can’t say I 
                        really know him. But my money is on 
                        Ronnie Burnett. Ronnie’s a son of a 
                        bitch. And Dora-- Well I’m not 
                        telling you anything you don’t 
                        already know: Dora had a wild side.

                        She bought pills from Ronnie from 
                        time to time. We both did. Hell, I 
                        probably introduced him to her--

           CLANK. The waitress plops two plates of food down in front of 
           them. She leaves without a word.

           Seth gingerly opens his burger with his fork. Sure enough 
           there is a distinct glob of phlegm in it. Seth swallows.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           The gloved driver barrels down an empty two-lane road through 
           the dark woods. Thirty miles over the speed limit.

           The driver plugs an audio jack from their five-year-old 
           smartphone into the car stereo. Ana’s voice comes over the 
           car speakers. I Heart Murder - Episode 20. 
                                 ANA (AUDIO)
                        ...Isn’t that quite a coincidence?  

           The driver accelerates. On the road ahead, a small animal 
           shape scuttles out of the underbrush and onto the shoulder. 
           Its eyes glow in the darkness.

                                 ANA (AUDIO)(CONT’D)
                        ...But hey, everybody down there is 
                        related, right?

           EXT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           A POSSUM is frozen in the headlights of the oncoming car. 

                                 ANA (AUDIO)(CONT’D)
                        ...And people can change.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The driver floors it. 

                                 ANA (AUDIO)(CONT’D)
                        ...I used to love kombucha. 

           At the last moment, the driver swerves toward the creature. 
           THUNK. 

                                 ANA (AUDIO)(CONT’D)
                        ...Now I can’t stand the stuff. 

           EXT. TWO-LANE ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           The car rolls to a stop. 

                                 ANA (AUDIO)(CONT’D)
                        Maybe Ronnie, the wife-murderer 
                        with the Nazi neck tattoo...

           The possum SQUEALS in agony. A nightmare sound. Its back half 
           has been crushed by the vehicle’s tires and its guts are 
           smeared across the asphalt. Somehow it is still alive.

                                 ANA (AUDIO)(CONT’D)
                        ...simply woke up one day in 2011 
                        and decided not to do any more bad 
                        stuff...

           The vehicle’s trunk pops open. The driver gets out and walks 
           to the back. They remove something and approach the dying 
           animal. 
                                 ANA (AUDIO)(CONT’D)
                        ...Maybe it’s got nothing do with 
                        his cousin running the local 
                        police.

           With a downward overhand swing -- CLANK -- a sledgehammer 
           bursts the creature’s head, splattering its brains onto the 
           pavement.

                                 ANA (AUDIO)(CONT’D)
                        Yeah. Maybe...

           Beat.

           A black gloved hand picks up the dead possum by its tail and 
           starts to walk back toward the car’s open trunk. 

           EXT. CHIEF LOGAN INN - MOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Ana and Seth approach their room at the motel, carrying 
           Burger King bags. 

                                 SETH
                        OK. This time I’m holding my breath 
                        because I know what to expe--

           The door is unlocked. Ana examines it. It has been smashed 
           open.

           Ana and Seth look at each other. They look around. The 
           parking lot is still virtually empty. Beyond are dark woods. 

           Ana nudges the door and it slowly swings open to reveal the 
           motel room beyond. Seth flicks on the lights. 

           The room has been ransacked and vandalized with swastikas 
           with threatening graffiti “LEAVE TOWN NOW BITCH”  

           “FUCK OFF JEWS” has been spray painted above the beds. 

                                 SETH
                             (confused, to himself)
                        ...but I’m not Jewish.

           Ana notices something. 

                                 ANA
                        Oh God.

           REVEAL a bloody, mutilated animal carcass lies in the middle 
           of the floor. Seth sees it and wretches.
           Ana covers her nose and mouth with her sleeve and pulls out 
           her iPhone to snap a picture. 

           Seth stumbles backward, pale and shaking.

                                 SETH
                        What--what is it?

                                 ANA
                        Hard to tell. But I think it’s a 
                        possum? 

                                 SETH
                        Does that mean maybe it’s just... 
                        pretending to be dead? 

           Ana looks at Seth.

                                 ANA
                        No, Seth. It’s not just pretending 
                        to be dead. Get the manager. 

           Seth runs off toward the front office. Ana begins a social 
           media post:

           “First night here and the locals have graciously invited us 
           to try a local delicacy! Yum! #IHeartMurder” 

           Ana attaches a photo of the bloody, dead possum.

           Send.

           A moment later, Mr. Mullins arrives with Seth. Mullins does a 
           double-take.

                                 MR. MULLINS 
                             (re: room)
                        Aw, what in the hell is this? Did 
                        y’all do this?

                                 ANA
                        Yes. You solved the case, Columbo. 
                        We’d like to turn ourselves in.

           Ana sarcastically holds out her wrists to be cuffed.

                                 MR. MULLINS
                        Ain’t no time for jokes, missy. 
                        Jesus this looks like

                        $400 worth of damage!

                                 ANA
                        Can we see your security footage?
                                 MR. MULLINS
                        Cameras are all fake.

                                 SETH
                        What? Seriously?

                                 MR. MULLINS
                        You think I’m made of money?

                                 ANA
                        Did you happen to notice anything 
                        strange? See anyone coming or 
                        going?

           Mr. Mullins shrugs and shakes his head.

                                 MR. MULLINS
                        Lady, I was asleep.

                                 ANA
                        Well I’m calling the cops.

           Ana pulls out her phone and dials. A beat.

                                 ANA
                        ...aaaand it went straight to

                        me!

           She hangs up.

                                 ANA
                        OK. Well we need to switch rooms.

                        Nope. That’s what he wants us to

           EXT. MOTEL - ROOM 207 - MINUTES LATER

           KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! Ana pounds on the door to Room 207. Seth 
           stands behind her with a mic and digital recorder. 

           After a beat, FEMALE MOTEL GUEST in a Garfield nightie 
           cautiously cracks the door. Her HUSBAND, a large bald man in 
           glasses, sits on the bed in his underwear.

                                 FEMALE MOTEL GUEST
                        Can I help you?

                                 ANA

           A beat.

                                 FEMALE MOTEL GUEST
                        Uh...

                                 ANA
                        Cool. Earlier our room was broken 
                        into and I need to know if either 
                        of you saw anything.

           The woman looks at her husband.

                                 FEMALE MOTEL GUEST
                        Well, I didn’t see anything happen 
                        but...

                                 ANA

                                 FEMALE MOTEL GUEST
                        I did notice someone, a man, in the 
                        parking lot. He looked... a little 
                        creepy. Kind of made my skin crawl. 

                                 ANA
                        Could you describe him?

                                 FEMALE MOTEL GUEST
                        He was white. Probably in his 
                        fifties. Not fat but not exactly 
                        skinny either. Goatee. And it 
                        looked like he had a bunch of 
                        tattoos.

           Ana reaches in her bag.

                                 ANA
                        Is this him?

           Ana pulls out a crumpled printout of Ronnie Burnett’s 
           mugshot. The woman nods.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER

           Ana and Seth toss their bags and recording equipment onto the 
           respective beds in their new room.

           Seth puts the deadbolt and the chain lock on the door. He 
           closes the curtains and peeps out through a gap. 

           Ana flops onto her bed and begins scrolling through social 
           media on her phone.

                        check it out.

                        Yeah. The locks here clearly suck. 

           Seth stands by the curtain peering out onto the empty parking 
           lot.

           Ana rolls over and turns out the light. A moment later her 
           phone BUZZES. She checks it.

           ANGLE ON a new message from @southwillrise88

           “came calling. nobody home. see you soon bitch”

           Ana furrows her brow. She replies:

           “How does tomorrow work for you?”

           Send.

           THE NEXT MORNING

           Seth snaps awake in the chair where he was keeping watch. He 
           moans and rubs his neck.

                        you, Seth?

           Ana steps out of the bathroom, already showered and dressed, 
           drying her hair. Annoyingly energetic. Seth groans. 

                                 ANA
                        C’mon. Get ready. 

                                 SETH
                        Why?

                                 ANA
                        We’re gonna go interview Ronnie 
                        Burnett.
                                 SETH
                        Again, I’d like to register my 
                        complete objection to this idea.

                                 ANA
                        OK, registered. Now hop in the 
                        shower so we can get a move on.

                                 SETH
                        That’s not how my complete 
                        objection works!

                                 ANA
                        Seth, this is it. This is what 
                        solves a literal murder and takes 
                        the show to the next level. 
                        Everything we’ve worked for. We 
                        nail him. On tape. We’re heroes. 
                        Justice for Dora. Case closed.

           Seth takes a deep breath and they stare at each other.

                                 ANA
                        Look at me: Ronnie Burnett is not 
                        going to hurt me.

                                 SETH
                        Cool. What about me?

           Ana pauses and considers this for a moment. She cocks her 
           head.

                                 SETH
                        ...Ana, what about me?!

                                 ANA
                        I’m joking. You’re safe, Seth. And 
                        honestly I’d go without you but, 
                        you know...

           Ana pantomimes turning a steering wheel and beeping a horn. 
           Seth frowns.

                                 SETH
                        That’s not how driving works.

           EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

           Seth and Ana drive the twisting backroads of Corbett County. 
           Forested mountains loom on either side of the road, casting 
           deep shadows into the valley.
           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Ana attempts to make a phone call as Seth drives.

                                 ANA
                        Hi... right, yes. This is Ana Cohen 
                        from I Heart Murder... Ana Cohen.. 
                        I’m just returning Dan Pedrossian’s 
                        call... Hello? Hi, I can’t--Sorry, 
                        breaking up... Hello?

           The call is dropped.

                                 ANA
                        Damn it. The cell service is 
                        terrible around here.

                                 SETH
                        Ana, I’m having a slow-rolling 
                        panic attack. If we’re really doing 
                        this shouldn’t we at least... buy a 
                        gun or something? I mean, you can 
                        just do that here, right?

           Ana laughs.

                                 ANA
                        What would you do with a gun, Seth?

                                 SETH
                             (mumbling)
                        ...I could use a gun... I could 
                        shoot a guy with my new gun.

           WHOOP! WHOOP! Ana sees a Sheriff’s Department cruiser in the 
           rearview mirror, lights flashing. 

                                 SETH
                        Aw, Christ.

           Seth pulls over. 

           EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Joe Ivey, gets out of the car and walks toward the vehicle. 
           Deputy Tony Yates reluctantly follows.

                                 SETH
                        Was I, uh, speeding or something, 
                        offic--

                                 JOE
                        Shut the fuck up.
                                 SETH
                        OK.

           Joe stares at Ana, his face a mask of rage. He’s breathing so 
           hard he’s practically panting.

                                 ANA
                        Hello, Joe. We meet at last. 

                                 JOE
                        You ruined my life.

                                 ANA
                        Just doing my job. Speaking of 
                        which...

           Ana holds up her iPhone and starts to film the interaction.

                                 ANA (CONT'D)
                        ...just want to let you know you’re 
                        being recorded.

                                 JOE
                        It’s all some kind of game to you. 
                        But I had a family. My wife left 
                        me. Took my kids. People I’ve known 
                        my whole life think I’m a fucking 
                        murderer now.

                                 TONY
                        Easy, Joe. 

                                 ANA
                        I’d say the wife thing’s on you if 
                        you didn’t run the whole “open 
                        relationship” thing by her first. 
                        But I’d be happy to do a formal 
                        interview where you set the record 
                        straight about Dora’s death--

           CRACK! Joe punches the back driver side window, making a 
           spiderweb crack. Ana and Seth flinch back. Blood trickles 
           down Joe’s knuckles. 

                                 ANA
                        ...I guess that’s a “No”?

           Tony stares at the ground and chuckles nervously.

                                 TONY
                        All right, Joe. Losing it is the 
                        last thing you need to do right 
                        now.
                                 JOE
                        I’m in control, Tony.

           Joe slowly turns toward Ana. She sees one of his eyes has 
           burst a blood vessel. He speaks very slowly, almost calmly. 
           Terrifying.

                                 JOE
                        This is a warning: you have no sway 
                        down here. You’re nothing in West 
                        Virginia. You poke around where you 
                        don’t belong and you will get hurt. 
                        Maybe worse. 

           Joe turns and walks back toward the cruiser leaving Tony 
           awkwardly standing there.

                                 TONY
                        Uh. Sorry about that. He’s just-- 
                        well, that’s Joe for you.

           Tony shrugs and follows Joe to the car. The cruiser PEELS out 
           speeding past Seth and Ana’s Nissan.

           A beat. Seth exhales.

                                 SETH
                        This goddamn place. Is this what 
                        the rest of the country is like?

                                 ANA
                        Couldn’t say. But that guy sure is 
                        mad.  Suddenly I’m way less sure 
                        that Ronnie Burnett is guilty. 
                        Also... I think I might have a 
                        crush on him.

                        Aw, come on!

           EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - LATER

           Seth and Ana’s Nissan turns off the main road onto a gravel 
           side road heading up the mountain and into the woods.

           INT. CAR - DAY 

           Ana spots a ramshackle house at the end of the road. 

                                 ANA
                        This is the place.
           Seth pulls over and takes a deep breath.

                                 ANA
                        Relax. The whole world knows 
                        exactly where we are.

           EXT. BURNETT HOUSE - DAY

           Ana and Seth, carrying recorder and microphone, slowly walk 
           onto a rundown property at the end of a dark holler. At the 
           edge of the woods stands a dilapidated one-story house. A 
           rusty black Ford truck is parked out front.

           The patchy front yard is littered with junk: an old washer-
           dryer, a rusted out lawnmower, a pile of cinder blocks and 
           more. A faded Confederate flag and a Nazi flag flutter side 
           by side on the side on a flagpole. 

                                 SETH
                        Jesus.

           Flies buzz around a flayed deer that hangs on a tree. Clearly 
           dead awhile. It reeks and maggots continuously boil out of 
           its eye sockets. Nearby a hunting knife, encrusted with fur 
           and dried blood, is jammed into a tree stump.

           Seth frantically fumbles with his phone. 

                                 SETH
                             (quietly)
                        Goddammit. Still no service. Ana if 
                        something happens we can’t even--

           THUNK! A crossbow bolt lodges in the deer carcass 3 feet 
           ahead of them. Seth SCREAMS. Ana whirls and scans the woods. 
           Her heart is racing. Nobody there. The dead deer spins lazily 
           from the impact.

                                 ANA
                        ...Hello?

           A beat. From the weeds a filthy blond boy, TRAVIS (10), 
           emerges laughing. He tosses a heavy hunting crossbow onto the 
           ground.

                                 ANA
                        ...Is your father home?

                                 TRAVIS
                        He ain’t my Daddy bitch.

                                 RONNIE
                        But I am home.
           REVEAL Ronnie Burnett is now standing, shirtless, in the 
           darkened doorway of his house.

                                 RONNIE
                        Might as well come on in. 

           Ronnie turns and disappears inside. Seth and Ana look at each 
           other. They follow him.

           INT. BURNETT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The inside of the house is dark and squalid, flies circling 
           piles of trash and rotting food. It’s a backwoods drug den.

           Two rail-thin women, who might be 20 or 50, MISTY and AMBER, 
           nod off on the floor. Ronnie steps over them. He cracks a 
           beer and sits down on his ratty couch. Ronnie gestures to a 
           pair of folding lawn chairs. Seth and Ana awkwardly sit. A 
           porno DVD plays silently on the TV behind them.

                                 RONNIE
                        Now...

           Ronnie moves a Tweety Bird blanket to reveal an AR-15 with a 
           CeraKote Confederate Flag design on it, laying on the couch 
           beside him.

                                 RONNIE (CONT'D)
                        Tell me why I shouldn’t blow your 
                        fucking heads off for trespassing 
                        on my goddamn property.

           A beat. Ana tries her best not to react.

                                 ANA
                        Because we’re just here to listen. 
                        To your story.

                                 RONNIE
                        ‘Course. You people are always so 
                        inquisitive, ain’t you? Some would 
                        say nosy.

           Ana doesn’t take the bait. Ronnie picks up the AR-15. In the 
           half light, his eyes are bloodshot, crazy.

                                 RONNIE 
                        But I’m an honest American and I

                        questions long as you answer mine. 
                        And you tell the truth now...
           Ronnie chambers a bullet.

                        Or I’m gonna get real unhappy.

                        Works for me. We rolling Seth?

           Seth checks the equipment and nods. Ana leans in.

                                 ANA
                        Ronnie Burnett, I want to ask you 
                        for the record, did you murder Dora 
                        Bishop?

           Ronnie gives a rancid grin.

                                 RONNIE
                        Nope. My turn: You scared right now 
                        honey?

                                 ANA
                        Of course.

                                 RONNIE
                        That’s good. You should be scared 
                        of a white man. A white man is 
                        powerful.

                                 ANA
                        Great to know. Did you break into 
                        our motel room? Have you been 
                        sending me threatening DMs?

           Seth and Ana jump into their car and slam the doors. Seth

                        phone. Speaking of which... 

           Ana waves her own phone around as the car descends the twisty 
           road down from the holler.

                        bars!

           ANGLE ON Ana’s phone. She quickly begins to type a social 
           media message:

           - @RyeCatM: “Do not trust him. He’s a snake. Look deeper.”

           - @theliza: “He is guilty and should burn in hell.”

           Ana starts to argue but before she can, her phone RINGS. It’s 
           an unlisted number. She answers.

                                 ANA

           EXT. DORA'S MOM'S HOUSE - DAY

           Ana and Seth’s car pulls up in front of a well-kept two-story 
           house closer to the center of town. Seth and Ana get out.

                                 ANA
                        OK, this is a very delicate 
                        situation. We need to tread lightly 
                        here.

                        do that? 

           Ana rings the bell. After a moment a woman answers the door. 
           JOYCE BLAIR (late 40s) looks strangely dressed up, too much  
           make-up with big hoop earrings and a sparkly sequin sweater. 

                                 ANA
                        Hello, we spoke on the phone.

                                 JOYCE
                        Welcome, welcome. Nice to finally 
                        meet you. Come on in.

           INT. DORA'S MOM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, the house is a shrine to Dora Bishop. Photos from 
           childhood, her beauty pageants, college graduation, all the 
           way through 2015, cover nearly every surface. Heartbreaking. 

           Ana and Seth follow Joyce through the eerily quiet house.

                                 ANA
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t even think to 
                        ask your name over the phone.

                                 JOYCE
                        It’s Joyce. Joyce Blair. 

           She extends her hand. Ana shakes it, looking a little 
           confused.

                                 JOYCE (CONT'D)
                        Can I get y’all anything? Sweet 
                        tea? Coke?

           Ana shakes her head.

                                 SETH
                        I’m good. Thank you.
           Joyce leads them into a living room. More photos of Dora 
           stare back at them from the walls.

           In a wheelchair in the corner sits BERNICE BISHOP (60s) Dora 
           Bishop’s mother, breathing from an oxygen tank. She looks 
           terrible, broken. Her skin is gray, her hair is unwashed, her 
           eyes are hollow. She silently stares at nothing. 

                                 ANA
                             (quietly to Seth)
                        Dora’s mother.

           An awkward beat.

                                 ANA
                        Hello, Ms. Bishop. I-- I just want 
                        to say how sorry I am for your 
                        loss.

           Bernice doesn’t respond.

                                 JOYCE
                        Bernice is not feeling well today.

           Joyce grabs the wheelchair handles

                                 JOYCE
                             (loudly to Bernice)
                        OK IT’S TIME TO GO WATCH TV NOW.

           Joyce wheels Bernice into the adjoining TV room. She returns, 
           closing the door behind her. She takes a seat at the dining 
           room table.

                        She’s been through so much.

                                 SETH
                        Would another time be better? We 
                        could always come back--

                                 JOYCE
                        No, I’m happy to answer your 
                        questions.

                                 ANA
                        Look, I don’t mean to be rude, but--

           Seth places a calming hand on Ana’s arm. 

                                 SETH
                        We were really hoping it would be 
                        possible to speak with Dora’s, ah, 
                        immediate family.
                                 JOYCE
                        I represent the family.

                                 ANA
                        And who are you again?

                                 JOYCE
                        Joyce Blair.

                                 ANA
                        Yeah. You said that.

                                 JOYCE 
                        My mama is a Bishop. She and 
                        Bernice are first cousins. So I’m 
                        Dora’s cousin.

                                 ANA
                        Second cousin.

                                 JOYCE
                        Exactly. Now, before we get 
                        started, I just wanted to ask... 
                        how much do y’all pull in a week 
                        from those mattress ads?

                                 SETH
                        What?

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m sorry. Was that rude? I only 
                        ask because I happen to be an 
                        fellow entrepreneur myself. I have 
                        two passions in life: wellness and 
                        business 

                                 SETH
                        OK?

                                 JOYCE
                        I own a multi-level marketing 
                        franchise called ZoobaLife, which 
                        is an herbal energy drink system.

           She hands Seth a business card with a picture of a strange 
           green beverage on it. Seth looks at it for an awkward moment.

                                 SETH
                        Mmm. Gotcha.

           He tries to hand the card back to her. Joyce doesn’t take it.
                                 JOYCE
                        So, what I’m looking for is the 
                        opportunity to create some, ah, 
                        synergy between our two brands.

                                 SETH
                        I’m sorry, I don’t really follow.

                                 JOYCE
                             (re: card)
                        I have an online store.

                                 SETH
                        Oooh. OK. I see. Well, we don’t 
                        really do advertising like that. 

           Joyce’s eyes narrow.

                                 JOYCE
                        As I said, I have information that 
                        may be crucial.

                                 SETH
                        Don’t you want to solve your 
                        cousin’s murder for its own sake?

                                 JOYCE
                        Second cousin. And I don’t see why 
                        we can’t both benefit here. 

           Ana and Seth look at each other. Ana takes the business card 
           from Seth. 

                                 ANA
                        This the URL?

           Joyce nods. Ana types something into her phone.

                                 ANA 
                        There. Just posted it from the 
                        show’s account. You’re welcome.

           Joyce immediately softens.

                                 JOYCE
                        Excellent. You should know 
                        Zoobalife increases your baseline 
                        energy level to maximize daily

                        chemicals in caffeine. An spot on 
                        your podcast would really--
                                 ANA
                        We can talk business later. What’s 
                        the information?

                                 JOYCE
                        Well, it pertains to the letter I 
                        mailed you.

           Ana’s eyes widen.

                                 ANA
                        Wait, you’re the one who sent the 
                        envelope to our studio? 

           Joyce nods. Ana holds up Ronnie’s “confession”. 

                                 ANA
                        How did you get this?

           Joyce is confused.

                                 JOYCE
                        I mean, that boy sent them right to 
                        Dora’s house. I found them when I 
                        was going through her belongings. 
                        She kept everything, poor girl.

                                 SETH
                        Found the confession?

                                 JOYCE
                        ...The letters. Cody Varga sent 
                        them to Dora.

           Seth is about to say something but Ana stops him.

                                 ANA
                        Can we see them?

           Almost despite herself, Joyce flashes an unseemly grin and 
           produces a shoebox. She opens it dramatically to reveal that 
           its full of handwritten letters in opened envelopes.

                                 JOYCE
                        The boy sent 244 of these to her. 
                        He was obsessed. Everyone says he’s 
                        some type of Satanist. Y’all know 
                        that right?

           Ana takes one of the letters out of its envelope. The 
           handwriting is small and strange; words crowded onto the 
           page. She reads it.
                                 ANA
                        “I know the time is not right and 
                        you have said it will never be but 
                        I know we can be together. The 
                        things I feel must be true, and 
                        even if you don’t feel them maybe 
                        you will one day? I will be here, 
                        always, waiting for that moment.”

                                 JOYCE
                        They’re all like that.

                                 SETH
                        Yikes.

                                 ANA
                        And you say you contacted our show 
                        about these?

           Joyce is extremely confused now.

                                 JOYCE
                        Yes, I sent you a letter... and you 
                        wrote me back?

                                 SETH
                        No. We never recei--

                                 ANA
                        Can I see what I said to you?

                                 JOYCE
                        Sure?

           Joyce looks through he box and pulls out another envelope. 
           She hands it to Ana.

                                 ANA
                             (reading)
                        “...Thank you for bringing this 
                        material to our attention. For now 
                        we’d like to keep this quiet as it 
                        pertains to our ongoing 
                        investigation of the Bishop case. 
                        But when the time is right, we’d 
                        like to discuss further. Sincerely, 
                        Ana Cohen.”

           Ana checks the envelope. The return address is P.O. Box 1810 
           Terrace Park, OH. 

                                 JOYCE
                        I figured since y’all were here in 
                        town, the time was right.
                                 ANA
                        How did you get this address?

                                 JOYCE
                        When I found the letters, I reached 
                        out to the podcast through social 
                        media. Your assistant replied and 
                        gave it to me.  

                                 ANA
                        Do you remember the assistant’s 
                        name?

           Joyce shrugs and chuckles. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Couldn’t say. You must have a lot 
                        of people working for you if you 
                        can’t keep track of all of them. I 
                        hope to get to that point with my 
                        business.

                                 ANA
                        Can I take these letters?

           Joyce puts her hand on the box, a little too quickly.

                                 JOYCE
                        ...I’m not sure Dora would want 
                        them out there. I mean she was a 
                        very private person.

           Awkward beat.

                                 ANA
                        You know, maybe we could record a 
                        30-second post-roll ad for your 
                        Zoobalife store?

                                 JOYCE
                        Oh my God, that would mean the 
                        world to me! I really, really 
                        believe in the product.

           Joyce slides the box over to Ana.

                                 ANA
                        Before we go, do you think there’s 
                        any chance we could talk to 
                        Bernice.

                                 JOYCE
                        I don’t see why not.
           INT. DORA'S MOM'S HOUSE - TV ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ana cracks the door and Seth follows close behind. Bernice 
           sits in her wheelchair staring past the muted TV at nothing.

                                 ANA
                        Hi again, Mrs. Bishop. I just 
                        wanted to talk to you. For our 
                        podcast.

           Bernice doesn’t respond.

                                 ANA
                        We’ve been working really hard to 
                        try and tell your daughter’s story

           Long beat.

                                 BERNICE
                        ...My daughter’s story.

                                 ANA
                        Yes.

                                 BERNICE
                        Her story? Her story. Her story is 
                        over now.

                                 ANA
                        No, what I mean to say is--

           Bernice turns and stares Ana right in the eyes. Perfect 
           clarity.

                                 BERNICE
                        You don’t have children do you?

                                 ANA
                        No. I’m not sure that’s in the 
                        cards for me.

                                 BERNICE
                        When you have a child your soul 
                        goes into them. Your own soul. It 
                        lives outside your body now. It’s 
                        in another person.

                                 ANA
                        I can only imagine.

                                 BERNICE
                        Yes. You can only imagine.
                        When Dora died, I died. Only... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BERNICE (CONT'D)
                             (regarding her own hands)
                        my body is somehow still alive? 

                                 ANA
                        Mrs. Bishop, I’m trying to find the 
                        person responsible.

           Bernice suddenly stands, causing Ana to flinch backwards.

                                 BERNICE
                        Don’t you understand? It doesn’t 
                        matter who’s responsible because 
                        it’s NOT going to bring her back. 
                        NOTHING will ever bring her back. 
                        Nothing.

           Bernice grabs Ana by the shoulders, implacably strong. She 
           pulls Ana closer against her will. 

                                 BERNICE
                        And whoever did it? They killed 
                        Dora once. But you? You keep 
                        killing her. Every week. Over. And 
                        over. And over again...

                                 ANA
                        I--

                                 BERNICE
                        YOU KEEP KILLING MY DAUGHTER! YOU 
                        KEEP KILLING ME!

           Ana struggles and breaks free of her grasp but stumbles 
           backward, knocking over a coffee table. Seth helps her 
           scramble out of the room. 

                                 BERNICE
                             (yelling after them)
                        YOU KEEP KILLING ME!

           INT. CAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Seth and Ana get into their car. For the first time Ana looks 
           pale and frightened. Seth goes to start the car and then 
           pauses.

                                 SETH
                        You can’t... It’s not really about 
                        you... she’s a grieving mother 
                        so... you know.
                                 ANA
                        Just drive.
                             (re: box of letters)
                        We have to find Cody Varga.

           EXT. VARGA TRAILER - LATER

           Seth and Ana exit their car at a small trailer park by the 
           train tracks and surrounded by woods. They approach a 
           tumbledown double-wide that is completely covered in 
           graffiti. “MURDERER”; “FRY IN HELL DEVIL WORSHIPPER”; “YOU 
           DID IT” are spray-painted on the outside. 

           Nearby a Yamaha 4-wheeler, much cleaner than the trailer, is 
           parked under a blue tarp nailed between three pine trees.

           Ana knocks on the door.

           JACKIE VARGA, a wary-eyed woman in her late 40s who looks 
           much older, cracks the door. She keeps the chain lock 
           fastened.

                                 JACKIE
                        What?

                                 ANA
                        Hello, Ms. Varga. We’re looking for 
                        your son.

                                 JACKIE
                        Grandson. What did he do?

                                 ANA
                        We’d just like to talk to him.

                                 JACKIE
                        Well I don’t know where the hell he 
                        is. He don’t tell me nothing. Four-
                        wheeler’s here so try the school. 
                        Reckon he still goes sometimes.

                                 SETH
                        Ah. Well, maybe you wouldn’t mind 
                        answering a few--

           She slams the door in Seth’s face.

           INT. GLENCOE HIGH SCHOOL - LATER

           Ana and Seth walk across the parking lot toward the high 
           school. 
           It’s lunch time and a few hundred HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS mill 
           around outside. Seth attempts to somehow hold his recording 
           equipment in an inconspicuous way.

                                 SETH
                        ...So are we going to clear this 
                        with the front office or what?

                                 ANA
                        There’s no way they’d say yes. 
                        Forgiveness not permission, Seth. 
                        Haven’t you learned that yet? Just 
                        be discrete--

                                 RANDOM TEEN
                        Hey, murder lady!

           Ana turns to see a group of TEENS standing in a cluster.

                                 ANA
                        That’s Ms. Cohen to you, but yes.

           A RANDOM TEEN steps forward. His face is totally ashen. He 
           looks around nervously.

                                 RANDOM TEEN
                        Look, I have to tell you something.

                                 ANA
                        What?

                                 RANDOM TEEN
                        I know who killed Ms. Bishop but... 
                             (nervous whisper)
                        I’m scared to say.

                                 ANA
                        Who was it?

                                 RANDOM TEEN
                        ...Me!

           His friends burst out laughing. 

                                 ANOTHER TEEN
                        Don’t listen to him. He’s just 
                        trying to protect me. I did it. I 
                        killed her. And I’d do it again, 
                        too!

                                 TEEN #3
                        I honestly think it was Principal 
                        Lynch. Guy’s an asshole.
           More laughter.

                                 LYNETTE
                        All right. Break it up geniuses.

           Lynette Hagan approaches and the teens disperse. Still, most 
           of the other students and a few of the FACULTY are staring at 
           Ana and Seth from a distance now. Everyone knows who they 
           are.

                                 LYNETTE
                             (quietly)
                        I really don’t think y’all are 
                        supposed to be here.

                                 ANA
                        We just wanted a quick chat with 
                        Cody Varga.

                                 LYNETTE
                        You... really think he did it?

           Ana shrugs.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Well when he bothers to show up for 
                        school, Cody has vo-tech up in 
                        Blackwell for half the day. If you 
                        want to talk to him, he gets back 
                        at 3. But you didn’t hear it from 
                        me.

           Lynette disappears into the crowd.

           INT. CAR - AFTERNOON

           Ana and Seth wait in the rental car. Seth watches the school 
           parking lot while Ana talks on her phone.

                                 ANA
                        Yep... Just returning Dan 
                        Pedrossian’s call. Mmm hmm. Ana 
                        Cohen. From the podcast. No, yeah, 
                        cell service is terrible where I am 
                        so I was hoping... OK, thanks for 
                        taking the message.

           Ana sighs. Outside a school bus pulls up and students to 
           start get off. Seth perks up.

                                 SETH
                        Ana. There.
           EXT. GLENCOE HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Cody Varga exits the bus alone. He has no friends.

           Ana approaches, all smiles.

                                 ANA
                        Cody, hi, again.

                                 CODY
                        I don’t want to talk to you.

           Cody starts to walk away. Ana grabs his arm. Cody stops and 
           turns back. He towers a foot over her at least.

                                 ANA
                        Cody we want to hear your side.

           Ana holds up a new pack of Skittles. Peace offering. Cody 
           stares into Ana’s eyes for a moment. He easily yanks his arm 
           out of her grasp.

                                 CODY
                        No, you don’t actually. 

                                 ANA
                        I promise you we want to 
                        understand. That’s all.

                                 CODY
                        You want a prop. You want a creep, 
                        or a devil-worshiper, or a school-
                        shooter because that’s the role 
                        you’re casting. Right?

                                 ANA
                        You don’t think I know what it’s 
                        like to be an outsider? Please. I 
                        had purple hair and a favorite 
                        serial killer at my all-girls prep 
                        school 

                                 SETH
                        I played Dungeons & Dragons until I 
                        was 19.

                                 CODY
                        Yeah, that’s right. Empathize with 
                        me. Then I’ll confess everything.

                                 ANA
                        ...Is there something you want to 
                        confess.
           Cody sighs and rolls his eyes. Unbelievable.

                                 CODY
                        Look, I’m sorry things were tough 
                        for you at your rich girl school 
                        but I am completely alone in this 
                        town. I doubt you have any idea 
                        what that’s like.

                                 ANA
                        I-- I guess I don’t.

                                 CODY
                        The world does one thing to people 
                        like me. It’s just a matter of 
                        when.

           Cody puts a pair of earbuds in and starts to walk away.

                                 CODY
                        Don’t contact me ever again. I 
                        don’t want to talk to you.

                                 ANA
                        We have your letters.

           Cody stops. 

                                 CODY
                        What did you say? 

                                 ANA
                        The letters you sent to Dora.

           Cody turns, his eyes burning.

                                 CODY
                        Those are not for you!

           He lunges toward Ana. Seth steps in his path.

                                 SETH
                        Hey, c’mon. Easy, big guy.

           CRACK! Cody decks Seth who crumples to the ground. Cody leaps 
           on top of him and starts pummeling him. Ana tries to get him 
           off, but Cody easily throws her aside, knocking her down.

                                 ANA
                        Help! Somebody help!

                                 JOE
                        Get off him, freak.
           Joe Ivey drags Cody off of Seth by the hair.

                                 JOE
                        You’re 18 now, Cody. That means big 
                        boy jail.

                                 CODY
                        Fuck you.

           Enraged, Joe rears back to slug Cody. Tony grabs his arm. 

                                 TONY
                             Not again, Joe. 

           Joe somehow masters himself. Instead, he violently wrenches 
           the boy’s arms behind his back and cuffs him. 

           Seth moans on the ground, his face bloodied.

                                 ANA
                        Thank you. I don’t know what we--

                                 JOE
                        Shut up.
                             (to Seth)
                        You. Up. You’re under arrest. 
                        Disorderly conduct.

                                 ANA
                        What? But he attacked us!

                                 JOE
                        That’s for a fucking judge to 
                        figure out. You shouldn’t be here 
                        on school grounds. That’s why we 
                        got called. I’m hauling your ass in 
                        too.

           He grabs Ana by the wrist. A CROWD of students and faculty 
           has formed now, staring at the scene. Lynette Hagan steps 
           forward. 

                                 LYNETTE
                        C’mon now, Joe. I saw the whole 
                        thing. She wasn’t part of the 
                        fight. You can let her slide on the 
                        trespassing, can’t you?

           Joe stares at Lynette hard for a long moment, nostrils 
           flaring. Lynette holds her hands out and something unspoken 
           passes between them. Almost imperceptibly, Joe softens. 
                                 JOE
                        ...Fine.
                             (re: Seth and Cody)
                        But the other two are mine.

           Tony steps forward and helps Seth up. He shrugs 
           apologetically. 

                                 TONY
                        Sorry, son. Not up to me.

           Tony handcuffs Seth, who is still groggy from the beating.

                                 ANA
                        Don’t worry Seth. I’ll get you out. 
                        You hang in there...

           Seth doesn’t answer. Ana watches as Cody and Seth are both 
           loaded into sheriff’s cruisers and are driven away.

                                 RANDOM TEEN
                        ...Wow. That sucks, murder lady.

                                 ANA
                        Shut up.

           Ana carries the recording equipment across the parking lot to 
           the rented Nissan Versa. She looks at the car, then looks at 
           the keys. She sighs.

           Ana pulls out her phone and types a social media post: 

           “No Uber in Glencoe, WV so I’m about to walk the 3 miles back 
           to my motel. Oh and my producer just went to jail. [cowboy 
           hat smiley-face emoji] #outlaws #IHeartMurder”

           Send. 

           EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - EVENING

           The sun sets and darkness gathers as Ana, laden with 
           recording equipment, walks along the shoulder of a two-lane 
           highway. Every few minutes a car whizzes past. Otherwise it’s 
           deathly quiet.

           A vehicle behind Ana slows down to her walking speed. Ana 
           keeps walking. The car continues to follow. Ana stops and the 
           vehicle stops. She turns but she can’t see anything in the 
           glare of the headlights.

                                 ANA
                        ...Hello?
           A woman leans out of the window of the green Toyota. Ana 
           recognizes her. It’s the female guest from the Chief Logan 
           Inn.

                                 FEMALE MOTEL GUEST
                        You need a ride, honey?

           INT. GREEN TOYOTA - CONTINUOUS

           Ana climbs into the passenger side of the vehicle. The driver 
           is TRACEY MILBANK (40s), plump and cheerful.

                                 ANA
                        Thank you so much, ah... I don’t 
                        think I got your name the other 
                        night.

                                 TRACEY
                        Tracey Milbank. Glad I recognized 
                        you from the road. Did your car 
                        break down?

                                 ANA
                        Something like that... I don’t 
                        technically know how to drive.

                                 TRACEY
                        My gosh. How do you get anywhere?

                                 ANA
                        Take the subway. Maybe a Lyft if 
                        I’m feeling rich. I live in New 
                        York.

                                 TRACEY
                        Oh, I visited New York City one 
                        time. Don’t think I could live 
                        there. Too crowded. Plus there’s 
                        all the gangs and whatnot.

                                 ANA
                        Fun fact: the state of West 
                        Virginia actually has a higher 
                        murder rate than New York City.

           Awkward beat.

                                 ANA (CONT'D)
                        ...OK maybe it’s not a fun fact per 
                        se.
                                 TRACEY
                        Well, I’m from Ohio, anyway. So 
                        what brings you down this way? You 
                        said it was a “podcast”?

                                 ANA
                        Yep. Hoping to solve a murder.

                                 TRACEY
                        The awful one I heard about on the 
                        news?

                                 ANA
                        Probably.

                                 TRACEY
                        Doesn’t everybody think the drug 
                        dealer man did it?

                                 ANA
                        At this point I’m not so sure.

                                 TRACEY
                        They said he’s got a criminal 
                        record. Didn’t he kill his wife or 
                        something?

                                 ANA
                        Yeah, but something doesn’t quite 
                        add up.

           Tracey pulls into the parking lot of the Chief Logan Inn.

                                 TRACEY
                        Come to think of it, the man I saw 
                        in the parking lot last night 
                        looked a lot like the picture I saw 
                        on the news... Oh my gosh, maybe it 
                        was him?

                                 ANA
                        Yeah, maybe... Anyway looks like 
                        we’re here. Thanks for the ride.

           Ana gets out of the car. 

                                 TRACEY
                        Alrighty. Good luck solving your 
                        mystery, Ana!

           Tracey smiles cheerily as she pulls away.
           EXT. BURNETT HOUSE - NIGHT

           A gloved hand wrenches the bloody hunting knife out of the 
           stump in Ronnie’s yard.

           INT. LYNNETTE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

           Lynette lounges on her bed in her underwear and talks to 
           someone in the next room.

                                 LYNETTE
                        ...I don’t know. I can’t believe it 
                        was Cody. Dora always had a soft 
                        spot for that boy--

                                 JOE (O.S.)
                        He was stalking her. He’s a goddamn 
                        psycho.

                                 LYNETTE
                        He’s strange sure. But he just 
                        doesn’t strike me as the type. 
                        Ronnie Burnett on the other hand...

           Joe steps back into the bedroom, wearing only his boxers. His 
           jaw is clenched tight and his eyes are intense.

                                 JOE
                        It was Cody, Lynette. And it was my 
                        fucking fault he got off. I roughed 
                        him up during the arrest and his 
                        goddamn lawyer made hay over it.

                                 LYNETTE
                        All right. Calm down, Joe. You’re 
                        the cop. I’m just the high school 
                        admin assistant. I believe you.

           Joe softens. They kiss. Joe pulls away and starts to put on 
           his pants.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Stay.

                                 JOE
                        Can’t. 

           Lynette frowns. Joe continues to get dressed.

                                 LYNETTE
                        This is about your wife.
                                 JOE
                        She’s the mother of my kids, 
                        Lynette. People can’t know that 
                        I’m... You were Dora’s best 
                        friend... It’s just not the time 
                        for us to... go public with this.

                                 LYNETTE
                        “Go public”. Jesus.

                                 JOE
                        Damn it. You know what I mean.

           Joe goes to kiss Lynette again and she turns away. He frowns 
           and finishes buttoning his shirt. He leaves.

           Lynette sighs and turns on the TV. Infomercial. She changes 
           it. Rockford Files episode. She changes it. Weather Channel. 
           She hears a noise. Lynette sits up in her bed. 

                                 LYNETTE
                        Joe?

           Nothing. Lynette gets out of bed.

                                 LYNETTE
                        Joe is that you?

           INT. LYNETTE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN

           Lynette creeps into her darkened kitchen. She flicks on the 
           lights. Nobody there. Lynette breathes a sigh of relief.

           Then she notices that the backdoor is ajar.

           A HULKING FIGURE wearing an orange ski-mask steps out of the 
           pantry behind her. Lynette turns and screams.

           The hulking figure lunges toward her and Lynette bolts.

           INT. LYNETTE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM

           Lynette dives inside her bedroom. She slams the door behind 
           her and locks it. She frantically searches for her phone. At 
           last she finds it on the dresser. She starts to dial.

           CRACK! The huge masked figure bursts through the door, 
           splintering the wood of the frame. Lynette SCREAMS again. 

           The figure tackles her to the ground. Lynette screams again 
           as the figure clamps a gloved hand over her mouth. Her eyes 
           bulge with terror. 
           The figure drags the blade of a stained hunting knife across 
           her throat slicing it open in a fountain of blood. Lynette 
           shudders violently and lets out one last ragged gargle.

           INT. CORBETT SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

           The office phone RINGS. Mrs. Sykes presses a button to send 
           it to voicemail. She scowls as she sees Ana walking through 
           the front door.

                                 MRS. SYKES
                        You again.

                                 ANA
                             (overly cheerful)
                        Good morning to you too! I’m here 
                        to post bail for Seth Howard.

           INT. CORBETT COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - HOLDING CELLS

           Tony Yates leads Ana back into the department’s four holding 
           cells. Seth slumps on a bench inside his cell. Cody Varga 
           broods silently in the next cell over.

           Tony unlocks Seth’s cell door. 

                                 TONY
                        All right, Mr. Howard. You’re free 
                        to go.

                                 SETH
                        Great.

           Seth glares at Ana, clearly pissed. She now sees he’s got a 
           wicked black eye. 

                                 ANA
                        Seth, your eye. Jesus.

                                 SETH
                        I know, right? But hopefully we got 
                        some good audio of me getting my 
                        ass kicked.

           Before Ana can respond, Seth elbows past her out of the cell. 
           Ana notices Cody staring at her. 

                                 ANA
                        ...What?

                                 CODY
                        I don’t torture animals.
                                 ANA
                        OK? 

                                 CODY
                        You said that on your show. You 
                        said I torture animals. But I 
                        don’t. There was a turtle that some 
                        asshole shot with a BB gun. It was 
                        dying, so I put it out of its 
                        misery. I didn’t torture it.

                                 ANA
                        OK. Sure. I’ll issue a correction.
                             (beat)
                        Is somebody coming to bail you out?

                                 CODY
                        Ha. You think I’m worth $500?

                                 ANA
                        What about your grandmother?

                                 CODY
                        There was exactly one person who 
                        ever gave a shit about me. And she 
                        died 3 years ago.

           Cody crosses his arms and turns away. Ana’s phone BUZZES.

           It’s a new message from @southwillrise88:

           “i did it again. you’re next.”

           Before Ana can reply, a YOUNG DEPUTY rushes toward Tony.

                                 YOUNG DEPUTY
                        Tony it just came in over the 
                        radio. We have a Code 12 at 2750 
                        Redbud Drive.

           The color drains from Tony’s face.

                                 TONY
                        ...Code 12? 

                                 YOUNG DEPUTY
                        Yessir. 

                                 TONY
                        Good Lord.

           Tony and the young deputy rush out of the station toward 
           their cruisers.
           Ana hurries after them. Seth follows. 

           EXT. CORBETT COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Ana frantically Googles on her phone as they exit the 
           building.

           Seth stops walking.

                        Stop it with the Nancy Drew shit 
                        Ana. I’m not fucking doing this 
                        anymore!

                                 ANA
                        What?

                                 SETH
                        You get me beat up. Thrown in jail. 
                        What’s next?

                                 ANA
                        Please, Seth. I know I don’t say 
                        this often enough or actually ever, 
                        but... I’m sorry, OK?

           Ana holds up her phone.

                                 ANA (CONT'D)
                        Please. 2750 Redbud Drive is 
                        Lynette Hagan’s address. 

           Seth sighs deeply.

                                 SETH
                        Fine. But after this I’m going 
                        home. You’re on your own down here.

                                 ANA
                        OK. The car is still parked at the 
                        high school so we need to hurry.

           Seth and Ana head off on foot, almost at a jog. 
           EXT. LYNETTE’S HOUSE - LATER

           Seth pulls up to Lynette’s house. The whole yard has been 
           cordoned off with police tape. Various DEPUTIES take photos 
           of the crime scene and collect evidence.

           Sherriff Hammond stands to the side and talks on a cell 
           phone. As he sees Ana and Seth approaching he tries to ignore 
           her..

                                 ANA
                        Excuse me. What happened here?

                                 SHERIFF HAMMOND
                        Can’t talk about it. 

                                 ANA
                        Is Lynette Hagan dead?

                                 SHERIFF HAMMOND
                        This is an active crime scene. Move 
                        along. Now.

                                 ANA
                        How was she killed?

                                 SHERIFF HAMMOND
                        Move along, dammit!

           As Seth and Ana walk back toward their vehicle, they notice 
           Joe Ivey sitting in his cruiser. He stares straight ahead, 
           both hands gripping the steering wheel, knuckles white. He’s 
           virtually catatonic.

           Ana taps on the window. Joe turns toward her. She is 
           surprised to see his eyes are full of tears.

                                 ANA
                        Joe, what happened.

                                 JOE
                        Lynette’s been... Somebody... 
                        somebody cut her throat.

                                 ANA
                        Who?

                                 JOE
                        I don’t know... but when I find 
                        them they’re fucking dead....

           Joe starts to sob. Ana doesn’t quite know what to do.
                                 ANA
                        I’m... sorry, Joe.

           Joe doesn’t respond. Ana regroups with Seth.

                                 ANA
                        This is connected to Dora. The 
                        creep account messaged me again.

           She shows Seth the latest message from @southwillrise88 on 
           her phone.

                                 SETH
                        And Cody couldn’t have done it. He 
                        was locked up with me all night.

                                 ANA
                        Damn it. I was wrong. I mean I was 
                        right all along. It’s got to be 
                        Ronnie.

           Ana returns to Sheriff Hammond, who again tries to ignore 
           her.

                                 ANA
                        Sheriff, you need to arrest Ronnie 
                        Burnett.

                                 SHERIFF HAMMOND
                        Here we go again with this bull 
                        puck. Did you see something, 
                        darling?

                                 ANA
                        No.

                                 SHERIFF HAMMOND
                        Then you can’t just throw around 
                        wild accusations--

                                 ANA
                        Accusations against your cousin? 

                                 SHERIFF HAMMOND
                        That’s not-- That don’t have dick 
                        to do with it. You need evidence to 
                        arrest somebody!

                                 ANA
                        Fine. We’ll get it.

           Ana turns and heads back toward the car. She starts to unload 
           the recording equipment cases. Seth watches her.
                                 SETH
                        What are you doing?

                                 ANA
                        You don’t have to drive me to 
                        Ronnie’s place. I can walk. It’s 
                        only...

           Ana checks her phone.

                                 ANA (CONT'D)
                        5.2 miles.

           Seth grits his teeth and shakes his head.

                                 SETH
                        Don’t be an idiot. Get in the damn 
                        car.

           A small smile spreads across Ana’s face as Seth wearily 
           climbs into the driver’s seat. 

                                 ANA
                        I just need to make one quick stop 
                        first.

           INT. CORBETT COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT - DAY

           Mrs. Sykes sighs and closes her eyes. She smiles. For once 
           the phones are silent. Someone walks through the front door. 
           She opens her eyes and sees Ana. Mrs. Sykes glares. 

                                 MRS. SYKES
                        Oh, hell no.

                                 ANA
                        Yep. Just can’t stay away.

                                 MRS. SYKES
                        What do you want this time?

                                 ANA
                        I’d like to post bail for Cody 
                        Varga.

           Ana slaps some bills down on the desk and turns to leave. 
           Mrs. Sykes is confused. She counts the money and sees that 
           under the bills is a pack of Skittles. The phone starts to 
           RING.
           EXT. BURNETT HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Seth and Ana exit their car and cross Ronnie Burnett’s yard. 
           His truck is gone. The rotting deer carcass slowly twists in 
           the wind. Ronnie’s ramshackle house looms ominously ahead. 
           Seth notices something.

                                 SETH
                        Look. The knife is gone.

           Sure enough the stump no longer has the crusty hunting knife 
           lodged in it. Ana takes a deep breath and looks around. The 
           woods are eerily quiet. She pounds on the door. There’s an 
           instant of unbearable silence.

           Misty -- one of the two women Seth and Ana saw before -- 
           answers the door. She seems bleary-eyed and disoriented in 
           the light of day. 

                                 MISTY
                        What’re you... what do y’all want?

                                 ANA
                        We’re looking for Ronnie. 

           Misty shakes her head.

                                 MISTY
                        Ain’t here.

                                 ANA
                        How long has he been gone?

                                 MISTY
                        I don’t... I’m not...

           Misty is thoroughly befuddled. The boy, Travis, edges forward 
           from behind her.

                                 TRAVIS
                        He’s been gone since yesterday.

                                 SETH
                        Did he say where he was going?

           Travis grins.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Yeah. Up your ass. 
           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Someone watches Ana and Seth from the trees as they walk back 
           toward their car and get in.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Seth and Ana drive along the curvy ridgeline road back toward 
           town.

                                 SETH
                        So what do we do now?

                                 ANA
                        I guess we try to find Ronnie, but 
                        I don’t know where to--

           Ana’s phone RINGS, startling her and Seth. A moment of decent 
           cell reception. She slowly answers it. 

                                 ANA
                        ...Hello?

           INT. PODCASTING STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           Sharon sits at her desk in front of her computer screen.

                                 SHARON 
                        Hi, Ana it’s me.

                                 ANA (O.S.)
                        Jesus, Sharon. You scared the shit 
                        out of me.

                                 SHARON 
                        I’m... sorry?

                                 ANA (O.S.)
                        No, no, it’s fine. We’re just kinda 
                        busy right now. What’s up?

                                 SHARON
                        I wanted to touch base and make 
                        sure you guys are OK. I’ve been 
                        checking the forums and... Was 
                        there, like, another murder?  
           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                                 ANA
                        Yeah. Somebody already posted about 
                        it?

                                 SHARON (O.S.)
                        Mmm hmm. This morning.
                             (reading off computer)
                        “Just read about another killing 
                        down in Glencoe. Lynette Hagan, 
                        Dora’s best friend, has been 
                        brutally murdered. Looks like 
                        Ronnie Burnett struck again. When 
                        will this animal be locked up?”

                                 ANA
                        Who posted it?

                                 SHARON (O.S.)
                        Somebody called RyeCatM. 

                                 ANA
                        Is there a timestamp on the post?

                                 SHARON
                        Uh, 6:52 AM. I tried to Google the 
                        murder but... I couldn’t find 
                        anything.

           It slowly dawns on Ana.

                                 ANA
                        That’s because there haven’t been 
                        any news stories about it yet... 
                        Thanks Sharon, I have to go.

                        OK. Stay safe.

           Ana hangs up. She takes a deep breath.

                                 ANA
                        Seth, I think somebody’s trying to 
                        frame Ronnie Burnett. And I think 
                        they might have killed Lynette to 
                        do it.

                                 SETH
                        What?

                                 ANA
                        First they pretend to be Ronnie 
                        online to bait me.

                        confession. Now they’re talking up 
                        Lynette’s murder online like Ronnie 
                        did it.

                        I don’t know, Ana. It’s a big 
                        coincidence, sure, but--

                                 ANA
                        They implicated him before the 
                        police even knew! 

                                 SETH
                        It’s weird... but couldn’t it just 
                        be some local busybody who already 
                        heard about it somehow? Like, from 
                        whoever called it in maybe? Gossip 
                        seems to be the fastest-moving 
                        thing around here.

           Ana considers this.

                        We could do a test. If I say Ronnie 
                        is innocent again, I bet they’ll 
                        react...

           ANGLE ON Ana’s phone as she composes a social media post: 

           “Wow. Just received some very compelling new evidence that 
           completely exonerates Ronnie Burnett. Stay tuned Murder 
           Hearters! #IHeartMurder”

           Send.

           Ana lowers her phone. Immediately it BUZZES. 

                                 ANA
                        It’s a reply. From RyeCatM.

           ANGLE ON a direct message on Ana’s phone: 

           @RyeCatM: “what evidence?”

           Ana chews her lip. She types back:

           “I know you’re involved in Lynette’s murder. I know you’re 
           trying to set up Ronnie Burnett. Tell me who you really are.”

           Send.

                                 SETH
                        ...Anything?
           Ana waits. Nothing. She sags, disappointed. Then she types a 
           direct message to @southwillrise88. 

           “Maybe you prefer using this account?” 

           Send. 

           A beat. With a horrendous CRASH their car is t-boned off the 
           side of the road. It tumbles over the lip of the ridge into 
           the trees below.

                                                         SMASH TO BLACK

           EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY

           Ana flashes in and out of consciousness. 

           -Ana’s face is covered in blood. She’s still strapped in the 
           passenger seat and a fire is burning somewhere nearby. 

           -Someone, face obscured, drags Ana out of the burning car, 
           but leaves Seth inside. 

           -The person looks at Ana’s phone and types something on it 
           then tosses it onto the ground. Then they gingerly set the 
           cases containing the podcast’s recording equipment on the 
           grass beside her. Ana tries to say something but she can’t 
           speak. Can’t move. Blood drips into her eyes.

           -The figure notices the shoebox full of Cody’s letters, reads 
           one, then sets them alight on the burning car, before 
           leaving.

           -Ana lies on the ground, staring up at the trees. The sky is 
           beautiful. Flashing blue lights mingle with the flickering 
           oranges of the burning car nearby. Ana loses consciousness 
           once more.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           FADE IN:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Ana awakens with a GASP. She looks around to see that she’s 
           in a dark, quiet hospital bed. She has bandages on her face 
           and neck and her right arm is in a cast. An IV drip gives her 
           fluid.

           Behind her a dark figure rises from a chair. Ana whirls, 
           panicked. Joe Ivey holds both hands out.
                                 JOE
                        Easy. 

                                 ANA
                        Where am I? What-- what happened?

                                 JOE
                        Methodist Hospital in Booneville. 
                        You had a car accident. You’re 
                        lucky to be alive. If I’d gotten 
                        there a couple minutes later...

           Ana tries to get up but winces and slumps back down.

                                 JOE
                        Look, I need to find him.

                                 ANA
                        Who?

           Joe’s face hardens into a tight grimace.

                                 JOE
                        Ronnie Burnett. His truck was 
                        abandoned in the parking lot of 
                        your motel. I know you know where 
                        he is. I need to get to him... 
                        before anybody else does.

                                 ANA
                        Why?

                                 JOE
                        You know why.

                                 ANA
                        Joe, he’s innocent.

           A little of Joe’s anger gives way to confusion.

                                 JOE
                        He confessed.

                                 ANA
                        What?

                                 JOE
                        You posted the damn video.

           Joe pulls out his phone and shows the latest post from 
           @iheartmurder:
           VIDEO of Ronnie Burnett. He’s in a dark room. A bright light 
           shines directly in his face. Ronnie looks dazed and speaks in 
           a hoarse whisper. 

                                 RONNIE (VIDEO)
                        My name is Ronald James Burnett and 
                        I’d like to confess to the murder 
                        of Dora Bishop four years ago and 
                        the murder of Lynette Hagan 
                        yesterday. 

           The shaky video cuts off.

                                 ANA
                        No. It’s wrong. Somebody’s forcing 
                        him to say those things. Where’s my 
                        phone?

           Joe looks around and picks it up off a side table and hands 
           it to her. There’s a crack in the screen from the crash, but 
           otherwise it works. Ana checks it. She’s locked out of her 
           social media accounts.

                                 ANA
                        Damn it. He’s using my account. He 
                        changed the password.

                                 JOE
                        Who?

                                 ANA
                        Whoever ran us off the road. 

           Ana starts to get up. She pushes through the pain yanks the 
           IV out of her arm.

                                 JOE
                        What the hell are you doing?

                                 ANA
                        If he’s not already dead, Ronnie 
                        Burnett’s life is in danger. It’s 
                        the same people who killed Lynette. 
                        I have to go.

                                 JOE
                        No goddamn way.

                                 ANA
                        I know where he is, Joe.

                                 JOE
                        Where?
                                 ANA
                        I’ll tell you when we get there. 
                        Where’s Seth?

           INT. SETH’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Joe waits in the hall as Ana, now wearing her own clothes 
           again, enters another hospital room. 

           All of her resolve drains as she sees Seth lying in a 
           hospital bed, unconscious, bandages covering his burns. One 
           arm and both legs are in a cast. His injuries are far worse 
           than Ana’s.

                                 ANA
                             (quietly)
                        Seth?

           No answer.

                                 ANA
                        Seth, are you--

                                 SETH
                             (hoarse whisper)
                        Yeah. 

           Tears start to well in Ana’s eyes.

                                 ANA
                        How-- how bad is it?

                                 SETH
                        It’s bad.

                                 ANA
                        Jesus Christ. What the fuck am I 
                        doing? What the have I done to you?

           Ana breaks down and begins to cry.

                                 ANA (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry, Seth. I’m so sorry.

                                 SETH
                        Yeah.

                                 ANA
                        What was I thinking? It was stupid 
                        to come here. We have to get back 
                        to New York. We have to--

           Seth lets out a horrible, raw sound. He’s laughing. 
                                 SETH
                        Are you fucking kidding me?

           Ana blinks.

                                 ANA
                        What? 

                                 SETH
                        This is where you stop? This is 
                        where you finally give up? 
                        Unbelievable.

                                 ANA
                        No. You were right all along. I 
                        can’t let anyone else get hurt. I 
                        can’t be re--

                                 SETH
                        You are responsible! And for once, 
                        you are going to fucking listen to 
                        me. 

           Ana wipes the tears away from her eyes.

                                 ANA
                        OK, Seth. OK. I’m listening. 

                                 SETH
                        You’re going to finish what you 
                        started. You’re going to make this 
                        matter. 

                                 ANA
                        But--

                                 SETH
                        Make this mean something! 

           Seth slumps back in his bed, asleep or unconscious. 

           Shaken, Ana stumbles backward out into the hall. Joe checks 
           to make sure the coast is clear, and leads her toward the 
           elevator.

           INT. JOE’S CRUISER - NIGHT

           Ana sits in the passenger side. Joe stares straight ahead as 
           he drives. The lights of the oncoming cars cast strange, 
           dancing shadows on their faces. 
                                 JOE 
                        Ronnie Burnett is a human scumbag. 
                        The worst of the worst.

                                 ANA
                        I agree. But killing him is still a 
                        crime.

                                 JOE
                        If we get there, and you’re wrong 
                        about Ronnie being innocent... I’m 
                        going to do what needs to be done.

                                 ANA
                        I probably can’t stop you.

                                 JOE
                        So where the hell are we going 
                        anyway?

           Ana turns to look Joe in the eyes.

                                 ANA
                        Dora Bishop’s house.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Cody Varga races his 4-wheeler down a mountain trail in the 
           darkness. He’s traveling way too fast. Branches claw at him. 
           Tree trunks whip past and he barely manages to avoid them. He 
           seems to have a death wish.

           Cody screeches to a hard stop where the trail crosses the 
           road. A instant later Cody watches Joe’s cruiser speed past, 
           headed up the mountain.

           Cody rips off his helmet.

           EXT. DORA BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Joe’s cruiser pulls up to Dora’s house. It’s abandoned now, 
           falling apart, with black soot stains climbing up from every 
           window. 

                                 ANA
                        Look.

           There is already a car parked here, a green Toyota with a 
           huge dent in the hood.  

                                 JOE
                        Fine. You’re right.
           Joe speaks into his radio. 

                                 JOE
                        This is Officer Ivey requesting 
                        immediate backup out on County Road 
                        655 at the old Bishop place. Over. 

           Joe takes a deep breath, draws his gun, and exits the 
           cruiser. Ana starts to follow him.

                                 JOE
                        What the hell are you doing? Stay 
                        in the car.

           Ana frowns as Joe stalks toward the front steps of the house. 

           INT. DORA BISHOP'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

           Joe slowly opens the door, flashlight in one hand, gun in the 
           other. Inside the house is dark. It’s been burned out and 
           empty for 3 years. The floorboards are warped. Mold and 
           spiderwebs and even a few stray vines creep up the walls.

           INT. DORA BISHOP'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Joe proceeds into the ruined dining room, checking it with 
           his flash light. All clear. Joe hears a MUFFLED WHIMPER. It’s 
           coming from the basement. Joe slowly opens the basement door 
           and descends into darkness. 

           INT. DORA BISHOP'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Joe descends, each step groaning under his weight, into the 
           charred basement. Another WHIMPER. 

           His flashlight beam lands on Ronnie Burnett. Ronnie is 
           completely nude, bound to a blackened chair. His mouth is 
           covered in duct tape but otherwise his face and neck are 
           untouched. The entire rest of his body, however, is marked 
           with burns, bruises and open wounds. Several bloody 
           implements of torture -- pliers, hacksaw, sledgehammer,  
           blowtorch -- are piled on the ground at his feet.

                                 JOE
                        Jesus.

           Ronnie WHIMPERS again. His eyes are practically bulging out 
           of his head. He’s looking at something behind Joe. Joe turns.

           At the top of the stairs a hulking figure in a ski mask now 
           darkens the basement door. 
           The masked figure lunges and Joe raises his gun but it’s a 
           moment too late. BANG! Joe fires wide and the pistol clatters 
           out of his hand, as he is knocked to the floor.

           The two men scuffle on the ground, masked man on top. Joe is 
           strong but the masked man is much bigger and heavier. Joe 
           reaches for his gun but the masked figure stabs the hunting 
           knife all the way through Joe’s palm pinning his hand to the 
           floor. Joe SCREAMS in pain.

           The masked figure wrenches the knife free and goes for Joe’s 
           neck when-- 

           WHAM! Ana swings a hardshell sound equipment case right into 
           the masked man’s face, knocking him off Joe. 

                                 JOE
                        I told you to stay in the car!

                                 ANA
                        I’m not a great listener, Joe.

           The masked man moans and tries to push himself up off the 
           ground. Joe grabs his gun with his left hand. 

                                 JOE
                        Hands up shithead!

           The masked man slowly raises his hands.

                                 JOE
                        Take the fucking mask off!

           The man removes his mask. He’s a bald, doughy man who looks 
           more like a Little League coach than a murderer. Joe doesn’t 
           recognize him. But Ana does: it’s the man staying in Room 207 
           of the Chief Logan Inn.  

                                 JOE
                        Who the fuck is that?

           Before Ana can answer -- THUNK -- crossbow bolt sprouts from 
           Joe’s throat. He wobbles for a moment then falls to the 
           ground, bleeding out of his mouth and neck.

           Ana turns.

           ANGLE ON Tracey Milbank holding Ronnie’s hunting crossbow. 
           Her hair is wild and she wears a blood-stained “I Heart 
           Murder” t-shirt. She smiles strangely, tears welling in her 
           eyes.

                                 ANA
                        ...Tracey?
                                 TRACEY
                        Ana, I’m such a huge fan.

           Tracey loads and cocks another bolt into the crossbow.

                                 TRACEY
                        Sorry I lied to you earlier. But I 
                        had to be undercover to help solve 
                        the mystery. And I did.

           She grins and points to Ronnie Burnett. 

                                 ANA
                        ...Uh huh.

           Ana’s eyes flit to Joe’s gun. The big man, now on his feet,  
           kicks it away.

                                 TRACEY
                        Did you see the video we posted? It 
                        took awhile but Stu and I got 
                        Ronnie to confess. Oh gosh, where’s 
                        my head, I didn’t introduce you to 
                        my husband Stu.

           STU extends a meaty hand. Ana shakes it.

                                 TRACEY
                        He loves the podcast almost as much 
                        as I do. We listen to each episode 
                        over and over again to make sure we 
                        don’t miss anything. It got us 
                        through some real tough times.

           Ana speaks very carefully, hoping not to upset anyone.

                                 ANA
                        ...I’m glad you like my show... So 
                        now that you’ve captured the real 
                        killer, we should take him to the 
                        police--

                                 TRACEY
                        NO! 

           Tracey’s face twitches strangely.

                                 TRACEY
                        They’ll just let him go. They don’t 
                        care.

           Tracey spits at Joe’s corpse.
                                 TRACEY
                        What we want is justice for Dora. 

           Tracey aims the crossbow at Ronnie and a horrid smile spreads 
           across her face.

                                 TRACEY
                        Justice for Dora.

           She shoots. The bolt lodges in his chest with a THUD. Ronnie  
           shudders violently against his ropes and goes limp.

           Ana makes a break for it, darting up the basement stairs. 

                                 TRACEY
                        GET HER!

           Stu lumbers after Ana.

           INT. DORA BISHOP'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ana bursts out of the basement door and stumbles through the 
           darkened house. With no light, she keeps colliding with 
           objects, tripping over burned, broken furniture.

           Ana fumbles with her phone as she flees. She wants to call 
           someone, anyone. “No Service”

                                 ANA
                             (almost crying)
                        God damn it!

           She tries to open the front door but she can’t. Tracey has 
           padlocked it shut. Ana slams her shoulder into it once. 
           Doesn’t budge.

           Ana hears the sounds of Stu in pursuit. She runs up the 
           stairs to the second floor.

           INT. DORA BISHOP'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Ana races down the hallway and ducks into a bathroom. Stu’s 
           heavy footfalls echo on the stairs behind her.

           INT. DORA BISHOP'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ana hides inside the bathtub and yanks the moldy shower 
           curtain closed after her. She’s winded, but she tries her 
           damnedest to not even breathe.
           Ana hears Stu’s steps as he walks down the hallway outside 
           the door. He pauses for an unbearable moment at the bathroom 
           to listen. Then he continues on.

           Ana breathes an inaudible sigh of relief. Her phone RINGS. 

                                 ANA
                        Fuck!

           Ana answers it frantically and screams into the phone.

                                 ANA
                        I’m at Dora Bishop’s house and 
                        they’re trying to kill me!

           INT. STUDIO OFFICE - DAY

           A beautiful office space in Beverly Hills. A tan, handsome 
           man in a deep v-neck black tee shirt, DAN PEDROSSIAN (45) 
           sits at a desk and talks into a speakerphone.

                                 DAN PEDROSSIAN
                        Um... Hi, this is Dan Pedrossian 
                        calling for Ana Cohen?

                                 ANA (O.S.)
                        PLEASE! YOU HAVE TO--

           The phone goes silent.

                                 DAN PEDROSSIAN
                        ...Hello?

           Dan Pedrossian looks at his ASSISTANT. She shrugs.

           INT. DORA BISHOP'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Stu holds Ana’s iPhone that he just crushed in his meaty 
           hand. Ana makes another break for it but Stu grabs her with 
           one arm and hurls her across the room. Ana’s head smashes 
           against a radiator. She instantly loses consciousness.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. DORA BISHOP'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Ana comes to. She’s been tied up to the same support beam 
           where Dora was burned alive. Joe’s body, bolt still 
           protruding from his throat, lies on the ground beside her in 
           a pool of blood. 
           Ana looks up to see Tracey sitting on the stairs nearby, 
           staring at her with unblinking eyes. Stu looms silently 
           behind.

                                 ANA
                             (weakly)
                        Let me go.

                                 TRACEY
                        I can’t. You were looking for 
                        answers. And I knew they were out 
                        there. I wanted to lead you to the 
                        truth. And gosh I thought you would 
                        be happy that all has finally 
                        become clear. 

           She gestures towards Ronnie’s corpse.

                                 ANA
                        He didn’t do it.

                                 TRACEY
                        Yes. He. did. 

                                 ANA
                        You two killed Lynette Hagan just 
                        to frame him.

                                 TRACEY
                        You were losing the thread! You 
                        needed more clues!

                                 ANA
                        She was an innocent victim.

                                 TRACEY
                        Read the message boards! The pieces 
                        are all there! Lynette used drugs. 
                        She was Ronnie’s accomplice. They 
                        murdered Dora Bishop together. Poor 
                        Dora.

           Tracey starts to cry. Her body heaves with big, too-loud 
           sobs. Stu puts a big hand on her shoulder.

                                 ANA
                        ...You’re insane.

           Tracey wipes her eyes.

                                 TRACEY
                        I really hoped it wouldn’t have to 
                        come to this. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TRACEY (CONT'D)
                        But you’re just like the others, 
                        you want to bury the truth. 

           Tracey nods to Stu. The big man places a cheap digital 
           recorder onto the ground in front of her. He plugs in a ten-
           dollar microphone.  

                                 TRACEY
                        So we’re going to have to record 
                        the final episode of I Heart 
                        Murder, right here, right now. You 
                        need to tell the whole world, once 
                        and for all, that Ronnie Burnett is 
                        guilty of Dora Bishop’s Murder. 

           Stu turns the recorder on. Slowly, Tracey levels the crossbow 
           at Ana.

                                 ANA

           THUMP. A muffled noise from upstairs. Stu and Tracey look at 
           each other. 

           EXT. DORA BISHOP’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Tony Yates kicks at the front door of his house.

                                 TONY
                        Joe? Joe, are you in there? 

           Tony kicks again. And again. This time the padlock splinters 
           off the doorjamb.

           INT. DORA BISHOP'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Stu chambers a bullet in Joe’s gun and creeps up the stairs, 
           surprisingly quiet for such a large man. 

           Still aiming the crossbow at Ana, Tracey puts a finger to her 
           lips. Shh. 

           Both of them listen. Footsteps creaking the floorboards above 
           them.

                                 TONY (O.S.)
                             (muffled)
                        Hey, who the hell are--

           Gunshots -- BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! -- a body falls. Silence. 
           Then a single set of quiet footsteps make their way back 
           toward the basement door.
           Tracey’s sick grin returns as she turns back to Ana and holds 
           up the mic.

                                 TRACEY
                        Now repeat after me: My name is Ana 
                        Cohen and you’re listening to I 
                        Heart--

           BANG! The top of Tracey’s head explodes, splattering Ana with 
           blood and gore. Tracey flops forward onto the digital 
           recorder. 

           Tony Yates descends the stairs, smoking gun in his hand.

                                 TONY
                        Well, looks like I got here right 
                        in the nick of time.

                                 ANA
                        You saved my life... I’m sorry... 
                        Joe didn’t... He’s...

           Ana starts to cry. Tony looks at Joe then he stares at her 
           for a long moment as he strokes his jaw.

                                 TONY
                        Well, shoot. You probably shouldn’t 
                        have come down to West Virginia. 

           Ana looks up.

                                 ANA
                        ...What?

                                 TONY
                        Bad luck for you. Still, probably 
                        for the best. I can’t have you 
                        poking around here anymore. 

                                 ANA
                        What are you talking about?

                                 TONY
                        Too much attention, what with all 
                        the amateur detectives and now the 
                        Bureau of Criminal Investigation. 
                        Who knows what somebody might turn 
                        up if they actually look? No, no, 
                        no. It just won’t do.

           Ana struggles against the ropes.

                                 ANA 
                         Untie me, Tony. Please.
           He doesn’t. Instead he moves toward Tracey’s body.

                                 TONY
                        Hmm. This is a little messier than 
                        I like to do it. But hopefully we 
                        can wrap up all the loose ends.

           He crouches and places the gun he just fired into Tracey’s 
           limp hand. Curls her fingers around it and fires into the 
           basement wall -- BANG -- causing Ana to flinch backwards. For 
           the first time she notices Tony is wearing shiny black 
           gloves.  

                                 TONY
                        There. You and Joe came here to 
                        save Ronnie. These two maniacs 
                        killed Joe and then themselves. And 
                        I arrived
                             (checks watch)
                        20 minutes from now? But by that 
                        time the fire was already out of 
                        control. Luckily no rain in the 
                        forecast this time.

                                 ANA
                        What fire?

           Tony chuckles and holds up a 32 oz. bottle of lighter fluid. 
           He starts to squirt it onto the piles of partially burned 
           debris all around Ana.

                                 TONY
                        Haven’t you noticed? Look around 
                        these hills. So many of these 
                        people are just... trash. Pill-
                        heads and meth-heads and whores. 
                        They’re trash. Lazy, disgusting 
                        trash. Ana, my job is to burn the 
                        trash. 

           Tony pulls on a black latex dog mask.

                                 TONY
                        Yes. And many others. Though most 
                        of them weren’t so photogenic.

                        investigate. Lesson learned. 

           Tony chuckles again.

                                 ANA
                        ...Why her? 

                                 TONY
                        Dora Bishop was fornicating with a 
                        married man.

           He nudges Joe’s lifeless head with his toe.

                                 TONY
                        Trash.

           Ana struggles against her ropes and screams at the top of her 
           lungs.

                                 ANA
                        HELP ME! SOMEBODY! HELP!

           Tony shakes his head. 

                                 TONY
                        You really need to calm down. This 
                        should help.

           Tony crouches close to Ana and starts to fill a syringe from 
           a vial of oxycodone. 

           With an unexpected lurch, Ana headbutts Tony’s hands, sending 
           vial and  both clattering away into the darkness. Under the 
           mask, Tony’s face twists in fury. Then he catches himself and 
           slowly smiles.

                                 TONY
                        So you want to do it the hard way?

           Quick as a snake, Tony whips out his telescoping baton and 
           cracks Ana across the face, silencing her. She slumps, dazed 
           by the blow.  

           Tony steps back and strikes a match. He admires it for a 
           moment and tosses it onto the ground. WHOOMP! The lighter 
           fluid around Ana goes up in flames. Tony unzips his pants, 
           closes his eyes, and starts to masturbate. Pure bliss.

           As the flames burn higher, Ana blinks and sees something 
           glinting in the firelight. She twists and stretches and 
           manages to get two fingers around the crossbow bolt poking 
           out of Joe Ivey’s neck. 
           By straining and wrenching her weight she somehow manages to 
           rip the bloody bolt out of Joe’s throat. Using the arrowhead 
           she starts to saw at her ropes.

           Tony’s pace quickens and his breath starts to accelerate. 

           With a pop, Ana cuts through the ropes. She leaps over the 
           gathering fire and dashes up the basement stairs. 

           EXT. DORA BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Black smoke billows from the basement window. Ana bursts out 
           of the front door of the house, racing full speed toward 
           Joe’s cruiser. She throws open the door. 

           BANG! A bullet shatters the side mirror. Tony stands on the 
           porch, still in his dog mask, dick out, gun in hand. 

           Ana jumps into the driver seat and slams the door behind her. 

           INT. JOE'S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Tony walks calmly toward the vehicle as Ana fumbles. 

                                 ANA
                        Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

           The keys are still in the ignition. Ana starts the car. The 
           engine whines as she turns the key too far.  

           CRASH! Another bullet shatters the driver side window in a 
           hail of tinkling glass.

           Ana floors the gas. The engine roars. The car doesn’t move.

                                 ANA
                        What?

           Ana pulls the gearshift into drive and the car leaps forward. 

           EXT. DORA BISHOP'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ana speeds away down the twisty mountain road, tires 
           SQUEALING. Tony zips up his pants, climbs in his own cruiser 
           and follows.

           INT. JOE’S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Ana speeds and swerves down the nightmarishly twisty road, 
           struggling to keep control of the vehicle. 
           She barely misses a copse of trees, overcorrects and nearly 
           goes over the ridge. Utterly terrifying.

           With a CRASH, Tony’s car rams Ana’s from behind. The impact 
           nearly forces her off the road. Somehow she keeps vehicle 
           from going over the edge. 

           Tony tries to ram her again and Ana swerves at the last 
           second, causing him to spin out.

           Ana pulls away. Tony backs up and floors it to catch her.

           INT. JOE’S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Ana is nearly at the bottom of the mountain now. She’s going 
           to make it.

           INT. TONY’S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Tony leans out the window and fires his gun bursting one of 
           Ana’s tires.

           INT. JOE'S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Ana loses control of the car and skids into a ditch, 
           crumpling the front bumper against a tree.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Tony slows to a stop behind her and gets out of his cruiser. 
           He rolls his shoulders and slowly walks towards Ana’s 
           vehicle, gun in hand. Tony clucks his tongue.

                                 TONY
                        I’m very frustrated with you right 
                        now. Very, very frustrated.

           INT. JOE’S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Ana is dazed. As the airbag deflates, she fumbles with the 
           seatbelt. It’s locked. She can’t seem to get it undone. Her 
           fingers don’t quite work right. Her vision is blurry.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Tony stops as he hears a WHINING sound coming from the woods. 
           It’s an engine. Tony squints in the headlights as a 4-wheeler 
           pulls up to the main road. Cody Varga jumps off.
                                 CODY
                        Leave her alone! 

           Tony shoots at Cody but misses. Cody slams into Tony and, for 
           a moment, it seems like he might be able to overpower the 
           smaller man and wrestle the gun away. Cody yells at Ana.

                                 CODY
                        Go on! Drive!

           Yet with his other hand Tony whips out his telescoping baton. 
           He beats Cody repeatedly across the face and shoulders with 
           it, forcing the boy back. With a final blow to the head, he 
           knocks Cody to the ground. 

           INT. JOE'S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           In the rearview mirror Ana sees Tony slowly point his gun at 
           Cody’s head. 

                                 ANA
                        No.

           Ana starts the car. She throws it into reverse and floors it. 
           The tires SCREECH as she backs over Tony Yates at 30 miles an 
           hour -- KATHUNK -- instantly crushing him to death.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Ana, stumbles out of the cruiser and helps a groggy Cody to 
           sit up. She sits on the ground beside him and the two of them 
           stare out into the night.

           The headlights of another car approach. A two-door compact 
           with a police flasher on the dashboard rolls to a stop. 
           Trooper Terry Webb stumbles out, gun in hand.  

                                 WEBB
                        Call came in over the radio. Came 
                        as fast as I could. Are you OK? 

                                 ANA (V.O.)
                        ...Am I OK? I have a broken arm, 
                        two fractured vertebrae, and scars 
                        on my face that won’t ever heal. I 
                        wake up screaming some nights. But 
                        hey, this turned out to be one hell 
                        of a podcast, right? Now I know 
                        you’re probably wondering: is this 
                        the end of I Heart Murder?

                                                              SMASH TO:
           INT. PODCASTING STUDIO - RECORDING BOOTH - DAY

           Ana sits in the recording booth. Bandages gone, she now has 
           bright scars across her neck and forehead. Her arm is still 
           in a cast. 

                                 ANA (CONT'D)
                        ...I think it is. For now. When I 
                        started this podcast I had no idea 
                        where it would lead me or what it 
                        would mean to people. But I hoped 
                        what I would find in the end was 
                        the truth.

           ANGLE ON Ana’s cork board with the photos of Dora, Joe, 
           Ronnie and Cody, connected by red yarn. 

                                 ANA
                        Along the way, good people got 
                        hurt. Others died. I almost did. 
                        And I found the truth. Or I guess 
                        it found me. But the question I 
                        keep asking myself is: was it worth 
                        it?

           Ana sits in silence for a long moment.

                                 ANA
                        ...Well, was it?

           INT. PODCASTING STUDIO - OFFICE SPACE - DAY

           Ana steps out of the recording booth -- she walks with a 
           slight limp now -- followed by her new producer LEO (30) a 
           non-threatening quasi-hipster, bubbling with enthusiasm.

           Sharon sits at her laptop.

                                 LEO
                        Sharon, what’ve we got?

           Sharon points to the iTunes podcast rankings on her computer 
           and grins.

                                 SHARON
                        Still #1.  

                                 LEO

                                 SHARON
                        Eat shit Ira Glass.
                                 ANA
                        Anything else?

                                 SHARON
                        Oh, and it looks like Pedrossian’s 
                        office messengered the final 
                        contract over.

           Sharon hands Ana a manila envelope. 

                                 ANA
                        Thanks. 

           Ana limps to her desk and sits down. She opens the envelope 
           and starts to look over the contract. Leo follows. He hovers.

                                 ANA
                        What?

                                 LEO
                        ...So I know we’re basically in 
                        preproduction with Netflix, but I 
                        just wanted to float a couple 
                        things your way.

           Ana rolls her eyes.

                                 ANA
                        Leo, c’mon.

           Leo places a sheet on her desk. It’s an FBI missing persons 
           poster showing a pretty, young AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN.

                                 LEO

                        We’ve done the whole creepy

                        would have more of a hardscrabble, 
                        Midwestern urban vibe.

           Ana shakes her head.

                                 ANA
                        Seriously I really can’t even think 
                        about this right now.

                        relationship advice but also sketch

                        Nah, I think I’ll just finish up 
                        here.

                                 LEO
                        Okay don’t work too hard.
                             (yelling)
                        Sharon! Let’s ride!

           Sharon and Leo leave Ana alone in the office, poring over the 
           contract. 

           Ana pauses. She sucks at her teeth as if trying to decide 
           something. Then she pulls out her phone.
           INT. SETH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Seth sits in a wheelchair, both legs still in casts, bandages 
           still covering the burns on his arms face and neck. He and 
           Lisa watch another episode of the same baking competition 
           show as before. This time Seth isn’t smiling. 

           Seth’s phone BUZZES. He looks at it. On the screen he sees 
           the name “Ana”. 

           A beat. Seth declines the call.

           INT. PODCASTING STUDIO - OFFICE SPACE - NIGHT 

           Ana puts down her phone. She looks around the empty office 
           and drums her fingers on her desk. She sighs.

           Then she picks up the article about Kim Ricci and starts to 
           read...
