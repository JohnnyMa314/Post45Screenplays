           EXT. CHICAGO - ESTABLISHING - MORNING - DAY  

           A cold but sunny morning in Chicago. Snow glistens on trees. 
           A jingle bell rings in the distance. Christmas is in the air. 

           EXT. MICHIGAN AVENUE - MORNING - DAY

           COMMUTERS file down sidewalks and bridges. A sea of boots and 
           coats. One man stands out. He is JAKE DOYLE (40, stressed, 
           but can laugh about it). He talks on his iPhone as he walks. 

                                 ADULT JAKE 
                        ...What do you mean you didn’t send 
                        it yet? We need the shipment, Ed. 
                        We needed it yesterday. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Dad look! That’s the tablet I want!

           Jake’s daughter ANNIE DOYLE (8, inquisitive) points to a 
           storefront DISPLAY of the latest TABLET. Annie sniffles with 
           a cold but her eyes are curious, alert. 

                                 ANNIE 
                        Can we go inside? Can we go look?  

           Jake holds up a finger, “just a second”, stays on the phone.  

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        I don’t care if it’s almost 
                        Christmas. Get us the-- whoa!

           Jake steps on a patch of ice and almost loses his balance. He 
           shoots a look at a nearby SALVATION ARMY SANTA CLAUS (60s).

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Still?! The ice?!    

                                 SALVATION ARMY SANTA
                        I told ‘em to salt it. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Get us the shipment Ed. Because I 
                        just yelled at Santa. Yeah. You’re 
                        making me the guy who yells at 
                        Santa. My daughter is very upset.  

           Jake holds the phone down to Annie, she’s all smiles.  

                                 ANNIE
                        I’m very upset! 

           Jake chuckles, takes the phone back. 
                                 ADULT JAKE
                        See? Get us the shipment! 

           Jake takes Annie’s hand as they hustle across the street. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - SKYSCRAPER - A LITTLE LATER - MORNING - DAY 

           Jake and Annie ride an elevator up to Jake’s office. Annie 
           blows her nose as she watches Jake scroll through emails. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Are you stressed Dad? Are you 
                        tired? Is this elevator safe?

           Jake’s phone buzzes. It’s his WIFE calling.  

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Hold on, it’s Mom.
                             (on phone)
                        Hey. Yeah, it’s strep. We got the 
                        antibiotic. When can you come get 
                        her? Me? Honey, I can’t watch her 
                        all day. Because I just can’t.  

           Annie sighs, she’s used to this. Jake doesn’t notice her 
           reaction. He just listens to his wife, softening a little.  

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Okay. No, you’re right. I can watch 
                        her. I’m not too busy. 

           The doors open. Jake exits. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        I got this. 

           A beat. Annie is still in the elevator. The doors start to 
           close. Jake runs back and pulls her out. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Totally got it.

           INT. JAKE’S OFFICE - MAIN FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

           Jake leads Annie through his office. Employees bustle about. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Do all these people work here? What 
                        time does work start? Are you late? 

           A coworker, BETH (30s) passes by. 
                                 BETH
                        Pendrock keeps calling from New 
                        York, Jake.

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        I know, I know. 

           INT. JAKE'S CORNER OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

           Jake walks Annie into his spacious corner office. BLUEPRINTS 
           and PICTURES adorn the walls. Annie looks out the window.

                                 ANNIE
                        Is that a park down there? Is that 
                        a jungle gym? Is this office eco-
                        friendly? 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Okay, no more questions. You’re 
                        sick. You need to take a nap. 

                                 ANNIE
                        That’s boring.  

           Jake gently leads Annie to a couch, takes off her coat. 

                                 ANNIE
                        If I had my own tablet I wouldn’t 
                        be bored.  

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Enough about the tablet, sweetie, 
                        okay? C’mere.

           Jake sets a pillow down and Annie reluctantly lies down. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        There we go. Now, I’m gonna go over 
                        there and send about three hundred 
                        emails and you’re gonna lie here 
                        and get some rest. Cool? Cool. 

           Jake heads to his desk, gets right back to work.   

                                 ANNIE
                        Are you gonna work over Christmas 
                        again too? 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                             (not paying attention)
                        Uh-huh, sounds good. 
           Annie sighs, disappointed. Bored, she starts to look around 
           the room. Something in the corner sparks her interest. 

           Jake looks up to see Annie now standing before his OLD TV. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Hey, you’re supposed to be resting. 

                                 ANNIE
                        What’s that? 

           Annie points to an OLD NINTENDO under the TV. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        A Nintendo.

                                 ANNIE
                        A what? 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        A video game from when I was 
                        little.

                                 ANNIE
                        Cool. Can we play?  

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Annie, I have work to do--

                                 ANNIE
                        Please? Pleeeeeese? 

           Jake sighs. He needs a play here. Beth walks by his door. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Beth? 

                                 BETH
                        What’s up? 

           Jake heads to the door, out of ear shot from Annie. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Can you push the Pendrock call for 
                        a bit. I gotta get her down for a 
                        nap somehow. 

                                 BETH
                        No problem. 

           Jake heads back to Annie who is now feebly trying to get the 
           Nintendo to work, pressing buttons, etc. Jake picks up a GAME 
           from a KANGAROOS SHOE BOX full of games on the coffee table. 
                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Here. First you have to do this. 

           Jake blows on the game as is customary. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Why? 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        I don’t know, you just do. 

           Jake hands the game to Annie, she blows on it happily. 

                                 ANNIE
                        I thought you said Grandma and 
                        Grandpa didn’t let you have video 
                        games when you were little. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        They didn’t. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Then how did you get it?

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Tell you what? If I tell you the 
                        story of how I got my Nintendo will 
                        you take a nap? A long one? 

                                 ANNIE
                        Uh-huh.

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        You have to promise though. Because 
                        this is probably the most amazing, 
                        dangerous, awesome story of all 
                        time and you’ll probably get so 
                        excited you’ll never want to sleep 
                        ever again so you have to promise.

                                 ANNIE
                        Promise. 

           Jake puts the game in the console, has a seat next to Annie. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Okay. The year was 1987. Or was it 
                        ‘88? 
                             (thinking to himself)
                        ‘85 Bears. Super Bowl in ‘86...

                                 ANNIE
                        Does it really matter Dad? 
                                 ADULT JAKE
                        You wanna hear this or not? 

           Annie does. Jake hands her a controller, she smiles. EXCITE 
           BIKE starts to play on TV. Jake softens a little, settles in.     

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        The year was 1988. Let’s call it 
                        December. I was ten years old...  

           The sounds of an 8-Bit motor-cross bike rev as we... 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. SUBURBAN CHICAGO STREET - 1988 - MORNING - DAY

           The Excite Bike sound effects now match a BOY on his bike.

           This is YOUNG JAKE DOYLE (10). He pedals down the middle of 
           the street as fast as his legs can carry him. He wears a ski 
           jacket, Walter Payton Kangaroo shoes and a Bears knit cap.  

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        In the winter, if the streets were 
                        plowed, I could make it to Timmy 
                        Kleen’s house in just under eight 
                        minutes. 

                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        On a bike? How fast were you going? 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Super fast. 

                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        Did you wear a helmet? 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Uh, yeah. We always wore helmets in 
                        the 80s. We were super safe. 

           A HELMET suddenly appears on Jake’s head. 

                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        What color was it? 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Just let me tell the story, Annie. 

           WHOOSH! Jake rounds a corner and flies down another street. 
           The Excite Bike sound effects match his increase in speed. 
           Suburban middle class houses pass him by. 
           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           MIKEY TROTTER (10) watches INSPECTOR GADGET, eating cereal.  

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        I had recently come to the profound 
                        conclusion that Inspector Gadget 
                        would never catch Dr. Claw on any 
                        Saturday morning, so that gave me a 
                        five minute head start. 

           On TV DR. CLAW yells his famous line as he makes his escape.

                                 DR. CLAW
                        I’ll get you next time Gadget! 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                             (to TV, disappointed)
                        You kiddin’ me? 

           Trotter looks up through the window and notices Jake whizzing 
           by. He quickly drops his cereal and rushes out of the room. 

           EXT. STREET - MORNING - CONTINUOUS

           Jake pedals on, determined. He approaches a snowblower and 
           rides through its snow shower. Nothing will get in his way.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        The rule at Kleen’s was simple. The 
                        first ten kids to get through his 
                        door got to play. And the first one 
                        on his couch got first game, after 
                        Kleen of course, but if you got 
                        that pole position, you were 
                        sitting pretty all weekend. 

           Jake pulls even with a PAPER BOY (10) on his bike delivering 
           papers. The two lock eyes. Jake accelerates past him. The 
           Paper Boy reluctantly picks up his pace. 

           EXT. TIMMY KLEEN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 

           Jake pedals up to TIMMY KLEEN’S HOUSE. It’s by far the 
           biggest and nicest one on the block. In one continuous motion 
           Jake hops off his bike and ditches it in the yard. 

           Momentum carrying him, Jake runs up the front steps and rings 
           the bell repeatedly. He takes his helmet off, noticing it for 
           the first time and chucks it over his shoulder.  
           A sleepy TIFFANY KLEEN (16) answers the door. She struggles 
           to hold a yipping little dog LACY DOG from getting out.  

                                 TIFFANY KLEEN
                        Lacy Dog! NO! You’re too early, I 
                        don’t even think he’s up-- 

           Jake runs past her right into the house. 

                                 TIFFANY KLEEN
                          --yet. Hey!

           INT. TIMMY KLEEN'S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Jake comes running down the basement steps into a nice rec 
           room. He flicks on a light, heroically illuminating a 
           NINTENDO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM sitting under a HUGE TV on the 
           far side of the room. Jake stands awestruck. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        And there she was, glistening in 
                        all her gray plastic glory. A maze 
                        of rubber wiring and electronic 
                        intelligence so advanced it was 
                        deemed not a video game but an 8-
                        bit Entertainment System. 

                                 JAKE
                        Wow...

           As Jake smiles we see a RETAINER in his mouth. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        There wasn’t a pair of blistered 
                        kid thumbs in suburbia that didn’t 
                        feel an instinctive tingle when the 
                        word Nintendo was mentioned.

                                 TIMMY KLEEN  (O.S.)
                        Forget something?  

           Jake turns around to see TIMMY KLEEN (10) at the bottom of 
           the stairs. He wears a KARATE ROBE over silk PJ’s and stirs 
           chocolate milk in a coffee cup. Remember the rich kid in the 
           neighborhood with all the cool stuff? This is him. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        It was an early lesson in God’s 
                        cruelty giving the only Nintendo in 
                        town to rich kid Timmy Kleen. 

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        Your shoes, butthead.
                                 JAKE
                        Oh, sorry, sorry about that. 

           Kleen heads upstairs. Jake follows, tiptoeing in his shoes.   

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        I’d prayed several times to be made 
                        part of his family. 

           INT/EXT. TIMMY KLEEN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - FOYER 

           Jake sets his shoes by the door. Timmy stirs his chocolate 
           milk and gazes out the window. TWO DOZEN KIDS are now 
           jostling for position outside in the snow, hoping to get in. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Outside, half of H.C Storm 
                        Elementary wrestled in the snow. 
                        Including my four best friends. 

           Jake looks at a particular group of KIDS, his friends.

                        Hey! He’s coming out!

           A hush falls over the crowd. Everyone turns to the porch. The 
           door slowly opens and out steps Timmy. He stands high above 
           the crowd on the top step. Lacey Dog nips at his heels. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Kleen surveyed the crowd like an 
                        annoyed Roman emperor. He checked 
                        his Swatch watch. Both of them. 

           Kleen checks his wrist, revealing two Swatch watches.

                        Anyone for a little Nintendo? 

           The crowd ROARS! Everyone rushes toward the door. Fresh to 
           the scene, the Paper Boy from earlier pedals through the 
           crowd chucking papers indiscriminately. It’s pandemonium.

           INT. KLEEN’S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Today’s TEN LUCKY KIDS file downstairs, out of breath. 

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        Boots off, boots off. Don’t touch 
                        the wall it’s French.

                        Wait, my brother’s still outside.

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        You know the rules. First ten, 
                        that’s it. 

                                 TOMMY GRUSECKI
                        But it’s Ryan. 

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                             (mimicking)
                        “But it’s Ryan”. 

           Ryan Grusecki bangs on the adjacent basement well window.  

                                 RYAN GRUSECKI
                        Lemme in! 

           Kleen just closes the curtain shut. 

                                 RYAN GRUSECKI (O.S.)
                        Jerk!

                        You guys want some Pop Tarts or 
                        something?

                        Yeah that’d be great.  

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        Too bad.  

           Kleen chuckles to himself as the boys seat themselves 
           numerically on the couch. Kleen turns on DUCK HUNT, grabs the 
           GUN and holds it directly on the TV. He smiles devilishly. 
                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        Winner stays. 

           Kleen blasts away, he’ll be playing forever. Jake scowls.   

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        As I sat there and watched Timmy 
                        Kleen blast away to his evil 
                        heart’s content...

                        One thing became clear: I needed to 
                        get my own Nintendo. Fast.

           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           An old, two story, Victorian style farm house. Jake sits at

                        Quietly singing theme songs.

           Jake sits up in his chair, centers himself.

                        But tonight was the night I’d 
                        finally put it all into action. 

           Jake’s mom PATTY DOYLE (40, even keeled) cooks chili on the 
           stove. She wears a leotard and leg warmers. 

                                 JAKE
                        You know what’s really important 
                        mom? Hand-eye coordination. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                             (didn’t hear him)
                        What’s that dear?  

                                 JAKE
                        Hand-eye coordination. Totally. You 
                        need it to get into college. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Is that right. 

           CRASH! Something falls in the other room. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE (O.S.)
                        God bless it! 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Well I’m sure your dad will want to 
                        teach it to you then. 

           JOHN DOYLE (40s, gruff) storms into the kitchen through a 
           plastic sheet hanging over the door to the dining room. He 
           wears a tool belt and is slightly dusted in plaster dust. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Has anyone seen my bandsaw? 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        I think it’s in the shower. 
                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        That’s the table saw. I need the 
                        bandsaw. Jake get in here.  

           John grabs a package of nails off the counter and goes back 
           through the sheet. Jake reluctantly follows.  

           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           Jake awkwardly holds a board as John hammers nails into it.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        It was a well known up and down 
                        Linwood Avenue that in 1978 my 
                        father went to install a kitchen 
                        cabinet and had not stopped since. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE (O.S.)
                        Dinner’s ready! You almost finished 
                        out there? 

           John gives a quick glance around. The room, like much of the 
           house, is totally gutted. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        No.  

                                 PATTY DOYLE (O.S.)
                        You know what I mean. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        He was warmly referred to in our 
                        house as the dyslexic Bob Vila. 

           John examines his work. Not satisfied. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        God bless it. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        And no matter what, if I was ever 
                        going to get a Nintendo, I’d have 
                        to go through him. 

           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER

           Jake sits at the table eating dinner with his parents and his 
           little sister LIZZY DOYLE (6, super smart, cute, conniving). 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        This was going to take some serious 
                        buttering up. 
                                 JAKE
                        Drywall looks really good in there 
                        Dad. Totally.  

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Stop saying totally. It makes you 
                        sound like a moron. And why’s your 
                        retainer out of your mouth? 

                                 JAKE
                        We’re eating. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Do you know how expensive that 
                        thing is? Put it back in. 

           Jake looks at his mom for some help. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        John you really can’t eat with it 
                        in. It doesn’t work that way.  

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Well it’s terribly designed then. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        If I had a retainer I’d wear it all 
                        the time. No matter what. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        I know you would Lizzy. Good girl. 

           Lizzy smiles devilishly at Jake. Jake scowls.

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        You haven’t seen my bandsaw have 
                        you? 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        It’s in the backyard. Right next to 
                        all the dog poop that Jake didn’t 
                        pick up. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        You didn’t pick that up?! Cry in a 
                        bucket, Jake. What have you been 
                        doing all day? 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Well Dad, I’ve been playing an 
                        amazing new system called Nintendo! 
                        You seem ready to hear about it, 
                        let me regale you with its wonders! 
                                 JAKE
                        Uh, I was in Timmy Kleen’s 
                        basement. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        You can’t play outside? 

                                 JAKE
                        It’s cold. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        It’s not even below zero out. What 
                        the heck were you doing inside all 
                        day? 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Probably playing the Nintenda. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Nintenda? 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Nintendo. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Tenda?  

                                 JAKE
                        Tendo. The Nintendo Entertainment 
                        System. It’s this totally-- really 
                        educational piece of technology, 
                        Dad. I think you’d like it.   

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Well I ran into Mrs. Trotter at the 
                        Jewel today. Apparently Nintendo’s 
                        been doing all kinds of strange 
                        things to children in Japan.  

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Like making them smarter? Faster? 
                        Better at sports and Karate? 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        They get so involved that they 
                        forget about everything else. 
                        School, friends. One little boy 
                        supposedly had a seizure.  

                                 JAKE
                        A seizure? 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Plus they’re very expensive. 
                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Video games make you fat Jake. That 
                        is a fact. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Cabbage Patch Kids don’t make you 
                        fat. And you can take them outside. 
                        They’re a great Christmas present.    

           Lizzy smiles at Jake. She’s good and she knows it.   

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        No Nintendo in this house. I’ll 
                        tell you that right now. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        I second that. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Nintendo no-friendo. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Now what did you want to talk to us 
                        about honey? Something important 
                        you said? 

           Jake just sighs and stares at his plate, crushed.   

                                 JAKE
                        Never mind. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER (PRE-LAP)
                        Jake. Jake...

           EXT. HC STORM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PLAYGROUND - DAY 

           Jake sits in a daze slumped against the bottom of a MASSIVE 
           SNOW MOUND on the playground. Trotter and Olsen crouch on 
           either side of him like a couple of scared infantry men. In 
           the distance, we hear the sounds of screaming. 

           Welcome to fifth grade. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Jake! 

           Jake snaps out of it and looks up. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        You gotta focus man.
                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        His parents told him he couldn’t 
                        get a Nintendo last night, go easy. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Jeez. You sure you’re up for this? 

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah... 

           The guys peer up toward the top of the mound. Standing there, 
           dominating the game “King of the Mountain” is DAN DELUND (age 
           unknown). He wears steel toed work boots and a Mötley Crüe t-
           shirt under his ratty bomber jacket. His rat tail is amazing.     

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        It was never quite certain what 
                        grade Dan “King of the Mountain” 
                        Delund was actually enrolled in, as 
                        the vast majority of his time was 
                        spent in such foreign districts as 
                        the principal’s office and the Ben 
                        Franklin cigarette counter. 

           Delund is easily twice the size of his opponents. As kids 
           rush up to him he just tosses them off like rag dolls. 

                                 DAN DELUND
                        Woooo! You like that?! 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        And every day before school we 
                        would gather, for reasons unknown, 
                        to get pummeled by him in the game 
                        “King of the Mountain.” 

           Tommy Grusecki and Ryan Grusecki come tumbling down the mound 
           face first and land on either side of the group.  

                                 RYAN GRUSECKI
                        I think I saw hair under his pits. 

           Trotter keeps his eyes on Delund, focused. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Okay, his back is turned. This is 
                        it. You ready Jake? 

                                 JAKE
                        Right now? 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Olsen? Goonies never say die, man.  
                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        Goonies never met Dan Delund.  

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Let’s DO IIIIIIIT!

           Trotter charges up the hill, yelling. Jake sighs, then 
           reluctantly follows after him. Olsen sits there for a beat, 
           then nervously charges up the hill too.  

           Athletic and confident, Trotter sprints toward Delund. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Ahhhhh! 

           Delund spins around, his eyes widening. In one powerful 
           motion he just grabs Trotter and tosses him over the side. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Noooo! 

           Jake and Olsen see this happening but it’s too late to 
           retreat. Delund clothes-lines both of them at the same time 
           with two outstretched arms. They hit the ground with a THUD.    

                                 DAN DELUND
                        My mountain! Mine!  

           Olsen somehow rolls himself off the hill. Jake tries to crawl 
           away but Delund grabs him and starts white washing his face. 

                        DAN DELUND
                                                          JAKE
           Ha! Ha! Ha!
                                              Quit it! Quit it! Quit it!

           Delund tosses Jake over the side, raises his arms in victory. 

                                 DAN DELUND
                        Mine! 

           Jake comes tumbling down and lands next to Olsen, Trotter and 
           the Gruseckis who all lie flat on their backs, dazed. 

                                 JAKE
                        I hate that guy. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Just think about the Power Glove, 
                        man. 

                                 JAKE
                        What Power Glove? 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        You didn’t tell him? 
                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        I thought you told him. The Power 
                        Glove! Kleen got one last night! 

           Evan pulls out a NINTENDO POWER MAGAZINE from his back 
           pocket, points to a POWER GLOVE ad. Jake’s in awe.  

                                 JAKE
                        No way... 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Yes way. 

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        He’s already practicing, look.  

           Jake and Olsen look to the other side of the playground where 
           Kleen practices martial arts “Power Glove” moves with his 
           naked right hand, chopping and punching at imaginary enemies.

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        We’re all going over to his house 
                        after school to play it. 

                                 JAKE
                        He’s gonna let us in? 

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        We gotta bring him gifts, but yeah. 

                                 JAKE
                        Who else knows about it? 

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        Just us. Well, and Farmer. 

                                 JAKE
                        Farmer knows? Great.  

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. TIMMY KLEEN'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY - DAY 

           Timmy Kleen’s front lawn is SWARMING with KIDS, at least 
           twice as many as Saturday. The atmosphere is like a rock 
           concert. The crowd chants in unison. 

                                 CROWD
                        POW-ER GLOVE! POW-ER GLOVE! POW-ER 
                        GLOVE!
                                 JOSH FARMER
                        I didn’t say anything to anybody. 
                        Swear to God. 

           The Gruseckis, Jake, Trotter and Olsen just stare at Farmer. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Okay, maybe Meg Platt. And Steve 
                        Dybsky. And my second period gym 
                        class and some lunch ladies but 
                        that’s it.  

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Come on Farmer! We’re never gonna 
                        get in now. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Don’t worry, I got a Power Glove 
                        too, you guys can play it whenever. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        No you don’t Farmer. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        No I do not.  

                                 TOMMY GRUSECKI
                        I don’t think anybody in Chicago 
                        has one yet. I don’t even know how 
                        the thing works.  

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Nobody knows how it works, man. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Oh, it has a suction cup that 
                        connects directly to your brain. 
                        Yeah. My uncle was on the design 
                        team.
                             (then)
                        At NASA. 
                             (then, off their looks)
                        I hate you guys. 

           Suddenly the front door starts to unlock. Everybody turns. 

                                 PAPER BOY
                        He’s coming out! 

           Tiffany Kleen walks out with a BOOMBOX, rolling her eyes.  

                                 TIFFANY KLEEN
                        This is so dumb. 
           A voice yell-whispers behind her through the mail slot.  

                                 TIMMY KLEEN (O.S.)
                        Just do it. 

           Tiffany reluctantly presses play. The 80s anthem “HOLDING OUT 
           FOR A HERO” by Bonnie Tyler plays. Tiffany opens the door and 
           Timmy struts out onto the porch. He wears sunglasses and his 
           Karate robe. His right hand is stuffed into his robe pocket.    

           The crowd is silent. Not sure what to make of this. But then, 
           Kleen shoots his right hand up in the air to the beat. Sure 
           enough he’s wearing the POWER GLOVE. The crowd goes bananas! 

                                 HYSTERICAL KID
                        Yeah Kleen! YEEEEEAAAAAH!

           Jake just stares at the glove in awe.  

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        It was the most beautiful piece of 
                        machinery I’d ever laid eyes on. 
                        The thing made Luke Skywalker’s 
                        robot hand look like a Tinker Toy. 

           Kleen silences the crowd with one swipe of his hand. 

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        Silence children of Batavia!

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        I’m not kidding, that’s seriously 
                        how this kid talked. 

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        What have you brought me?!

           Everyone holds up toys and money. Jake holds up a SAUSAGE. 

                                 JAKE
                        It was the best I could find. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        You’re not getting in dude. 

           The crowd surges. Kleen starts pointing to individual kids, 
           who hold up and shout out their offerings. 

                                 KID 
                        Five bucks from my first communion!

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        One. 
                                 KID
                        A bunch a Micro Machines! 

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        Two. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        I can get you a Ryne Sandberg 
                        rookie card by tomorrow--!

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        No. 

                                 JAKE
                        Over here! Timmy! It’s gourmet! 
                        It’s a gourmet sausage! 

           Kleen’s not interested. Jake’s not going to make the cut. 
           Lacy dog barks like a maniac. Jake watches her run to the 
           back of the house. Suddenly he gets an idea.  

           EXT. KLEEN'S HOUSE - BACK OF THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 

           Jake runs to the back of the house to see Lacy Dog run 
           through a TINY DOG DOOR. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Desperate times called for 
                        desperate measures. There was no 
                        way I was missing out on that Power 
                        Glove. 

           Jake runs to the doggie door. As he pokes his head in Lacy 
           Dog starts barking and nipping at his face. 

                                 JAKE
                        Ah! Shh! Lacy Dog, no! 

           Lacy Dog won’t shut up. Jake suddenly remembers the sausage. 
           He tosses it inside. The barking stops. Jake dives through. 

           INT. TIMMY KLEEN'S HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           Jake runs through the house and casually files in with the 
           group now walking down into the basement. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        How did you--?

           Jake just smiles as he removes his shoes. 
           INT. TIMMY KLEEN’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Ten lucky kids and Jake sit facing Kleen who stands 
           dramatically before them. He raises his gloved fist. 

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        Gentlemen. Behold! The power of the 
                        Power Glove! 

           Kleen presses play on the dual deck boom box. 

                                 TIMMY KLEEN (V.O.)
                        Timmy’s audio journal. Well, I peed 
                        on myself a little bit today--

           Kleen shuts off the tape. He pressed the wrong tape deck. 

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        No one heard that! 

           Everyone stifles their laughter. 

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        Behold! The power of the Power 
                        Glove!

           Kleen presses play on the other tape deck and “DANGER ZONE” 
           by Kenny Loggins plays. 

           Way too into it, Kleen starts playing DOUBLE DRAGON, a 
           violent fighting game. Everyone watches, excited. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Oh man this was it! The Power Glove 
                        at last! Each one of us in that 
                        basement knew we were about to 
                        witness history. 

           Kleen starts throwing punches. 

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        Hi-ya! 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        We just didn’t know what kind yet. 

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        I said hi-ya!

           Kleen has trouble controlling his character on screen. 

                                 TOMMY GRUSECKI
                        You gotta kick him Kleen. 
                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        I’m trying! Hi-ya! Hi-ya! 

           Kleen’s character just stands there, getting pummeled. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        You’re getting killed man. 

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        Do what I say! Do what I say! 

           Kleen jiggles the cord connected to the glove. He tries a few 
           different buttons, nothing works. 

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        What’s wrong with this thing?!

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        And that’s when we realized. In the 
                        span of about fifteen seconds. A 
                        horror that has haunted our 
                        generation ever since. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        This thing sucks. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        The Power Glove sucked. 

                                 JAKE
                        It doesn’t work at all! 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        It didn’t work at all.

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        NOOOOOOOO! 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Maybe it was the glove. Maybe it 
                        was the song. Maybe it was because 
                        he was just such a magnificent 
                        spaz. But Timmy Kleen lost his dang 
                        mind that day. 

           Kleen loses it. He starts flailing about. Pounding the 
           carpet. Kicking and screaming. Lacy Dog barks like a maniac.

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        Stupid glove! Stupid game! Why are 
                        you so stupid?! 

           The boys watch in amusement as Kleen starts to karate chop 
           and kick anything he can find.  
                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        You tell ‘em Kleen! 

                                 RYAN GRUSECKI
                        Yeah, show us your moves Kleen!

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        The taunting probably didn’t help 
                        either.

                                 JAKE
                        Go Kleen go! Tae Kwan Do! 

                                 EVERYONE
                        Go Kleen go! Tae Kwon Do! Go Kleen 
                        go! Tae Kwon Do!

           The couch is in hysterics, chanting. Kleen starts doing 
           Karate moves in a blind rage. Lacy Dog barks like crazy. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        And then. It happened. 

           Kleen suddenly locks his eyes on a target across the room and 
           we go into SLOW MOTION...

                                 TIMMY KLEEN
                        RRRRAAAAHHHHHH!

           Kleen charges the TV. He takes flight and jump kicks the 
           screen. It rocks back and forth on impact. 

                                 EVERYONE
                        NOOOOO!

           We now notice Lacy Dog sitting directly under it, still 
           barking. The TV lurches forward. The kids all watch it fall 
           to the ground. The barking stops. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Broken stained glass window. 
                        Swallowed marble. Show Biz Pizza 
                        party compared to this. For there, 
                        lying under the weight a smashed 
                        forty two inch television set was a 
                        dead dog.  

                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        What?!

           INT. JAKE'S OFFICE - LATER - PRESENT DAY - DAY 

           Back to present day. Annie’s face fills the frame, upset.  
                                 ANNIE
                        The dog dies?! There’s a dead dog 
                        in this story?! 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        It was the eighties, what can I 
                        tell you. Stuff got real. 

           We notice that Annie and Jake have been playing Super Mario 
           Brothers. The game has been paused on the TV. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Are you making all of this up? 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        No way. 

                                 ANNIE
                        I don’t believe you. I’m Googling 
                        Nintendo. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Be my guest. 

                                 BETH (O.S.)
                        Jake?

           Beth knocks on Jake’s door. Jake gets up to answer it. Annie 
           nibbles on a cookie as she heads toward Jake’s computer. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        And no more cookies. This story’s 
                        backfiring on me here, you’re 
                        supposed to be asleep by now.

           Jake approaches Beth at the door. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        What’s up? 

                                 BETH
                        I pushed it an hour, but they want 
                        an answer.  

           Beth hands Jake a large file, gives him a hopeful look.   

                                 BETH
                        It’s a big contract, Jake. 

                                 JAKE
                        I know, I know. 
                                 BETH
                        You want another Christmas cookie 
                        Annie?

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes please!

                                 JAKE
                        She does not. Thank you Beth. 

           Jake turns to Annie who is now on his computer. 

                                 ANNIE
                        So Power Glove didn’t come out til 
                        1989. And Nintendo came out in 1985 
                        not 1988. Your dates are all wrong. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Well I guess I should stop telling 
                        the story then. 

                                 ANNIE
                        No! I mean, you can still tell it 
                        if you want. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        And then you’ll take a nap? 

                                 ANNIE
                        Uh-huh. What happened next? In the 
                        basement? What did you do?  

           Jake looks at his file for a second. Then at Annie.

                                 ADULT JAKE 
                        Well, we did what every other 
                        rational, thoughtful, intelligent 
                        kid would’ve done in our position. 

                                 ANNIE
                        You ran away? 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        So fast.

           EXT. TIMMY KLEEN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

           WHOOSH! Kleen’s front door flies open and eleven screaming 
           kids come pouring out. Some try to put their boots on as they 
           run, others just sprint away in their stocking feet. 

           Evan Olsen and a few other stragglers sit outside. 
                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        What happened?! What happened?!

                                 TOMMY GRUSECKI
                        Get outta here!

           Jake holds his shoes in his hands and hops on the back of 
           Trotter’s bike as Trotter pedals away.  

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        It was the endo of Nintendo as we 
                        knew it. So many thoughts raced 
                        through my head. Would I be 
                        arrested? Would I go to jail? Or 
                        worse, would my parents find out?

           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           Jake sits at the table, nervously picking at his dinner. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        So. What happened today? What did 
                        you do after school, Jake?  

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Nothing to do with a certain dog I 
                        bet.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Oh god. This was it. This was the 
                        end. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        You see my boots over there? You 
                        see what’s all over them? 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Saw dust? Rage? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Poop. You never picked up Elwood’s 
                        dog poop in the back yard did you? 

           Jake exhales, relieved. The Doyle’s golden lab ELWOOD looks 
           up from the floor sadly.

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Look at him. Poor guy can barely 
                        walk around back there. 

                                 JAKE
                        Sorry Dad, I forgot. 
                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        This weekend. Before it snows again 
                        and we can’t get to it til April. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        It’s supposed to snow tonight, 
                        dear. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Says who? Skilling? Guy doesn’t 
                        know what he’s talking about. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING 

           Chicago weatherman TOM SKILLING does his cheery morning 
           forecast on WGN TV. 

                                 TOM SKILLING
                        Just like I said. Snow! Snow! Snow!

           Jake and John look out the window. It’s definitely snowing. 

                           JAKE
                                                       JOHN DOYLE
           Yes!
                                              God bless it.

           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Patty, still in that leotard, cooks eggs on the stove. Lizzy 
           stares out the kitchen window. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Are we gonna have a snow day today 
                        Mommy? 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        I wouldn’t count on it dear.

           Patty adjusts the knob to a RADIO above the stove. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Of course not. In the history of 
                        Batavia, Illinois there had never 
                        been a snow day. Not a single one. 
                        It could be twenty below with a 
                        Soviet attack on the way and we’d 
                        still have school. 

           Jake enters the kitchen and stands next to Lizzy. The two 
           stare up at the radio, hopeful. 
                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER
                        ...and St. Charles in Dupage 
                        County. In Kane County, school 
                        closings are as follows: Geneva, 
                        Oswego, Elburn, South Elgin, North 
                        Aurora...

                                 JAKE
                        Come on...

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER
                        And that’s it. 

                                 JAKE
                        No! 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Stupid. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        That’s enough you two. Coats and 
                        gloves on the double. And Jake. 
                        Don’t forget your boots this time. 

           Lizzy smiles slyly. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Yeah, don’t forget your boots Jake. 

           Jake just closes his eyes in pain. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        There was a slight problem with 
                        that. 

           EXT. DOYLE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

           Jake steps out onto the porch, looking sick to his stomach. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        My mother, in a Kohl’s coupon 
                        induced bout of madness, had 
                        accidentally bought me girls boots. 

           Tilt down to reveal PURPLE ESPRIT BOOTS on Jake’s feet. Boy 
           George’s “DO YOU REALLY WANT TO HURT ME” plays-- and will 
           play every time we see the boots.   

           Lizzy, now dressed in a one piece snowsuit smiles, mockingly. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Pretty. 
           Jake scowls and walks down the steps. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        The boots were purple, with pretty 
                        white trim and pretty white letters 
                        that said ESPRIT, a word that I’d 
                        later learn was not only synonymous 
                        with female fashion but also 
                        French! 

           Jake ducks behind a tree and takes a knee in the snow.  

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        And they were a death sentence if 
                        anyone ever saw me in them.

                                 JAKE
                        Just go ahead, I’ll catch up. 

           Jake pulls shoes out of his bag, starts to remove his boots.  

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        You shouldn’t be doing that. 

                                 JAKE
                        I’ll catch up. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        You’re not supposed to let me walk 
                        by myself. 

                                 JAKE
                        Then wait a second and shut up. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Oooh. You said a swear. 

                                 JAKE
                        Shut up’s not a swear. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        You said it again. 

                                 JAKE
                        I got a lot on my mind Lizzy! 

           EXT. SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - LATER THAT MORNING - DAY

           Jake, now in his shoes, Trotter and Olsen sit at the base of 
           the snow mound, thinking. Up above them we hear the constant 
           sounds of Delund’s taunts and kids’ screams.  
                                 DAN DELUND (O.S.)
                        You like that?! 

                                 KID (O.S.)
                        Noooooo!

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        Are we even sure the dog‘s dead?

                        You ever see the end of Raiders of 
                        the Lost Arc? 

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        Yeah?  

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        It looked like that. 

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        Jesus. 

                                 JAKE
                        The dog’s dead, Olsen. 

                                 DAN DELUND (O.S.)
                        I am literally going to murder you! 

                                 KID (O.S.)
                        Nooooo!

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        Are we gonna get in trouble? 

                                 JAKE
                        I dunno. All I know is we gotta 
                        find another Nintendo now.  

           Tommy comes tumbling down the hill, lands there in a heap. 

                                 TOMMY GRUSECKI
                        Hey, we talked to Kleen.   

           Ryan comes tumbling down right after him. 

                                 RYAN GRUSECKI
                        Hey, we talked to Kleen. 

                                 JAKE
                        What’d he say? 
                                 TOMMY GRUSECKI
                        Nothing. He says he doesn’t want to 
                        talk about it. It was weird, but I 
                        don’t think we’re in trouble.  

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        Thank God. 

                                 DAN DELUND (O.S.)
                        Is that all you babies got?!

           Josh Farmer comes running up, out of breath.  

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Hey! Did you guys hear?!

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Yes, we heard about the dog Farmer, 
                        we were there, remember? 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        No, the Cub Scouts! They’re giving 
                        away a Nintendo this year! Whoever 
                        sells the most wreathes in the 
                        wreath selling contest gets one!

                                 JAKE
                        No way. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Yes way! A sixth grader just told 
                        me! 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        The same sixth grader who told you 
                        there were tryouts for the A-Team? 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        That wasn’t-- that was a different-- 
                        Murdoch’s gotta go guys. 

                                 DAN DELUND (O.S.)
                        Alright then! I guess I gotta come 
                        down there and start pounding 
                        people! 

           The boys all groan, scramble for their bags and run off 
           toward the school as the bell rings. Farmer yells after them.  

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Fine. You don’t have to believe me! 
                        I’m gonna win the Nintendo anyway! 
                        I already sold sixty seven wreathes 
                        already!

                                 JOSH FARMER (CONT'D)
                             (then, to himself)
                        Tell me what to do. I do what I 
                        want.

                                 DAN DELUND (O.S.)
                        I see you Farmer! 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Dang it.

           INT. CLASSROOM - LATER - DAY

           Jake sits in his desk. MRS. HUGO (30’s, perpetual head cold) 
           teaches at the front of the class.   

                                 MRS. HUGO
                        It’s called... The Dewey Decimal 
                        system. That’s right.  

           Mrs. Hugo underlines “Dewey Decimal System” on the board. 

                                 MRS. HUGO
                        This is a skill you will definitely 
                        need to know as adults. Just like 
                        cursive. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        By mid morning Nintendo prize 
                        rumors were circulating like Mario 
                        Brother fireballs. 

           Trotter leans back in his seat and whispers to Olsen. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Farmer says first prize comes with 
                        a Power Pad too, pass it on. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        However ridiculous Farmer’s Cub 
                        Scout story was, we were all 
                        starting to believe it. 

           Olsen leans back to Jake. 

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        First prize comes with a Power Pad, 
                        pass it on. 

           Jake leans back to Tommy Grusecki. 

                                 JAKE
                        First prize comes with--
                                 MRS. HUGO
                        Jake Doyle! 

           Jake just sits there, caught. 

                                 MRS. HUGO
                        Is there something you’d like to 
                        share with the class?

                                 JAKE
                        No. 

                                 MRS. HUGO
                        Don’t think I haven’t been watching 
                        you. You’re the only one in here 
                        with wet shoes. You know the rules. 
                        No boots. No recess. 

                                 JAKE
                        But--

                                 MRS. HUGO
                        No buts. Now I expect to see you in 
                        boots at recess, or your name goes 
                        on the board. With a check. 

           The class turns to face Jake, concerned. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Oh God, not a check. No one even 
                        knew what that meant. The only kid 
                        who ever got one was Dan Delund and 
                        he lived in the principal’s office. 
                        I did not want to end up there.   

           Jake looks at the board to see Dan Delund’s name up there 
           with a series of checks. Jake looks to see Delund’s empty 
           seat in the class-- a sign of his absence. 

                                 MRS. HUGO
                        So what’s it gonna be Mr. Doyle? 
                        Boots? Or a check?  

           Jake closes his eyes again. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - LATER - DAY 

           “DO YOU REALLY WANT TO HURT ME” plays. Jake’s girls boots tap 
           nervously in the snow. He hides awkwardly behind a garbage 
           can on the perimeter of the playground. All around him, 
           recess is in full swing.  
                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Over the years I’d come to find 
                        that garbage cans were great hiding 
                        places. They were solid, abundant, 
                        and they smelled really bad, so 
                        people tended to stay away from 
                        them.  

           Jake catches a whiff, scowls. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Unless of course they needed you on 
                        their football team. 

           Twenty yards away, two teams are about to square off for a 
           game of snow football on the blacktop. Delund and his team on 
           one side, Trotter’s team on the side closest to Jake. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Jake, come on! You’re on our team! 

                                 JAKE
                        Just play without me! 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        What are you doing back there? Is 
                        there a dead squirrel again?

           Trotter trots over with the ball. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Is it all furry and frozen-- Dude! 
                        You’re wearing Katie Sorrentino’s 
                        boots. 

                                 JAKE
                        They’re mine. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Oh man. 

           Delund calls from the other end of the blacktop. 

                                 DAN DELUND
                        Let’s go Trotter! You baby! 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        We gotta get you outta here. If 
                        Delund sees you he’ll kill you.  

           Olsen runs over.   
                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        Hey, what are-- Oh my GOD! You’re 
                        wearing Katie Sorrentino’s boots!

                                 JAKE
                        They’re mine.

           Out on the blacktop Delund’s had enough. 

                                 DAN DELUND
                        That’s it! I’m coming over there! 

                                 JAKE
                        What do I do? 

           The guys panic. Delund jogs toward the group. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Answering too many math questions, 
                        having insufficient fruit roll ups 
                        for the taking, these were grounds 
                        for physical retaliation. But 
                        girls’ boots? There was no telling 
                        what Delund would do. 

                                 DAN DELUND
                        I call dibs if there’s a dead 
                        squirrel back there again-- 

           Delund notices the boots and stops short. Bewildered. Angry.   

                                 DAN DELUND
                        What the--?! Are those..? 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Painfully, my mind flipped through 
                        the Rolodex of punishment I was 
                        about to endure.    

           Jake takes his retainer out, preparing for the beating.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Weeks of wedgies, swirlies, dead 
                        legs, dead arms, dead torsos--

                                 DAN DELUND
                        I think we got ourselves a pair of 
                        girls’ boots here.

           Delund grabs Jake by the coat, holds him up. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        But then, I heard the voice of an 
                        angel. 
                                 JOSH FARMER (O.S.)
                        HEY! HEY YOU GUYS! YOU GUYS!  

           Farmer runs across the playground waving a green flyer. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        I got proof! The Cub Scout “take 
                        home note”! It says it right here! 
                        Proof it’s a Nintendo! It really is 
                        a Nintendo!

           Delund drops Jake and grabs Farmer’s flyer. This is bigger 
           news than girls’ boots any day. A crowd starts to gather.  

                                 DAN DELUND
                        Just a picture of a dumb wreath. So 
                        what? 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        You gotta read it. 
                             (reading)
                        “This year’s first prize is a the 
                        perfect addition to any Cub Scout 
                        living room. The new Nintendo 
                        Entertainment System!” 

           The boys’ eyes widen. Maybe it is true. Delund grabs the 
           flyer back, his disbelief vanishing. We see it in print.  

                                 DAN DELUND
                        “Nintendo Entertainment System.”

           A beat. Delayed shock. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        By God, little Farmer had struck 
                        gold! 

           The boys all cheer and jump around. Delund puts Farmer in a 
           headlock and happily/violently nuggies his head. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Ow. Ow. Okay, ow.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        A cheer went up among us. And for a 
                        brief moment, my girls’ boots 
                        became a neglected side show. It 
                        was all I needed.  

           Jake casually runs away toward the side of the school. Only 
           Trotter, Olsen and Delund have seen the boots. 
                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Ecstatic on several levels, I took 
                        off to hide behind the dumpster and 
                        contemplate the biggest wreath 
                        selling campaign to ever hit 
                        Batavia. That Nintendo was mine.  

           Jake crouches behind a dumpster, giddy with excitement. 

           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - JAKE’S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - DAY

           Jake rushes into his room, tearing off his jacket. He’s 
           wearing his shoes now. Patty calls out from downstairs. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE (O.S.)
                        How was school honey?! What did you 
                        learn today?!  

           Jake takes his boots out of his backpack, stuffs them under 
           his bed. He grabs his Cub Scout uniform from his closet.  

           INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS - DAY 

           Patty sits at the table with Lizzy. Patty drinks coffee, 
           Lizzy drinks milk. They both flip through magazines. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE 
                        I learned about Brazil today. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Really? 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE 
                        Yes, it’s in South America. They 
                        speak Portuguese there. Most people 
                        don’t know that, but I do.    

           Lizzy helps herself to a cookie, nibbling it thoughtfully. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE 
                        Portuguese comes from Portugal. Do 
                        you think they have Cabbage Patch 
                        dolls in Portugal? 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Ah yes. There were other Christmas 
                        plans hatching in the Doyle house.

                                 PATTY DOYLE 
                        Well Lizzy, I don’t really--
           Jake comes flying through the kitchen. His Cub Scout uniform 
           is half on half off. He slides across the floor.  

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Jake. Where are you--?

           No response, Jake is out the door. 

                                 LIZZY
                        They probably don’t have Cabbage 
                        Patch dolls in Portugal. Those 
                        poor, poor children of Portugal... 

           EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE THE DOYLE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

           Jake comes flying out of the house buttoning up his blue Cub 
           Scout shirt under his jacket. He wears a blue and gold Cub 
           Scout ski cap and holds a clipboard and a pen.  

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Less than twenty minutes after the 
                        final school bell, I was fitted in 
                        my dress blues and on my way, 
                        secretly envisioning the acres of 
                        Alaskan pine forest needed to cover 
                        the amount of wreathes I was about 
                        to sell. 

           EXT. HOUSE ON JAKE’S STREET - CONTINUOUS - DAY

           Jake rushes up the steps of a neighboring house to make his 
           first sale. He knocks confidently on the door. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Oh I had it all planned out. 
                             (sales voice)
                        “Yes, I’m with the Cub Scouts 
                        ma’am. And without your help, 
                        thousands of boys may become drug 
                        addicts and communists before the 
                        year 1997. All we need from you is 
                        a bit of generosity in the form of 
                        a marvelous Merry Christmas 
                        wreath!”   

           The door opens. An imposing FAT MAN stands there. 

                                 FAT MAN 
                        WHAT?! 

           Jake freezes, scared.  
                                 JAKE
                        Uh. Communists. 

                                 FAT MAN
                        What? What is it?  

           Jake just stands there, stammering. 

                                 FAT MAN
                        Look kid they got Ditka on WGN 
                        tellin’ ethnic jokes, whaddya want? 

                                 JAKE
                        Uh, hello, my name is--

                                 FAT MAN
                        Wait, are you trying to sell me 
                        something? 

           The Fat Man points to a small white sign next to the door 
           that reads “No Solicitors”. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Solicitors? Oh no, I’m with the Cub 
                        Scouts sir.

                                 JAKE
                        Wanna buy a wreath? 

           The Fat Man looks at his door. It already has a wreath on it. 

                                 FAT MAN 
                        You got a learning disability?!    

           Jake just stares at him blankly.

                                 FAT MAN
                             (concerned)
                        Wait, you don’t really got a 
                        learning disability do you? 

           Jake shakes his head “no”. 

                                 FAT MAN
                        Good. 

           The Fat Man slams the door shut in Jake’s face.   

                                 JOSH FARMER (O.S.)
                        Gotta look out for those “No 
                        Solicitors” signs.  
           Jake turns to see Josh Farmer walking up the steps of the 
           house next door. Like Jake, he wears a Cub Scout hat and 
           holds a clipboard.

                                 JAKE
                        What are you doing here Farmer? 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Just out for a stroll. 

           Farmer smiles, rings the bell. 

                                 JAKE
                        You can’t sell wreathes here.

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Why’s that?

                                 JAKE
                        Because this is my block, that’s 
                        the rule. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        You think there are rules here, 
                        Doyle? There are no rules.

                                 JAKE
                        That Nintendo’s mine! 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        I already sold sixty seven wreathes 
                        already. 

                                 JAKE
                        To who? 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        People. Your mom. 

                                 JAKE
                        You’re full of it Farmer. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        We’ll see about that. 

           A HOUSE WIFE opens the door in front of Josh. Josh smiles.   

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Hello ma’am. That’s a lovely blouse 
                        you’re wearing. Let me ask you a 
                        question. Do you love your country?  
           Farmer’s good. Jake scowls, rolls up his sleeves. This isn’t 
           gonna be easy. The Jam’s “TOWN CALLED MALICE” kicks in and we 
           begin our wreath selling montage!

           EXT/INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - MONTAGE - DAY 

           Cub Scouts hustle up and down sidewalks and staircases all 
           over town. The boys in blue are out in force.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        All over town Cub Scouts pounded 
                        the pavement in record numbers. 

           Various Cub Scouts stand on different door steps and porches.

                                 MIKEY TROTTER

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        All in the name of Nintendo. And it 
                        was every man for himself. 

           - Two CUB SCOUTS argue outside a JEWEL GROCERY STORE. 
                                 CUB SCOUT 1
                        I was here first!  

                                 CUB SCOUT 2
                        Were not! 

                                 CUB SCOUT 1
                        Was too! I got Jewel! You take the 
                        White Hens!

                                 CUB SCOUT 1
                        No one goes to White Hens! 

           - Two CUB SCOUTS race toward the same door, then wrestle on 
           the front porch trying to be the first one to ring the bell. 

           - The PAPER BOY rides down the street, chucking papers with a 
           bright red WREATH ORDER FORM wrapped onto every one.

           - The Cub Scouts at the Jewel now have each other in head 
           locks. A SALVATION ARMY SANTA CLAUS tries to break them up. 

                                 SALVATION ARMY SANTA
                        Guys, guys! 

           - A bare fingered glove bangs on a door. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Kids who weren’t even in Cub Scouts 
                        were getting in on the action.

           Pull back to reveal Dan Delund. He’s written CUB SCOUT on a 
           piece of masking tape and taped it to his White Snake hat. 

                                 DAN DELUND
                        Your mom home? No? Okay you just 
                        bought three wreathes.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Even I was getting the hang of it. 

           - Jake stands on a few porches, more confident.  

                                 JAKE
                        Hello sir.

                        Hello ma’am. 

           - Jake stands before his ancient neighbor MISS SHERMAN (90s, 
           bathrobe and slippers). She can barely hear or see.   
                                 JAKE
                        Hello Miss Sherman. It’s Jake Doyle 
                        from down the street.

                        JAKE DOYLE FROM DOWN THE STREET!

           - Jake stands on another doorstep. 

                                 JAKE
                        Wanna buy a wreath? 

           - Jake stands in the Christmas decorations aisle of a 
           hardware store next to a MAN HOLDING CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.

                        Wanna buy a wreath?

           - Jake stands on a doorstep next to a PIZZA DELIVERY GUY 
           waiting for the door to open. Jake turns to the pizza guy. 

                                 JAKE
                        Wanna buy a wreath?

           - Back to old Miss Sherman. 

                                 JAKE
                        Would you like to buy a wreath?  

                                 MISS SHERMAN
                        Teeth? I don’t have any teeth. 

                                 JAKE
                        A WREATH! WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUY A 
                        WREATH MISS SHERMAN?! 

                                 MISS SHERMAN
                        Oh, yes indeedy. Come on in. I’ll 
                        make ya some sandwiches.  

           Miss Sherman pulls him inside. Jake groans.  

           - Farmer steps out of a house smiling. It’s DUSK out now.  

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        And God bless the United States of 
                        America! You have yourself a merry 
                        Christmas Mrs. Doyle. 

           Farmer’s just sold a wreath to Jake’s mom. He skips down the 
           steps and pats a stunned Jake on the shoulder. 
                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Told ya. 

           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER - NIGHT 

           Jake sits at the dinner table, fuming. At the counter, Patty 
           cuts up vegetables for some large dinner salads. 

                                 JAKE
                        Did it have to be Farmer?

           John enters through the backdoor, carrying a bucket of tools. 
           He’s clearly been working outside on the house. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        I’m sorry. You hate selling 
                        wreathes. How was I supposed to 
                        know you were going to do it this 
                        year. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        He only cares about it now because 
                        they’re giving away a Ninten--

           Jake kicks the table, coughs. 

                                 JAKE
                        A night in Chicago. Yeah, it’s a 
                        new prize. At a hotel I think. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        That’s a weird prize. 

           Lizzy smiles, delighted.

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        That is a weird prize. Don’t you 
                        think that’s a weird prize Dad?  

           John rummages through the refrigerator, not listening.

                                 JOHN DOYLE 
                        God bless it. Where the hell is it? 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Screwdriver’s in the butter dish. 

           John pulls a screwdriver out of the butter dish. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        No that’s not it.  

           John puts it back. He rummages more. 
                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        What are you looking for? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        My gourmet sausage.  

           Jake looks around nervously.    

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Whoopsie...

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        How the hell do you lose a sausage?

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        I’m sure it will turn up honey. 
                        Have a seat, dinner’s ready. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        I wanna eat it with dinner. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        We’re having salads. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        That’s why I wanna eat the sausage! 

           Patty sits. John sits down in a huff. 

                                 JAKE
                        Maybe Elwood ate it, Dad. He’s been 
                        pooping so much lately.  

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        He has, hasn’t he. You know how I 
                        know that? Because it’s still not 
                        picked up. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Whoopsie again. 

                                 JAKE
                        It snowed. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        That’s no excuse. Tomorrow morning. 
                        You and that shovel. Back yard. 

                                 JAKE
                        But I’m totally supposed to sell 
                        wreathes all day. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Too bad. And stop saying totally.  
                                 JAKE
                        That’s not fair.

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        You want fair? I’ll give you fair! 
                        Every day I go to work and bust my--

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        --Innn the name of the father...

           Patty starts to make the sign of the cross, the signal that 
           it’s time to pray and eat. And that she’s had enough.  

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        And of the Son and of the Holy 
                        Spirit amen. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Gourmet sausage!

                                 ALL THE DOYLES
                        Bless us, oh Lord, for these thy 
                        gifts...

           The Doyles all mumble their way through the Catholic dinner 
           prayer. John sputters. Jake cringes. Lizzy smiles.  

           EXT. DOYLE HOUSE - BACKYARD - MORNING - DAY

           Jake stands in the backyard, a small shovel over his shoulder 
           and a garbage bag in his had. Elwood pops a squat in the snow 
           nearby, panting almost mockingly at Jake. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Elwood was one year older than 
                        myself and in that eleven year span 
                        I was convinced he had pooped more 
                        times than any other dog, in the 
                        history of the world. 

           Jake scans the yard. Despite the recent snow fall, little 
           black poo specs still dot the lawn. 

           John heads toward the shed carrying half a hardware store. 
           The shed sits in a tucked away corner of the yard next to a 
           cluster of large trees. 

                                 JAKE
                        What’s Lizzy doing? She can’t help? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Lizzy’s being six years old right 
                        now Jake. Just pick it up. 
           Jake scowls. John sighs. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        C’mere. Take a deep breath. 

           John takes a deep breath, soaking in the winter air. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Smell that? 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Poo? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Fresh air. That’s all we had and we 
                        loved it. You know, when I was your 
                        age we didn’t have Nintendos. We 
                        used to build forts in the woods 
                        all day. Can you believe that? We’d 
                        gather up old lumber, siding, 
                        whatever we could find. We made 
                        look out towers, rope ladders...  

                                 JAKE
                        Trap doors? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Yeah, trap doors too.   

                                 JAKE
                        Cool. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        It was cool. We’d work on ‘em all 
                        year round. 

                                 JAKE
                        Kinda like the house? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                             (chuckles)
                        Yeah. Kinda like the house.

           John and Jake trade a smile. A nice moment between the two 
           for a change. They watch as Elwood finishes up his business. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Cry in a bucket that dog poops a 
                        lot. 

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah. 
                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Do that one last. Let it freeze. 

           John heads to the shed. Jake grabs his shovel, gets to work. 

           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - JAKE’S ROOM - LATER - DAY

           Jake trudges into his room, tired from a morning of picking 
           up poop. He opens his closet to grab his Cub Scout uniform.  

                                 LIZZY DOYLE (O.S.)
                        We need to talk. 

           Startled, Jake turns to see Lizzy coloring at his desk. 

                                 JAKE
                        What are you doing in my room? 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        I need your help. 

                                 JAKE
                        With what? 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Getting a Cabbage Patch. Santa 
                        didn’t get me a She-Ra last year so 
                        I can’t trust him. I gotta go 
                        through Mom and Dad. 

                                 JAKE
                        So what do you need me for? 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        I need you to tell them to get me 
                        one. A red head named Dawn, with 
                        freckles. It looks bad if I say it 
                        all the time. And we gotta act 
                        fast.   

           Lizzy points to a TIME MAGAZINE article next to her coloring 
           book. A headline reads “CABBAGE PATCH KIDS IN RECORD DEMAND.” 
           A picture shows two MOMS fighting over a doll. 

                                 JAKE
                        What are you gonna do for me? 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Tell you how to win the Nintendo. 

                                 JAKE
                        You don’t know how to win a 
                        Nintendo. 
                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Okay never mind. 

           Lizzy starts to pack up her stuff. 

                                 JAKE
                        Wait. Okay. How can I win it?

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        You promise to help me get a 
                        Cabbage Patch? 

                                 JAKE
                        Sure. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Promise? 

                                 JAKE
                        Yes, I promise already. What is it? 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Okay. You sold two wreathes to Miss 
                        Sherman yesterday right? 

                                 JAKE
                        How do you know that? 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Don’t worry about it. She bought a 
                        lot because she’s old, right? 

                                 JAKE
                        Not necessarily. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Yes necessarily. When you’re old, 
                        you buy stuff from kids. That’s 
                        what you do. So what you need are a 
                        bunch of old people all in one 
                        place so you don’t have to track 
                        them all down.

                                 JAKE
                        What’s your point? 

           Lizzy sets her crayon down and looks at Jake. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Prairie Pines. The nursing home. 
                        Two hundred old people with no 
                        where to go and nothing to do 
                        except buy wreathes from you.    
           Jake almost has to sit down that’s such a good idea. 

                                 JAKE
                        Wow. That’s a really good idea.

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        I know. So we got a deal or what? 

           Jake does sit down, reeling from the brilliance of this.  

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah... 

           Lizzy stands and hands Jake a drawing from her Cabbage Patch 
           Coloring book-- a picture of the exact doll she wants.  

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        A redhead. With freckles. Don’t 
                        mess it up. 

           Lizzy exits the room. 

           EXT. PRAIRIE PINES NURSING HOME - A LITTLE LATER - DAY 

           Jake rides his bike up to PRARIE PINES NURSING HOME. He wears 
           his Cub Scout shirt and his nicest dress pants and dress 
           shoes. His hair is combed and parted.   

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Ladies and gentlemen of Prairie 
                        Pines nursing home!

           INT. PRAIRIE PINES NURSING HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Jake strides down the hall. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Allow me to introduce myself. 

           Jake puts on a SANTA HAT as he rounds a corner and enters a 
           large DINING HALL. Dozens of OLD FOLKS enjoy lunch together. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        I am Jake Doyle. Cutest Cub Scout 
                        alive! 

           Jake stops in the doorway and waves adorably.  

                                 JAKE
                        Hello everybody.   
           The entire dining hall looks up, delighted to have a little 
           kid here visiting. 

                                 OLD FOLKS
                        Oh hello! / Merry Christmas!/ What 
                        a cute Cub Scout! / It’s Santa’s 
                        little helper!

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        That’s me. 

                                 OLD MAN
                        Well don’t just stand there sonny, 
                        come on over. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Don’t mind if I do. 

           Jake clicks his pen, smiling. This is going to work.  

           INT. DOYLE MINIVAN - THE NEXT DAY - DAY

           The Doyles’ ‘86 Chrysler Minivan heads east down I-290 toward 
           Chicago. STEELY DAN’S “DO IT AGAIN” plays on the tape deck.  

           Jake sits in the way back seat, happily studying his sales 
           sheets. They are heavily filled in with new sales.  

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        It took five hours and eleven cups 
                        of rice pudding, but I managed to 
                        sell a whopping eighty two wreathes 
                        to the nursing home. All thanks to 
                        Lizzy. 

           Jake shuffles to Lizzy’s Cabbage Patch Kid drawing. He gives 
           Lizzy a nod. Lizzy nods back in solidarity. 

                                 JAKE
                        Hey mom. Did you know that Water 
                        Tower Place has the best selection 
                        of Cabbage Patch kids in Chicago? 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        I didn’t know that, no. 

                                 JAKE
                        They do, which is good ‘cause 
                        they’re really flying off the 
                        shelves.

           John leans over to Patty as he drives, concerned.  
                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        He doesn’t want a Cabbage Patch kid 
                        now does he? 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Who knows with this one. 

           A car suddenly cuts John off. He lays on the horn. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Oh! Just put it anywhere pal! Yeah! 

           John scans the heavy traffic, shaking his head, muttering. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Everybody come on down to the city. 
                        All at once. All at the same time.     

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Ah yes, the annual Doyle Chicago 
                        Shopping Trip. Also known as my 
                        dad’s least favorite day of the 
                        year.  

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        You know, you could really use some 
                        new turtle necks John. Let’s try 
                        some on today. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Sounds great.  

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        The shopping. The stress. The 
                        traffic. The tourists. 

           John stews. Another car cuts him off. He lays on the horn. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Wisconsin plates! Shocker! 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        The man held it together with 
                        nothing more than sheer will and a 
                        Steely Dan Mix tape. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Can we turn on Christmas carols? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        No Christmas carols! 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:
           INT. WATER TOWER PLACE SHOPPING MALL - LATER - DAY 

           A group of elf costumed CHRISTMAS CAROLERS sing SLEIGH RIDE 
           as they ride up a crowded escalator with the Doyles. The mall 
           is PACKED. One ANNOYING CAROLER is inches from John’s face. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Just breathe honey. Just breathe. 

           This is John’s hell.   

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        They gotta put a bar in here.

           INT. WATER TOWER PLACE - MARSHALL FIELDS - LATER - DAY

           Lizzy scurries ahead through the department store MARSHALL 
           FIELDS. Jake walks with Patty. John lags behind carrying the 
           day’s shopping bags like a pack mule.  

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        There’s the Cabbage Patch section! 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Lead the way Lizzy.

           Lizzy charges ahead toward a big Cabbage Patch Kid sign.

                                 JAKE
                        Hey Mom, did you know Cabbage Patch 
                        kids come with their own birth 
                        certificates?

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        I didn’t know that, no. 

                                 JAKE
                             (whispering)
                        Lizzy really wants one. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        They’re very expensive Jake. And 
                        very hard to find.  

           Lizzy rounds the corner and stops short. The Cabbage Patch 
           aisle is almost completely BARE. Only a few bald headed boys 
           and an armless girl remain. 

           An OLD JANITOR sadly sweeps up the remains. 

                                 OLD JANITOR
                        Sold out in twenty minutes. Last 
                        patch in all of Chicago. 
           Lizzy holds it together for a second, then buries her head in 
           her hands, crying. Patty picks her up, consoling her. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        It’s okay Lizzy. I saw some really 
                        nice Care Bears on the way in. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Yippie. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Poor little Lizzy. It kinda made 
                        you want to go over there and wipe 
                        her tears and give her a big hhhh--

           Jake notices a BEAUTIFUL NINTENDO DISPLAY in the distance. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        --hhhhhold on a second. 

           Jake just stands there staring at it. The display is twenty 
           feet tall, featuring large cut-outs of NES characters: Zelda, 
           Mario, etc. A huge TV rests in the center of it, surrounded 
           by blinking lights and other high tech flourishes.   

                                 NINTENDO (V.O.)
                        Hello Jake. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Who said that? 

                                 NINTENDO (V.O.)
                        You know who. 

           Jake focuses on the GIANT REPLICA of the NES console at the 
           base of the display. In Jake’s mind, it’s talking to him. 
           It’s slightly robotic and creepy. Think the voice of KEVIN 
           SPACEY (but, you know, not him). 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Nintendo? 

                                 NINTENDO (V.O.)
                        That’s right. Come over here. I’ve 
                        missed you.  

           Patty taps Jake on the shoulder, not noticing the display. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Jake, Dad and I are going upstairs 
                        to get the Fenelons a gift.  

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        They never get us anything. 
           Patty sets Lizzy down. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        You can stay down here with the 
                        toys, just watch your sister. Okay? 

           Jake hasn’t heard a word she just said. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Jake. 

                                 JAKE
                        What? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Watch your sister. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        We’ll be right back. Okay?

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah.

           Patty heads up the escalator with John. Jake just stares at 
           the Nintendo, completely under its spell.  

                                 NINTENDO (V.O.)
                        That’s it. Come on over Jake.   

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        What am I gonna do about my Cabbage 
                        Patch now, Jake? 

                                 NINTENDO (V.O.)
                        Forget your sister Jake, she’s 
                        useless. 

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah, useless...  

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Who are you talking to? 

           Jake starts walking toward the display. Lizzy follows. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        We need a new plan. Jake? Jake.  

                                 NINTENDO (V.O.)
                        Do you know how many games I have 
                        here Jake? I have all of the games. 

           Jake gets closer, now standing eye level with the NES.  
                                 NINTENDO (V.O.)
                        What game would you like to play?  

                                 JAKE
                        Top Gun. 

           Beat. 

                                 NINTENDO (V.O.)
                        Pick another one. I don’t have that 
                        one. 

                                 JAKE
                        Mega Man. 

                                 NINTENDO (V.O.)
                        Mmm, how ‘bout Double Dragon? It’s 
                        loaded up right now. You have to 
                        get an employee to change it 
                        otherwise. It’s a whole thing.  

                                 JAKE
                        Cool. 

           Jake grabs a controller and starts playing DOUBLE DRAGON. His 
           character punches and kicks opponents at will.  

                                 NINTENDO (V.O.)
                        Oh very good. Yes. I can tell 
                        you’ve got what it takes. 

                                 JAKE
                        Yes I do. 

           Jake exhales, focused-- a kid about to get in the zone. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Maybe it was the excitement of the 
                        display, or just the thrill of 
                        playing in public. But for some 
                        reason I started playing the game 
                        of my life.

           As Jake punches and kicks, TIME STARTS PASSING.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Never before had my thumbs 
                        maneuvered with such efficiency. My 
                        response time was clicking at an 
                        all star rate.  

           Jake’s eyes widen. His face contorts with his character’s 
           motions on screen. KIDS start to gather around to watch.  
                                 BOY ONE
                        Dude you’re on fire. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        All other distractions became 
                        irrelevant. My senses had reached a 
                        higher state. I’d become one with 
                        Nintendo.

           Jake’s beats a level, pulls out his retainer and in SLOW 
           MOTION yells a primal roar. 

                                 JAKE
                        YEAAAAAH! 

           The crowd, even bigger now, cheers! Jake bounces in place 
           like a boxer. People pat him on the shoulders.  

                                 NINTENDO (V.O.)
                        Yes! Yes! You were born for this 
                        moment! 

                                 BOY ONE
                        What’d you say your name was again? 

                                 NINTENDO (V.O.)
                        Go ahead. Tell them your name Jake. 
                        Say it!    

                                 JAKE
                        Jake Doyle!  

                                 NINTENDO (V.O.)
                        Jake Doyle! Nintendo master!

                                 BOY TWO
                        My man Jake.

                                 BOY ONE
                        Jake! Jake! Jake! 

           The crowd starts chanting. “Jake! Jake! Jake!” 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        This was why I wanted a Nintendo. 
                        This right here. This was my 
                        destiny. Nothing could stop me now!

                                 CROWD
                        Jake! Jake! Jake!

           Jake keeps playing, a manic look in his eyes. Through the 
           chanting, two muffled voices start to come into focus. 
                                 PATTY DOYLE (O.S.)
                        Jake! Jake! Jake!

                                 JOHN DOYLE (O.S.)
                        JAKE STEPHAN DOYLE! 

           Jake freezes and looks up to see his parents standing above 
           him. John grabs him by the jacket, lifts him up. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Where. Is. Your. Sister?! 

           The chanting stops. The music stops. Everything stops. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Oh dear God in heaven. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Where is she?! 

           Jake can’t get out an answer. John drops him like a sack of 
           potatoes. He and Patty start looking around frantically. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Lizzy! Lizzy honey? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Elizabeth! 

                                 BOY ONE
                        You’re a dead man bro. 

           Jake drops the controller and starts running around looking 
           for Lizzy too. Panic has set in. 

                                 JAKE
                        Lizzy?! Lizzy?! 

           Jake runs down toy aisle after toy aisle. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        In the realm of punishable kid 
                        offenses losing your sister ranked 
                        somewhere just above grand theft 
                        auto and just below lighting your 
                        grandma on fire. I had to find her. 

           EXT. WATER TOWER PLACE - MICHIGAN AVE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

           Lizzy stands before a SALVATION ARMY SANTA CLAUS (30s), 
           grilling him with questions. She’s been at it for awhile. 
                                 LIZZY DOYLE 
                        Do they speak English at the North 
                        Pole?

                                 SALVATION ARMY SANTA
                        Yes. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE 
                        Even the elves? 

                                 SALVATION ARMY SANTA
                        Yes. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Even the elves that make the 
                        Cabbage Patch dolls? 

                                 SALVATION ARMY SANTA
                        Yes. 

           Jake comes rushing outside and sees Lizzy. 

                                 JAKE
                        She’s out here mom! I found her!

           Patty comes running out and scoops up Lizzy. Hugging her. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Oh Lizzy! 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE 
                        Mom, they might still have Cabbage 
                        Patch dolls at the North Pole! Even 
                        ones with red hair! 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Lizzy, we told you to stay with 
                        Jake. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE 
                        He was playing Nintendo. 

           John comes barreling out of the store, out of breath, irate.  

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        God bless America Jake! You play 
                        that stuff and your head goes to 
                        mush in three minutes! 

                                 JAKE
                        Sorry Dad.
                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        She’s your sister! It’s not like 
                        losing your retainer for cripes 
                        sake!  

           Jake freezes. He cautiously runs his tongue over his teeth. 
           No retainer. He subtilely checks his pockets. No retainer.   

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Oh for two. 

           John notices Jake’s reaction. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Open your mouth. 

           Jake slowly opens his mouth just enough so that you can’t see 
           anything on his teeth or the roof of his mouth. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Open it Jake. 

           Jake stands motionless, weighing his options.

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Do you have the Marshall Field bag 
                        John? 

           John looks down at the bags for a brief second. Jake makes a 
           break for it and runs back inside. John chases after him.

           INT. WATER TOWER PLACE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

           Jake rushes through the crowded store, frantically trying to 
           get back to the Nintendo display. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        The actual cost of my retainer had 
                        been explained to me in the simple 
                        terms of “if you lose it, don’t 
                        bother coming home.” 

           John runs after Jake, now hell bent on catching him. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        I figured it cost roughly as much 
                        as a new car. 

           Jake sprints around sales displays, weaves and bobs, takes 
           short cuts, dodges old ladies, runs past stores. 
           John barrels through fake snow, knocks over animatronic snow 
           men, side steps small children. He curses and sputters, takes 
           off his coat mid-stride and chucks it.  

           Jake and John end up on matching escalators on either side of 
           the second story foyer. They lock eyes from a distance. A 
           father son standoff. 

           Jake darts through shoppers on his escalator. John gets stuck 
           behind those damn ELF CAROLERS again. The same annoying one 
           is right in his face. 

                                                       JOHN DOYLE
                   ANNOYING ELF CAROLER
           Fiiiive golden rinnnnngs!
                                              AHHHHH!

           Jake nears the top of his escalator. Then he sees it. His 
           retainer! It’s lying across the hall on the floor in the 
           slush, getting kicked around, in danger of being crushed. It 
           sits equidistant from Jake’s escalator and John’s. 

           SLOW MOTION: Jake takes off like a shot and runs towards it. 
           He slides feet first, baseball style toward the retainer. In 
           one athletic swoop he scoops it up, wipes it on his coat, 
           pops it in his mouth and stops at his dad’s approaching feet. 

           John stands above Jake like an umpire. He didn’t see the 
           slide. He points to Jake’s mouth. Jake opens it, smiling. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Safe.

           EXT. SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - BEHIND THE DUMPSTER - DAY 

           Jake’s slight smile matches the one from the previous scene. 
           He sits in the snow behind the dumpster, hiding his girls’ 
           boots from view, watching recess from a distance. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Despite nearly losing my sister and 
                        my retainer at the hands of 
                        Nintendo, I had managed to survive.

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY 

           Jake comes bounding down the steps, fresh from another sale. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        And by the final day of wreath 
                        selling I’d sold an astounding 
                        ninety six wreathes. 
           INT. DOYLE MINI VAN - NIGHT 

           John drives, intently listening to the CHICAGO BLACKHAWKS 
           game on the radio. Jake sits shotgun, staring out the window.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Before I knew it, I’d have a 
                        Nintendo. And then everything would 
                        change. Everything...   

           Jake smiles to himself.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - NIGHT - FANTASY SEQUENCE 

           Peter Gabriel’s “BIG TIME” plays. There’s a party going on in 
           the Doyle house. A Nintendo party! Pretty much everyone we’ve 
           seen in the movie so far is here, decked out in hip 80s 
           fashion. Lizzy walks around with a tray of ECTO COOLER JUICE 
           BOXES passing them out to guests.  

           A NINTENDO rests on a marble pedestal, hooked up to a BIG 
           SCREEN TV in a maze of blinking lights and high tech wiring. 
           A crowd of kids huddle around it, playing ICE HOCKEY.

           Arm in arm, John and Patty happily survey the party.

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Jake’s test scores are up again. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE 
                        That Nintendo Entertainment System 
                        is the best thing that ever 
                        happened to this family. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Totally. 

           A pair of COMBAT BOOTS descend the stairs. Tilt up to reveal 
           Jake. He wears sunglasses, a Miami Vice sport coat and a Rad 
           Racer T-Shirt. The NES gun is holstered on his belt. GIRLS 
           wave hello, including KATIE SORRENTINO who wears her boots.  

                                 JAKE
                        Like those boots Katie Sorrentino. 
                        If you’ve noticed, mine are 
                        completely different from yours. 

                                 KATIE SORRENTINO
                        I did. 

           Katie smiles, a little flirtatiously. Jake nods back cooly.
           Jake walks through the party, trading hellos with various 
           80’S ICONS including MARC SUMMERS and SPUDS MCKENZIE. 

                                 JAKE
                        Marc Summers, my man. Spuds 
                        McKenzie, ‘sup dog? Glad you could 
                        make it. Mega Man and the 
                        California Raisins! That’s what I’m 
                        talking about! 

           Jake exchanges high fives with a life size MEGA MAN and life 
           size CALIFORNIA RAISINS. 

           Jake leans over to Dan Delund, who wears a suit and 
           sunglasses and works the door, clearly the party’s bouncer.  

                                 JAKE
                        We gotta get Ronald McDonald out of 
                        here. He’s freaking people out. 

                                 DAN DELUND
                        No problem boss. 
                             (points off camera)
                        You. Clown.

           Delund goes to take care of it. Jake walks up to the Nintendo 
           where the Gruseckis play Ice Hockey. 

                                 JAKE
                        Gentlemen. Next game of Ice Hockey, 
                        mix it up a bit. Go all fat guys 
                        versus all skinnies. It’s a party. 

           Jake pulls out a candy cigarette, takes a bite. 

                                 JAKE
                             (to the crowd)
                        A Nintendo party! 

           The partygoers all cheer “woooo!”. 

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. DOYLE MINIVAN - NIGHT 

           Jake cheers quietly to himself, in a daze. 

                                 JAKE
                        Wooo... Wooo...

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Will you quit “wooing” for crying 
                        out loud?!
           Jake snaps out of it. 

                                 JAKE
                        Huh?

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        We’re on a power play here, I’m 
                        trying to listen to this. 

                                 JAKE
                        Sorry Dad. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                             (muttering to himself)
                        Hawks can’t score, kid’s makin’ 
                        weird noises...

           The crowd noise intensifies. John turns it up.  

                                 PAT FOLEY (V.O.)
                        Larmer high slot... Savard with it 
                        now. Down the near side-- past 
                        Claude Lemuix-- Oh! He shoots he 
                        scores! DENNY SAVARD! Hawks take 
                        the lead!

           The Stadium horn blares. The crowd erupts. John cheers. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Ha ha! Dipsey-doo to you Lemuix! 

                                 PAT FOLEY (V.O.)
                        And Claude Lemuix is still jawing 
                        away. He did not like that move 
                        Savard put on him.  

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Oh, quit your whining Claude. 
                        You’re all talk no walk. Jake? 

           Jake looks over. John looks him in the eyes.  

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Always remember, a bully like 
                        Claude Lemuix isn’t worth a hill of 
                        beans. All talk, no walk. Worst 
                        combo a man can have. Now what do 
                        you know about Cabbage Patch Dolls? 

                                 JAKE
                        Huh? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        You seem to know a lot about them.
                                 JAKE
                        I don’t want a Cabbage Patch Doll. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        I know, but you know what they look 
                        like, right? 

                                 JAKE
                        I guess. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Good. 

           Jake looks out the window, suddenly concerned. 

                                 JAKE
                        Where are we going? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        To see a guy. 

                                 JAKE
                        About Cabbage Patch Dolls? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Do you wanna deal with your sister 
                        if she doesn’t get one? 

                                 JAKE
                        No. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Then there ya go.

           EXT. SHADY STREET - AURORA - NIGHT

           A deserted street in the much more urban city of Aurora. John 
           and Jake exit the van. Jake looks a little nervous. John is 
           focused, he splits a stick of gum for the two of them.

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Stay close. Let me do the talking. 

           A DEALER stands against an abandoned building across the 
           street. He wears a Members Only jacket, smokes a cigarette. 
           Jake and John approach him. 

                                 DEALER
                        Help you boys? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Word is you’ve come into a little 
                        cabbage. 
                                 DEALER
                        Step into my office gentlemen. 

           The dealer leads John and Jake down the adjacent alleyway 
           toward his car, a ‘79 CUTLASS.  

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        I’m gonna need a girl with 
                        freckles. 

                                 DEALER
                        Not a problem. 

           The dealer opens his trunk to reveal a dozen CABBAGE PATCH 
           KIDS all covered in a blanket with just their heads sticking 
           out. It’s a little unsettling.

                                 DEALER
                        Best patch in the Tri Cities. 

           John looks them over, then gives Jake a look for 
           confirmation. Jake leans over, studying them. 

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah, they’re legit. 

                                 DEALER
                        ‘Course they’re legit. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        There aren’t any freckles on the 
                        redhead. 

                                 DEALER
                        The freckles are on the blond here. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Listen Mac, I need a redhead with 
                        freckles or we don’t have a deal. 

                                 DEALER
                        This ain’t a make your own pizza 
                        pie here pal. Look, I had this lady 
                        lookin’ for a green eyed black 
                        haired kid a few weeks ago. I says 
                        all I got is a green eyed blond 
                        haired one. Lady says she’ll just 
                        dye the doll’s hair. Badda-bip-
                        boop, she’s got herself a black 
                        haired green eyed Cabbage Patch 
                        doll.  

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        That worked? 
                                 DEALER
                        Like a charm. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        How much? 

                                 DEALER
                        Hundred. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        A hundred?!

                                 DEALER
                        Where else you gonna find one man? 
                        Every store from Wheaton to 
                        Winnetka’s out. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE

                        brothers in Villa Park selling for

                        have to.

                        Diaz brothers. You don’t want their 
                        bald headed junk. Eighty. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Seventy. Last offer. 

                                 DEALER
                        Fine. Deal. 

           John pulls out his wallet, nods for Jake to grab the doll. 
           Jake pulls the doll out to find it’s COMPLETELY NAKED. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Oh! Hey!  

           John covers Jake’s eyes, grabs the doll.  

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        What the hell is this?!

                                 DEALER
                        What? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Where’s her clothes?

                                 DEALER
                        You didn’t say nothin’ about no 
                        clothes. 
                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Jiminy Cricket. I can’t give my 
                        daughter a naked doll for crying 
                        out loud. My wife will kill me! 

                                 DEALER
                        I don’t do clothes man, it just 
                        complicates things. I want this 
                        dress, I want that dress, I want a 
                        stinkin’ space suit, no, you want 
                        the doll, you get the doll, that’s 
                        it. 

           John sputters. He puts a five back in his wallet. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Sixty five. I thought there were 
                        clothes.  

                                 DEALER
                        Seventy. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Sixty five, that’s all you’re gonna 
                        get. Yes or no? 

           The dealer relents and holds his hand out for the cash. John 
           slaps it in. John leads Jake out of the alley, proudly. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Down from a hundred. You see that 
                        Jake? Lizzy’s gonna love it. 

           Jake forces a smile.  

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Of course she would. Like always, 
                        my parents were getting Lizzy 
                        exactly what she wanted for 
                        Christmas. Me? I had to do it all 
                        on my own... 

           INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - NIGHT

           The cafeteria is eerily dark. Rows and rows of Cub Scouts 
           stand in front of metal folding chairs, all dressed in 
           uniform, their faces illuminated by candles in their hands.   

           Jake stands next to Olsen and Trotter. Anticipation is in the 
           air. MR. HALBERG (40s, Pack Leader, ‘Nam Vet) stands before 
           the group. He wears a Cub Scout shirt and holds a candle. 
                                 MR. HALBERG
                        Gentlemen, look deeply into the 
                        candle’s flame. Stare into its 
                        dancing light. Now... close your 
                        eyes. What do you see? 

           All the scouts close their eyes. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Fifty seven glorious visions of 
                        Nintendo blazed before us. For 
                        tonight was the night one of us was 
                        going home with an NES. 

                                 MR. HALBERG
                        You see the flame gentlemen. It 
                        burns even when your eyes are 
                        closed. Because when we blow these 
                        candles out, we know the Cub Scout 
                        flame will never fade. 

           Halberg blows out his candle, the Cub Scouts follow suit. 

                                 MR. HALBERG
                        It will remain with us forever. 

           The lights come back on, everyone sits. Halberg is a little 
           choked up with his speech. He checks his list. 

                                 MR. HALBERG
                        Ahem. A lot to go over tonight 
                        gents. Pine Wood Derby, Loyalty Day 
                        parade, I got another ‘Nam poem for 
                        you entitled “A Tie is Not a Loss-”

                                 DAN DELUND
                        Get to the wreathes, Halberg! 

                                 MR. HALBERG
                        I’m sorry? 

                                 DAN DELUND
                        The wreathes. 

           Halberg notices Dan Delund leaning against the back wall in 
           his bomber jacket-- the only kid here not in uniform. 

                                 MR. HALBERG
                        Are you in this troop? 

                                 DAN DELUND
                        I’m here ain’t I? 

           Halberg stares, about to say something. 
                                 CUB SCOUT ONE (O.S.)
                        Do the wreathes!

                                 CUB SCOUT TWO (O.S.)
                        Yeah! Wreathes!

           The crowd starts chanting “Wreathes-wreathes-wreathes!”. 

                                 MR. HALBERG
                        Okay, okay. We’ll do the wreathes.  

           The boys cheer and stomp their feet! 

                                 MR. HALBERG
                        Calm down, calm down. Now I know 
                        you’ve all been selling very hard 
                        this year, so we’ve really done our 
                        best to make these prizes special. 
                        Mr. Delacruz, if you will?  

           Another Scout Leader, MR. DELACRUZ rolls three carts out onto 
           the stage marked THIRD PRIZE, SECOND PRIZE and FIRST PRIZE. 
           Each prize is mysteriously covered with a SHEET.   

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Ho-ho! Look at that! First prize 
                        looked even bigger than a normal 
                        NES system. Who knew what other 
                        Nintendo treasures were under 
                        there. 

           Farmer leans over to the Gruseckis. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Told ya it came with the Power Pad. 

           Mr. Halberg steps on stage, clears his throat. 

                                 MR. HALBERG
                        Ahem. Alright. In third place this 
                        year... Joshua Farmer! 

           Applause and laughter. Josh reluctantly goes up on stage. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Considering Farmer’s constant 
                        claims to victory, this was a 
                        delight to us all. Anybody had a 
                        chance now. 

           Mr. Halberg lifts the sheet revealing a small box. Farmer 
           opens it and pulls out a small card and reads from it. 
                                 JOSH FARMER
                        A subscription to “Boys’ Life”. 

           More mocking laughter. Josh trudges back to his seat. 

                                 MR. HALBERG 
                        In second place, selling even more 
                        than last year, Jeff Bristow! 

           Polite applause. JEFF BRISTOW, the Cub Scout who was fighting 
           outside the Jewel earlier, sulks his way up onto the stage. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Bristow walked up onto stage like 
                        he’d just been shot. There was no 
                        second place when it came to 
                        Nintendo. 

           Halberg pulls back the sheet revealing a nice GLOBE. 

                                 MR. HALBERG
                        Look at that! A globe that lights 
                        up! 

           Bristow picks up the globe and immediately dumps it in the 
           trash as he walks off stage. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        You had to feel for the guy. 

                                 MR. HALBERG
                        And now, the first prize winner of 
                        this year’s wreath selling contest.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        This was it. This was it...

                                 MR. HALBERG
                        The highest sales total in troop 
                        history... Jake Doyle! 

           Jake cheers! His friends all maul him like he just hit a walk 
           off homer. Jake gallops up on stage, beaming.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        You can put it on the boaaaaard, 
                        YES! Oh, so many people to thank. 
                        My friends, my family, the Nintendo 
                        corporation. 

                                 MR. HALBERG 
                        This year’s first prize, the best 
                        we’ve had in years...
           SLOW MOTION: Halberg pulls back the sheet. 

                                 MR. HALBERG 
                        A brand new set of World Book 
                        Encyclopedias! 

           SHOCK hits the crowd. Horrible, terrible, dog-just-got-run 
           over-by-an-ice-cream-truck, shock. A few kids fall to their 
           knees. A set of ENCYCLOPEDIAS glisten under the lights.    

                                 JAKE
                        What?!

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        It was like winning more school. 

           Delund picks up a chair, hurls it across the room. 

                                 DAN DELUND
                        Where’s the Nintendo? Where is it?!

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        It didn’t make any sense! Why? Why 
                        had the Cub Scouts promised us toys 
                        and then given us books!? Who could 
                        possibly be behind something so 
                        terrible, so awful, so villainous?!

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           Timmy’s Dad, DR. TIMOTHY KLEEN SR (50s, glasses) stands 
           behind a podium. A button with Lacey Dog’s face on it is 
           pinned to his tweed jacket. This is a serious man. 

                                 DR. KLEEN
                        Parents of Batavia. Good evening.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Doctor Timothy Kleen Senior, that’s 
                        who.

           A hundred concerned parents sit on folding chairs in the gym, 
           including JOHN & PATTY DOYLE and a row of CUB SCOUT LEADERS. 

           EXT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

           Jake, Trotter and Olsen straddle their bikes and peer through 
           a small window at the back of the gym. A sign on the door 
           reads: EMERGENCY PTA MEETING TONIGHT ON VIDEO GAME VIOLENCE. 
                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        The dog...

                                 JAKE
                        This is bad. 

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        This is really bad...

           INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 

           Dr. Kleen continues. 

                                 DR. KLEEN
                        As some of you may know, there was 
                        an incident at my home last week. A 
                        member of the Kleen family, Lacy 
                        Dog Kleen...

           We notice MRS. KLEEN (30s, trophy wife) sitting in the 
           audience, wearing all black, crying into a Kleenex. 

                                 DR. KLEEN
                        ...was crushed to death by our 
                        forty two inch television set. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Forty two inches. That’s a nice TV. 

                                 DR. KLEEN
                        This dog killing crime has a 
                        culprit ladies and gentlemen. And 
                        it goes by the name Nintendo! 

           Kleen clicks on a slide projector and an image of Nintendo 
           covered in blood fills the screen. The audience gasps.  

                                 DR. KLEEN
                        Nintendo is the reason for this! 

           Kleen clicks to a photo of the smashed TV. 

                                 DR. KLEEN
                        And this! 

           A photo of a Timmy Kleen wailing hysterically. 

                                 DR. KLEEN
                        And this! 

           A photo of Lacy Dog’s paw sticking out from underneath the TV 
           like the Wicked Witch of the East. The crowd gasps.  
                                 DR. KLEEN
                        The question is, are we prepared to 
                        do something about it?!

           Mikey’s mom, MRS. TROTTER (40s) stands up, fired up. 

                                 MRS. TROTTER
                        We should ban it!

                                 DAD ONE
                        Yeah! Ban it! 

                                 OFFICER MASEJEWSKI
                        No more dogs are dying in my town!

                                 DR. KLEEN
                        We must protect our dogs! We must 
                        protect our children! 

           The crowd cheers. Jake, Trotter & Olsen look on, distraught. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Kleen’s panicked propaganda 
                        continued on well into the night, 
                        leaving even the most skeptical 
                        parents petrified that their own 
                        television sets might suddenly be 
                        jump kicked onto little sisters, 
                        immobile grandparents, Neil Diamond 
                        record collections. Poor Frankie 
                        Wattendorf who’d been unfortunately 
                        dragged to the event sat amid the 
                        hysteria and wept, openly.    

           FRANKIE WATTENDORF (8) sits between his parents, sobbing.  

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        It was virtual Nintendo Armageddon.

           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - MORNING - DAY

           Saturday morning cartoons. Jake and Lizzy sit on the couch 
           watching MUPPET BABIES in their pajamas.  

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        And there was nothing we could do 
                        about it. 

           The cartoon is suddenly interrupted by a NEWS ANCHOR.  
                                 NEWS ANCHOR 
                        We interrupt this program to bring 
                        you a special news bulletin from 
                        Kane County. 

           Lizzy and Jake exchange a worried look. The TV cuts to the 
           GENEVA COURTHOUSE in Kane County. A group of concerned 
           parents picket in the background with “NINTENDO-NO!” signs. A 
           REPORTER interviews Dr. Kleen.   

                                 REPORTER
                        Thank you Walter. We’re here live 
                        in Geneva with video game violence 
                        activist, Dr. Timothy Kleen. Dr. 
                        Kleen, it’s only eight shopping 
                        days now until Christmas and you’ve 
                        managed to pass a county wide ban 
                        on selling Nintendos? 

                                 DR. KLEEN
                        That’s correct. Every store in Kane 
                        county has agreed to it. 

                                 REPORTER
                        You really feel that Nintendo 
                        promotes violence enough to make it 
                        illegal?  

                                 DR. KLEEN
                        Has your dog ever been crushed to 
                        death by your TV? 

                                 REPORTER
                        No it has not. 

                                 DR. KLEEN
                        Okay then. Parents need to know the 
                        truth. Nintendo is pure evil and it 
                        has to be stopped. Nintendo-NO! 
                        Nintendo-NO! Nintendo-NO!

           Jake looks like he’s about to cry. Concerned, Lizzy hands him 
           the remote. Jake starts changing channels, his nerves shot.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Suddenly it was as if the entire 
                        world was against me. Was there no 
                        end to this anti-Nintendo madness?  

           Jake begins to hallucinate, his imagination running wild. He 
           clicks to MAX HEADROOM, the computer talking head. 

                                 MAX HEADROOM 
                        Ni, Ni, Ni, Nintendo No-friend-o. 
           He clicks to McGRUFF the crime fighting cartoon dog. 

                                 MCGRUFF
                        Say no to Nintendo and take a bite 
                        out of crime. 

           He clicks to A CARTOON MR. T. 

                                 CARTOON MR. T
                        I pity the fool who plays Nintendo!

           He clicks to A GI-JOE CARTOON. SHIPWRECK and FLINT talk to 
           two kids. One is fat: ERIC, one is skinny: MICHAEL. 

                                 FLINT 
                        And that’s why Eric over there is 
                        such a big fatso. 

           Eric turns from his game of Nintendo, waves in agreement. 

                                 MICHAEL 
                        Because Nintendo makes him fat? 

                                 SHIPWRECK’S PARROT 
                        “Nintendo makes him fat. Nintendo 
                        makes him fat.” 

           They all laugh heartily. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well now I know. 

                                 FLINT
                        And knowing is half the battle. 

                                 ALL 
                        “GI JOE! A REAL AMERICAN--” 

           Jake clicks to that iconic “JUST SAY NO” COMMERCIAL.

                                 GUY
                        This is your brain.

                                 JAKE
                        No way.

           The guy cracks an egg and drops it into a sizzling pan.   

                                 GUY
                        This is your brain on Nintendo. 
                        Any questions? 

                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        Yes! What is happening?!
           INT. JAKE'S OFFICE - PRESENT DAY - LATER

           Back to Jake’s present day office. Annie is beside herself.    

                                 ANNIE
                        Cartoons are talking to you?! They 
                        banned Nintendo? What is going on?!

           Annie and Jake sit on the floor in front of the TV. Couch 
           pillows and blankets have been fashioned into a small fort. 
           Take out lunch rests between them. Nintendo is paused on TV.

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Sometimes grownups just get really 
                        upset, Annie. 

                                 ANNIE
                        So what did you do? If the town 
                        banned it and Grandma and Grandpa 
                        won’t get you one and you’re acting 
                        like such a bad kid all the time-- 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        --Not all the time. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes all the time. If I was doing 
                        that stuff you’d never get me a 
                        tablet. If you’re doing all this 
                        and everything is going wrong, then 
                        how did you get it?! How did you 
                        get the Nintendo?!

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Okay, calm down, calm down. Have 
                        some orange juice.

           Annie takes a gulp of juice, calms down a little. 

                                 ANNIE
                        It just doesn’t seem like you’re 
                        ever gonna get one, Dad.

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        That’s what makes it such a great 
                        story Annie. Now you want to hear 
                        the rest or not? 

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Okay... 
           Jake leans in. He’s starting to enjoy telling this thing. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        You see sometimes, at Christmas, 
                        just when you think all hope is 
                        lost, something magical happens. 
                        Some people call it a Christmas--

           Jake’s intercom buzzes. 

                                 BETH (O.S.)
                        Jake, I got Pendrock on line one. 

                                 ANNIE
                        He’ll call ‘em back!

           Jake smiles, a little proud of Annie. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        --A Christmas miracle. It all 
                        happened at the baseball card 
                        store...

           EXT. THE DUGOUT BASEBALL CARD STORE - 1988 - DAY 

           “I’M WALKING ON SUNSHINE” by Katrina and The Waves plays, the 
           happiest, peppiest song of all time. 

           Jake, Trotter, Olsen and the Gruseckis sit slumped against a 
           bike rack outside THE DUGOUT baseball card shop. They are 
           seriously, hopelessly depressed.  

           Farmer dances to the music coming from a small boom box by 
           his bike, trying to cheer them up.  

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Come on guys! It’s not that bad. We 
                        still got each other. Walk on some 
                        sunshine! Yeah! 

           Tommy scowls. 

                                 TOMMY GRUSECKI
                        Who needs one?  

           All the guys raise their hands. Tommy goes back inside to buy 
           more baseball card packs. Farmer keeps dancing.  

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Turn that terrible song off Farmer!
                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Can’t. The play button’s frozen. 
                        Wooo! Sunshine baby! 

           Ryan grabs the boom box and bangs on it until it turns off. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Six days until Christmas and it was 
                        officially official. None of us 
                        were getting a Nintendo. 

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        My cousin in Elmhurst might get one 
                        still. That’s in Cook County. 

                                 JAKE
                        Dupage County. 

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        How do you know? 

                                 JAKE
                        I got encyclopedias. 

           Trotter shuffles through his pack of Topps.  

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Need it, got it, need it...

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        You gonna eat your gum? 

           Trotter tosses the gum from his pack at Farmer. Farmer drops 
           it on the ground, picks it up and crunches away on it, happy. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Need it, got it, got it...

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        The only thing that could ease our 
                        pain now was cracking open a few 
                        tasty packs of baseball cards. 

           Tommy comes back out of the store with fresh packs of FLEER 
           ‘89 (new this week) for everyone. He dishes them out. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        There wasn’t a boy among us who 
                        wasn’t thoroughly convinced they’d 
                        make us millionaires one day. 

           The guys all shuffle through their packs, calling out the 
           good cards they got. 
                                 JAKE
                        I got a Clemens. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Mattingly. 

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        Chris Sabo.   

                                 TOMMY GRUSECKI
                        Oh, that’s a good card. 

                                 RYAN GRUSECKI
                        I got a Ripken. Billy Ripken. 

           Ryan just stares at his card, gobsmacked. 

                                 TOMMY GRUSECKI
                        Who cares about Billy Ripken? 

           Ryan looks like he’s just seen a ghost.

                                 TOMMY GRUSECKI
                        What? What is it? 

                                 RYAN GRUSECKI
                        You guys aren’t gonna believe this. 

                                 TOMMY GRUSECKI
                        What? 

                                 RYAN GRUSECKI
                        Look! Right there! On his bat! 

           The guys all gather round and peer over his shoulder. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        And there it was. Written on the 
                        bottom of Billy Ripken’s baseball 
                        bat, staring up at us like some 
                        kind of private joke from God. A 
                        swear word.   

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Oh, that’s a bad one. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        And not just any swear word. The 
                        worst swear word. “Swear word dash 
                        face.” On a baseball card!  

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        It’s an error card. 
                                 RYAN GRUSECKI
                        No. It’s the greatest error card of 
                        all time. 

           Tommy quickly fumbles through his Beckett Magazine, searching 
           for the price. The guys wait with baited breath. 

                                 TOMMY GRUSECKI
                        Billy Ripken... Ninety five bucks.

           The guys go crazy! Jumping up and down, hugging Ryan.  

                                 RYAN GRUSECKI
                        Careful! Don’t tweak it! Careful!

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        You’re rich Grusecki!  

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        Yeah, a couple more of those and 
                        you can buy your own Nintendo. 

           Jake suddenly stops jumping around. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        And that’s when it hit me like an 
                        ‘85 Bears blitz. We didn’t need Cub 
                        Scouts or our parents or anyone. We 
                        were going to buy our own Nintendo 
                        for Christmas. I had a plan.

           INT. JAKE’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 

           The guys sit on Jake’s bedroom floor. Jake stands above them. 
           He’s just told them his incredible plan, which has been 
           written out in extreme detail on an easel, entitled “FIFTEEN 
           STEP PLAN FOR NINTENDO!”.

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        I don’t get it. 

                                 JAKE
                        What do you mean you don’t get it? 
                        It’s a very clear fifteen point 
                        plan.  

           Olsen points to the easel. 

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        I think you spelled “covert” wrong. 
                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        The field trip is Monday Farmer. To 
                        Chicago. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        So? 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        So, they still sell Nintendo’s 
                        there. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        So?

                                 TOMMY GRUSECKI
                        So we sell some baseball cards, get 
                        some money, sneak out of the field 
                        trip and buy our own Nintendo. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Oh, okay, I get it. Why didn’t you 
                        just say that in the first place? 

                                 JAKE
                        This can work guys. 

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        I don’t know, sounds dangerous.  

                                 JAKE
                        We don’t have to do the flame 
                        thrower thing, I just tossed that 
                        in there for Mikey.  

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Flame thrower thing would be pretty 
                        cool though. 

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        I dunno, we could get in trouble. I 
                        can’t get in trouble now Jake, it’s 
                        almost Christmas. 

                                 JAKE
                        Forget Christmas! This is serious!
                             (beat, digs deep)
                        This is our one and only chance to 
                        get a Nintendo. One that we can 
                        play on our own and we don’t have 
                        to worry about taking our boots off 
                        or getting in line or any of that 
                        stuff. We can totally do this. This 
                        is our Goonie adventure. Who’s with 
                        me? 
                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        I’m in. 

           The Gruseckis look at each other, then.

           We’re in.
                                              We’re in.

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        You know, this reminds me of the 
                        time me and Face from the A-Team--

                                 JAKE
                        Yes or no Farmer. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        I’m in. 

                                 JAKE
                        Olsen? 

           Olsen still isn’t sure. He looks around, sighs, then smiles.    

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        We’re gonna get in so much trouble. 

                                 JAKE
                        That’s what I’m talkin’ about!

           The guys all cheer! Olsen is in. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Yeah! Woo!

           Farmer presses play on his little boom box. “WALKING ON 
           SUNSHINE” plays again. Everyone tries to turn it off.  

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        No! 

                                 JAKE
                        Turn it off! 

                                 RYAN GRUSECKI
                        I hate this song! 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        You love it! You know you love it!

           INT/EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - MONTAGE 

           The boys get to work on their plan. “WALKING ON SUNSHINE” 
           continues through the whole montage. 
           - Olsen puts fresh batteries in some WALKIE TALKIES. 

           - Tommy and Ryan select a few cards, including Billy Ripken, 
           and put them in a small plastic case.

           - Trotter squeezes a little cup of MOTTS APPLESAUCE onto the 
           counter, experimenting. 

           - Farmer leads the guys in some aerobic dancing exercises.

           - Olsen reluctantly hands over a few of his best cards to 
           Tommy. Tommy puts them in the case. 

           - Jake studies a city map of Chicago in his encyclopedia.  

           - Trotter hands over a few of his best cards to Tommy. 

           - Jake goes over a crude overhead drawing of a city block 
           with the guys. We see words like BACK SEAT OF BUS, ESCAPE 
           ROUTE, TICKING CLOCK, WATER TOWER PLACE, “KOVERT”. 

           - Jake hands Tommy a few of his best cards.   

           - Farmer hands Tommy a few GARBAGE PAIL KID CARDS. Tommy just 
           shakes his head. 

           - Tommy’s plastic case is now full of cards. The guys all 
           follow him into The Dugout. 

           - Moments later the guys exit the store, excited. Tommy fans 
           through a bunch of ten dollar bills. He hands the stack to 
           Ryan, Ryan hands it to Trotter, Trotter hands it to Olsen who 
           puts the money in a TRAPPER KEEPER and hands it to Jake. 

           - The guys walk off down the street like Reservoir Dogs. But 
           as they do we see a FIGURE watching them. It’s Dan Delund.   

                                 ANNIE (V.O.)
                        Oh no! Not Delund! What’s he gonna 
                        do?!

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Just hang on Annie, I’m getting 
                        there.

           EXT. FRONT OF SCHOOL - MORNING - DAY

           All the fifth grade classes board a school bus to Chicago. 
           Jake stands off to the side, holding the Trapper Keeper, 
           inspecting his crew as they pass by to get on the bus. 

                                 JAKE

                        Check. 

           Farmer steps forward wearing head to toe CAMOUFLAGE clothing. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Camouflage! Check. 

                                 JAKE
                        Not really necessary, Farmer, but I 
                        like the spirit.

           Trotter steps up, he and Jake exchange a little handshake.

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        You got the money. I got the Motts. 

                                 JAKE
                        Let’s do it. 

           Jake and Trotter turn to walk toward the bus but run right 
           into Dan Delund who stands over them, menacingly.  

                                 DAN DELUND
                        Nice Trapper Keeper, Boyle. I hear 
                        it’s good for organizing money. 

           Delund snatches the Trapper Keeper out of Jake’s hands. 

                                 JAKE
                        Hey! That’s ours! 

                                 DAN DELUND
                        Not anymore. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        You can’t do that!

                                 DAN DELUND
                        Oh yeah? What are you gonna do 
                        about it? 
           Dan looms, threateningly. Trotter and Jake stammer. 

                                 DAN DELUND
                        That’s what I thought. The 
                        Nintendo’s mine. 

           Delund chuckles to himself and walks onto the bus with the 
           Trapper Keeper. Trotter and Jake just watch helplessly. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Oh man. This is bad.  

                                 JAKE
                        I don’t think it could get any 
                        worse.

                                 MRS. HUGO (O.S.)
                        Jake Doyle!

           Jake looks up to see Mrs. Hugo now standing above him. 

                                 MRS. HUGO
                        Where do you think you’re going?

                                 JAKE
                        On the bus. To the Art Institute. 

                                 MRS. HUGO
                        Not like that you’re not. No boots. 
                        No field trip. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Son of a--

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 

           “DO YOU REALLY WANT TO HURT ME” plays. A nervous Jake slowly 
           steps onto the now completely full bus in his girls’ boots. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        At first I thought, maybe no one 
                        will notice. 

           A KID in the second row immediately stands and points. 

                                 KID
                        Hey everybody! Jake Doyle’s wearing 
                        girls’ boots!

           The entire bus starts laughing and pointing. Humiliated, Jake 
           trudges toward the back where his friends are sitting. 
                                 KID TWO 
                        Look at those!

                                 KID THREE
                        They’re so pretty! 

                                 KATIE SORRENTINO
                        I have the same kind. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Reoccurring nightmares of Freddy 
                        Kruger and the ‘84 Cubs quickly 
                        fell to the wayside. It was a bad 
                        dream come to life. 

           Delund stands up, pounding his fist in his hand, smiling.  

                                 DAN DELUND
                        Forgot about those. Nice boots 
                        Boyle! Come on back and have a 
                        seat!

           There are two seats left on the bus. One right next to Delund 
           in the very back. And one right next to CONOR STUMP (10, the 
           weirdest kid in school) toward the front. Jake gulps.  

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        And suddenly our whole plan was in 
                        jeopardy. 

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - LATER - DAY 

           The bus makes its way through downtown Chicago. It’s bumper 
           to bumper traffic. Jake sits next Connor Stump who sings to 
           himself. He’s probably been doing so the entire trip.   

                                 CONNOR STUMP
                        When you’re running into first and 
                        you feel a juicy burst. Diarrhea. 
                        Diarrhea. 

           Jake puts his head in his hands. Stump keeps singing.   

                                                      CONNOR STUMP
                                              When you’re sliding into 
                                              third and you feel a juicy 
                                              turd. Diarrhea. Diarrhea...
                     ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
           The entire plan hung in the 
           balance, and I was stuck 
           sitting in the reject seat 
           with Connor Stump.

           Jake looks back at Trotter who shrugs “What do we do?!” Jake 
           looks over at Delund who is counting the money in his seat. 
           Connor takes note.     
                                 CONNOR STUMP
                        Are you scared of Dan? I am. That’s 
                        why I sing the poo songs. To calm 
                        me down. Do you know any poo songs? 

                                 JAKE
                        No. 

                                 CONNOR STUMP
                        You should learn some. 

           Trotter comes running up, crouched down to avoid detection. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        We’re almost to the spot Jake, what 
                        do we do? 

                                 JAKE
                        I don’t know. Just, just go ahead, 
                        I’ll think of something. 

           Trotter nods, walks up to the front of the bus, moaning. 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Mrs. Hugo...

                                 MRS. HUGO
                        Michael, what are you doing out of 
                        your seat? 

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        I don’t feel good... 

           With Mrs. Hugo distracted, Jake scurries to the back of the 
           bus. Delund watches him approach. 

                                 DAN DELUND
                        Well looky what we got here. A girl 
                        in girls’ boots. 

                                 JAKE
                        Dan, we gotta go get the Nintendo 
                        now. I can show you how to--

                                 DAN DELUND
                        I’m not listening to you Boyle. The 
                        money’s mine. I’ll get my Nintendo 
                        when I get it.  

                                 JAKE
                        We gotta go now or else--

                                 DAN DELUND
                        Or else what? You’re gonna make me? 
           Delund stands, he grabs Jake by the jacket. 

                                 DAN DELUND
                        Go back and sit with your 
                        girlfriend in your girls’ boots. 

           Dan pushes Jake hard. He stumbles backwards and falls onto 
           the floor. Delund laughs hysterically as Jake lays there.  

                                 DAN DELUND
                        Ha ha! Look at the little girl! Are 
                        you gonna cry now little girl? Wha 
                        wha wha! Wha wha wha!

           Jake looks like he might actually cry. He looks around, all 
           eyes are on him. Connor Stump looks up at him with innocent 
           kid eyes. Something inside of Jake snaps. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Oddly enough, it was something in 
                        Connor Stump’s runny nose that made 
                        me get up. Nintendo or not, Delund 
                        had been king of the mountain for 
                        too long. 

           Jake suddenly pops up off the floor and charges back toward 
           Delund. Delund looks up from his seat, surprised. 

                                 JAKE
                        You’re all talk, no walk Delund. 

                                 DAN DELUND
                        What’s that supposed to mean? 

           WHAM! Jake slams his ESPRIT BOOT into Delund’s chest. Pinning 
           him up against the seat. He leans toward him, growls. 

                                 JAKE
                        It means gimme the Trapper Keeper 
                        you heavy metal hair on an 
                        elephant’s butt. 

           The bus is in complete shock. Delund is in complete shock. 

                                 JAKE
                        Now. 

           Delund swallows hard. Then, without a word he hands the 
           Trapper Keeper over. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Holy smokes...
           Kid’s jaws are hitting the floor. Jake nods to the Gruseckis. 
           They start waving hand signals toward Trotter. Trotter, who’s 
           still distracting Hugo, gives a subtle nod.  

                                 MRS. HUGO
                        Just tell me what it is. Is it your 
                        stomach? Do you think you might--

                                 MIKEY TROTTER
                        Bluuuuuuughh!

           Trotter suddenly PUKES all over Mrs. Hugo. 

                                 MRS. HUGO
                        Ugh! Stop the bus! Carl! Stop the 
                        bus! Pull over!

           Kids start screaming, Hugo keeps yelling, it’s chaos. The bus 
           pulls over. Trotter runs out puking into his hands-- we now 
           notice that he has cups of MOTTS APPLESAUCE in his sleeves.  

           In the back, The Gruseckis mash a BLANKET over the emergency 
           exit alarm. Farmer pulls the handle and thrusts the door 
           open. Olsen tosses Jake a walkie talkie and a duffle bag. 
           Jake jumps out onto the street and takes off. He’s doing it! 
           Olsen scrambles to the window and calls out after him.  

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        Goonies never say die Doyle! 

           EXT. MICHIGAN AVENUE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

           Jake runs down the sidewalk. He checks his map and crosses 
           the street toward WATER TOWER PLACE. He pulls out his walkie.  

                                 JAKE
                        Red Dog this is Blue Bird I’m 
                        approaching Water Tower Place. 
                        Over. 

                                 EVAN OLSEN (O.S.)
                        Blue Bird, this is Ewok One. 

                                 JAKE
                        What happened to Red Dog? 

                                 EVAN OLSEN (O.S.)
                        I changed it. 

                                 JAKE
                        We get to change names now? Start 
                        over. 
                             (then)

                                 JAKE (CONT'D)
                        Ewok One this is Millennium Falcon 
                        Super Cool.  

                                 EVAN OLSEN (O.S.)
                        Love it. 

                                 JAKE
                        I am crossing the street. Over. 

           Jake runs toward WATER TOWER PLACE shopping center. The very 
           same place he went shopping with his family last week. The 
           same SALVATION ARMY SANTA CLAUS is there too.  

                                 SALVATION ARMY SANTA
                        Careful there kid. It’s slippery.  

           Jake gives Santa a wave and side steps a small patch of ice 
           near the entrance. He runs through the doors. 

           INT. WATER TOWER PLACE - CONTINUOUS

           Jake runs through the store foyer. He clicks his digital 
           Casio calculator watch to countdown NINE MINUTES.  

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        The plan was simple. I had exactly 
                        nine minutes to buy a Nintendo and 
                        three games and make it back to the 
                        bus before Trotter’s applesauce ran 
                        out. As long as I didn’t run into 
                        any major obstacles I figured I’d 
                        be good to goo-- Oh God. 

           Jake runs up to Marshall Fields to find MRS. TROTTER and MRS. 
           KLEEN picketing with NINTENDO-NO signs in front of the store. 
           There’s no way he can get past them without being seen.   

                                 JAKE
                        Are you kidding me?!

           Jake ducks behind a MALL MAP KIOSK. Pulls out his walkie. 

                                 JAKE
                        Ewok One. We have a problem. 

           INT. SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

           Olsen holds his walkie talkie. The Gruseckis and Farmer 
           huddle up with him in the back two seats. 
                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        What’s the problem Millennium... 
                        Super whatever? 

           We cut back and forth between the store and the bus. 

                                 JAKE
                        Mrs. Trotter and Mrs. Kleen are 
                        standing outside the store! Repeat 
                        Trotter and Kleen are here! I can’t 
                        get in without them seeing me! 

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        Oh no! What are we gonna do?! 

                                 JAKE
                        I don’t know that’s why I’m calling 
                        you! 

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        Abort! Abort! 

                                 JAKE
                        No! No abort. We just need to get 
                        them out of the way. 

           Jake notices the PHONE NUMBER for the building on the kiosk. 

                                 JAKE
                        Maybe we can page them. Over the 
                        intercom or something. Tell them 
                        they have a call. 

           Tommy taps Olsen, points to a PAY PHONE across the street. 

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        There’s a pay phone across the 
                        street! 

                                 JAKE
                        Yes! Okay. How’s Trotter? Gimme a 
                        sauce check.  

           Olsen peers out the window to see Mrs. Hugo tending to 
           Trotter who is now standing up, breathing slowly.  

                                 MRS. HUGO
                             (to Trotter)
                        Is that it? Is that everything? 

           Trotter doubles over and “pukes” again. Mrs. Hugo sighs.  

                                 MRS. HUGO
                        I should’ve gone to law school.
                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        Sauce is still flying. We can make 
                        it to the pay phone. But what do we 
                        say?  

                                 JAKE
                        I don’t know, something good. 

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        Like what?! 

                                 JAKE
                        I don’t know, make something up! 

           Farmer rises from his seat. Smiles. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Did someone say, “make something 
                        up”?

           EXT. STREET - PAYPHONE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

           Farmer’s on the payphone across the street, in his element.  

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Yes, I need you to page a Mrs. 
                        Trotter and a Mrs. Kleen please. 
                        Yes, it’s an emergency, this is 
                        their nephew. Well, I’ve just found 
                        a needle in my halloween candy and 
                        I’m trying to decide if I should 
                        eat it or not. Yes, I think you 
                        should get them.  

           INT. WATER TOWER PLACE - CONTINUOUS

           Jake nervously looks at his watch. It’s down to SIX MINUTES. 

                                 JAKE
                        Come on... Come on... 

           The PA crackles on. 

                                 PA VOICE (O.S.)
                        Paging Mrs. Trotter and Mrs. Kleen. 
                        Mrs. Trotter and Mrs. Kleen. Please 
                        come to the customer service desk. 
                        You have an emergency phone call.  

           Surprised and concerned, Mrs. Trotter and Mrs. Kleen walk off 
           toward the front lobby. Jake grabs his walkie talkie. 
                                 JAKE
                        It worked. I’m going in. Keep ‘em 
                        on the phone. 

           INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

           Olsen looks out the window at Farmer across the street. 

                                 EVAN OLSEN 
                        Copy that. 

           Olsen gives Farmer a thumbs up and a signal to keep the call 
           going. Farmer gives him a thumbs up back. He’s got this. 

           INT. TOY SECTION - MARSHALL FIELDS - MOMENTS LATER

           Jake runs through the store. Focused, determined.  

                                 NINTENDO (V.O.)
                        Hello Jake. How ‘bout a quick-- 

                                 JAKE

           Jake blows by the Nintendo display.

           Farmer does his best to keep Kleen and Trotter on the line. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Hello Mrs. Trotter. I mean Mrs.

                             (then)
                        Yes I know you don’t have a nephew. 
                        That’s exactly why I’m calling. I’m 
                        with the International Nieces and 
                        Nephews Collective. That’s right.

           INT. TOY SECTION - MARSHALL FIELDS - CONTINUOUS

           Jake runs up to the aisle where Nintendos and games are sold. 
           He grabs a Nintendo, pausing for a second to soak in the 
           moment. He hoists it on his shoulder, starts grabbing games.  

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Okay, games, games, games, let’s

           Jake grabs Top Gun and runs off.

           Farmer keeps the conversation going somehow. 

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        Well it makes perfect sense if you 
                        think about it. You don’t have a

                        Oh, I have Mrs. Trotter now, yes,

                        One Nintendo please. 

           The COSMETICS CLERK (50s, female) looks him over, suspicious.

           EXT. CITY STREET  - CONTINUOUS - DAY

           Trotter teeters back and forth on the sidewalk, moaning. The 
           BUS DRIVER has joined Mrs. Hugo on the sidewalk now. The two 
           watch Trotter in amazement. This kid has been puking forever.   

                                 MRS. HUGO
                        Feeling better now? Think we can 
                        get on the bus? 

           Trotter doubles over again, “pukes”, but no applesauce comes 
           out. He’s out of Motts cups. 

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        Yeah he’s dry heavin’, you’re good. 

           The Bus driver heads back to the bus. Trotter sneaks a 
           panicked look up at Olsen. “I’m out.” Olsen grabs his walkie.

                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        The sauce is gone. Repeat. We are 
                        out of sauce. 

           Olsen turns to see the Gruseckis pulling Farmer on the bus.

                                 JOSH FARMER
                        I lost em. 
                                 EVAN OLSEN
                        And Farmer’s off the phone!

           INT. WATER TOWER PLACE - MARSHALL FIELDS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

           Jake sprints toward the Marshall Fields exit as he stuffs the 
           NINTENDO and GAMES in his duffle bag. 

                                 EVAN OLSEN (V.O.)
                        Repeat. Farmer’s off the phone! 
                        Look out for Kleen and Trotter! 

           Jake looks up to see Kleen and Trotter approaching. He has no 
           where to hide. He dives along side A GROUP OF SHOPPERS 
           heading toward the escalator. He army crawls along with them, 
           using them as a screen from Kleen and Trotter.  

           A TODDLER in the arms of one of the shoppers notices Jake and 
           smiles. Jake give the kid a little wink, he’s in the zone.  

           INT/EXT. WATER TOWER PLACE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

           Jake runs down the escalator stairs, yells into his walkie. 

                                 JAKE
                        I got past ‘em! I’m in the clear! 

                                 EVAN OLSEN (V.O.)
                        The bus is moving Jake. The 
                        stoplight is still the rendezvous! 
                        You’re gonna make it! 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        This was it. This was it. Victory 
                        was mine. I could taste it...

           Jake barrels through the front doors, his eyes wide as 
           saucers as he runs onto the sidewalk. Sunlight hits his face, 
           he’s free, he’s made it! We go into SLOW MOTION. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Yes! Yes!

           Suddenly Jake’s feet slide out from under him. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Nooooooo! 

           Jake slips backward on a patch of ice-- the same spot that 
           Adult Jake almost slipped at the beginning of the movie. 
           The momentum thrusts Jake’s hands upward and the duffle bag 
           goes flying. It glistens in the sun as it flutters down, 
           down, down onto the street.  

           Jake scrambles up on his side just in time to see THE BUS 
           come flying by and RUN OVER THE NINTENDO. 

                                 JAKE
                        Nooooooo! 

           Front tire, then back tire. On the bus Olsen, Farmer, Trotter 
           and the Gruseckis all peer out the back window, their faces 
           pressed against the glass in horror, witnessing the damage. 

                                 THE GUYS 
                        Noooooo! 

           The bus stops at the stoplight at the end of the block. Jake 
           just stands in the street, devastated. The Nintendo lays 
           SMASHED TO BITS at his feet. The bus drives off.   

           INT. TAXI CAB - A LITTLE BIT LATER - DAY

           Jake sits in the back of a CAB, totally dejected holding a 
           broken piece of Double Dragon. A CABBIE (60’s, South Side, 
           gruff) looks Jake over in the mirror, a little concerned.  

                                 CABBIE
                        Where to chief? 

                                 JAKE
                        Art Institute. 

           A beat. The Cabbie looks Jake over again. 

                                 CABBIE
                        So what gives? 

                                 JAKE
                        I got money, don’t worry. 

                                 CABBIE
                        No, what gives? Why the long face? 

                                 JAKE
                        I don’t want to talk about it. 

                                 CABBIE
                        You on Christmas vacation? 

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah, almost.  
                                 CABBIE
                        So, you should be happy. Go on tell 
                        me what the problem is. 

           A beat. Jake sighs. Okay. 

                                 JAKE
                        I’m not gonna get what I want for 
                        Christmas. Nobody is. 

                                 CABBIE
                        Yeah, that’s a tough one. 

           The Cabbie sighs, then gets reflective. 

                                 CABBIE
                        One year when I was a kid I wanted 
                        a horse. Can you believe that? We 
                        live eight blocks from Comiskey and 
                        I want a horse. All November, all 
                        December that’s all I talk about. 
                        My grandparents, my parents, they 
                        all ask “Chester what do you want 
                        for Christmas?”. “A horse” I says, 
                        over and over “a horse”. That’s it, 
                        nothing else. Everybody tells me 
                        “Chester we can’t get a horse and 
                        that’s final.” I don’t listen, I 
                        spend all Christmas waiting for the 
                        horse, figuring out how to get the 
                        horse. And then you know what 
                        happened Christmas morning?

                                 JAKE
                        You got the horse?

                                 CABBIE
                        No, I don’t even know what I got 
                        that year. But no horse. I realized 
                        later, I wasted a whole Christmas 
                        worrying about something that 
                        didn’t really matter anyway. 

           A car cuts the Cabbie off. 

                                 CABBIE
                        You see that? Come January I’ll 
                        call that yuppie every name in the 
                        book. But now, well, it’s 
                        Christmas. You only get so many of 
                        ‘em and you gotta make ‘em count. 
                        Like with you. Betch-ya you haven’t 
                        even told somebody Merry Christmas 
                        this year have you. 
           A beat. Jake thinks about that. The cab pulls into the back 
           driveway of THE ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO. 

                                 CABBIE
                        Who you meeting here?

                                 JAKE
                        My class. We’re on a field trip. I 
                        kinda left. I’ll probably get held 
                        back now. How much do I owe you? 

                                 CABBIE
                        Hold on. You cut out on a field 
                        trip? 

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah. 

           The cabbie chuckles a bit, impressed.  

                                 CABBIE
                        Is it a big class? 

                                 JAKE
                        Pretty big. 

                                 CABBIE
                        This is the back entrance to the 
                        place. Tell the guard at the door 
                        there you got lost, the place is 
                        huge. He’ll let you in, just hop 
                        right back in with your class, 
                        you’ll be fine. 

                                 JAKE
                        Thanks. How much is it? 

                                 CABBIE
                        Ah don’t worry about it. You gotta 
                        do me a favor though chief. 

                                 JAKE
                        What’s that? 

                                 CABBIE
                        Have a merry Christmas. 

           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - CHRISTMAS MORNING - DAWN 

           “HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS” plays. It’s 
           Christmas morning at the Doyle house. Stockings hang from 
           exposed wall studs. Presents rest under the tree. Cookies 
           left for Santa have been nibbled on. All is calm and bright.  
           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - JAKE’S ROOM - DAWN - CONTINUOUS

           Jake sleeps soundly. A hand rustles his shoulder. He opens 
           his eyes to see Lizzy standing there in her PJ’s, BEAMING. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Is it time yet? 

           Jake manages a small smile. 

           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - PATTY AND JOHN’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Lizzy bursts into the room yelling and jumping on the bed. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        It’s Christmas! It’s Christmas! 
                        Wake up! Wake up! 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Merry Christmas Lizzy, dear. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Dad, wake up it’s Christmas! 

           John groans, puts a pillow over his head. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Christmas is canceled. 

           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER - DAY 

           A giddy Lizzy crawls around the tree inspecting packages. 
           Jake stands a few feet away, pessimistically looking it over.   

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Nine years of visual unwrapping 
                        experience, I could tell right away 
                        that there was no Nintendo under 
                        the tree. Fat ladies standing by 
                        quietly warmed their vocal chords. 

           John and Patty descend the stairs, still half asleep. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        No touching packages till we pass 
                        them out Lizzy. You know the rules. 

           Lizzy doesn’t listen, she shakes a package. It rattles. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Legos? 
                                 JAKE
                        Legos. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        All I wanted at this point was to 
                        get the whole thing over with.

           John plops on the couch. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Alright, lets have some Christmas. 

           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - MONTAGE - TIME PASSING - DAY

           The 8-BIT TETRIS THEME SONG plays as Patty hands out 
           presents. The Doyles happily tear into packages. Jake just 
           mopes his way through it. 

           - Lizzy opens up a My Little Pony. 

           - Patty opens a pair of leg warmers. 

           - Jake opens some Legos. He nods, knowingly. 

           - John opens an electric sander. He’s impressed. 

           - Patty opens up another pair of leg warmers. 

           - John starts sanding a nearby wall. It’s very loud. 

           - Jake opens some ear muffs. He puts them on. 

           - Lizzy opens her Cabbage Patch doll. She’s ecstatic!  

                                 LIZZY
                        A CABBAGE PATCH! 

           The doll wears nothing but a child sized Chicago Bears T-
           shirt. It also has PURPLE HAIR. Jake gives his dad a look. 
           John shakes it off.

           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER - DAY

           Post presents bliss. The floor is a mess with wrapping paper. 
           Jake and Lizzy sit on the couch on either side of Patty. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Well that was another great 
                        Christmas, wasn’t it? 

           John sands the wall behind the tree.
                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        What?!

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        I said that was another-- John! Do 
                        you have to do that right now?!

           John shuts the electric sander off. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        You bought it for me. 

           John pulls the cord taught, inadvertently knocking over an 
           unseen PACKAGE wrapped in brown mailing paper by the door. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        And that’s when I saw it. 

           The sun suddenly illuminates the package. A choir of ANGELS 
           SING. Jake’s eyes widen. Lizzy’s eyes widen. Elwood’s 
           friggin’ eyes widen. Could it be? 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        It was the exact size and shape of 
                        the box I’d held in my hands not 
                        three days before. I knew that box. 
                        I’d felt that box in my sleep. That 
                        was a Nintendo box.   

           Lizzy runs over and sneaks a look at the shipping label. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        To Jake. From Uncle Dan. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Uncle Dan! Of course! Unreliable, 
                        stinking rich, crazy Uncle Dan! 
                        Uncle Dan who hadn’t so much as 
                        sent me a postcard in three years. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Dan sent a gift? Great. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Clearly he was making up for it. 
                        With a Nintendo!

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Where’s he living again now? 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Japan. 
                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Japan! Japan! The home of Nintendo! 
                        The land where dreams came true! Oh 
                        God don’t mess with me now... 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Well, it’s got your name on it 
                        Jake. 

           Jake slowly walks toward the package. John sits on the couch.

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                             (aside to Patty)
                        What’d he say he was sending? 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        I have no idea. 

           Jake cautiously brings the package to the middle of the room. 
           He kneels before it. Everyone waits with baited breath. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        I’d later read of Olympic athletes 
                        training their entire lives for one 
                        five second moment. This was it. 

           Jake tears open the package, his eyes widening.  

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        It had to be. It had to be...

           Jake gasps. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Lite Brite! 

                                 JAKE
                        Lite Brite? 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Lite Brite. Japanese Lite Brite. 

           We now see the box. It’s dotted with Japanese lettering and 
           strange English phrases. TWO PREPPY JAPANESE CHILDREN smile 
           as they make an ornate picture of a CLOWN on a LITE BRITE.  

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Oh look Jake, it’s the “super happy 
                        yum” version. That’s great. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Jeez, for a second there I thought 
                        it might be a Nintendo. 
           Patty and John both start laughing. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        As I slowly tried to grasp the 
                        situation I began to fear that I 
                        might never recover from this. That 
                        this was a tragedy so great I’d 
                        never go to prom, never go to 
                        college, never leave the house. I’d 
                        become a thirty year old balding 
                        man in his parents’ basement making 
                        elaborate pictures of Zelda on his 
                        Lite Brite. 

           Jake just sits there in pain. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Christmas was dead to me now.

           INT. DOYLE HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER - NIGHT

           Jake looks out his kitchen window, still in a daze. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        By nightfall I got word that 
                        despite the panic, level headed 
                        grandmas had come through. And half 
                        my friends went to bed with 
                        blistered thumbs from ten hours on 
                        their new Nintendos. 

           Jake sighs and sits on the floor. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        It was a tough pill to swallow. 

           Lizzy and Patty sit next to a HUGE PILE OF LUGGAGE. Lizzy 
           holds her doll. John storms in and out, picking up bags. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        We’re going to Minnesota for three 
                        days Patty. You’ve been in our car 
                        before, I’ve seen you in it. You 
                        know how big it is. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE 
                        Let’s just go in the morning John. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE (O.S.)
                        I’m not hitting traffic!
                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Can I bring Dawn outside at 
                        Grandma’s, Mom? 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Sure you can honey. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        We need to get her a hat though.
                             (whispering)
                        Her hair. It’s an embarrassment. 

           John walks back inside. He exchanges a glance with Patty.

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Jake. 

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        There’s still a ton of poop out 
                        there. Go grab the shovel and pick 
                        it up. 

                                 JAKE
                        Right now? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Yes right now. You’ve had all day 
                        to do it. And start by the shed. 
                        You haven’t been back there in 
                        months. 

           Jake sighs, grabs his coat and exits. 

           EXT. DOYLE HOUSE - BACKYARD - A LITTLE BIT LATER - NIGHT

           We have not seen this part of the yard yet. It’s tucked away 
           behind the shed next to a small wooded area. Jake mopes 
           through the snow and sits down on an overturned bucket. He 
           watches his breath in the darkness. A sad beat.   

                                 JAKE
                        You forgot to turn on the lights 
                        Dad. Dad! The flood lights!

           The flood lights suddenly flick on. Jake slowly gets up. He 
           looks toward the heavens and stops short.  
                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        And there, high above the frozen 
                        dog poo that had become the bane of 
                        my existence was the most beautiful 
                        structure I had ever laid eyes on. 

                                 JAKE
                        Whoa...

           We see what Jake sees. A picture perfect TREE FORT, freshly 
           painted and slightly hidden by the snowy branches.

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        A tree fort. A spectacular, two 
                        level, solid wood, tree fort. 

           Jake stands awestruck. He drops his shovel and walks towards 
           it. He climbs the ladder and slowly looks around. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        Oh it was breath taking.

           John, Patty and Lizzy walk outside to have a look. 

                                 LIZZY DOYLE
                        Wow-ee. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Maybe I should ask Santa to finish 
                        the kitchen next year Lizzy, what 
                        do you think? 

                                 JAKE
                        It’s got a trap door! 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Careful by that paint. It still 
                        looks wet. 

                                 PATTY DOYLE
                        Why don’t I go get the video 
                        camera, John? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Nah. Let him be. 

           John looks on, happy, proud. 

           INT. JAKE'S OFFICE - LATER - PRESENT DAY - DUSK 

           It’s almost dusk now. A Christmas tree twinkles in the park 
           below. Headlights flicker on the street. Jake and Annie sit 
           on the floor of his office, holding controllers.
                                 ANNIE
                        But the Nintendo was hidden in the 
                        fort wasn’t it? 

                                 JAKE
                        Nope. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Then how did you get it? 

                                 JAKE
                        I didn’t get one until I worked a 
                        whole summer outside as a caddy. 
                        Grandpa said I could buy my own 
                        then. 

                                 ANNIE
                        I would’ve got you a Nintendo, Dad. 

                                 JAKE
                        Thank you Annie. 

           Jake puts his arm around her. The two sit there together. 

                                 JAKE
                        But I think the tree fort ended up 
                        being a pretty good present. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Yeah.

           Annie and Jake look to the wall in front of them. Only now do 
           we see that it is filled with BLUEPRINTS and PICTURES of TREE 
           FORTS-- ornate and elaborate structures built for hospitals, 
           yards and schools. Smiling kids are in each and every one. 

           A prominent plaque reads 2018 CHICAGO BUSINESS of the YEAR: 
           ALL SEASONS PLAYGROUNDS, FOUNDER & CEO JAKE DOYLE. Jake 
           builds tree forts for a living now. This is his business. 

                                 BETH
                             (knocking)
                        Sorry to interrupt. Jake, I told 
                        Pendrock we’d just get back to them 
                        tomorrow. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        That’s okay. We can get back to 
                        them today. The answer’s no. 

                                 BETH
                        You sure?  
                                 ADULT JAKE
                        If we took that job we’d end up 
                        working straight through New 
                        Year’s. The whole office. 

                                 BETH
                        Central Park, it’s a huge contract.  

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        It’s a restaurant deck. We build 
                        forts for kids. Do me a favor Beth, 
                        send everybody home. It’s 
                        Christmas. 

                                 BETH
                        You got it boss. 

           Beth smiles, exits. Jake looks back to see Annie now standing 
           at his window, staring at the hustle and bustle below. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        You feeling any better? 

                                 ANNIE
                        Yeah. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        You wanna go check out that tablet 
                        on our way home? 

                                 ANNIE
                        You think we could go to the park 
                        instead? 

           Jake smiles, proud. 

                                 ADULT JAKE
                        Totally. 

           Annie runs over to grab her coat. Jake goes to turn off the 
           light. As he does we notice a SMALL FRAMED PICTURE on the 
           wall. It’s of JAKE, TROTTER, OLSEN, THE GRUSECKIS and FARMER 
           playing in Jake’s fort circa summer ‘89. We see JOHN near the 
           back, about to hammer a nail. He’s smiling.

           EXT. BACKYARD/TREE FORT - A LITTLE BIT LATER - 1988 - NIGHT 

           John pops his head through the open trap door of the fort. He 
           looks around and takes a deep breath. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Smell that? 
                                 JAKE
                        Fresh air? 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Fresh air. 

           A nice father-son beat. Jake watches his dad soak it in. 

                                 ADULT JAKE (V.O.)
                        From that moment on I saw John 
                        Doyle a little differently. He was 
                        more than just a guy who hated 
                        traffic and could never quite 
                        finish the kitchen. He was a 
                        magician. He was a hero. He was my 
                        dad. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Come on. It’s getting late. We 
                        don’t want to hit the traffic. 

           Jake climbs down the rope ladder after John. At the bottom of 
           the ladder, John grabs Jake and slings him over his shoulder. 
           He carries him through the snow toward the house.

                        Peacefully, my mind unfolded all 
                        the tree fort adventures that 
                        undoubtedly lay ahead. Ghost story 
                        campouts by flashlight. Week long 
                        snow ball battles. And round the 
                        clock sky gazing for Soviet spy 
                        planes. 

                                 JAKE
                        Hey dad. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Yeah? 

                                 JAKE
                        Merry Christmas. 

                                 JOHN DOYLE
                        Merry Christmas, Jake.

                                                              FADE OUT.
