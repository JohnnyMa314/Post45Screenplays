           Director’s Note: the opening scene is one unbroken shot.

           EXT. CORNFIELD - DUSK

           1979, Texas. 

           A scarecrow on a cross hangs high above a large cornfield, 
           its long white gown sways in the wind. 

           SOUNDS of classical music rise from O.S. as the Camera slowly 
           pulls back through golden stalks and lands in a clearing.

           The music emanates from an approaching produce truck with a 
           Fresh Hill Farms logo painted on kitschy pastoral landscapes. 
           It halts, the engine stops and the music dies.

           ZOOEY (18), scrawny, exits the driver’s door with his hands 
           full of gallon water jugs. He walks to the rear of the truck, 
           drops the jugs, and heads back to the driver’s door.

           BOOM! 

           A loud noise from inside the truck. 

           Zooey does not acknowledge the sound as he grabs more water 
           jugs and again deposits them at the back of the vehicle.

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

           Something is inside, and it does not want to be.

           Zooey calmly returns to the driver’s door once more. BOOM! 
           BOOM! BOOM! But this time, he retrieves a shotgun. 

           He approaches the rear gate and unlatches it. The door 
           retracts upward as he aims into the shadowed interior. 

           Beat. 

                                 ZOOEY
                        Out. Come on now.

           Camera rounds the corner for a better view, but the truck 
           remains too dark to make out its contents.

           With the nose of his shotgun, he strikes the steel frame.

                                 ZOOEY (CONT’D)
                        Out! Don’t be scared.

           SOUNDS of rustling.
           From the back of the truck appears MARTHA (17)- dirty prairie 
           dress, no makeup. 

           Other figures soon emerge: 15 WOMEN (late teens)- dressed the 
           same way, each tired and weary.

                                 ZOOEY (CONT’D)
                             (points gun at the fields)
                        Quickly. Stick here, together. We 
                        don’t know what’s out there.

           The women help themselves down into the dying light.

                                 ZOOEY (CONT’D)
                        Drink or urinate. This is our only 
                        stop until morning. 

           Camera follows Martha as she jumps onto the dirt. She walks 
           past some women drinking water, past others squatting, closer 
           and closer to the cornfield--  

                                 ZOOEY (CONT’D)
                        -Stop right there! Far enough. 

           Martha freezes, turns. Zooey motions for her to squat. She 
           crouches to the dirt and waits for Zooey to stop staring. 

           Beat. He does not. She pivots away and begins to urinate. 

           Camera wraps around Martha and widens out, pulling her gaze 
           once more to the corn. She finishes and slowly rises.  

           Zooey, distracted, ushers the other women back in the truck. 

                                 ZOOEY (CONT’D)
                        Get inside. Go on now. Get.

           Suddenly, Martha makes a run for it- straight for the corn. 
           Zooey sprints after her and raises his shotgun-- 

                                 ZOOEY (CONT’D)
                        -Hey! 

           Camera follows Martha into the first row of corn... 

                                 ZOOEY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Stop!

           ...the second row...the third row... 

                                 ZOOEY (O.S) (CONT’D)
                        STOP!!

           -BANG!
           Martha’s body collapses in a red blur, falls out of frame. 
           Hold on the blood-stained corn stalks. 

           Camera slowly reverses to find Zooey staring from the edge of 
           the cornfield. He lowers his shotgun, eyes teary. 

           Zooey turns back to see the other women watching in horror.

                                 ZOOEY (CONT’D)
                        I told you what I’d do. I have to. 
                        We got to stick together now, 
                        that’s the plan. Together or we 
                        don’t stand a chance. 

           He turns his shotgun on the group.

                                 ZOOEY (CONT’D)
                        Who else wants to run?
                             (beat)
                        Back in the truck now! 

           He moves toward the vehicle prompting the onlookers to 
           shuffle back inside. He wipes his runny face. 

           Zooey grabs the retractable rear door and slams it shut. He 
           locks it and takes a few private, deep breaths. 

           Dusk has given way to night and it is darker now.

           Zooey inches back to the corn, almost trips over a water jug 
           that he promptly punishes with a kick. He stops, far away 
           from the edge of the field. He mumbles, smacks his head.

           Finally he exhales, wipes his eyes and straightens his 
           posture. He walks to the driver’s seat and gets in.

           The engine ignites and the headlights flip on. The Fresh 
           Hills Farm produce truck rolls down the dirt road, taking the 
           classical music with it. 

           Camera moves into the cornfield, back toward the scarecrow, 
           returning to the exact composition of the opening shot.

           Long beat.

           Then a trembling, bloody hand reaches up from the stalks and 
           removes the scarecrow’s long white gown off the cross.

           Below, corn stalks part to form a jagged path toward a 

           COMMERCIAL FARM COMPOUND in the distance, its lights now on.
           EXT. VIKSE FARM - DAY

           GEORGE VIKSE (69) stares down intently. Rolled sleeves 
           display worn, tan skin. He crouches, concerned.

                                 GEORGE
                        Small problems just grow into big 
                        problems. Best nip it in the bud.

           He stares at a weed sprouting from the soil.

                                 BERCIK (O.S)
                        Pesticide is bad, George. Very bad.

           Wider. George stands in a

           CORNFIELD

           Unlike the prologue’s field, his corn is sparse, green, and 
           only waist-heigh. BERCIK (30s), Polish farmhand, broken 
           English, follows his boss toward a dilapidated barn.

                                 GEORGE
                        How many Polacks does it take to 
                        deracinate 10 acres by hand?

                                 BERCIK
                        Deracinate?

                                 GEORGE
                        Tear up from the roots- the weeds.

                                 BERCIK
                        We are only 3 Polacks.

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s why we need pesticide. 

                                 BERCIK
                        But we never use any pesticide.

                                 GEORGE
                        And we never grow any corn.

           They arrive at a

           GOAT PEN

           Outside the barn, a makeshift fence of wire, metal, and 
           pointed tree limbs enclose 30 ROAMING GOATS.

           Bercik’s brothers PATRICE and RONAN milk respective goats 
           into pails. Crates of full pint glasses lay at their feet.
                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        We all loaded up?

                                 RONAN
                             (in Polish)
                        2 more goats, then we can drink. 

                                 BERCIK
                             (translating)
                        Almost.

                                 GEORGE
                        How many pints for the week?

                                 PATRICE
                             (in Polish)
                        Over a dozen dozen.

                                 BERCIK
                             (translating)
                        About 150 pints.

                                 GEORGE
                        Good girls.

           George feeds a carrot to Ronan’s goat before he departs.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Tomorrow...tomorrow, we spray.

           George continues past a rusted windmill pump, toward an old, 
           gothic revival FARMHOUSE.

                                 BERCIK
                             (in Polish)
                        Uparty.

                                 GEORGE
                        Uparty?

                                 BERCIK
                             (translating)
                        Stubborn.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Worn furniture. Floral wallpaper. Porcelain doll collection. 
           The only hints of 1979 modernity lie in kitchen appliances. 

           George stands here and stares down the hall at an ajar YELLOW 
           DOOR that leaks Felix Mendelssohn’s Symphony No.2, Op.52.

           Beep Beep. He turns at the microwave alarm. 
           Insert on 2 Swanson TV Dinners beside a game of dominos. CAT 
           (30), nursing scrubs, eats. Beat.

                                 CAT
                        It’s still cold in the center.

           George takes a bite as he studies the pieces.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yep.

           He takes another bite and moves a domino. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Good day then?

           Cat raises her hand in a so-so gesture. George nods, places 
           another domino.  

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - 2ND STORY MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           An empty, immaculate bedroom. George, in pajamas, brushes his 
           teeth in the bathroom sink.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           He pours ice tea into a large glass and walks down the hall, 
           past a piano in the living room, toward the Yellow Door. 

           He enters and gently closes the door behind him.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIBRARY - NIGHT

           He places the drink on an adjustable tray beside the hospital 
           bed where ALICE VIKSE (60s) opens her eyes, tired but warm. 

           George grabs a pill holder off the vinyl player’s glass case 
           where Mendelssohn continues to play.

                                 GEORGE
                        Beethoven?

                                 ALICE
                        Mendelssohn. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Sonata--
                             (off her head shake)
                        -Symphony. Number...Four.
                                 ALICE
                        Two. Published posthumously. He 
                        wanted to revise it, but...

                                 GEORGE
                        Sounds done to me.

                                 ALICE
                             (playful)
                        You’re an amateur.

           He sits on her bed, places several pills in her hand. She 
           swallows one by one with the ice tea. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Move at all today?

                                 ALICE
                        Few laps downstairs. Slept a lot.

                                 GEORGE
                        Any dreams?

                                 ALICE
                        Two. First was summer at the beach. 
                        Except the sand was so cold I 
                        couldn’t get my feet warm. The 
                        other was a concert at school. You 
                        had a dark suit, asked me to dance.

                                 GEORGE
                        A regular class act I am.

           She smiles but suddenly winces in pain.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Your fingers again?

           Alice points to her forehead. George leans down, kisses it.

           Beat. She points to her left cheek. He kisses her there. Her 
           right. He follows. Then she points to her lips. They kiss.

                                 ALICE
                        You brushed your teeth.

                                 GEORGE
                        One of us oughta.

           She laughs. He joins.

           LATER

           It is dark.
           AHHHHHHHHH!

           George darts up from a tiny fold-up cot beside his wife’s 
           sickbed. He looks at Alice, but she is deep in sleep. George 
           turns to the yellow door.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Camera moves through the dark interior toward the back door, 
           behind George’s silhouette.

           BAM!

           The wooden frame shakes on impact. 

           BAM! 

           The door again rattles violently.

                                 GEORGE
                        Who is it?

           He reaches under the stairway and pulls out a rifle. He aims 
           it at the front door with one hand. With the other, he 
           outstretches his hand for the doorknob--

           -BAM!

           The door shakes and George jumps back. Beat. He recovers, 
           reaches out again. His grip tightens around the doorknob. 
           Finally, he swings the door open to see--

           -A GOAT.

           AHHHHHHH!

           The goat screams again (Note: goat screams sound human). 
           George sighs, lowers his weapons and inches onto 

           THE PORCH

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        How’d you get out?

           Closer on the goat; some blood runs down its face, another 
           deep laceration on its hip. 

           AHHHHHHHH! AHHHHH! AHHH! 

           He looks up, into his backyard to find A DOZEN MORE GOATS.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Goddamn it...BERCIK!
           EXT. VIKSE FARM - BACKYARD - DAWN

           George, Bercik, Ronan and Patrice sleepily corral respective 
           goats back toward their pen in the misty blue light.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - GOAT PEN - SUNRISE

           Ronan leads the last goat into the pen while Patrice fixes 
           the makeshift fence. Bercik holds a chewed up wire.

                                 BERCIK
                        Coyote is back. They fought him 
                        off, only one got scratched.

                                 GEORGE 
                        Thank God...

           On “God”, the farmhands each perform the sign of the cross. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        ...at least they’re all back safe.

           Beat. Ronan and Patrice mumble in Polish. 

                                 BERCIK
                             (translating)
                        All but one.

           George turns to the distant, empty fields. 

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Nurse Cat hovers over Alice, nude in the bathtub.

                                 CAT
                        ...the one Asian man I dated said 
                        it was normal-- uh, excuse you--

           -George opens the door.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m off. Do you need anything? 

                                 CAT
                        Oh! Get me some maple candy?

                                 ALICE
                        Nothing for me, love.

           George nods, reaches for the door--
                                 CAT
                        -Wait.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Cat approaches, shuts the door behind. Softly,

                                 CAT
                        You still owe me last week’s pay. 
                        I’m fine doing it just us but 
                        that’s why I go through an agency. 
                        I already turned down another job.

                                 GEORGE
                        Today. I’ll get it.

           Cat nods, heads back inside the bathroom.

                                 CAT
                             (returning to Alice)
                        Anyway, he was a gemini so it 
                        wasn’t gonna work out...

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           A beaten up, baby blue 1967 Ford pickup truck carves into the 
           dusty, sunburnt landscape.

           Crates of goat milk jostle in the cargo bed as the truck 
           continues over a transition from dirt to asphalt, toward a 
           small town in the distance. 

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

           Parked trucks line the sidewalk filled with tables and tents. 
           A LARGE CROWD roams through the street market. Some kids pet 
           a live chicken held by a POULTRY VENDOR.

           George rests on his tailgate beside a stenciled sign, Goat 
           Milk & Meat. His worn, dirty boots rest atop coolers.

           NANCE (50s) waves as she approaches. 

                                 NANCE
                        I’m late, I know it. Took the 
                        grandkids to church. You sold out?

                                 GEORGE
                        Loin chops going quick, but I saved 
                        you three pounds.
                                 NANCE
                        Oh perfect. Thank you, George. 

           He removes wax paper wrapped meat from the cooler.

                                 NANCE (CONT’D)
                        They got Dale on the piano; he can 
                        play the notes but he’s got no 
                        soul. Not like Alice. We miss her.

                                 GEORGE
                             (hands over the meat)
                        That’s sweet. I’ll pass that along. 

           Nance smiles as she leaves. George slumps back in his seat, 
           stares across the market at a CORN VENDOR laughing with ARNIE 
           WAYNE Sr. (50) neat, earnest, wearing brand new cowboy boots.

                                 JUNIOR (O.S)
                        Two pints. A dollar-fifty?

           George looks down at JUNIOR (11). He places coins on the 
           table and grabs the goat milk.

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s right.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Were you in World War Two?

                                 GEORGE
                        Too old.

                                 JUNIOR
                        World War One?

                                 GEORGE
                        Too young.

                                 JUNIOR
                        You a pacifist? Dad says pacifists 
                        voted for Carter and anyone who 
                        votes for Carter is a pussy.

                                 GEORGE
                        I don’t vote.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                             (approaching)
                        No politics, Arnold.

                                 GEORGE
                        Reminds me of you as a boy.
                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Gets his mouth from his mother.

           Arnie Wayne arrives, playfully tussles his son’s hair.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        His good looks and voracious 
                        curiosity is mine. Just started 
                        middle school- was hoping he’d get 
                        Mrs. Vikse, shame she retired.

           Junior cracks his pint of goat milk and sips.

                                 GEORGE
                        Not her choice.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        No, I don’t imagine. How is she?

                                 GEORGE
                        Okay. Good. Tired. That medicine... 
                        You? Sizing up the competition?

           George nods back toward the Corn Vendor. Arnie laughs.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Russell? No competition Mr. Vikse. 
                        You put up enough numbers you can 
                        go right to the grocery marts. We 
                        got a good thing going with Piggly 
                        Wiggly, San Angelo through Dallas. 

                                 GEORGE
                        How many acres you up to now?

                                 ARNIE WAYNE

                                 GEORGE
                        600? Boy. I only see a corner from 
                        my porch. You expanding?

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Got to, this economy. You used to 
                        put up good numbers, Mr. Vikse.

                                 GEORGE
                        Hasn’t taken in a while. Always 
                        stumbles mid cycle, but we’re 
                        trying now. Looking for pesticide 
                        actually, gonna shake down Russell.

                                 JUNIOR
                        We got pesticide in our truck.
                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        I’ll give you a few canisters.

                                 GEORGE
                        How much?

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Said I’ll give them to you.

                                 GEORGE
                        I don’t like favors, Arnie. How 
                        much those cans go for?

           Beat.

                                 JUNIOR
                        How much them loin chops go for?

           Junior, faint milk mustache, smiles. George laughs.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY 

           Pesticide canisters and empty milk crates bounce in the truck 
           bed. George heads back down the vacant dirt road.

           INT. / EXT. GEORGE'S TRUCK - DAY

           He adjusts the AM radio dial...talk radio...static...baseball 
           game... static...a sermon...George looks back up to the road--

           -A GOAT--

           -The truck breaks, swerves, and finally comes to a stop.

           Through the clearing dust, George spots his goat moving into 
           the road’s forested shoulder. He exits the vehicle after it.

           EXT. FORESTED SHOULDER - DAY

           The goat stops at the crest of a tiny hill. George shouts 
           from the bottom.

                                 GEORGE
                        Hold up! Come on back here.

           The goat remains static. George reluctantly trudges upwards. 
           As he nears the goat, it scurries out of view down the far 
           side of the slope. 

           As George finally arrives at the top, he suddenly stops. 
                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Christ almighty.

           Reveal ONE HUNDRED BODIES in the field below. 

           George, in shock, stares at the lifeless people (20s-40s). 

           Long beat. 

           Finally, he turns, almost sick. He steadies himself in the 
           direction of his truck until--

           -SOUNDS OF CRYING.

           George turns to the sea of bodies. He scans the field but 
           cannot find the source of its wailing: an infant. 

           George descends the hill, into

           THE FIELD

           He steps over still limbs and around limp heads; no blood, no 
           signs of trauma- the landscape more akin to a mass slumber.

           The shrieking continues, louder and louder. 

           George walks over a large, unstained knife, and closes in on 
           a trembling blanket. Tepidly, he lifts the cloth back.

           A BABY BOY (6 months old). 

           George stares stunned at the naked infant. Beat. 

           He crouches down and awkwardly picks it up.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Shhhh...shhhhh....okay....shhhh

           Wider. George holds the boy, the only life left in the field.

                                                           PRELAP PIANO

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           SHERIFF JIM BROOKES (27) looks even younger than he is as he 
           absentmindedly presses keys on the out of tune piano. 

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        They acquired a mass amount of land 
                        next to you, Arnie, then oblong to 
                        the east...
           George sits on the couch, dazed. He stares at coffee ground 
           residue in his mug. 

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES (CONT’D)
                        ...We thought it was a commune. I 
                        went snooping a year ago but they 
                        had crosses up. Figured they were a 
                        Christian group, Pentecostal or 
                        what have you; snake healing and 
                        speaking-in-tongues kinda folks- 
                        not illegal just bizarre.

                                 POLICE RADIO SECRETARY (O.S)
                        I have a 10-77 on Social Services.

           Sheriff stands.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        Excuse me.
                             (into his walkie)
                        Supposed to be here an hour ago...

           George looks over to the open yellow door with a view into

           THE LIBRARY

           Cat holds the sleeping baby up to the window where Bercik, 
           Ronan, and Patrice have gathered to see. They smile as Cat 
           hands the infant to Alice, in bed. 

           George returns to the Sheriff.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES (CONT’D)
                        Unbelievable. The Social Services 
                        person- her transmission died 
                        outside Waco. She can’t get here 
                        til tomorrow afternoon, if that. 

           Cat appears in the doorway, listening. 

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES (CONT’D)
                        This thing is big. A big old mess. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Call the other counties yet? You 
                        can borrow some fellas to help 
                        identify the dead. 

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        That’s good, that’s smart. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Hell, state police. Maybe even the 
                        FBI. This is gonna make noise.
                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        Gosh, the FBI? I didn’t even think 
                        I’d win Sheriff. 

                                 GEORGE
                        You ran unopposed.

           POLICE RADIO ignites again with officer chatter. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        You’re busy Jimmy, we oughta let 
                        you go now and take the baby.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        What do I do with the baby?

           George clocks Cat leaning against the doorframe.

                                 GEORGE
                        Don’t know Sheriff. What do you do?

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        Social Services was just gonna take 
                        it to the hospital. But that’s 
                        three hours each way and I gotta 
                        get back to the field.

           Sheriff looks at George, pleading.

                                 GEORGE
                        No. I can’t afford that drive right 
                        now, we’re spraying--

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        -Alice still goes to the hospital  
                        every week though?

                                 GEORGE
                        Every other week.

                                 CAT
                        We could watch the baby for a day 
                        or so. He seems healthy and all.

                                 GEORGE
                        No. I got goats. I got corn.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        You got a live-in nurse.

                                 GEORGE
                        No, Jimmy. No--
                                 ALICE (O.S)
                        -We go to hospital on Friday. 

           Everyone turns to Alice, still in bed, baby in her arms. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        We’ll watch the baby til then.

           George, unwilling to dissent. Sheriff heads to the back door.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        Thank you, thank you. Alice, Cat, 
                        George. I’ll be in touch now. I 
                        truly appreciate it, I do.

           Sheriff exits and George follows.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM HOUSE - PORCH - DAY - CONTINUOUS

                                 GEORGE
                        What in the hell, Jimmy? 

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        I’m sorry. I owe you...

           Sheriff descends the porch stairs.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES (CONT’D)
                        ...I’ll come back one of these days 
                        and fix your door.

           George turns to his door where horn-sized holes have pierced 
           the wood, smeared with dried goat blood.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - SUNSET

           The farmhands wheel the pesticide canisters through the 
           cornfield. They spray different rows of the short green crop.

           George watches from the

           GOAT PEN

           He shoos away goats- they scatter under a low hanging storm 
           cover’s tin roof. George returns to scrubbing a dirty glass 
           coke bottle and billy bottle nipple in a bucket of suds. 

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - KITCHEN

           George sets two hot TV dinners down on the table and studies 
           the adjacent game of dominos.
                                 GEORGE
                        You move? Where’d you move?

           Cat feeds the baby from the cleaned coke bottle at the edge 
           of the table, her scrubs stained with milk, both hands full.

                                 CAT
                        A little busy, George.

           George looks down the hall as the yellow door opens, leaking 
           Bach’s Concerto for Harpsichord & Orchestra No. 6. Alice 
           slips on a cardigan as she slowly emerges.

           Cat turns, surprised. George stands.

                                 ALICE
                             (arriving)
                        Smells good.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re hungry?

           Beat.

                                 ALICE
                        Yes, actually.

           George retrieves a third chair for their small kitchen table. 
           He slides his TV dinner to Alice. 

           She quickly takes a few bites, grinning at the baby. George 
           looks to Cat. Alice feels their eyes.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.

                                 CAT
                        No. Eat, please.

                                 GEORGE
                        We got plenty more.

           The baby cries, softly. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        We got chicken and salisbury--

                                 ALICE
                        -Can I hold him again?

           She places her fork down. Cat nods, hands the baby over.

                                 CAT
                        Likely needs some burping. 
           Alice holds the child upright against her shoulder and kisses 
           its head. She pats his back until he burps. Alice laughs.

           She looks to George. He smiles back at his wife.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - NIGHT

           Goats move inside their pen. In the distance, George descends 
           his porch stairs and opens a root cellar door, built into the 
           soil. He descends into the dark. Beat.

           A light turns on.

           INT. VIKSE FARM - ROOT CELLAR - NIGHT

           A dim concrete basement courtesy one dangling overhead bulb. 

           Storage shelves contain canned vegetables. Old corn husks 
           hang above a tool bench littered with half-finished projects 
           and an unread copy of ON DEATH AND DYING. 

           George hovers in the back at a separate table above a pot, 
           plastic buckets and tubes. He scoops liquid out with a mug. 
           Cautiously he smells, then sips. His face goes bitter but 
           recovers into a smile. Moonshine.

           EXT. VIKSE HOUSE - PORCH - NIGHT - LATER

           George sits in a rocking chair with his mug. 

           His rifle lays across his lap as he eyes the distant goat 
           pen, then the spinning windmill, and finally the buzzing 
           filament of a lantern hanging over the porch railing. 

           Slowly, his eyelids close.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIBRARY - NIGHT

           The baby lies on the dresser. Alice tries to fold a cloth 
           diaper but curls her fingers as if pricked. Cat sees.

                                 CAT
                        I got that.

                                 ALICE
                        I’m fine. 

           Alice tries again but fails. Cat grabs the diaper.
                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                             (sits on the bed)
                        I swear it’s the pills that do it.

                                 CAT
                             (folding)
                        Your body’s just remembering 
                        itself, like when you fall asleep 
                        on your arm. But it’s good; it’s 
                        progress.

                                 ALICE
                        Well progress hurts.

           Cat finishes the diaper fold. The baby coos at Alice.

                                 CAT
                        He likes you, Alice.

                                 ALICE
                        Yeah?

                                 CAT
                        Yeah. How come you never had any 
                        kids? George didn’t want them?

                                 ALICE
                        We waited. I had school and George 
                        had the farm. Seemed like enough, 
                        until it didn’t. And by then it was 
                        too late. That was a real rough 
                        patch, nearly broke George.

                                 CAT
                        All this time I just thought he was 
                        an asshole.

                                 ALICE,
                        Oh honey, he’s still an asshole.

           They share a polite laugh.

           LATER

           George stumbles in the dark as he unfolds the cot and lays 
           down. Between himself and Alice’s hospital bed, the baby 
           sleeps in a cleaned manger adorned with blankets. 

           George watches the baby’s little chest rise and fall. 
           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIBRARY - DAY

           Sunlight pours through the window. George wakes and turns 
           toward Alice. Her bed is empty.

           PIANO SOUNDS (in tune) from beyond the yellow door. 

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           George enters the living room where Alice sits at the piano. 
           The baby rests on her lap. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Your fingers?

                                 ALICE
                        Felt better. Watch this.

           Alice taps the left-most piano key, A0. Nothing happens. Then 
           key, B0. Still nothing. Next C1.

           The baby coos.

           Alice continues moving down the keys. The baby responds only 
           at specific notes as a melody forms. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        His own little lullaby. He likes 
                        it! Yes he does.

           The baby smiles. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Very cute.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           George enters. Cat reads a newspaper and sips coffee.

                                 GEORGE
                        How’s my paper?

                                 CAT
                        Good. Your coffee isn’t bad either.

                                 GEORGE
                        You got work to do?

                                 CAT
                        You mean nurse the woman who’s 
                        laughing at the piano? Today is a 
                        good day.
           George reaches for the French press coffee, but it is empty. 
           A WHISTLE from the backyard- George turns.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - DAY

           George descends the porch stairs toward Bercik.

                                 BERCIK
                        Good news? Corn is alive- all of 
                        it. Even the back acre we thought 
                        dead. Weeds are shrinking fast.

                                 GEORGE
                             (arriving)
                        What’s the bad news?

                                                                 CUT TO

           THE GOAT PEN

           A MUTILATED BILLY GOAT. Flies hover over blood and guts. 
           Ronan and Patrice say a prayer in Polish.

                        That coyote came back.

           George covers his nose with a handkerchief.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - GRAVEYARD - DAY

           George ushers dirt into a tiny hole with his boot and plops a 
           large stone on top. Wider to reveal several similar mounds.

           A few yards away, ONE SMALL CROSS stands erect in the shadow 
           of a tree. It is old and rusting. George stares.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           INSERT on the TV NEWS:

                        Temple.

           Montage of disparate interviews.
           The TV light flickers on Alice, asleep on the couch. The baby 
           wakes in the manger by her feet and starts to fuss.

                                 GEORGE (O.S)
                        Cat!...the baby!
                             (beat)
                        ...CAT!

           George enters frustrated from the back porch door.

           He approaches his sleeping wife and adjusts her blanket. Then 
           he picks up the manger, crying child and all.

           EXT. VIKSE HOUSE - PORCH - NIGHT

           George closes the door behind him as he sits back into his 
           porch chair and places the manger at his feet.

           The baby cries louder. George offers the bottle. But the baby 
           spits it out. Again, the bottle. Again, rejected.

                                 GEORGE
                        Not hungry...did you poop?

           George leans over the child and sniffs its cloth diaper.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        No. Thank god.

           The baby continues crying, louder. George sips his mug.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        You teething? 

           George dips a finger into his moonshine and outstretches it 
           toward the baby’s mouth. He gently rubs its gums. Beat.

           The baby calms.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Good, huh? Made it myself--

           -George pulls back with a wince. He looks at his finger.

           Blood forms. It drips onto the porch. 

           George returns to the baby, who stares back, finally silent. 
           Confused, George leans down and slowly parts its lips.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           George enters the kitchen with a yawn. Cat sips coffee.

                                 CAT
                        Sleep in, did we?

                                 GEORGE
                        Up all night with the baby. Where 
                        were you?

                                 CAT
                        What?

                                 GEORGE
                        I called for you.

                                 CAT
                        Didn’t hear it.

                                 GEORGE
                        I screamed.

           Cat shrugs, continues reading. George eyes her as he reaches 
           for the coffee- empty again. Alice enters with the baby.

                                 ALICE
                        Are we late?

           INT. GEORGE’S TRUCK - DAY

           Sunlight passes in and out over the baby’s face. George’s 
           left hand steers, his right rests in the center with a band-
           aid on his finger. 

           Alice grabs his hand, grips tight. She appears tense.

                                 GEORGE
                        It’ll be fine. It always is.

           Beat. Her eyes focus on the baby.

                                 ALICE
                        We’re better than an orphanage.

           George releases his grip, places his hand back on the wheel.

           George, Alice and the baby follow BAY NURSE (50) down a hall, 
           past TECHS, some EXPECTANT PARENTS and BRAND NEW PARENTS.

                                 BAY NURSE
                        Sheriff said you found him on the 
                        side of the road. Some people just 
                        aren’t ready to be parents. 

           Alice looks at George- the Sheriff had a cover story.

                                 GEORGE
                        Strangest thing I ever saw.

                                 BAY NURSE
                        I’ve seen stranger. Did an ER 
                        residency; you wouldn’t believe 
                        what some folks put up their anus.

           They stop at the glass windows of the observation area.

           Alice hands the Baby to a young NEONATAL NURSE, who enters 
           the back room behind the glass, where 2 NEWBORNS rest.

           George listens impatiently to the Bay Nurse, distracted by 
           Alice who has become emotional.

                                 ALICE
                        What happens to him now?

                                 BAY NURSE
                        We’ll do blood work, fingerprints, 
                        vaccinations. Then guess his age to 
                        draw up his paperwork.

                                 ALICE
                        A retroactive birth certificate?

                                 BAY NURSE
                        He’s gotta grow up to pay taxes, 
                        don’t he?

                                 ALICE
                        What will you name him?

                                 GEORGE
                        We’re late, hun.

                                 BAY NURSE
                        Last name goes to the doctor. First 
                        name? We’ll draw straws; adoptive 
                        parents gonna change it anyways.
                                 ALICE
                        What about Eli? 
                             (to George)
                        You like that name? Eli?

                                 GEORGE
                        ...Yeah, sure.

           Alice turns back to the Bay Nurse.

                                 BAY NURSE
                        Eli. That’s a lovely name.

           Behind the glass, Baby Eli snuggles into his bassinet.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           MONTAGE. Cross cut between Baby Eli and Alice as each has 
           weight measured, blood drawn, eyes checked, and enter an MRI 
           machine (Alice) or incubator (Eli).

           INT. HOSPITAL - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

           THREE DOCTORS sit near MRI images across the room from Alice. 
           DR. LIU (40s) marks a questionnaire.

                                 DR. LIU
                        ...any digestive issues since your 
                        appetite has returned?

                                 ALICE
                        No.

                                 DR. LIU
                        Any resurgent abdominal swelling?

                                 ALICE
                        No.

                                 DR. LIU
                        Almost done. What age did you begin 
                        menopause?

                                 ALICE

                                 DR. LIU
                        Have you ever been pregnant?

           Beat.
                                 ALICE
                        Three times.

                                 DR. LIU
                        Full term to birth?

                                 ALICE
                        Only once.

                                 DR. LIU
                        Male or female?

                                 ALICE
                        Male.

                                 DR. LIU
                        How old is your son now?

                                 ALICE
                        Excuse me?

                                 DR. LIU
                        What year was he born?

                                 ALICE
                        March 25th, 1944. He was a 
                        stillborn.

           Dr. Liu looks up for the first time. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve answered these questions 
                        before. Was there a problem with my 
                        scans?

                                 DR. LIU
                        No, Alice. This is good news.

           INT. HOSPITAL - OFFICE - DAY

           A cramped office. Stacks of books and papers on the desk. 
           George and Alice sit across from DR. JARRAD (50s).

                                 DR. JARRAD
                        If the surgery didn’t take, we’d 
                        see spread to the colon or lungs: 
                        stage 4. Instead I see regression, 
                        containment to the pelvic region. 
                        If I saw this for the first time, 
                        I’d say its stage 2. Go to Austin 
                        and a democrat’ll call it stage 1.
                                 GEORGE
                        If the surgery worked, why has it 
                        taken, what, four months to show?

                                 DR. JARRAD
                        The armidex, the aromasin, the 
                        prolia, changes in diet, sleep, any 
                        combo of these. We don’t know.

                                 ALICE
                        But I’m better.

                                 DR. JARRAD
                        Regression doesn’t mean inactive. 
                        We see cancer weaken and sometimes 
                        come back even stronger. For now, 
                        we’ve moved in a great direction.

                                 ALICE
                        Do I have to keep taking the pills? 
                        My joints on that stuff- I can’t 
                        even use the stairs most days.

                                 DR. JARRAD
                        Don’t rock the boat, Alice. Keep up 
                        with the pills. And whatever you’re 
                        doing differently, keep doing it.

           Alice looks at George.

           INT. HOSPITAL - INFANT WING - DAY

           Baby Eli sleeps in a little blue cap. Unheard through the 
           soundproof glass, George and Alice discreetly argue. Her 
           passion in sharp contrast to his stoicism. Beat. 

           Finally, he mutters. She hugs him, kisses his cheek.

           INT. HOSPITAL - INFANT WING - DAY

           George signs some forms at the front desk.

                                 BAY NURSE
                        Social Service’ll present adoption 
                        candidates in a few weeks. Usually 
                        come with neat essays and photos...

           He looks over to the observation area where Alice is pressed 
           agains the glass. Fog forms as she watches the Neonatal Nurse 
           lift and present Baby Eli.
                                 BAY NURSE (CONT’D)
                        ...and if you decide to keep him, 
                        easy, it’s just a few more forms.

                                 GEORGE
                        No, ma’am. This is only temporary. 

                                 BAY NURSE
                        Well then. A temporary 
                        congratulations to you.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           George’s truck parks in the driveway beside Cat’s Chevelle 
           Station Wagon. 

           Alice exits with Baby Eli and heads inside their home while 
           George opens the tailgate filled with groceries, baby 
           products, and large cardboard boxes.

           Ronan, Patrice, and Bercik approach the truck.

                                 GEORGE
                        Can you takes these inside?

           George glances back at his house. Through a window he watches 
           Alice and Baby Eli greet Cat.

                                 BERCIK
                        Baby not gone?

           Cat, upset, looks back at George. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Baby not gone.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           George has sprawled out on the floor with tools and various 
           open cardboard boxes. The TV plays the end of Jeopardy. 

           Cat enters, sets Baby Eli on the floor.

                                 CAT
                        I’m off the clock.

                                 GEORGE
                        Can you just watch it til Alice is 
                        out of her bath?

                                 CAT
                        No. 
                                 GEORGE
                        No? I need another- look- Jesus- 
                        it’s putting shit in its mouth!

           George swipes an instruction manual out of Eli’s hand, 
           brushes the tiny assembly pieces away.

                                 CAT
                        A child is not a puppy you get to 
                        make your sick wife feel better.

                                 GEORGE
                        I said I didn’t want it. I said 
                        that. You butt in, you did that.

                                 CAT
                        A couple days is not adoption.

                                 GEORGE
                        We didn’t adopt! It’s, this is 
                        temporary. That’s all. And if it 
                        gives her something to focus on for 
                        a couple weeks then good; she’s 
                        feeling better.

                                 CAT
                        My last client, Mr. Cogan- leukemia- 
                        he felt better for a whole week, 
                        about two months before he died. 

           Cat storms up the stairs. 

                                 CAT (CONT’D)
                        You’re putting that highchair 
                        together backwards. 

           Baby Eli stares at George. 

           The TV NEWS starts: images of bodies in the field. George 
           switches channels to a JOHN WAYNE MOVIE. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Watch that.

           Eli continues looking at George.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jars of opened baby food. Baby Eli sits in a new highchair, 
           face and bib already a mess. Alice, wet hair, outstretches a 
           spoonful. George watches.
                                 ALICE
                        Peach. Peach. Mmmm. Peach.

           Eli opens his mouth wide. His ponderous face turns pleased. 

                                 BABY ELI
                        Mmmmbaaa.

                                 ALICE
                        Yayyy. Peach is yum. Let’s try more 
                        Peas. Okay? Peas, peas, peas.

           Baby Eli reaches for the spoon. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        You want more? More? Look George, 
                        he wants to feed himself. See!?

           Eli grabs the spoon and tries, mostly fails, to get smashed 
           peas in his mouth. Alice claps. Eli smiles, turns to George.

           Suddenly, Baby Eli burps.

           Alice laughs. Then Eli giggles. Alice laughs harder, can 
           barely catch her breath. She smacks the table as tears form. 

           George stares at Eli, humorless.

                                 GEORGE
                        Don’t get too attached.

           Alice pretends not to hear.

           EXT. VIKSE HOUSE - PORCH - NIGHT

           The goats sleep under the tin roof in their pen. George 
           watches from his porch chair where he sips his mug. The 
           creaking wood sounds like a metronome. Tick. Tick.

           His eyes slowly close. Tick. Tick.

           A LOUD, DISTANT BARN DOOR SLAM. 

           George wakes and grabs the rifle. A rustling from the pen. 

           He stands, raises his weapon and scans the field via scope. 
           But the goats just amble, no panic at all. 

           Beat. George lowers his rifle, looks up to see--

           -A SILHOUETTE approaching fast.
                                 GEORGE
                        Who’s that?

           As the shadow nears it takes a female shape.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Said who is that!?

           George aims his rifle as it approaches the light.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Stop right there--

           -Cat raises her hands.

                                 CAT
                        I look like a coyote!? 

           George lowers his rifle, sits back down. Cat mumbles as she 
           marches up the porch, lands on the last step.

                                 GEORGE
                        What were you doing in Bercik’s 
                        barn so late?

                                 CAT
                        None of your business.

                                 GEORGE
                        I employ you both, so actually 
                        that’s exactly what it is.

                                 CAT
                        I was returning a book he lent me.

                                 GEORGE
                        What book?

                                 CAT
                        The Bible.

           George laugh-coughs into his mug.

                                 CAT (CONT’D)
                        It’s good to believe in something.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’ll believe it when I see it.

                                 CAT
                        You been drinking more these days?

                                 GEORGE
                        That is none of your business.
                                 CAT
                        Keep it up and you’ll be my next 
                        client. Then it will be.

           She approaches, grabs his mug for a sip. She coughs.

                                 GEORGE
                        Did I offer you a taste? 

                                 CAT
                             (returns the mug)
                        Thought you actually changed.

                                 GEORGE
                        No one changes. You just become 
                        more you. Like a snake that sheds 
                        its skin, over and over again, 
                        until there you are. 

                                 CAT
                        Can’t talk to you when you’re 
                        drunk, you remind me of my dad.

           She enters the home, leaving George alone.

                                 GEORGE
                        A poet, I’m sure.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIBRARY - NIGHT

           George sleeps in his cot. SOUNDS of Baby Eli crying O.S. 

                                 ALICE (O.S)
                        Shhh...It’s okay...

           George tosses and turns, then slowly wakes as the cries grow. 

                                 GEORGE
                        What does it want?

                                 ALICE (O.S)
                        Nothing. Go back to bed.

           Sounds of Alice shuffling for the baby and the door opening.

                                 GEORGE
                             (sitting up)
                        Alice?

           He sits up but the room is empty. The yellow door is open; 
           Alice and Eli are gone. George turns on a lamp. Beat.

           Suddenly, a DARK FIGURE passes behind him. He turns-- 
           -The yellow door SLAMS SHUT and a shadow passes over it, then 
           another. Different shapes move across the walls in a pattern.

           George traces the contours back to their source- a mobile of 
           felt angels and clouds spinning above Baby Eli’s new crib.

           George grabs the mobile, halts its gentle rotation. Beat.

           ANOTHER DARK FIGURE PASSES OVER THE WALL BEHIND HIM.

           George stands, spooked, eyes on the wall. Beat. 

           FAINT SOUNDS OF BABY CRYING start again from the next room.

           George cautiously approaches the wall. As he nears, he sees 
           the floral wallpaper warping in narrow passages like there is 
           a leak. A protruding bulge abruptly appears and then 
           retracts. George jumps back.

           The strip of wallpaper slowly peels off entirely to reveal--

           -BLOOD RUNNING DOWN THE NAKED WALL. 

           SOUNDS OF CRYING grow louder and more crisp, emanating from 
           the wall itself. 

           George watches the bulge appear again, morphing into

           AN INFANT’S HAND, REACHING OUT AT HIM--

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIBRARY - NIGHT

           -George wakes up in his cot. 

           He turns to see the crib and hospital bed are empty. He sits 
           up with a view through the open yellow door into

           THE LIVING ROOM

           Alice gently rocks Baby Eli back to sleep.

           INT. VIKSE FARM - GOAT PEN

           Patrice and Ronan corral goats into a head gate, locking them 
           upright. George takes a stool and grabs his head, hungover.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m good.
           Bercik nods, rosary in hand. His brothers bow.

           George turns to his house. 

           EXT. VIKSE HOUSE - PORCH - DAY

           He grabs the receiver sitting on the windowsill.

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah?

                        Sheriff Jim Brookes? Can’t believe 
                        I’m talking to a real live TV star.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES (O.S.)
                        Rather be on M.A.S.H than the news.

                                 GEORGE
                        No doubt.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES (O.S.)
                        Listen, George. Did that baby... 
                        did you notice anything strange?

           George peers through the window, billowing curtains reveal 
           Eli on the floor, playing with Alice.

                                 GEORGE
                        Besides all those dead bodies?

           Baby Eli spots George. Alice turns to the window, waves. 

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES (O.S.)
                        Any signs of abuse? 

                                 GEORGE
                        Not that I recall. Why?
                                 SHERIFF BROOKES (O.S.)
                        Made it to their compound- well one 
                        of em. Found home video tapes we’re 
                        going through now, odd ceremonies, 
                        rituals...Think they branded women, 
                        maybe kids too. Trying to verify.

                                 GEORGE
                        You can’t verify with one of those 
                        poor bastards in the field?

                                 GEORGE
                        Yep.

           George hangs up, stares back through the curtain.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - LATER

           Baby Eli, naked in the sink. Water builds around the infant. 
           Alice dips her fingers under the faucet and adjusts the 
           temperature. She wipes Eli’s head. He giggles.

                                 ALICE
                        Feel good? Yeah? Yeah...

           Alice grabs his right leg, turns it. Closer on the back of 
           his thigh: a hand-carved inverted crucifix.

           The water continues filling the sink. Alice, upset, releases 
           his leg; Eli’s limbs are now all underwater.

           The faucet STUTTERS to a stop.

           Alice adjusts the hot water, then the cold. Nothing. She taps 
           the faucet again and again to no avail.

           Eli giggles and splashes. Alice considers the faucet until--

           -CRRRRSHHHHHHHHH!

           BLOOD GUSHES OUT FILLING THE SINK.

           Alice, horrified, grabs the faucet but her wet hand slips on 
           the valves. Blood runs everywhere. Finally, it shuts off. 
           Baby Eli laughs and slaps his hands, kicks his little feet. 
           His tiny, smiling face now covered in red.

           INT. WATER WELL - DAY

           Hold on blackness. Until a lid slides to reveal a tiny circle 
           of daylight above. Camera is deep down in a well. Two 
           silhouettes appear. One pours a long rod down the hole.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - BACKYARD - DAY

           George stands at his stone well beneath the windmill. Next to 
           him is Arnie Wayne.

           Arnie withdraws his rod, steeped in blood-like liquid. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Smells like shit.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        That’s the sulfur. This is clay 
                        resolves. Gives it that red hue. 
                        How old is this well, Mr. Vikse?

                                 GEORGE
                        Your daddy dug it for me, maybe the 
                        year you were born. 

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Yep. Clay erodes over time. Even 
                        faster when you pump salt water.

                                 GEORGE
                        We don’t pump salt water.

           Arnie pulls paper from the rod’s tip; it is green.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        You got 5 times the salt 
                        concentration you’d ever want.

                                 GEORGE
                        Does that make us sick?

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        No. Dehydrated maybe. But if this 
                        is your irrigation source, you’re 
                        killing your own crops. Didn’t need 
                        that pesticide after all, huh?

           George scratches his head.
           EXT. VIKSE FARM - LATER

           Arnie Wayne smokes a cigar, holds a forked-stick dowsing rod 
           parallel to the ground and walks through the backyard past 

           THE LITTLE GRAVEYARD

           He passes the dirt mounds with stone markings, toward the 
           tiny cross. George watches the rod bend down to the soil. 

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Arnie points at an old geological map of the farm. 

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        There are two areas ripe to hit a 
                        fresh water spring. Here or, my 
                        preference, over by this tree.

                                 GEORGE
                        We can’t dig there.

                        The other spot might hit limestone--

           -Alice enters with Baby Eli and opens the fridge.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Vikse? Heyyyy, how are you?

           Arnie stands. Alice approaches, kisses him on the cheek.

                                 ALICE
                        Hello, Arnold. Sorry, I didn’t know 
                        you two were still working.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        It’s so nice to see you. You look 
                        wonderful, just great.

                                 ALICE
                        Thank you, I’m feeling better.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        And who is this little guy, huh?

           George stares Alice down. She notes his displeasure.

                                 ALICE
                        Oh. This, this is Eli. My niece’s 
                        youngest. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        They’re on a trip, so we’re keeping 
                        an eye for a week or two.

                                 GEORGE
                        Hopefully less.

           Arnie detects the tension, deflects with a laugh.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Boy howdy. I remember these days. 
                        Lots of sleepless nights. Babies, 
                        all babies, sure is a lot of work. 
                        But it’s all worth it, isn’t it? 

                                 ALICE
                        I imagine so.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIBRARY - NIGHT

           Alice and Baby Eli sleep. George quietly unfurls his cot.

                                 GEORGE
                        Alice...Alice you up?

           No answer. George lays down and turns the lamp off. In the 
           darkness, he tosses in search of a cool spot. Settled, he 
           cranes his neck back toward Alice--

           -SHE LEVITATES A FOOT ABOVE HER BED.

           George darts up and flicks the lamp on to illuminate--

           -Alice in bed like normal.

           Beat. Baby Eli also sleeps.

           George wipes his eyes, confused. He shakes his head and 
           reaches again for the lamp switch. Off.

           IN THE DARKNESS, ALICE SLOWLY RISES ABOVE HER BED.

           George flicks the light back on--

           -But Alice rests again on the mattress. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Alice... hey, Alice?

           She continues to sleep. Long beat. George finally resigns. 
           Lamp still on, he lays back on his cot. Beat.

           CLICK. The light turns OFF by itself. 
           George whips his head to the lamp. Then, back to

           ALICE, HOVERING.

           He flicks the light back on.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Alice. Wake up. Alice get up--

           Baby Eli tosses in his sleep and AUDIBLY GRUMBLES--

           -The lamp light grows brighter and brighter. George turns to 
           the white-hot filament. It continues to buzz until it BURSTS.

           Darkness, again. Beat.

           Camera stays on George, frightened. He slowly, quietly lays 
           back down on his cot and turns over, facing away.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           George tired, stands on a chair to adjusts the fuse box. He 
           turns to an obstructed view of

           THE LIVING ROOM

           Alice plays Eli’s Lullaby on the piano, the baby on her lap. 
           George stares as Cat enters.

                                 CAT 
                        You don’t ever look good but today 
                        you especially look like shit.

           Cat, bedhead and baggy shirt, pours herself the last bit of 
           coffee and unfolds the paper. George gets off his chair.

                                 GEORGE
                        You look about as rough as me and 
                        you’re only half as funny.

                                 CAT
                        Couldn’t sleep again?

           George nods. Sees the paper’s cover story on the dead bodies.

                                 GEORGE
                        Bad dreams.

                                 CAT
                        Oughta take some of her medicine. 
                        That’ll knock you flat out.
           EXT. VIKSE FARM - BACKYARD - DAY 

           Gloves, safety goggles, open cans of beer. Arnie Wayne, 
           Junior, and 2 EXCAVATORS guide a power augur into the ground.

           A rotary drill rotates in a violent blur. Suddenly it stops. 
           Fresh water pours out over the ground forming a puddle.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - CORNFIELD - DAY

           Bercik stands by a tall sprinkler tripod and relays a thumbs 
           up 20 yards from Ronan at his own sprinkler, who relays a 
           thumbs up to Patrice down the line, ditto to George in the:

           THE BACKYARD

           George flips on a large motorized pump. Water cascades out of 
           the farmhands’ sprinklers. They cheer. George laughs, turns 
           to see Alice on the porch with Baby Eli, clapping.

           CORN TIMELAPSE

           Days pass. Weeks pass. Corn grows, straightens, and blooms.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - CORNFIELD - SUNSET

           In different rows of the distant fields, the farmhands till 
           corn with sickles and pack cobs into burlap sacks.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Cat shuffles corn into a hand mill, spitting out cornmeal. 
           Alice cracks eggs into a bowel of masa and kneads it.

           INT. VIKSE BARN - NIGHT

           Ronan plays a concertina atop haystacks. George pours his 
           moonshine shots for Cat, Alice, Bercik, Ronan, and Patrice.

                                 PATRICE 
                        Na Zdorovie!

                                 ALL
                        Na Zdorovie!

           They drink. Ronan plays Polish birthday song A Hundred Years. 
                                 PATRICE
                        Sto lat, sto lat,
                        Niech zyje, zyje nam...

           Alice holds the baby’s hands so he stands upright. Eli jumps 
           up and down in a little dance. The others follow and sing.

                                 PATRICE / RONAN / BERCIK
                        ...Sto lat, sto lat,
                        Niech zyje, zyje nam
                        Jeszcze raz, jeszcze raz,
                        Niech zyje, zyje nam,
                        Niech zyje nam!

           George unveils a loaf of cornbread, a lit candle on top. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Happy Birthday, Bercik.

           Bercik blows out his candle. Gentle applause. George cuts the 
           cornbread, placing pieces on plates. The Farmhands all bow.

                                 RONAN / PATRICE
                             (in Polish)
                        Heavenly Father we thank You for 
                        Bercik. Bless him always in Your 
                        love. Bless us too, Holy Father, 
                        and this food with which we 
                        celebrate. Help us all to praise 
                        You and give You glory through 
                        Jesus Christ our lord.

                                 BERCIK/ RONAN/ PATRICE/ CAT
                        Amen. 

           Baby Eli sneezes.

                                 CAT
                        God bless you!

           Baby Eli sneezes again.

                                 ALICE
                             (fanning the air)
                        I think the smoke got to him...

           Ronan’s continues to play as Bercik pours more moonshine. 
           Everyone savors the cornbread. George raises his mug, proud.

                                 PATRICE
                        Byczy!

                                 ALL
                        Byczy!
           LATER

           The music has softened into something romantic. Everyone is 
           tired, drunk. Baby Eli yawns in Alice’s arms. His eyes close.

           Nurse Cat and Berick dance, close and intimate. He whispers 
           something in her ear. Cat laughs. George watches, displeased. 

           Ronan plays the final notes of his song and removes the 
           concertina from his neck, finished.

           George stands and places a hand on Alice’s shoulder.

                                 GEORGE
                        Bed?

                                 ALICE
                        Cat, does the baby have a fever?  

           Cat walks beside her, hand to Eli’s forehead. Bercik joins 
           her, and finally Ronan and Patrice. Note: composition mimics 
           Caravaggio’s Nativity with Saint Francis and Saint Lawrence.

                                 CAT
                        He’s hot. 

           Alice coughs, badly. Cat moves her hand to Alice’s head.

                                 CAT (CONT’D)
                        Alice, you’re hot too. 

                                                             CROSS FADE

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIBRARY - NIGHT

           The mobile of felt angels and clouds spins above Baby Eli, 
           sleeping in his crib. Alice stares while a record spins, 
           Chopin’s Mazurka in C-Sharp Minor, Opus 50, No.3.

           George enters with ice tea and withdraws her pill holder. 

                                 GEORGE
                        You think Cat and Bercik are 
                        dating? It’s like she forgot she’s 
                        here to take care of you. 

                                 ALICE
                        They’re young. Let them be young. 

           George stops, stares at the pills in his hand. He counts.
                                 GEORGE
                        There are 15 pills here. You know 
                        how many were here last week? 
                             (off her head shake)
                        You haven’t been taking your 
                        medicine. 

                                 ALICE
                        It hurts my fingers, my joints, 
                        turns me groggy- keeps me sick.

                                 GEORGE
                        We do what the doctors tell us to 
                        do until you’re better.

                                 ALICE
                        I am better.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re sick. 

                                 ALICE
                        I have a little cold.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re sick, damn it. I wish you 
                        weren’t, I wish I could take it on 
                        for you. But I can’t.

           He presents the pills again. Beat. A refusal.

                                 ALICE
                        I’m meant to be better. Just like 
                        you were meant to find Eli. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Alice.

                                 ALICE
                        You think I’m superstitious. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I think you’re drunk and you should 
                        take your medication.

           He shoves the pills closer but her eyes remain on his. 

                                 ALICE
                        How am I supposed to take care of 
                        Eli?

           Frustrated George drops the pills and exits.
                                 GEORGE
                        Time that baby found a real home.

           Alice turns to Eli.

           EXT. VIKSE HOUSE - PORCH - NIGHT

           George sits, rifle in his lap, rocking in his chair. He eyes 
           the lamp’s flickering filament. Then, RUSTLING from the 
           distant sheep’s pen.

           George stands, aims his rifle. Through the scope he spots a 
           COYOTE clawing at the fence. George fingers the trigger.

           BANG!

           The coyote goes down, kill shot to the head. George looks up 
           from the scope with a deep breath.

                                                           PRELAP CHOIR

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           George’s hand on the pew. It inches toward Alice’s. They 
           touch, but Alice moves away. Her modest diamond wedding ring 
           catches light, throwing a prism of colors across the church- 
           stations of the cross, a painting of virgin Mary and baby 
           Jesus, toward the alter where PREACHER (50s) stands.

                                 PREACHER
                        He answers you when you’re sick and 
                        lonely and scared. The hopes and 
                        fears you can’t even speak- he 
                        hears you, like a mother hears her 
                        child. And he answers you. Are you 
                        listening? Deuteronomy 32-29: See 
                        now that I, even I, am he, and 
                        there is no God beside me; I kill 
                        and I make alive; I wound and I 
                        heal; and there is none that can 
                        deliver out of my hand. 
                             (points)
                        Alice Vikse. Will you please?

           Alice exits her pew into the aisle. The entire congregation 
           tuns and slowly stands as she walks to the alter’s piano. 
           George watches the crowd whisper. He turns to Arnie Wayne, 
           beside his wife KIM and Junior. Arnie smiles back, winks.

           Alice begins to play the hymn, Whispering Hope but messes up. 
           She pauses and starts again- this time she plays clean.
                                 CHOIR
                        Soft as the voice of an angel, 
                        breathing a lesson unheard, hope 
                        with a gentle persuasion whispers 
                        her comforting word...

           The entire crowd joins, but George does not know the words.

                                 CHOIR / ENTIRE CONGREGATION
                        ...wait til the darkness is over, 
                        wait til the tempest is done, hope 
                        for the sunshine tomorrow, after 
                        the shower is gone. 

           INT. CHURCH - BASEMENT - DAY

           Alice, Nance (from the street market) and 6 VOLUNTEER WOMEN 
           sew different sections of a large patchwork quilt.

                                 NANCE
                        Watching the grandkids the other 
                        day, and Ronnie climbs up the 
                        counter to steal a cookie. So I 
                        smack his tush, you know, tell him 
                        “no cookies”. Just now we come down 
                        stairs to the refreshments. I grab 
                        a cookie, then I feel a pat, turn 
                        around- Ronnie whacked my behind, 
                        wagging his finger, “no cookies.”

           She laughs. 

                                 ALICE
                        I remember when he was just a 
                        little thing. Now he’s got eyebrows 
                        and opinions.

                                 NANCE
                        I tell Jody, enjoy it every day. 
                        Trite but true, they grow up fast.

           OVER AT THE REFRESHMENTS

           George sets his cornbread onto the table of assorted snacks. 
           Arnie Wayne ambles up, eyeing the sweets.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Kim got me on this diet- gotta get 
                        my fix here. That looks good.

                                 GEORGE
                        Still warm. Go on, try it.
           He hands Arnie cornbread. He tastes, his face lights up.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        That is good cornbread. Truly good.

           Arnie takes another bite.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Got a tinge of butter in the 
                        center, huh? Moist, tender like 
                        pie. This Abner’s Bakery?

           George shakes his head, points to himself. Arnie, confused.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        You’re actually growing?

                                 GEORGE
                        Harvesting. First time in a decade.

           Arnie smiles, puts his half-eaten piece down.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Good for you, Mr. Vikse. Yeah, 
                        that’s real nice. How many acres?

                                 GEORGE
                        10. But who knows next year. Sold 
                        you that sprawl back in the day but 
                        I still own about 200.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Well, that’d be a serious yield, 
                        Mr. Vikse. Sure would.

           Arnie’s eyes drift elsewhere, he waves at someone O.S.

                                 ARNIE
                        Oughta say hello to Ralph...

           George walks around Arnie, cuts him off on the other side.

                                 GEORGE
                        Thing is, I need a combine.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Oh, Mr. Vikse, I’m getting ready to 
                        harvest myself. 

                                 GEORGE
                        No favors- I’d rent one from you. 

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        I’d help but I’ve got buyers.
                                 GEORGE
                        If I can turn a little profit, show 
                        the bank I got something going- you 
                        tasted it, it’ll sell.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        No, I know it will.

                                 GEORGE
                        Fair price, Arnie.

           Beat.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Let me crunch some numbers, yeah?

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah. Good. Thanks.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

           George pushed his cart past PATRONS around the corner, into 
           an aisle to find Sheriff Brookes, basket full of frozen food.

                                 GEORGE
                        I pick Swanson over Banquet, the 
                        meat is less dry. 

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                             (turns to George)
                        Yeah? Been eating at the station; 
                        Staties got me logging home video 
                        tapes day and night. Swear I 
                        wouldn’t mind the hours if this 
                        thing was making more sense.

                                 GEORGE
                        What’s not adding up?

           Sheriff looks around. They are alone.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        We got the toxicology reports back.

                                 GEORGE
                        How’d they do it. Cyanide? Bleach?

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        Off the record?

                                 GEORGE
                        Sure.
                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        No known cause of death.

           Beat.

                                 GEORGE
                        100 people don’t just drop dead.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        Sure is odd.

                                 GEORGE
                        Odder than odd.

           Alice rounds the corner with her hands full--

                                 ALICE
                        -Found them. Oh, hi Jimmy.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        Alice, look at you. So nice to see 
                        you up and about. Feeling better?

                                 ALICE
                        Oh, yes. Much better.

           Sheriff looks at the jars in her hands: baby food.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        No hard foods yet. Day at a time.

           Sheriff nods.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - CHECKOUT LINE - DAY - LATER

           They wait in line.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re getting good at that.

                                 ALICE
                        What?

                                 GEORGE
                        Lying.

                                 ALICE
                        We didn’t lie.

                                 GEORGE
                        Alice.
                                 ALICE
                        He didn’t ask about Eli.

                                 GEORGE
                        Who? Eli? Oh, your niece’s baby.

           Alice turns and starts loading the conveyor belt. Ahead of 
           them, a CLERK rings up dozens of gallon water jugs. 

           Reveal the customer is ZOOEY, the prologue’s truck driver. 

           Zooey pays, briefly looks back at George as he exits.

           George helps shovel items toward the Clerk.

                                 ALICE
                        I don’t know why, but I’m worried 
                        about him.

                                 GEORGE
                        We’ve only been gone a few hours.

                                 ALICE
                        I miss him.

           George stares out the windows just as the FRESH HILLS FARMS 
           produce truck exits the parking lot blaring classical music.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           George and Alice exit their vehicle and grab groceries from 
           the rear truck bed. Alice stares at their house. It is dark.

                                 ALICE
                        Why aren’t there any lights on?

           MUFFLED CRIES coming from inside.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Darkness. PANICKED SHRIEKS. The front door opens to Alice.

                                 ALICE
                        Eli? 

           Eli wiggles alone on the floor surrounded by broken glass. 
           Alice runs to the infant and nervously cradles him.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        What did they do to you? 

           George arrives, notes broken lamps and shattered bulbs.
                                 GEORGE
                        Cat?...Cat!?

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - BACKYARD - NIGHT 

           George bursts onto the back porch and down the steps.

                                 GEORGE
                        CAT!?...BERCIK!?

           GAGGING NOISES from the barn. George sprints toward it.

           INT. VIKSE BARN - NIGHT

           George enters, his face falls.

                                 GEORGE
                        What the hell...

           Bercik’s body violently convulses, illuminated by lantern.

           Cat, Ronan, and Patrice each hold a different limb. Suddenly 
           his body stops and his eyes roll to the back of his head.

           George watches, helpless. 

           Cat places two fingers in Bercik’s mouth over his tongue.

           Beat. Bercik’s seizure slows.  

           His body settles and then goes limp. His eyes return focus, 
           terrified but present. Ronan and Patrice pray in Polish.

                                 CAT
                        You’re fine...You’re alright now...

           EXT. VIKSE HOUSE - PORCH - NIGHT - LATER

           George sits with Cat on the porch stairs. They each drink. 

                                 CAT
                        We’re all just hanging out singing, 
                        but Eli starts crying and he won’t 
                        stop. Then the lights start 
                        blinking. All of them. Bercik goes 
                        to the fuse box but it zaps him. He 
                        seemed OK but wanted to lay down. 
                        Minute later, they’re all yelling.

                                 GEORGE
                        What were you singing?
                                 CAT
                        Nothing, some hymns. It’s Sunday.

           Cat finishes her drink.

                                 CAT
                        I got 7 little brothers and sisters 
                        and I never heard a baby cry like 
                        that.

           She stands revealing two large duffle bags at her feet.

                                 CAT
                        Sleeping in the barn tonight, in 
                        case he starts again. If you need 
                        me, get the power back on and call.

           George watches her move into the darkness.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Candles are lit around the home. 

           George sweeps the broken bulb glass into a dustpan, discards 
           the shards into a trash bin. Closer on the trash. Bills, junk 
           mail, and a LETTER FROM SOCIAL SERVICES. 

           He hovers over TORN PHOTOS OF YOUNG COUPLES and phrases like 
           “Adoption Applicants” and “Eagerly awaiting your reply.”

           He looks up and peers through a crack in the yellow door into

           THE LIBRARY

           Eli nurses a bottle in Alice’s lap. She sings to him, softly.

                                 ALICE
                        Baby mine, don't you cry
                        Baby mine, dry your eyes...

           George inches closer to the door.

                                 ALICE
                        ...Rest your head close to my heart
                        Never to part, baby of mine--

           -Alice turns. Tight on George’s eyes as she shuts the door. 

           INT. VIKSE FARM - ROOT CELLAR - NIGHT

           Shattered light bulbs are spread out. Reading glasses on, 
           George selects one with tweezers and raises a candle close.
           The filament is burnt to a crisp. 

           He selects another. Ditto. Another--

           -KNOCK! KNOCK! 

           He looks to the stairs and the latched steel doors above.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           The root cellar doors open. George pokes his head out to find 
           no one. Instead, there rests a glass of red wine.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           George enters with the wine to Bing Crosby’s It’s Been A 
           Long, Long Time. Candles burn throughout the house.

                                 GEORGE
                        Found the spare fuses. 

           Alice enters, all done up in a dress and makeup. 

                                 ALICE
                        Took forever but Eli is finally 
                        down for the night.

           She sips from her own wine glass.

                                 GEORGE
                        What number is that?

                                 ALICE
                        I can’t count in the dark.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’ll have the lights on in five.

           He walks toward the kitchen--

                                 ALICE
                        -No.

                                 GEORGE
                        No?

                                 ALICE
                        Dance with me.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m all dirty.
                                 ALICE
                        You’re handsome.

                                 GEORGE
                        I smell.

                                 ALICE
                        I like your smell.

           She grabs his glass, places both on a table.

                                 ALICE
                        Dance with me.

           She slings her arms around his neck. He raises his hands to 
           her waist. They dance.

                                 GEORGE
                        We haven’t done this in a while.

                                 ALICE
                        We haven’t done a lot of things in 
                        a long time.

                                 GEORGE
                        Are you flirting with me?

                                 ALICE
                        It’s called foreplay.

                                 GEORGE
                        You used to be more subtle.

                                 ALICE
                        I’m old and I know what I want.

                                 GEORGE
                        And what exactly do you want?

                                 ALICE
                        I want you...to spin me.

           He smiles, twirls her out and then back into his body.  

                                 ALICE
                        I feel like I’m just now waking up 
                        from an awful dream.

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s been a rough year.

           They sway back and forth. She rests her head on his shoulder.
                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        George? Tell me a secret. 

                                 GEORGE
                        You know all my secrets.

                                 ALICE
                        Then say something romantic.

           Beat.

                                 GEORGE
                        I missed you.

           He smiles, but his eyes have become damp. She pats his cheek.

                                 ALICE
                        I knew that one.

           She leans in and kisses him. Again. Longer. 

           She breaks with a laugh, grabs her wine, moves to the stairs. 
           George follows with a candle.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - 2ND STORY MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           They enter the dark room. He places the candle down.

           George lays Alice down in bed. She sneaks under covers as her 
           blouse comes off. His belt and jeans fall down as he joins 
           her under the sheets, kissing, laughing. Their bodies move 
           into each other--

           -SOUNDS of Baby Eli fussing.

                                 GEORGE
                        You brought the baby up here?

                                 ALICE
                        He’ll stop in a second.

           George resumes kissing Alice. But the baby whimpers. George 
           stops. Alice takes over. Beat. They are back in it until

           Baby Eli breaks into a full on cry. 

                                 ALICE
                             (sitting up)
                        Hold on.

                                 GEORGE
                        Don’t.
                                 ALICE
                        He just wants to be held for a 
                        second, it’s a new room--

                                 GEORGE
                        -Alice. We’re having a nice time.

           She hovers at the edge of the bed. The cries continue.

                                 ALICE
                             (standing)
                        Sorry.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re not sorry.

                                 ALICE
                        George, it’s a baby.

                                 GEORGE
                             (sharp)
                        It’s not your baby.

                                 ALICE
                             (sharper)
                        No. We never had one.

                                 GEORGE
                        We couldn’t.

                                 ALICE
                        We couldn’t?

                                 GEORGE
                        We tried and we couldn’t.

                                 ALICE
                        That’s right, it died. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I don’t want to talk about this.

                                 ALICE
                        Of course you don’t.

                                 GEORGE
                        We get so few good days. 

                                 ALICE
                        You never wanted to talk so we 
                        never talked. 

                                 GEORGE
                        So few. And you want to waste them.
                                 ALICE
                        You never asked me what I wanted 
                        because you knew what I wanted. And 
                        if I said the words out loud, then 
                        it would be real and you would 
                        actually have to deal with it.

                                 GEORGE
                        Go on, pick him up! Finally better 
                        and you want to waste it on a baby.

                                 ALICE
                        Yes! That’s what I want! I’ve 
                        always wanted it--

                                 GEORGE
                        -and I couldn’t give that to you--

                                 ALICE
                        -You wouldn’t consider adopting, 
                        couldn’t fathom it. And I just sat 
                        here, biting my tongue for years, 
                        for what? 

                                 GEORGE
                        But now you’ve changed.

                                 ALICE
                        Yes. And you’re the same; a bitter 
                        old man since you were 30.

                                 GEORGE
                        We’ve had a good life together, I 
                        don’t regret it.

                                 ALICE
                        Lay in a sickbed for a year, then 
                        tell me what you don’t regret.

           Beat. Eli cries louder.

                                 GEORGE
                        I don’t have a lot left to give. I 
                        only got enough in me for you. 

                                 ALICE
                        You’re selfish.

                                 GEORGE
                        I am. I want you for myself.

           Alice reaches into the crib and presses Eli to her shoulder.
                                 ALICE
                        Wanted a baby all my life. Now I 
                        got two.

           Alice turns her back to George. He stares at Baby Eli.

           EXT. WAYNE FARM - UTILITY BARN - DAWN

           Light leaks across the sky above a massive commercial 
           cornfield. Golden stalks sway in the wind.

           Junior and 12 FARMHANDS huddle together outside a large barn 
           smoking or drinking from thermoses. Arnie Wayne enters frame.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Morning boys. You all clock in?

                                 ALL
                        Yeah...yep...yessir.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Clock in, then right off to work 
                        with a cigarette break.

           He winks and smiles. Some laughter. He looks at Junior, a 
           white stick pokes out of his mouth.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE (CONT’D)
                         You smoke now too?

           Junior withdraws a lollipop. Arnie laughs.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Alright fellas, Gerald’s got the 
                        keys. My East boys know what 
                        they’re doing. West company, we got 
                        two combines placed, Tad’s driving 
                        the third out there now. Radio me 
                        for bathroom breaks- no shitting in 
                        the corn please, we don’t fertilize 
                        again til after harvest. Alright? 
                        Alright, let’s have a good day. 

           He claps and the men spread toward the corn, moving past 
           mills, grain trucks, and tractors.

           Arnie follows Junior toward the stalks.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        You eating with the boys or you 
                        want lunch with mommy and me?
                                 JUNIOR
                        What’s Mom making?

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Good question. I’ll radio you.

           Arnie halts. CAMERA continues with Junior into

           THE COMMERCIAL CORNFIELD

           He is dwarfed by the 8-foot tall corn as he trudges deeper 
           through the shadowed rows, swiping stalks from his face...

           ...sixth row...seventh row...eighth row...

           A NOISE.

           Junior stops. Beat.

           ANOTHER SOUND.

           He turns to

           SOMETHING WHITE AND RED IN THE DISTANCE. 

           Junior looks around but he is alone. Beat. He walks deeper 
           into the thicket, toward the object. Faster. Closer. 

           His face contorts in disgust as he reaches A BLOODY ROBE. 
           Junior kneels to the cloth--

           -SOUNDS OF WHIMPERING FROM THE NEXT ROW.

           Junior inches forward and parts the corn stalks to reveal

           Martha, the prologue’s gunshot victim, curled up. Her hands 
           pressed to the recent wound around her hips. Reveal the 
           prologue is chronologically this point in our story.

           Martha looks up, weakly raises a finger to her lips.

                                 MARTHA
                        Shhh.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIBRARY - DAY

           The yellow door opens and Cat enters.

                                 CAT
                        Want me to draw your bath or--

           She stops to find George alone in the sick bed. He wakes.
                                 CAT
                        Where’d your wife sleep?

           He fumbles for his mug and points up. 

           Cat nods, turns to a strip of wallpaper peeling off the wall. 

                                 CAT (CONT’D)
                        I called the agency this morning, 
                        just to see if they had anything.

           He opens his mouth to speak, but decides on a sip instead.

                                 CAT
                        They did. And you know Alice is 
                        better but now it’s babies and sick 
                        workers...things here are strange. 

           Beat. Cat wants a reaction.

                                 GEORGE
                        When do you leave? 

                                 CAT
                        I didn’t say I took the job.

                                 GEORGE
                        But you want to.

                                 CAT
                        ...Yeah.

                                 GEORGE
                        Then go.

           Beat. Cat backs away, reaches for the door.

                                 CAT
                        Ok. Then I will. As soon as the 
                        farmhands are better.

                                 GEORGE
                        They’re sick?

                                 CAT
                        They all got the flu or something.

           The door shuts, causing the strip of wallpaper to peel more. 
           He stares at an older, yellow paint on the wall beneath.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - GOAT PEN - DAY

           George, mud-stained, wrestles a goat into a head gate by its 
           horns. He sits on a stool and milks with one hand while he 
           drinks his mug with the other. He looks down into the pail.

           Blood.

           George looks up to the house in the distance where familiar 
           PIANO SOUNDS leak Baby Eli’s Lullaby.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Alice plays the piano as Baby Eli tries to inch his body 
           toward her. She cheers him on.

                                 ALICE
                        Come on, you can do it! Come on...

           Eli crawls on the rug, past the TV NEWS. Closer on the 
           screen: NEWS ANCHOR talks beside a photo of Martha.

                                 TV NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)

                        members of the Rising People’s 
                        Temple, from an underground silo 
                        meant for storing grains, used for

                        may be armed and dangerous. 

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           Cases of goat milk bounce harshly in the back of George’s 
           pick up truck as he drunkenly swerves across the dirt road.

           INT. / EXT. GEORGE'S TRUCK - DAY

           George refills his mug from a pint of moonshine. He drinks.
           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

           A SMALL CROWD stands beside a CAMERAMAN and a FIELD REPORTER 
           pointing mics at Arnie Wayne and Junior.

                                 FIELD REPORTER 1
                        Did she say anything else when you 
                        found her?

                                 JUNIOR
                        No. She was hurt bad and spooked 
                        even worse. 

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        She was pretty incoherent. 
                        Brainwashed far as I could tell.

           Field Reporter whispers to the Cameraman; he stops rolling.

                                 FIELD REPORTER 1
                        Ok, thank you. Thanks a lot.

                                 JUNIOR
                        You said Six O’Clock News? 

                                 FIELD REPORTER 1
                        Yes, sir. You’ll be on the TV then.

                                 CORN VENDOR RUSSELL (O.S)
                        Oh you boys is famous now!

           Junior and Arnie Wayne turn, walk toward Corn Vendor Russell. 

           George watches from the back of his truck, tracing Arnie 
           through the CROWD OF SHOPPERS. He sips his mug and stands. 

                                 CORN VENDOR RUSSELL (CONT’D)
                        Shoulda worn a Wayne Farms shirt in 
                        that interview. Product placement.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE

                        your advisory services around town,

                                 CORN VENDOR RUSSELL
                        Yep. For a thousand bucks you can 
                        call me advisor. For a million, 
                        I’ll let you call me daddy!

           They laugh as George arrives, but stumbles and falls.

                                 CORN VENDOR RUSSELL (CONT’D)
                        Woah there, George.
                                 GEORGE
                        Shut your mouth, Russell.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        You OK?

           George is visibly drunk. Arnie and Junior help him up.

                                 GEORGE
                        Fine. 

                                 CORN VENDOR RUSSELL
                        That’s one word for it.

                                 GEORGE
                        Can I talk to you? 

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Sure, Mr. Vikse. Let’s talk.

           Arnie places a hand on George, guides him back to his stand.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        You sure you’re alright?

                                 GEORGE
                        Fine. I’m uh, I’m coming up on 
                        peak. I wanna know if I can count 
                        on you or not?

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Let’s get you a seat first, huh?

                                 GEORGE
                        I just need to rent one combine. 
                        All I need is a yes or a no.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Mr. Vikse, let’s sit you down--

                                 GEORGE
                        -Well, is it a yes or a no?

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Your liable to hurt yourself--

                                 GEORGE
                        -Just answer the damn question!

           They stop.
                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not stupid! I’m not a stupid 
                        man. I see how you do that to 
                        people. I got eyes.

            Only Arnie notices as some patrons turn, quiet down.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        What do I do, Mr. Vikse?

                                 GEORGE
                        Nothing! Talk but you say nothing. 
                        You smile and it means nothing! 

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        I never promised you a combine. 
                        Never said that.

                                 GEORGE
                        Your father and me, we were good 
                        friends, we got history--

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        -My daddy liked you very much, but 
                        I own the farm now.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m a friend, Arnie. 

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Of course, Mr. Vikse. But you 
                        harvest corn and you’re also a 
                        competitor.

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s horse shit! That’s not how 
                        you were raised. 

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        You’re not my father, Mr. Vikse. 
                        You’re no one’s father.

           Arnie turns away, back toward the corn stand. The frozen 
           crowd slowly thaws back to life. From a distance, Junior 
           stares at George. Beat. George turns away.

           INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE - DAY

           Sheriff Brookes wears oversized headphones at a tube TV in 
           the back corner of a cramped, open-plan office. His eyes 
           drift to 3 FBI AGENTS across the room, talking.

           SECRETARY (50s) approaches with paperwork and VHS tapes.
                                 SECRETARY
                        Audio goes in and out but I typed 
                        up transcripts best I could. Mostly 
                        preaching. Some weapons training 
                        too.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        Alright, thanks.

                                 SECRETARY (CONT’D)
                        Then there’s this one. I started 
                        it, but I couldn’t.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        What’s on it?

           She shakes her head, places it on his desk and walks away.

           Sheriff stares at the VHS tape. Long Beat. He looks around. 
           Then, cautiously, he enters it into the deck. 

           Closer on the TV as a dark, grainy image appears: candle 
           light illuminates a NUDE WOMAN laying on the ground, crying. 

           Sheriff again looks around and adjusts the monitor. 

           Back to the TV: zoom out to reveal this is MARTHA and she is 
           pregnant. Wider still, she lays on the floor surrounded by 
           MALE ONLOOKERS, her limbs each gripped by FEMALE HELPERS. 

           Suddenly, everyone points. Camera pans to see the LUMP IN HER 
           STOMACH ABRUPTLY SHIFT. 

           The Sheriff leans toward the monitor to see--

           MARTHA BEGINS TO LEVITATE OFF THE GROUND AS THE CANDLES 
           SPONTANEOUSLY FLAME OUT AND THE VIDEO GOES BLACK. 

           Sheriff Brookes raises the volume to its maximum. His 
           headphones leak SOUNDS OF A WHISPER CHANT and then... 

           A NEWBORN BABY CRYING.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - DAY

           Rain falls on the corn. Violent gusts of wind bend the stalks 
           to reveal the Vikse Home as George parks his truck and exits 
           with a crate of milk and meat.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           George enters the quiet house and wipes his wet boots.
                                 GEORGE
                        Alice?

           He looks upstairs. But turns to SOUNDS OF STATIC from

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Empty. George places the crate on the table and looks down 
           the hall at the yellow door. He steps forward but halts-- 

           -STATIC SOUNDS. A baby monitor receiver rests on the counter. 

           George turns the volume up. Faint, static-ridden noises 
           crystallize into SOUNDS OF DRESSER DRAWER RUMMAGING. 

           Suddenly, the yellow door bursts open. Cat stops surprised to 
           see George. She continues, hands full of pill bottles. 

                                 GEORGE
                        You found batteries for these?

                                 CAT
                             (approaches, whispers)
                        Shhhh. They’re napping upstairs.

           Cat arrives in the kitchen, places the pills on the counter. 

                                 CAT (CONT’D)
                        Found batteries and playing cards, 
                        a gold earring, and every kind of 
                        pill in the world except Motrin. 

           He opens a drawer, withdraws a near empty bottle of Motrin.

                                 CAT (CONT’D)
                        Is that all? 

                                 GEORGE
                        You going into surgery?

                                 CAT
                        Bercik, Ronan, and Patrice all have 
                        fevers. I mean bad- 102, 103. What 
                        was in that pesticide?

                                 GEORGE
                        I don’t know. Nothing harmful.

                                 CAT
                        It’s pesticide.

                                 GEORGE
                        Everybody uses that stuff. 
                                 CAT
                        Without gloves and masks?

           She grabs the Motrin and turns to the back door.

                                 GEORGE
                        That was weeks ago, that’s not it.

                                 CAT
                        Oh no? Then what?

           Cat exits into the pouring rain toward the barn. 

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - GOAT PEN - DUSK

           The storm continues. Under the pen’s tin roof a kid goat 
           sucks milk from its mother. She licks its wet fur dry.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Prescription bottles read “Alice Vikse”. Pills line the 
           counter. BANG! A pot crushes them until only dust remains.

           George brushes the grounds into a glass of ice tea and stirs. 
           The baby monitor comes to life with WHISPERING. 

           He lowers the volume and looks down the dark hall.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           He quietly approaches the yellow door.

           SOUNDS OF A FOREIGN LANGUAGE grow louder as he spots a shadow 
           rocking under the doorway. Closer, he hears

           ALICE SPEAKING. It sounds like Latin. 

           George, confused, pushes the yellow door open to

           THE LIBRARY

           Baby Eli nurses a bottle on Alice’s lap. She opens her eyes.

                                 GEORGE
                        Were you sleeping?

                                 ALICE
                        I’m not sure.

                                 GEORGE
                        I heard you talking.
                                 ALICE
                        Sleep-talking?

                                 GEORGE
                        Sounded like Latin.

                                 ALICE
                        I don’t speak Latin.

                                 GEORGE
                        No, you don’t.

           He turns to see the wallpaper has peeled even more, exposing 
           an elephant decal atop a yellow wall.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Alice, you know, last night. I, uh, 
                        I don’t want to make you upset. 
                        Never. And I did. I guess I have 
                        for some time--

                                 ALICE
                        --No, George, I haven’t been 
                        sleeping well with the baby...

                                 GEORGE
                        ...Yeah.

                                 ALICE
                        Yeah. 

           The baby coos. They both turn to see happy Baby Eli. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        George, he’s smiling at you.

                                 GEORGE
                        I see. Hello there.

                                 ALICE
                        He likes your voice. 

           Baby Eli continues to stare, babbles.

                                 BABY ELI
                        Mmmm-baahhhh-daaaaaa.

                                 ALICE
                        You want to hold him?

                                 GEORGE
                        My hands are all wet. Here.

           George offers his wife the iced tea.
                                 ALICE
                        You can rock him to sleep?

                                 GEORGE
                        Not tonight.

                                 ALICE
                        If you held him, I know you’d like 
                        it. You can feel what he feels.

           George approaches Eli. But instead kisses Alice’s head.

                                 GEORGE
                        He looks content.

           As George exits, he turns to see Alice sip her ice tea. 
           George smiles and shuts the door.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

           Curtains move as wind blows through an open window.

           George sits on the couch, hunched over a dominos game of 
           solitaire on the coffee table. He drinks from his mug. 

           SOUNDS OF ELI CRYING via baby monitor receiver.

           Frustrated, George lowers the volume. But the cries continue 
           to echo from upstairs. 

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - 2ND STORY MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The door creaks open, spreading light across Alice, deep in 
           sleep. The empty iced tea glass rests on the nightstand.

           George turns to Eli crying in his crib, hands outstretched.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           George puts a bottle of milk in the microwave. He sits Eli 
           upright on the counter. Thunder clap. The baby cries as a 
           gust of wind sends curtains in the next room flying. 

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re alright. You’re fine. It’s 
                        the wind. It’s just the wind.

           George opens the microwave then sucks the bottle himself. 
           Warm enough, he hands the milk to Eli who drinks.
                                 GEORGE
                        Good? Good.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           George places Baby Eli in a walker at the edge of the table 
           with a view of the open window. He resumes his dominos game.

                                 BABY ELI
                        Mmmbbaa...baaaa...mmma.

                                 GEORGE
                        Really?

                                 BABY ELI
                        Ba-mmmmmm...abbaabba...mmmb!

                                 GEORGE
                        Fascinating. 

           Eli stretches across the table and grabs a domino. George 
           takes it back and moves all pieces out of Eli’s reach.

                                 GEORGE
                        Solitaire. Means only I play.

           George considers his next move and sips his mug.

           Eli reaches out again until he can go no further, but his 
           tiny fingers are still too far away. Suddenly

           THE DOMINO SLIDES ACROSS THE TABLE ALL BY ITSELF...

           George turns, watches it move

           ...INTO BABY ELI’S HAND.

           George, shocked.

                                 BABY ELI
                        Mmbbbba...bbb-ba.

           He gently grabs the domino from Eli and places it on the 
           table where it had been. Then he drags it even further back.

           Eli grows disgruntled.

                                 GEORGE
                        Do that again. 

           The baby extends his hand once more. 

           George turns to the domino.
           Long beat.

           The domino remains static. Eli finally lowers his hand.

           George reaches for the unmoved piece, but as he nears it... 
           the wind howls and furiously blows the curtains--

           -THE DOMINO SLIDES ACROSS THE TABLE AND INTO BABY ELI’S GRIP.

           George darts up onto his feet, spooked as the wind continues 
           to knock stray papers onto the floor. 

           Eli nibbles on the domino. George approaches the whipping 
           curtains. But as he nears the window, the wind stops.

           He shuts the window. Hold on the view outside of the barn.

           INT. VIKSE BARN - 2ND STORY - NIGHT

           A crucifix hangs on the wall above Cat, asleep on a futon. 
           Her breathing body moves in and out of shadows.

           CREAK.

           Her eyes open. She slowly turns to the dark hallway. Empty. 
           Cat returns to her sleeping position. Beat. Behind her,

           A SILHOUETTE RACES DOWN THE HALL.

           She whips around.

                                 CAT
                        ...Bercik?

           Cat grabs a match and lights the lantern at her side. She 
           stands toward the hallway.

           She slowly steps forward with the light to reveal

           A POOL OF BLOOD ON THE HALLWAY FLOOR.

           Cat hovers, concerned. She directs the light over the puddle 
           and bends closer to a reflection there. Beat. It moves.

                                 CAT (CONT’D)
                        What the--

           -ANOTHER FIGURE SPRINTS RIGHT PAST HER.

           Cat swings the lantern but it is too dark to see the end of 
           the hallway where A DISTANT DOOR SLAMS. Beat.
           Cat, still crouched, nervously shifts the lantern down to see 
           a trail of blood drops on the floor.

                                 CAT (CONT’D)
                        Ronan? Patrice?...you alright?

           Cat rises, frightened. 

           Barefoot, she slowly traces the red splatter to the end of 
           the corridor. She stops. The trail continues under a door.

                                 CAT (CONT’D)
                        Somebody in there?

           She knocks. Beat.

           Cat opens the door to

           THE BATHROOM

           Bercik, pale, sweaty, bloodshot eyes, stares at himself in 
           the mirror. Cat steps forward, unnoticed.

           Then Bercik’s mouth opens. 

                                 CAT (CONT’D)
                        You feeling ok?

           His mouth opens wider until BLOOD OOZES OUT.

           Bercik bends to the sink. Reveal Ronan and Patrice behind; 
           both sick, hovering over the tub and toilet respectively. 
           They turn, exposing their own bloody mouths.

           Cat, terrified.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Headlights move throughout the house and across sleeping Eli.

           HONK! HONK! HONK! HONKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!

           George stands, runs to the front door as the baby wakes.

           EXT. VIKSE HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           The rain has stopped. George runs out of the house rattled as 
           Cat opens her car door and stands.

                                 GEORGE
                        I just put the baby down.
                                 CAT
                        Something’s wrong! Their fevers 
                        won’t quit and now there’s blood!

                                 GEORGE
                        Blood?

                                 CAT
                        Coughing it up- they need a doctor. 
                        Headed to Isham. I’ll call you!

           Cat gets back in the car and takes off. George watches the 
           farmhands, in the way back seat, recede into the night.

           He turns to his home and through the window sees Eli crying. 
           The child notices George and softens.

           INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE - DAY

           Sheriff sits up in his chair opposite an unseen couple.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        This must be an impossible time for 
                        you, I can only imagine. I’ve had 
                        dozens of such meetings and it 
                        doesn’t get easier. Now, in order 
                        to verify the dead you’ll excuse me 
                        as I ask you some questions.

           He picks up a clipboard, reads.

                        About 2 feet. Maybe 20 pounds.

           Sheriff looks up. Reveal this is Zooey. He sits beside BETTY 
           (18), quiet and robotic.

                                 ZOOEY
                        Her baby is almost 7 months now.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - DAY

           Hold on the corn, dancing in the breeze. Crows scatter as a 
           WOODEN CROSS DRAPED WITH A CLOTH rises up over the crops.

           DEEP IN THE CORN 

           George nails a stake into the dirt. He sighs, grabs another 
           12’ tall wooden cross and heads further into the thicket.

           LATER

           Wider. Another poor-man’s scarecrow is erected in the 
           distance. There is one every 50 yards.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Prescription pills are lined up on the counter. BAM. A pot 
           crushes them until only dust remains.

           George gathers the grounds into a glass of ice tea and stirs. 
           The baby monitor bursts to life with Chopin’s 12 Etudes, 
           Op.10: Etude No.3 in E Major. 

           George lowers the volume and looks down the hall.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The yellow door. Fast approaching.

           George’s silhouette moves closer and closer to the tiny crack 
           from which the music emanates.

           Tight on his eyes, arriving. A slit of light hits his face. 
           Beat. He can hear the SOUNDS OF HIS WIFE HUMMING.

           He pushes the door open, but instead of the Library he sees

           A NURSERY

           Bright, fresh, yellow painted walls with decals of elephants. 
           George, confused, approaches the rocking chair where Alice 
           cradles a still unseen Baby Eli draped in a long 1940s gown.

                                 GEORGE
                        Alice?

           Alice turns to reveal 

           SHE IS BREASTFEEDING BABY ELI.

                                 ALICE
                        ...he’s hungry.

           Baby Eli releases from her nipple. A stream of blood runs. 
           George’s face falls into shock.

           Eli starts to choke. Louder, harsher. His lips part as

           AN INSECT CRAWLS OUT ONTO HIS CHIN AND FLIES AT GEORGE.

           She smiles unaware. George can only point at Eli’s mouth as

           MORE BUGS POUR OUT OF THE INFANT’S MOUTH: LOCUSTS.

           They fly all around the room. George swats away the plague, 
           walking backwards into

           BLACK SPACE

           Through the swarm, George sees the yellow door suddenly slam 
           shut. Tight on him, furiously flailing his hands until 

           EXT. VIKSE HOUSE - PORCH - DAY

           George wakes is his chair, one hand on his mug resting on his 
           wet crotch. He looks up, surprised to see Arnie Wayne.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        You piss yourself, Mr. Vikse?

           Beat.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m not that old, not yet. Spilled--

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        -I saw. Spilled your drink. 

                                 GEORGE
                        How long you been watching me?
                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Just now arrived. 
                             (smells)
                        Plum?

                                 GEORGE
                        Muscadine grape. 

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Daddy used to make his liquor with 
                        cherries. Tasted awful.

                                 GEORGE
                        Why are you here, Arnie?

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        So you can apologize.

           Beat. George nods.

                                 GEORGE
                        I was drinking and, well, I’ve been 
                        acting a little funny lately.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        You and everything else.

           Arnie tosses him an ear of corn.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        We reaped half my acres, then this.

           George peels the husk back to reveal BLACK, INFECTED KERNELS. 

                                 GEORGE
                        How bad is it?

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Spreading east. Victor’s been hit, 
                        Russell too. You don’t have them 
                        yet if that’s what you’re asking. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Your surprisingly calm.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Insurance will help. Kicks in when 
                        I burn a shelter-belt around my 
                        property, help stop the spread. 

                                 GEORGE
                        When’s the fire?
                                 ARNIE WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Tonight. I’ll burn my perimeter, 
                        all along the edge there. Maybe 
                        harvest the rest as salvage grain--

           -MUFFLED SOUNDS of the BABY O.S from the house. Arnie turns.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        ...You still got that baby?

                                 GEORGE
                        No.

           Beat. The O.S CRIES slowly die.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        When Arnold found that girl, we’re 
                        waiting for the ambulance and she 
                        just keeps repeating how she has to 
                        warn everyone. So I ask her, warn 
                        us about what?...a child.  

           George stares, unblinking. Arnie finally laughs.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Batshit crazy, I tell you.

           George feigns a smile. 

           Arnie looks to the house. He slowly raises his hand, waving. 
           George turns. 

           Alice appears in the window, rocking Baby Eli.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, you been acting real funny 
                        lately, Mr. Vikse.

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m fine.

           Arnie nods, turns.

                                 ARNIE WAYNE
                        Watch out for the fire, Mr. Vikse.

           Arnie exits around the side of the house. George looks into 
           his mug- some liquid still left. He tosses it over the porch.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Alice holds Baby Eli’s arms as he bounces up on his feet in 
           front of Sesame Street. Then he falls.
                                 ALICE
                        Uh oh. It’s OK. Up again. Up, up.

           George enters, sullen.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t come to bed last night.

           He sits on the couch nearby.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        You OK?

                                 GEORGE
                        Didn’t sleep well. Bad dream.

                                 ALICE
                        You remember it?

           Beat. George watches Eli bounce.

                                 GEORGE
                        No. You have any?

                                 ALICE
                        One. We’re younger in the dream, me 
                        and you. And Eli’s there, except 
                        he’s older. We walk in the dark and 
                        you keep humming a song. But you’re 
                        both faster and I fall back in the 
                        dark. So I just follow the song.

                                 GEORGE
                        Sounds scary.

                                 ALICE
                        It wasn’t.

           Eli stares. George cover his face. Beat. He removes his hands 
           to reveal a smile. Eli giggles. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        You’re good at that.

                                 GEORGE
                        Nobody’s bad at peek-a-boo.

                                 ALICE
                        You make him smile, George. He 
                        loves you.

                                 GEORGE
                        Love is a big word for a baby.
                                 ALICE
                        Actually, it’s a perfectly sized 
                        word.

           George forces a smile and stands again. Alice grabs Eli.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Gonna take a nap?

                                 GEORGE
                        Might go the other way, make some 
                        coffee. You want any?

                                 ALICE
                        No thanks. We’re going for a walk. 

           She stops and rests her head against his face, long enough 
           for him to kiss her forehead. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Cat called. They have to stay 
                        another night at the hospital... 
                        I’m sure they’ll be fine.

           George nods, unconvinced. Alice exits onto the back porch.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           George fills the kettle and places it on the stove. 

           He peers out the back window to see the goats gather as Alice 
           and Eli pass by. The goats SCREAM- a chorus of screeches.

           Alice and Eli keep walking and disappear into the cornfield.

           SOUNDS OF A CAR O.S.

           INT. VIKSE FARM HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           George reaches for the remote and turns off Sesame Street. 
           But the CAR SOUNDS continue to rise.

           He turns to the front window to see a POLICE CAR pull up. 

           George looks at the mirror, observes himself. Beat.

           KNOCK KNOCK.

           INT. / EXT. VIKSE HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY

           George opens the door to Sheriff Brookes. 
                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        Hi George.

                                 GEORGE
                        Jimmy. 

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        I spoke to the hospital. I know 
                        you’ve got the baby. And that’s 
                        fine- you’re not in trouble. 

           Beat. 

           George sees Zooey and Betty hovering by the cruiser.

                                 GEORGE
                        Who are they?

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        These folks are his real parents.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES (CONT’D)
                        They left that group shortly after 
                        their baby was born, but they’re 
                        still sort of free spirits. They 
                        just now heard about the whole 
                        catastrophe. May we come in?

           George opens the door wider. Sheriff waves at the couple.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Betty, Zooey, and Sheriff all sit. 

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        George, this is Zooey and Betty.

                                 GEORGE
                        Nice to meet you folks.

                                 ZOOEY
                             (looking around)
                        You have a large home.

                                 GEORGE
                        It does the job.

           George tidies up near his chair, clearing toys, baby shoes.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        To cut right to it, George, these 
                        folks would like their son back. 
           Beat. George stares at the odd couple.

                                 GEORGE
                        Well...I have to say this is 
                        somewhat of a relief. For me. I 
                        imagine Alice will take it hard.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        Is Alice home?

           CREAK.

           Everyone turns to the noise. But the room is empty.

                                 GEORGE
                        She went for a walk.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        I see. Is the baby here?

           Betty will not make eye contact. Zooey will not look away.

                                 GEORGE
                        Baby’s with Alice. Unsure when 
                        they’ll be back. 

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        I see.

           SOUNDS of the O.S. kettle humming.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES (CONT’D)
                        Now, the media still doesn’t know 
                        about the baby and I think we’d all 
                        like to keep it that way, frankly. 
                        Perhaps tomorrow, you all can come 
                        down to the station?

           KETTLE HISSING. Zooey, unblinking.

                                 GEORGE
                        Of course. I think that would be 
                        decent, to have the night, let 
                        Alice say goodbye. Pack up, these 
                        toys and such. Clothes. You should 
                        have them...

           KETTLE SCREECHES. George stands.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me. 
           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Steam pummels the window. George enters, turns the burner 
           off. The whistling dies.

           He wipes fog away from the glass and peers out into his 
           backyard. He searches but cannot see Alice or Eli anywhere.

           George turns back.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           He rounds the corner to find--

           Alice and Baby Eli standing in the living room.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        Good timing after all. 

           George slowly approaches the group once more.

                                 ALICE
                        You’re here for Eli?

                                 ZOOEY
                        Armon.

           Everyone turns to Zooey.

                                 ZOOEY (CONT’D)
                        His name is Armon.

           George sits. Alice follows. Eli squirms in her arms, unhappy.

                                 ALICE
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were 
                        coming...
                             (to George)
                        Did you?

                                 GEORGE
                        No.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        Didn’t mean to barge in, Alice.

                                 ALICE
                        No, of course not.
                             (to Betty)
                        You must’ve been worried sick, I 
                        can’t imagine.

           Alice repositions Eli to face Betty.
                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Would you like to hold him?

           Betty looks to Zooey. Long Beat. Baby Eli starts to pout. 
           Alice notes their hesitation and looks to George, confused.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Why didn’t you come searching for 
                        your son until now?

                                 ZOOEY
                        We were traveling and just heard 
                        the news.. We want to thank you and 
                        your husband for you grace and your 
                        compassion. For feeding and 
                        clothing and loving this child as 
                        you clearly do. You’re kind people. 

           Zooey outstretches his hands. Baby Eli whimpers. 

                                 ZOOEY (CONT’D)
                        May I?

           Alice sighs. She starts to extend Baby Eli toward him. But 
           George blocks the handoff. Alice looks at her husband.

                                 GEORGE
                        You confirmed the medical records 
                        and all that then, Jimmy?

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES 
                        The baby wasn’t born in a hospital.

                                 ZOOEY
                        We don’t believe in doctors.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        They corroborated details about the 
                        commune there, and a description of 
                        the child the hospital had.

           George cracks a smile. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Short, bald, chubby’s not exactly 
                        unique as far as babies go.

                                 ZOOEY
                        You don’t believe us?

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s not about belief, I’d just 
                        feel better with some proof. 
                                 BETTY
                        We thought they killed him.

           Zooey raises his hand and Betty quiets. Alice watches, 
           uncomfortable. 

                                 ZOOEY
                        Armon is 7 months and 20 days old 
                        today. He loves music. It’s the 
                        only thing that ever truly settles 
                        him. He has an awful cry and it can 
                        be quite deafening.

                                 GEORGE
                        Babies cry. Babies like music.

                                 ZOOEY
                        There is a mark, a cross, carved on 
                        the back of his right thigh.

           Sheriff looks at Alice. She slowly nods, affirming.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        Ok. That’s something.

                                 GEORGE
                        Carved?

                                 ZOOEY
                        Armon has abilities. Very special 
                        and extremely powerful. He is a 
                        divine empath; he can feel what 
                        others feel. He can also manipulate 
                        things with his mind.

           Beat. Sheriff, shocked, looks to George. He turns to Alice. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Eli’s just a baby. He babbles and 
                        cries and shits. That’s all.

                                 ZOOEY
                             (to Alice)
                        You’ve seen it.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        I, uh, I think that the next step, 
                        given the high profile nature of 
                        recent events, would be to 
                        administer a blood test. 

                                 ZOOEY
                        That takes weeks.
                                 BETTY
                        You don’t understand, we’re trying 
                        to help you.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        We’ll settle this whole thing as 
                        soon as humanly possible. OK?

           Zooey stares at George. Beat. 

           Then he breaks into a smile and stands, prompting Betty and 
           Sheriff Brookes to do the same. 

                                 ZOOEY
                        Fine. We’ll have Armon back soon.

           Alice holds Baby Eli tight. She remains seated as George 
           stands and sees the visitors to the front door.  

           INT. / EXT. VIKSE HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY

           Sheriff leads Betty down the stairs toward the police car.

                                 SHERIFF BROOKES
                        Thank you, George. We’ll talk soon.

           Sheriff Brookes mouths the words sorry to George as he goes. 
           Zooey lags behind and grabs George’s hand.

                                 ZOOEY
                        The end of something is better than 
                        its beginning. Patience is better 
                        than pride. Ecclesiastes 7:8.

           George pulls his hand away. Zooey turns. George shuts the 
           door and locks it. He turns to Alice.

                                 ALICE
                        What kind of mama won’t hold her 
                        own child?

           George shakes his head and stares at Baby Eli.

           EXT. WAYNE FARMS - COMMERCIAL CORNFIELD - DUSK 

           On the distant horizon, a group of silhouettes gather 
           together in a field, raising hands to relay a signal.

           Suddenly, they spread out as FIRE ignites, engulfing rows of 
           corn. A plume of smoke climbs up through the purple sky.
           EXT. VIKSE FARM HOUSE - PORCH - NIGHT

           George watches the fire spread from his porch, rifle in hand. 
           SOUNDS of Baby Eli’s Lullaby from inside.

           INT. VIKSE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           George enters and locks the door behind him. He tucks his 
           rifle back under the stairwell.

           He sits and watches Alice play the piano. She starts a new 
           song, Chopin’s Nocturne in D-Flat Major Op.27 No.2.

           Baby Eli yawns in his walker.

                                 ALICE
                        You’re not drinking tonight.

                                 GEORGE
                        Cutting back. Why?

                                 ALICE
                        I wouldn’t mind some. 

                                 GEORGE
                        My nerves are a little shot too.

                                 ALICE
                        I don’t trust those people.

                                 GEORGE
                        Me either.

           Beat. She continues playing, but softer.

                                 ALICE
                        We don’t have to give Eli back.

                                 GEORGE
                        If he’s theirs we do.

                                 ALICE
                        Some parents shouldn’t be parents. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Even bastards got rights, Alice. 
                        This was always temporary.

           She stops. Eli has fallen asleep.

                                 ALICE
                        But it doesn’t have to be. We can 
                        fight. 
                                 GEORGE
                        I’m not saying I like it.

                                 ALICE
                        We can hire a lawyer, a good one.

                                 GEORGE
                        To do what?

                                 ALICE
                        Our name’s on those guardian forms. 

           Alice grabs the sleeping child. They walk to the yellow door.

                                 GEORGE
                        OK.

                                 ALICE
                        OK?

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah.

                                 ALICE
                        Yes?

                                 GEORGE
                        Yes. We hire a big expensive 
                        lawyer, three piece suit, and we 
                        hustle up and back to court for 
                        months and months until Eli’s ours. 
                        And then what? We’re 70 with a 
                        baby. You’re still sick.

           They continue into

           THE LIBRARY

           Alice lays Eli down in the crib.

                                 ALICE
                        I’m better.

                                 GEORGE
                        Maybe. Maybe you really are. OK, 
                        then what? How much time we got 
                        left, 10 years? We’ll be 80 and 
                        he’ll still be a boy...

           She stares at the sleeping baby.
                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        ...20 years? We’ll be 90 when he’s 
                        done school. How long? My mother 
                        died at 46. My daddy at 50. 

           George moves to the open window by the baby, shuts it. 

           Alice grabs the baby monitor and stops at the doorway.

                                 ALICE
                        I love him, George.

           Alice stares. Beat. She softly closes the door. Back into

           THE LIVING ROOM

                                 GEORGE
                        What would happen to Eli if we go?

                                 ALICE
                        Old is better than crazy.

                                 GEORGE
                        Alice.

           She shuts off one lamp and the room falls darker.

                                 ALICE
                        You can’t plan 20 years. You take 
                        one step forward, one, and you 
                        trust there’s a second. If I waited 
                        until I felt ready for anything, I 
                        would’ve done shit with my life. 
                        And damn it, I want this. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I know you do.

                                 ALICE
                        Maybe...we were chosen.

           Beat. Alice hovers by the only remaining lamp.

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s just something broken people 
                        say when they have to endure.

                                 ALICE
                        I’d rather be delusional and still 
                        feel something.

           She turns off the second lamp; the room goes dark, revealing 
           SEVERAL WOMEN IN PRAIRIE DRESSES OUTSIDE THEIR HOME.
           Neither George or Alice see as they approach the stairwell. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I think it’s been a long day and we 
                        both need some sleep.

           BABY MONITOR STATIC SOUNDS as Alice follows George upstairs.

           Then BABY ELI CRYING leaks over the monitor. 

           Alice stops. George’s feet continue climbing.

                                 ALICE
                        I thought he was down.

                                 GEORGE (O.S)
                        Gotta let him cry himself to sleep.

           Alice’s feet reluctantly continue up and out of view.

           SOUNDS OF THE BABY CRYING GROW LOUDER. 

           Long beat.

                                 ALICE (O.S)
                        I’ll be right back.

                                 GEORGE (O.S)
                        Leave him, Alice.

           Alice descends back into view. She crosses through the living 
           room and opens the yellow door to

           THE LIBRARY

           Alice freezes. 

           Curtains blow from the open window that had just been closed. 
           She turns to CRYING coming from the shadows.

           ZOOEY STANDS OVER BABY ELI.

                                 ALICE
                        Are you a dream?

           Beat. 

           She inches closer to the crib, toward a frightened Zooey.

           BANG!

           A wound forms below Alice’s naval, staining her nightgown. 
           She staggers back against the door. 
           Zooey lowers his revolver, shocked himself.

           Suddenly, two arms enter through the window. It is Betty.

                                 BETTY
                        Grab it!

           Zooey snaps back to life and peers into the crib where Baby 
           Eli screams.

           Alice cannot hold herself any longer and slides down against 
           the doorframe to reveal-- 

           George, behind in the living room. He raises his rifle.

           BANG!

           He aims high, away from Eli. Zooey flinches. Betty ducks.

           BANG!

           Zooey retreats further away from the crib. He fumbles for his 
           own gun but is scared by George’s third gunshot. BANG! Zooey 
           jumps out of the window.

           George grabs Eli wrapped in his blanket and bends to Alice. 
           He turns to see the front doorknob jiggle; they want in.

                                 GEORGE
                        Can you stand?

           Alice, hurt but conscious. 

                                 ALICE
                        I think so.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - NIGHT

           George bursts onto the back porch, gun in one hand and the 
           crying baby in the other. Alice hangs off his shoulder as 
           they descend the steps together.

           SEVERAL WOMEN IN PRAIRIE DRESSES stand at the bend.

                                 PRAIRIE DRESS 1
                        They’re back here!

           Commotion sounds. 

           George kicks open the root cellar doors. 

           He helps Alice down the steps into blackness as Zooey rounds 
           the house and raises his gun.
           BANG! 

           The shot ricochets off the cellar doors. George pivots Eli 
           away and fires back as he squats down into 

           INT. VIKSE FARM - ROOT CELLAR - NIGHT

           George closes the steel doors above.

           Blackness.

           SOUNDS of the door being locked from the inside.

                                 GEORGE
                        Alice?

           Baby Eli cries furiously. 

           Finally, the single overhead light bulb ignites to illuminate 
           Alice on the ground. She looks weak.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        Alice!

           He places crying Baby Eli beside her atop his blanket. He 
           kneels to his wife. Alice, pained, sweats profusely.

           George pats her abdomen and lower back to inspect the wound.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        There’s no exit wound. The bullet 
                        is still inside.

                                 ALICE
                        Is that bad?

                                 GEORGE
                        No. That’s fine. You’ll be fine.

           He looks up at the overhead light, which suddenly starts to 
           GLOW BRIGHTER.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - NIGHT

           Zooey leads his dozen Prairie Dresses followers through the 
           backyard and toward the root cellar doors where 

           Light leaks from the gap between.

           Zooey stops at the doors below and presses his boot to the 
           latch, then raises it high and STOMPS DOWN. He repeats.
           INT. VIKSE FARM - ROOT CELLAR - NIGHT

           Baby Eli’s cries grow PIERCING as

           The overhead lightbulb burns even brighter.

           Alice’s grip on George’s hand weakens. Her eyes close under 
           strained, heavy breathing.

                                 GEORGE
                        Alice. Stay here. Don’t leave me. 
                        Stay right here.

           BOOM! BOOM! 

           George looks up to the doors above as they endure impact.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - NIGHT

           Zooey and some Prairie Dresses keep stomping on the doors 
           until the slit widens with a major dent.

           Light flickers from beneath.

           INT. VIKSE FARM - ROOT CELLAR - NIGHT

           Alice stops breathing. 

           George’s eyes go wide.

           He shakes her.

                                 GEORGE
                        Alice? Alice!? Wake up!

           Baby Eli’s little body shakes as it screams. 

           George winces at the child’s CRESCENDOING CRIES until

           ALL SOUND GOES MUTE.

           INSERT on the lightbulb’s filament burning up.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - NIGHT

           THE PRAIRIE DRESSES BEGIN TO COVER THEIR EARS.

           Light pours out from the crack in the cellar doors. It glows 
           brighter. Zooey points his gun at the hole. But suddenly, 

           HIS GUN STARTS TO SHAKE.
           His hand continues trembling, until 

           THE GUN FLOATS OUT OF HIS HAND AND INTO THE SKY.

           INT. VIKSE FARM - ROOT CELLAR - NIGHT 

           Baby Eli wails as sparks rain from the overhead bulb. 

           George turns to Alice. From her torso

           THE BULLET EXITS HER WOUND, FLOATS UP TO THE BURNING LIGHT.

           George traces the tiny metallic cylinder with his eyes.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - NIGHT 

           ZOOEY LIFTS OFF THE GROUND.

           His body bends backwards, as if his chest were being pulled 
           up to the sky while his face contorts in tremendous pain.

           Behind him, the Prairie Dresses’ feet also lift.

           INT. VIKSE FARM - ROOT CELLAR - NIGHT

           Alice’s hand suddenly grips George’s hand.

           She is alive.

           The bullet continues up toward the light, brighter and 
           brighter and brighter until the filament bursts.

           Blackness. 

           SOUND rushes back with a cacophonous thud of falling objects.

           MUCH LATER 

           Still Black.

           SOUNDS of footsteps on stairs, hands fumbling with the steel 
           doors. They are pushed aside as dawn light floods in.

           EXT. VIKSE FARM - DAWN

           George steps up through the doors, his rifle outstretched 
           ready to fire. Instead he sees

           A DOZEN DEAD BODIES sprawled out in the backyard including 
           Zooey, Betty, and the other Prairie Dresses. 
           The stubble fire continues burning through the outlying 
           cornfields, closer now to George’s property.

           The goats clamor together in their pen, moaning loud. 

           George turns as Alice emerges from the cellar with Baby Eli.

                                 BABY ELI
                        Bmmm...Mmba-da...Mm-da...da...

           Alice steps forward with a smile. Her nightgown filled with 
           dry blood but her face serene, healthy and somehow younger.

                                 BABY ELI (CONT’D)
                        ...da-da. Da-da. Da-da.

           Alice outstretches Baby Eli. 

           Beat. 

           George stares at the child. 

                                 BABY ELI (CONT’D)
                        Da-da...da-da.

           George, eyes wet, accepts the infant and hugs him close. 
           FRENZY SOUNDS of all the goats now screaming.

           In the distance, a wooden cross draped with cloth is 
           silhouetted by a wall of flames.

           Baby Eli snuggles into George as Alice joins her husband. 
           Together, they watch the fire. 

           They are a family.

           THE END
