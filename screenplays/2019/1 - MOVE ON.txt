           FADE IN:

           INT. RESTAURANT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           An upscale bathroom inside an upscale restaurant. TEDDY (28) 
           stands in front of the mirror. Handsome with an easygoing 
           charm, he nervously fixes his tie and suit jacket.

           He pulls out a RING BOX and practices going down on one-knee 
           without actually touching the bathroom floor for obvious 
           sanitary reasons.

           He pops the box open to reveal an ENGAGEMENT RING.

                                 TEDDY
                             (sotto)
                        Leyna, will me you marr--

           He shakes his head and stands back up. Reset. Back down.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Leyna, I can’t think of a better 
                        way to celebrate our anniversary 
                        than asking you to marry me. So 
                        will you... marry... me?
                             (to himself)
                        Jesus, Teddy. Words.

           He shakes it off and tries once more when a PATRON enters. 
           Teddy springs back up.

                                 PATRON
                        Oh, am I interrupting?

                                 TEDDY
                        No, you’re good. I’m just, uh... 
                        practicing.

           The Patron smiles as he hits the urinal. Teddy waits for him 
           to finish. The Patron zips up, washes his hands and dries 
           off. On his way out--

                                 PATRON
                        Good luck, man.

                                 TEDDY
                        Thanks.

           The Patron exits. Teddy looks at himself in the mirror.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Screw it. Here we go.
           INT. RESTAURANT - HALL - NIGHT

           Teddy steps out of the bathroom when his phone RINGS. He 
           checks -- it’s SQUID. He picks up.

                                 TEDDY
                        Yo... No, I’m at the restaurant 
                        now... I haven’t yet... Well, I 
                        can’t because I’m on the phone with 
                        you! Yeah, keys are above the 
                        door... Just make sure no one goes 
                        in my bedroom... Okay, later.

           Teddy hangs up, lets out the heaviest of nervous EXHALES, and 
           heads back to his table.

           INT. RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           Classy. Low-lit. White table cloths. LEYNA (28) -- smart, 
           elegant, uncomfortable in this particular moment -- sits at a 
           table with a look of horror on her face.

                                 LEYNA
                        No.

           In front of her, down on one knee, is Teddy as he presents 
           the RING. We watch his soul get crushed in real-time.

           The entire restaurant’s eyes are on them.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        I... I’m sorry.

           She stands and walks out of the restaurant. The crowd is 
           embarrassed for him but also enthralled by the drama.

           An elderly MAITRE D’ approaches and talks low to Teddy, who’s 
           still down on one knee.

                                 MAITRE D’
                        Chin up, son. There we go.

           The Maitre D’ gets Teddy to his feet.

                                 MAITRE D’ (CONT’D)
                        You can use the back exit here if 
                        you’d like.

                                 TEDDY
                             (despondent)
                        I still need to pay--
                                 MAITRE D’
                        It’s taken care of.

           The Maitre D’ pats him on the back and waves a WAITER over, 
           who quietly leads Teddy out through the kitchen.

           EXT. CHICAGO - STREET - NIGHT

           Teddy drives down a busy street as he calls Leyna but it goes 
           to voicemail. His phone battery is down to 4% and he’s manic. 
           He stops at a red light and tries again. No answer.

                                 TEDDY
                        Come on Leyna, pick up!

           The light turns green but Teddy doesn’t notice because he’s 
           busy texting her: Please call me back.

           The car behind him HONKS but Teddy ignores.

           TEDDY: Let’s talk about this.

           The car HONKS long and angry now as the light turns yellow.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        All right! Christ!

           Teddy steps on the gas but the light is back to RED again. A 
           TRUCK comes barreling through the intersection. Teddy has no 
           time to react as HEADLIGHTS BEAR DOWN ON HIM--

           SMASH!!

           The truck clips his rear bumper and he SPINS OUT OF CONTROL, 
           skidding across the intersection before coming to a stop on 
           the opposite corner.

           Beat.

           Shaken but unhurt, Teddy gets out of his car as the TRUCK 
           DRIVER runs over.

                                 TRUCK DRIVER
                        You okay??

           Teddy looks at the phone, still in his hand. It’s dead.

           INT. TEDDY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A disheveled Teddy opens the front door and trudges inside 
           when the lights turn on--
                                 CROWD (O.S.)
                        SURPRISE!!

           Teddy flinches. Party poppers go off and shoot little bits of 
           confetti as FRIENDS emerge from their hiding spots. 

           A big BANNER above the door reads: ENGAGED AF!

           Teddy GRUMBLES as SQUID (28), his best friend, approaches 
           with a big grin and hugs him.

                                 SQUID
                        Yo, where were you guys?
                             (wincing at the smell)
                        Jesus, how much you drink?

           Off Teddy’s silence--

                                 SQUID (CONT’D)
                        And where’s the lucky lady?

           Teddy shakes his head and the crowd falls silent.

                                 SQUID (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit.

           Squid grabs Teddy and leads him into the bedroom.

                                 SQUID (CONT’D)
                             (to the crowd)
                        Turn the music up! Y’all keep 
                        drinking. Party’s still a party.

           INT. TEDDY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Squid closes the door behind them as Teddy plops down on his 
           bed, draped in sadness.

                                 SQUID
                        Dude...

                                 TEDDY
                        You were right. I forced her hand 
                        and she said no.

                                 SQUID
                        Where is she now?

           Teddy shrugs. No idea.
                                 SQUID (CONT’D)
                        That’s rough, man. I’m sorry...
                        But hey, maybe now you can move to 
                        Tokyo with a clear conscience.

           Teddy throws Squid a look.

                                 TEDDY
                        Are you serious right now?

                                 SQUID
                        I’m just trying to find the silver 
                        lining here.

                                 TEDDY
                        I proposed because I wanted her to 
                        move with me.

                                 SQUID
                        I know...

           They take a beat to commiserate.

                                 SQUID (CONT’D)
                        I’ll clear everyone out.

           INT. TEDDY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Squid sees the crowd out. Once the apartment is empty, Squid 
           knocks on Teddy’s bedroom door.

                                 SQUID
                        Coast is clear.

           Off Teddy’s silence--

                                 SQUID (CONT’D)
                        She hit you up yet?

           More silence.

                                 SQUID (CONT’D)
                        Come on. Let’s go out.

                                 TEDDY (O.S.)
                        I want to be alone.

                                 SQUID
                        That’s the last thing you want to 
                        be tonight, trust me.

                                 TEDDY (O.S.)
                        Go away.
           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Teddy lies in bed staring at his phone, willing it to buzz 
           with a call or text from Leyna.

                                 SQUID (O.S.)
                        Stop staring at your phone, man.

                                 TEDDY
                        I’m not!

           He texts her:

           I’m sorry I sprung that on you. Take however much time you 
           need and call me when you’re ready.

           He puts his phone down and covers his face with a pillow when 
           Squid opens the door.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                             (under the pillow)
                        Leave me alone, dude.

                                 SQUID
                        I can’t because I know how you are 
                        when you’re alone.

                                 TEDDY
                        I’ll be fine.

                                 SQUID
                        No, you’ll sit here and stew and 
                        wallow in self-pity and that little 
                        voice in your head is going to make 
                        things seem a thousand times worse--

                                 TEDDY
                        All right, Jesus!

           Teddy gets out of bed.

                                 SQUID
                        You know I’m right.

           INT. DOGWOOD TAVERN - NIGHT

           A low-key neighborhood dive bar. Squid and Teddy sit at a 
           booth, a couple beers in.

                                 SQUID
                        So was it like a “not now” vibe or 
                        a “never” vibe?
                                 TEDDY
                        I don’t know. It was a “no” vibe.

                                 SQUID
                        Shit.

                                 TEDDY
                        Not helping.

                                 SQUID
                        Well, then Tokyo could be an even 
                        bigger blessing in disguise. New 
                        country. New people. Fresh start.

                                 TEDDY
                        I don’t want to think about that 
                        right now.

                                 SQUID
                        Just saying, better to rip the band-
                        aid off in these types of 
                        situations.

                                 TEDDY
                        These situations? You’ve never been 
                        in a relationship, Squid.

           Squid shrugs.

                                 SQUID
                        Doesn’t mean I’m not right.

                                 TEDDY
                        All right.

           Teddy stands and heads to the bathroom.

           INT. DOGWOOD TAVERN - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Teddy splashes water on his face and stares at himself, a 
           shell of his earlier self. His eyes sunken in, hair 
           disheveled.

           He checks his phone again. No new texts. He shakes his head, 
           defeated. He wipes his face and heads back out.

           INT. DOGWOOD TAVERN - CONTINUOUS

           As soon as he steps out, the music cuts out. When he gets 
           back to the bar area, he notices that it’s dead-silent.

           Something’s not right.
           Teddy scans the crowd and notices that no one’s moving.

           What the hell?

           He walks back over to their table where Squid is frozen.

                                 TEDDY
                        Squid?

           He grabs Squid’s shoulder and shakes him. Nothing. Thinking 
           it’s some joke--

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Weird but okay, you got me...?

           That’s when Teddy spots a pitcher of BEER being poured into a 
           glass at the next table. The liquid is frozen mid-stream.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        What the...?

           He waves his hand through the suspended liquid, clearing away 
           the beer that touches his hand while the rest remains hanging 
           in mid-air. When he pulls his hand back, the beer sticks to 
           his skin like normal.

           Teddy looks to the crowd now. No one’s moving. Or breathing. 
           Or blinking.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Hello?!

           Nothing. Suddenly frightened, he heads out of the bar.

           EXT. DOGWOOD TAVERN - CONTINUOUS

           He BURSTS out the doors and spots a CAR turning out of the 
           parking lot.

           He runs over and looks inside -- the DRIVER is frozen still. 
           The engine idling in a weird monotone. The BLINKER stuck mid-
           blink. He KNOCKS on the window.

                                 TEDDY
                        Hey!

           No reaction. He checks the rest of the street. Pedestrians 
           frozen mid-stride. A skateboarder frozen mid-ollie. A train 
           on the Red Line frozen on its tracks.
           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Teddy sprints over to the nearest row of shops and looks 
           inside a restaurant. FROZEN CUSTOMERS.

           He runs down to the next shop. A jam-packed SPORTS BAR. Fans 
           watching a football game are frozen mid-celebration like 
           someone pressed the PAUSE button.

           Teddy pulls out his phone and dials LEYNA’S NUMBER but it 
           doesn’t work. He tries MOM, then DAD. No ring. No dial-tone. 
           He checks his social media apps but they won’t open.

           He sprints down the street in a panic.

                                 TEDDY
                        Anybody?! Anybodyyyy?!

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           EXT. MICHIGAN AVE - DAY

           SUPER: THREE MONTHS LATER

           Everything still frozen. Cars line the roads, their drivers 
           frozen at the wheel. Pedestrians remain unmoved despite the 
           sun beating down on them.

           From down the street, a MAN appears on a mountain bike. He 
           shoulders a large backpack, his ragged hair tucked under a 
           wool cap while his scruffy unkempt BEARD covers his neck.

           He weaves through the frozen traffic and heads north past The 
           Art Institute and Millennium Park.

           He cruises down a few more blocks and pulls up to--

           INT. CHIPOTLE - DAY

           Frozen CUSTOMERS sit at the tables while EMPLOYEES stand 
           behind the counter in the midst of making burritos and bowls.

           Our Man enters and heads behind the counter, grabs a 
           tortilla, and sniffs the carnitas. He dumps a scoop on the 
           tortilla and slides down the line, adding toppings.
           INT. WALGREENS PHARMACY - DAY

           He eats the burrito as he browses the aisle for toiletries. 
           He steps up to the MEN’S SHAVING SECTION where the over-
           priced replacement cartridges are locked away behind a 
           plastic case.

           He tries to slide his hand underneath but can’t reach so he 
           gently pulls at the plastic guard but it doesn’t budge.

           He looks around, then YANKS at it until it breaks off. He 
           grabs a set of blades and goes on his way.

           EXT. TEDDY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           With plastic bags full of goods hanging off his handle-bars, 
           our Man pulls up outside an apartment complex and heads 
           towards the entrance when--

                                 LEYNA (O.S.)
                        Teddy?

           Our bearded Man whips around and for the first time, we get a 
           CLOSE-UP of his face. It is Teddy. His eyes widen. Standing 
           before him is...

           LEYNA. Like him, she’s a bit disheveled, clothes stained, 
           hair longer. His mouth drops.

                                 TEDDY
                        Leyna?!

           It takes them a moment to process...

           Then they rush into each others’ arms. She takes his face in 
           her hands as if to make sure he’s real.

                                 LEYNA
                        It’s you... It’s really you.

           She buries her face into his neck and he squeezes her tight, 
           both still in shock.

           INT. TEDDY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           They enter. He flicks the lights on to reveal an unchanged 
           apartment. Plates piled up in the sink. Food wrappers 
           everywhere. Clothes scattered on the floor.

                                 TEDDY
                        Sorry for the mess. I haven’t been 
                        back here in awhile.
           He kicks some of the clothes out of the way when he sees 
           Leyna looking up at the ENGAGED AF! banner still hanging 
           above the door.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           He tears it down and shoves it in the trash can as guilt 
           creeps across Leyna’s face. She shoots him an apologetic look 
           but Teddy can’t meet her eyes and pushes on, desperate to 
           change the subject--

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Um, coffee?

           Leyna takes a beat before letting it go.

                                 LEYNA
                        Sure.

           He moves to the KITCHEN, puts on a pot and starts the burner.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        Yours still works?

                                 TEDDY
                        Yeah. Yours?

                                 LEYNA
                        It’s shoddy. Maybe because it’s 
                        electric? I don’t know.

                                 TEDDY
                        Yeah, I’ve noticed certain things 
                        are more glitchy than others.

                                 LEYNA
                        I have so many questions.

                                 TEDDY
                        Me, too.

           Teddy grabs a bag of coffee beans and pours them into an 
           electric grinder. He’s doing anything to avoid eye contact, 
           which makes it only more awkward.

           She, on the other hand, seems more in control.

                                 LEYNA
                        Where are you coming from?

                                 TEDDY
                        Jersey.
                                 LEYNA
                        Your parents?

                                 TEDDY
                        Yeah.

                                 LEYNA
                        Are they...?

                                 TEDDY
                             (unfortunately)
                        Yeah.

                                 LEYNA
                        Did you bike there?

                                 TEDDY
                        Took cars where I could but for the 
                        congested areas, the bike comes in 
                        real handy.

           He kicks the coffee grinder into gear. It’s loud.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. One sec.

           The loud grinding is a welcome reprieve. Teddy finishes and 
           taps out the coffee grinds into a pour-over contraption.

                                 LEYNA
                        I--

           The pot starts to WHISTLE. Teddy puts up a hold-that-thought 
           finger and turns the burner off. He pours the hot water into 
           the coffee-packed filter.

           He reaches into the fridge and pulls out milk. Sniffs it. 
           Still good. He looks to her for approval.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        I trust you. None of the food I’ve 
                        seen has spoilt so far.

                                 TEDDY
                        Me neither.

           He gives hers a pour and slides the cup over.

                                 LEYNA
                        Thanks.

           There’s no more activity for him to occupy the silence with.
                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        So... wanna start at the beginning?

                                 TEDDY
                        The beginning as in...?

                                 LEYNA
                        The night everything froze.

                                 TEDDY
                        Right. Sure, um...

           She sees him struggling--

                                 LEYNA
                        I’ll go first. After our... dinner, 
                        I had just gotten home when it 
                        happened. I tried calling you, my 
                        parents, friends... Nothing went 
                        through so I came here but you 
                        weren’t home.

                                 TEDDY
                        Yeah, I was out with Squid when it 
                        happened. I went to your place too 
                        but we must have missed each other.

                                 LEYNA
                        After that, I went downtown, to the 
                        office, malls, parks... It’s all 
                        frozen.

                                 TEDDY
                        Same with New Jersey, New York, and 
                        every town I passed through.

           A sullen beat. She sees the bags under his eyes.

                                 LEYNA
                        You must be exhausted.

                                 TEDDY
                        A bit. I never realized how big 
                        this country was until I had to get 
                        around it manually.

                                 LEYNA
                        Why don’t you rest up and we can 
                        talk more tomorrow?

                                 TEDDY
                        Sure. Mind if I hop in the shower?
                                 LEYNA
                        Go ahead.

                                 TEDDY
                        Feel free to...
                             (waving his hand around)
                        You know.

                                 LEYNA
                        Thanks.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Teddy’s muscles relax as the HOT WATER pours over him. 
           Suddenly, the water stops mid-air. Yet another glitch. Not 
           bothered, he pushes the paused water out of the way, jiggles 
           the knob on and off and the water starts flowing again.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Leyna has a look around. The decorations are still up and the 
           poppers and confetti litter the floor. The coffee table is 
           covered in POLAROID printouts of them.

           She sits down and picks one up. A PHOTO of them at the bar 
           making silly faces. Another of them laughing hysterically. A 
           selfie he took of her sleeping on his chest...

           She starts to tear up.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Teddy hears the bathroom door open. A moment later, Leyna 
           gets in the shower. She wraps her arms around him from behind 
           and places her head on his back.

           A comfort washes over him. He turns and they embrace, holding 
           each other in silence.

           After a long beat, she pulls away.

                                 LEYNA
                        I’m sorry.

                                 TEDDY
                        It’s okay--

           But she steps out. Teddy drops his head.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Teddy emerges from the bathroom as Leyna prepares to leave.

                                 LEYNA
                        I should go.

                                 TEDDY
                        Just stay.

                                 LEYNA
                        You don’t have to--

                                 TEDDY
                        You’re the first unfrozen person 
                        I’ve seen since this all started. 
                        I’d feel better if you stayed here.

           Leyna mulls a beat and relents. Teddy opens a closet and 
           grabs a bedsheet and a comforter.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Take my bed.

                                 LEYNA
                        No, that’s not--

                                 TEDDY
                        It’s fine. I spend more nights on 
                        the couch, anyway.

           Leyna doesn’t press.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Your clothes are still in the 
                        dresser... if you need.

           That guilt creeps up on Leyna again as Teddy finishes setting 
           up the couch.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        If you need anything, let me know.

                                 LEYNA
                        Thanks, Teddy.

                                 TEDDY
                             (lightly)
                        Go fuck yourself.

           Leyna stops, taken by surprise. An amused look from her as 
           they exchange a knowing glance.
                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, that was--

                                 LEYNA
                        It’s fine. Good night.

                                 TEDDY
                        Night.

           She heads into his bedroom and shuts the door.

           INTERCUT:

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Leyna gets into bed. Lights off. Staring up at the ceiling.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Teddy in the same position, also staring up at the ceiling. 
           He glances over at the bedroom door...

           She does the same, as if willing him to come in... but he 
           doesn’t.

           He SIGHS and draws the comforter over his face. It’s going to 
           be a long night.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. NORTH AVENUE BEACH - CASTAWAYS - DAY

           SUMMER. The sandy shores are packed with locals trying to get 
           as much sun as they can. This is before the freeze.

           A clean-cut Teddy stands in front of a restaurant shaped like 
           a steamship when Leyna -- with longer hair -- approaches.

                                 LEYNA
                        Teddy?

                                 TEDDY
                        Leyna.

           A gawky hug. Teddy points to himself.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        As you expected?

                                 LEYNA
                        Very much so.
                                 TEDDY
                        Good. Shall we?

           EXT. NORTH AVENUE BEACH - LATER

           They stroll barefoot along the beach.

                                 LEYNA
                        Worst date you’ve ever been on.

                                 TEDDY
                        Oooh, I like this one. Let’s see... 
                        My worst date lasted five seconds.

                                 LEYNA
                        Do tell.

                                 TEDDY
                        She came into the restaurant, saw 
                        me sitting at the table, we clearly 
                        made eye contact, then she turned 
                        and walked right back out.

                                 LEYNA
                        Ouch. That’s brutal.

                                 TEDDY
                        That’s New York. She even made an 
                        “eww” face on her way out.

                                 LEYNA
                        No she didn’t!

                                 TEDDY
                        Oh ya. It was the perfect mix of 
                        disgust and disappointment, like 
                        this...

           Teddy scrunches his face. Leyna CRACKS UP.

                                 LEYNA
                        What happened to good ol’ fashioned 
                        standing people up?

                                 TEDDY
                        Right?? But no, she had to come 
                        down to the restaurant, inspect the 
                        goods in person, show disgust, and 
                        then leave.
                                 LEYNA
                        Is that why you moved here? To 
                        escape the cut-throat dating scene 
                        of Manhattan?

                                 TEDDY
                        Yeah, I heard that women in Chicago 
                        will at least let you buy them a 
                        beer before they ditch you.

                                 LEYNA
                        We are very polite.

           Leyna pulls up to an ice cream cart.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        Want one? My treat.

                                 TEDDY
                        Sure, I’ll take a strawberry 
                        shortcake bar.

           Leyna raises a brow.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        I’m very secure.

                                 LEYNA
                        I can see that.

           They take their ice cream and sit on a bench.

                                 TEDDY
                        So what’s your worst first?

                                 LEYNA
                        I once had a guy tell me the only 
                        way he could orgasm was by 
                        screaming his mother’s name.

           Teddy chokes on his ice cream and starts COUGHING.

                                 TEDDY
                        Don’t believe you.

                                 LEYNA
                        Ten minutes into meeting me.

                                 TEDDY
                        Did he confuse you for his 
                        therapist?
                                 LEYNA
                        Who knows? I wasn’t about to do a 
                        deep-dive into that Oedipal complex 
                        so I let him buy me a beer and then 
                        I took off.

                                 TEDDY
                        Well, you win that round.

                                 LEYNA
                        Your turn.

                                 TEDDY
                        Hmm, how about worst thing an ex 
                        ever did to you?

                                 LEYNA
                        I’m gonna go with he gave me an STD 
                        after cheating on me... with a guy.

                                 TEDDY
                        What?!

                                 LEYNA
                        Yeah, it was traumatic on multiple 
                        levels. And don’t worry, it was one 
                        of the curable ones.

                                 TEDDY
                        Christ, I can’t follow that. And 
                        who are all these awful people 
                        you’re dating?

                                 LEYNA
                        I have famously poor taste in men.

                                 TEDDY
                        I’ll ignore that.

           She LAUGHS.

                                 LEYNA
                        Your turn.

                                 TEDDY
                        Hmm... Well, my last ex ruined the 
                        phrase “I love you” forever.

                                 LEYNA
                        How so?

                                 TEDDY
                        Tried to force it down my throat 
                        from the moment we started dating.
                                 LEYNA
                        That’s never a good sign.

                                 TEDDY
                        She used it like a period at the 
                        end of every sentence. I have a gag 
                        reflex every time I hear it now.

                                 LEYNA
                        I love you.

           Teddy shudders.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        Oh man, you’re not joking.

                                 TEDDY
                        Unfortunately not.

                                 LEYNA
                        Well, that’s an easy fix. Just 
                        replace it with a different phrase.

                                 TEDDY
                        Like what?

                                 LEYNA
                        Like instead of “I love you,” my 
                        parents used to say, “I hate you.”

                                 TEDDY
                        That’s funny.

                                 LEYNA
                        I thought it was cute, too. Then 
                        they got divorced.

                                 TEDDY
                        Ha! Sorry.

                                 LEYNA
                        So probably not that one.

                                 TEDDY
                        Hmm...

                                 LEYNA
                        How about “go fuck yourself?”

                                 TEDDY
                        Hey babe, you’re the best. Go fuck 
                        yourself.

           They let it linger in the air.
                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Think we got a winner.

                                 LEYNA
                        You’re welcome.

           They get up and start walking again.

                                 TEDDY
                        So was it gonorrhea?

                                 LEYNA
                        Go fuck yourself.

           They share a laugh as we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Leyna’s eyes open. It takes a beat to let the dream/memory 
           fade into the back of her mind.

           Unsettled, she gets up and heads to the bedroom door.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She opens it and peeks out to see Teddy SNORING on the couch. 
           A look of relief washes over her.

           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

           Fresh out of a shower, she rummages through her little 
           section of the cabinet mirror and finds a RAZOR and shaving 
           cream. She puts her leg up on the counter and runs her 
           fingers across her shin -- it’s bristling with hair.

           She lathers her leg and starts shaving. A few strokes in, she 
           NICKS the back of her calf and winces.

                                 LEYNA
                        Ow.

           She looks down at the cut as blood starts to ooze out. She 
           runs a finger across the wound and inspects the blood. She 
           rubs it between her fingers as if it’s foreign to her when--

           A KNOCK at the door snaps her out of her trance.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        Yeah?
                                 TEDDY (O.S.)
                        Hey, I’m going across the hall to 
                        use the neighbor’s shower.

                                 LEYNA
                        Oh, I’m almost done.

                                 TEDDY (O.S.)
                        That’s okay, take your time. I’ll 
                        be back in a bit.

                                 LEYNA
                        Okay.

           Leyna returns her attention to the blood on her fingers.

           INT. TEDDY’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Teddy returns as Leyna brews coffee.

                                 TEDDY
                        Ah, I see the student has become 
                        the master.

                                 LEYNA
                        Don’t get your hopes up. I’m a 
                        hipster in training wheels compared 
                        to you.

                                 TEDDY
                        I see the back-handed compliment 
                        game is still strong with you.

           She hands him a cup and watches him take a sip.

                                 LEYNA
                        Bad?

                                 TEDDY
                        The opposite of bad. Hell, if your 
                        career doesn’t work out, you can 
                        always become a snobby barista at 
                        an overpriced coffee shop.

           Leyna forces a smile but Teddy senses the underlying sadness.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, we’re gonna get through 
                        whatever this is...

           Leyna tries her best to stay positive and forces a nod.
                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        And that starts by figuring out 
                        what this is.

                                 LEYNA
                        What do you mean?

           Teddy pulls out his PHONE and opens up GOOGLE MAPS. He swipes 
           to the Eastern seaboard of the United States and shows her.

                                 TEDDY
                        Check this out.

                                 LEYNA
                        What am I looking at?

                                 TEDDY
                        See that black line over the 
                        Atlantic Ocean?

           Sure enough, there’s a straight BLACK LINE that cuts parallel 
           down the US coastline about ten miles out to sea.

                                 LEYNA
                        Yeah?

                                 TEDDY
                        I didn’t say anything last night 
                        because I didn’t want to sound 
                        crazy, but... I saw it.

                                 LEYNA
                        Saw what?

           EXT. NEW JERSEY - NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Teddy cruises down the street on his bicycle and pulls up to 
           a small house in a middle-class neighborhood.

           He walks up and BANGS on the door.

                                 TEDDY
                        Mom? Dad? It’s Teddy!

           No answer. He heads to the back of the house when something 
           grabs his attention.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                             (sotto)
                        What the hell...?

           Behind the house, in the far distance, a WALL OF BLACK 
           extends into the sky.
           Confused, Teddy gets back on his bike and heads towards it.

           EXT. ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK - DAY

           Teddy rides his bike to the end of the boardwalk and looks 
           out at the ocean. His eyes widen, face frozen in shock. It 
           takes him a beat to take in whatever he’s looking at. He 
           rushes over to the edge and WE PAN WITH HIM TO SEE--

           A WALL OF BLACK OVER THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. A pitch black 
           curtain of nothingness slicing across the water for as far as 
           the eye can see and extending up into space.

           It’s as if the world just ends there.

           Ocean waves lap into it and disappear. A vacuum of sight and 
           sound. It’s at once mesmerizing and terrifying.

           He checks the map on his phone and sure enough, it’s the same 
           black line that slices through the ocean from the North Pole 
           down to the South.

           Frightened, he rushes back to his bicycle and pedals away.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. TEDDY’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Leyna furrows her brow.

                                 LEYNA
                        I don’t understand.

                                 TEDDY
                        I don’t know how else to explain 
                        it. Here’s another one.

           This time, Teddy swipes over to the West Coast. Another BLACK 
           LINE cuts vertically down the coast through Los Angeles.

                                 LEYNA
                        You think it’s the same thing?

                                 TEDDY
                        Only one way to find out.

                                 LEYNA
                        You’re not thinking of going there.

                                 TEDDY
                        What’s the alternative? Wait around 
                        and hope things unfreeze?
           Leyna looks like that’s exactly what she was thinking.

                                 LEYNA
                        What if it’s dangerous?

                                 TEDDY
                        I was maybe ten miles away from it 
                        and nothing happened. It’s safe.

                                 LEYNA
                        How do you know?

                                 TEDDY
                        I just... feel it.

                                 LEYNA
                        You feel it?

                                 TEDDY
                        Okay, saying it out loud sounds 
                        nuts but so is everything that’s 
                        happened. Machines and electronics 
                        still work and day still turns to 
                        night but all living things are 
                        frozen? It doesn’t make any sense.

                                 LEYNA
                        I don’t know, Teddy. Maybe we 
                        should just stay here.

                                 TEDDY
                        Leyna, it’s already been three or 
                        four months and nothing’s happened.

                                 LEYNA
                        What are you planning on doing if 
                        you get to it?

                                 TEDDY
                        I’ll know when I get there. And I’d 
                        feel better if you came with.

                                 LEYNA
                        Sounds like you’re going regardless 
                        of whether I come or not.

           A KNIFE to Teddy’s heart. Leyna immediately regrets it.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that.

                                 TEDDY
                        No, I deserve it.
           Leyna thinks a beat, then relents.

                                 LEYNA
                        I’ll need to pack some things.

           INT. SPORTS STORE - DAY

           They load up on camping gear, sleeping bags, flashlights, 
           protein bars, and water packs.

           Teddy checks out a CROSSBOW. Leyna frowns and Teddy puts it 
           back. He grabs a HUNTING KNIFE instead and holds it up for 
           approval. Leyna shrugs.

           EXT. MALL - DAY

           They step out with two shopping carts full of gear.

                                 LEYNA
                        How are we going to fit all this 
                        stuff into your car?

           Teddy eyes the parking lot and spots a TOYOTA 4-RUNNER.

                                 TEDDY
                             (pointing)
                        We’ll take that one.

           They approach the SUV to see a young preppy COLLEGE KID 
           driving it. Teddy opens the door and checks inside.

                                 LEYNA
                        Oh, Teddy. I don’t know about 
                        stealing some poor kid’s car.

           Teddy reaches in and pulls out a BAG OF ECSTASY from the 
           glove compartment and holds it up.

                                 TEDDY
                        Poor kid?

                                 LEYNA
                        Oh.

           Teddy then holds up a big plastic bag containing little 
           baggies of COCAINE.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        Okay, fine.

           MOMENTS LATER
           Leyna loads the equipment into the back while Teddy gently 
           places the frozen College Kid in a shopping cart along with 
           his drugs.

                                 TEDDY
                        Thanks, buddy. We’ll try and get 
                        your ride back to you...
                             (to Leyna)
                        You ready?

                                 LEYNA
                        I guess?

           They get in.

           INT./EXT. SUV - DAY (MOVING)

           Frozen cars dot the I-290 as they drive down the shoulder, 
           away from the Chicago skyline.

           They settle in. Leyna turns the radio on but all the channels 
           are dead-silent.

                                 TEDDY
                        You can leave it on, just in case. 
                        760 AM’s the emergency station.

           Leyna scrolls to it and leaves it on. It’s silent.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        How did you sleep last night?

                                 LEYNA
                        Honestly? Really well.

                                 TEDDY
                        Me, too.

           Leyna shoots him a warm glance before her eyes move down to 
           his beard.

                                 LEYNA
                        How’s all that hair working out for 
                        you?

                                 TEDDY
                        You no like?

                                 LEYNA
                        It’s... different.
                                 TEDDY
                        I noticed a lil’ baby ‘stache on 
                        you, too.

           Leyna SMACKS his arm.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, never hit the driver.

           Suddenly, Leyna spots something on the other side of the 
           highway five hundred yards ahead and points to it.

                                 LEYNA
                        Teddy, look.

           It’s a CAR CRASH taking place.

                                 TEDDY
                        Whoa.

           Teddy slows down and pulls to a stop beside the crash.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Teddy gets out, hops over the divider and approaches the 
           scene. It’s mid-crash. A PICK-UP TRUCK is in the midst of 
           slamming into the back of a MINIVAN. The windows are just 
           smashing, milliseconds away from spraying glass everywhere.

           Teddy approaches cautiously and peeks inside the mini-van. 
           The driver is a YOUNG MOM who’s frozen, her muscles 
           constricting and bracing for impact. In the backseat, a 
           TODDLER is strapped into a baby seat.

                                 TEDDY
                        Jesus.

           Leyna gets out and approaches.

                                 LEYNA
                        Teddy?

                                 TEDDY
                        It’s okay. Well, not okay but...

           Teddy waves her over. She looks inside the minivan and GASPS.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        We’re literally a second away from 
                        this turning real bad.

                                 LEYNA
                        We have to get them out.
           Teddy nods. He opens the Mom’s door and un-clips her 
           seatbelt. Leyna helps him carry her out of the car.

                                 TEDDY
                        Let’s place her over by the grass.

           They carry her over and lay her down. Teddy goes back in and 
           grabs the Toddler. He places her in the Mom’s lap and wraps 
           the Mom’s arms around the child.

           Leyna checks the Mom and Child for injuries while Teddy gets 
           inside the minivan and presses on the BRAKE. He then taps the 
           GAS and the minivan starts to roll forward. He cuts the wheel 
           to get away from the truck.

           The shattered windows are frozen in place and left behind, 
           creating a silhouette of the minivan. He rolls the minivan 
           onto the shoulder, safely away from traffic.

           He gets out and jogs over to the pick up truck. He drags the 
           Driver out and onto the grass next to the Mom.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        That does it, hopefully. How are 
                        they doing?

                                 LEYNA
                        I’m no doctor but they seem okay.

           They exchange a look of relief. Leyna puts a hand on his arm 
           as they look over the work they’ve just done.

           INT./EXT. SUV - DAY (MOVING)

           The scenery has turned rural and the cars have thinned out. 
           Teddy and Leyna still processing what happened.

                                 TEDDY
                        That was...

                                 LEYNA
                        Unreal.

                                 TEDDY
                        I mean, we did a good thing, right?

                                 LEYNA
                        Obviously, yes.

                                 TEDDY
                        Like, we’re not messing with fate 
                        or anything.
                                 LEYNA
                        Don’t think like that.

                                 TEDDY
                        But like--

                                 LEYNA
                        If that’s messing with fate, then 
                        it’s worth it.

                                 TEDDY
                        No, you’re right. You’re right.

           Leyna looks at Teddy, who’s focused on the road. She reaches 
           for his free hand and squeezes. He squeezes back.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - EVENING

           As the sun begins to set, WE FLY OVERHEAD as they drive down 
           a desolate stretch of highway.

           INT. SUV - NIGHT (MOVING)

           Leyna sleeps as Teddy rubs his eyes and yawns. He switches 
           lanes and takes the next exit for DOWNTOWN ST. LOUIS.

           EXT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - NIGHT

           They pull up to the front of the hotel.

           INT./EXT. SUV - NIGHT

           Teddy parks as Leyna wakes up.

                                 LEYNA
                        Where are we?

                                 TEDDY
                        St. Louis. Would’ve made it further 
                        but all the frozen traffic slowed 
                        us down pretty considerably.

                                 LEYNA
                        No need to rush, especially after 
                        seeing that car crash.

                                 TEDDY
                        True. Figured we could stay here 
                        tonight.
           They exit the vehicle. Leyna looks up at the beautiful hotel.

                                 LEYNA
                        Fancy.

                                 TEDDY
                        Might as well take advantage of the 
                        situation, right?

                                 LEYNA
                        Might as well.

           INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

           It’s a gorgeous modern layout. Frozen GUESTS mill about as 
           Teddy and Leyna weave their way over to elevators.

                                 LEYNA
                        You know what you’re doing?

                                 TEDDY
                        Just need to find housekeeping.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The elevator door DINGS open and Teddy pushes the luggage 
           cart down the hall as Leyna rides on it. A MAID stands frozen 
           in the hallway.

                                 TEDDY
                        Perfect.

           Teddy walks up to her and grabs the MASTER KEY CARD off her 
           belt. They pull up to a set of regal double doors.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s see what’s behind door number 
                        one.

           Teddy swipes the keycard and the doors unlock. Teddy pushes 
           the doors open into--

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           A sprawling room with a view that overlooks all of St. Louis.

                                 LEYNA
                        Wow. This is so nice, Teddy.
                                 TEDDY
                        I’ll be just down the hall. Wanna 
                        do dinner in an hour or so?

                                 LEYNA
                        Sounds like a plan.

                                 TEDDY
                        See you then.

           Teddy stands at the door, waiting for something.

                                 LEYNA
                        Yes?

                                 TEDDY
                        It’s customary to tip the bellhop.

                                 LEYNA
                             (haughty; waving him off)
                        Put it on my account, won’t you?

                                 TEDDY
                        It’s scary how quickly you’ve 
                        acclimated to this lifestyle.

           She laughs as he shuts the door behind him.

           INT. TEDDY’S PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT

           Teddy opens the door to his room and enters. It’s a similarly 
           grand hotel room. He collapses on the bed and lets out a 
           heavy SIGH.

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Leyna takes a much-needed soak in the bathtub. She lifts her 
           leg to check the shaving nick from the previous morning. It’s 
           scabbed over and healing as normal. She runs her finger over 
           it again as if it’s still foreign to her.

           Satisfied, she sinks into the water and blows bubbles.

           INT. TEDDY’S SUITE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Post-shower, Teddy finishes shaving his face and gives 
           himself a once-over. A satisfied -- if slightly nervous -- 
           look emerges on his face, like first date energy.
           INT. TEDDY’S SUITE - NIGHT

           Teddy tries on a few shirts in front of the mirror and 
           settles on a button-down tucked into chinos with leather 
           dress shoes to top it off.

           He gives himself one last look, runs a comb through his waxed 
           hair, and heads out.

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT

           Leyna also gets ready, except she’s in a simple white T-shirt 
           and jeans with high-top chucks. Her hair up in a bun. She 
           casually checks herself out and heads to the door.

           She opens it to--

           INT. LEYNA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Teddy stands at the door, pre-freeze. He’s in a black T-
           shirt, black jeans, black converse.

           Leyna greets him in a black blouse, black trousers, black 
           mules, and a black leather jacket.

                                 LEYNA
                        Hey--
                             (seeing his outfit)
                        Oh.

                                 TEDDY
                        Wow. Great minds.

                                 LEYNA
                        It’s like we’re attending a really 
                        casual funeral.

                                 TEDDY
                        Don’t worry. Hipsters flock to 
                        where we’re going so we’ll blend 
                        right in.

                                 LEYNA
                        Where are we going?

                                 TEDDY
                        A bar hidden inside a morgue.

                                 LEYNA
                        Funny.
           EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           From outside, we see Leyna and Teddy sitting by the window, 
           laughing and eating in a crowded, divey local spot. The neon 
           signs and the steam rising up from the drains creates an In 
           The Mood For Love vibe.

           INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           It’s bustling inside but they sit in silence as Teddy eyes 
           Leyna for a beat. Then--

                                 TEDDY
                        Non-profit.

                                 LEYNA
                        Are you kidding?

                                 TEDDY
                        What? I have plenty of friends who 
                        went to business school and work at 
                        non-profits.

                                 LEYNA
                        I totally respect that but I can’t 
                        afford to spend two hundred 
                        thousand dollars on an MBA to go 
                        work at a non-profit.

                                 TEDDY
                        Fair enough.

                                 LEYNA
                        You got one guess left.

                                 TEDDY
                        Okay, well I know Booth is strong 
                        in finance...

           Leyna gives off a “no” vibe so he swerves.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        But I know you think the industry 
                        is douchey and lame because it’s 
                        festering with muppets like me...

           Leyna CHUCKLES.
                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        So given your outgoing, independent 
                        personality, along with a flare for 
                        calculated risk-taking, I’m going 
                        to guess... entrepreneurship and 
                        like, marketing to back it up.

           Leyna raises an impressed brow.

                                 LEYNA
                        Did you stalk my LinkedIn profile?

                                 TEDDY
                        Wait, did I nail it?

                                 LEYNA
                        Yes, you did.

                                 TEDDY
                        Wooo!

                                 LEYNA
                        I’m totally creeped out.

                                 TEDDY
                        Don’t be salty. Bet’s a bet. Meal’s 
                        on you.

                                 LEYNA
                        Mm hmm. Excuse me while I go set my 
                        profile back to private.

           Leyna wipes her mouth with a napkin and stands.

                                 TEDDY
                        Don’t skip out on the bill.

                                 LEYNA
                        I only do that on second dates.

                                 TEDDY
                        This is our second date.

           Leyna grins as she disappears around the corner--

           INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

           FROZEN WORLD. Leyna exits the elevator to Teddy waiting in 
           the lobby. He lights up and walks over.

                                 TEDDY
                        Hey.
           The mismatch in styles is noticeable.

                                 LEYNA
                        You shaved.

                                 TEDDY
                        Figured I’d get civilized again.

                                 LEYNA
                        I was starting to get used to it.

                                 TEDDY
                        Really?

                                 LEYNA
                        No, not really. Any woman who says 
                        she likes beards has never dealt 
                        with one or is lying.

                                 TEDDY
                        Good to know.

                                 LEYNA
                        So, where to?

           EXT. ROOFTOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           They arrive on a rooftop that overlooks all of St. Louis. The 
           city lights glow softly below.

                                 LEYNA
                        Wow. This is nice.

                                 TEDDY
                        Too nice?

                                 LEYNA
                        No, it’s perfect.

           Teddy grabs two MENUS and seats Leyna at an empty table. He 
           squints over at a chalkboard by the front.

                                 TEDDY
                        Today’s specials are...
                             (butchering it)
                        Ris de veau and farci poitevin?

           They look at each other, lost. She hands him the menu back.

                                 LEYNA
                        Chef’s choice.
                                 TEDDY
                        Two of whatever I can find in the 
                        kitchen coming right up.

                                 LEYNA
                        Want me to help you scavenge?

                                 TEDDY
                        I’ll grab food. You get drinks?

                                 LEYNA
                        Sure.

           As Teddy saunters inside, Leyna heads to the BAR. The Gateway 
           Arch rises up in the distance, majestic and alien.

           She goes behind the bar and finds a bottle of red WINE. She 
           grabs two glasses and on her way back, spots an OLD COUPLE 
           holding hands across the table, frozen in time. The image 
           warms her heart.

           Teddy re-emerges from the kitchen with two PLATES in hand and 
           they meet back at the table.

                                 TEDDY
                        So this is all I could find. Chef’s 
                        salad and some fancy chicken. What 
                        did you get?

                                 LEYNA
                        A bottle of cab.

                                 TEDDY
                        You win.

           They take their seats. She pours while he serves her a plate.

                                 LEYNA
                        This looks good.

                                 TEDDY
                        Let’s hope so. That menu was New 
                        York prices.

           As they dig in--

                                 LEYNA
                        It’s incredible that this chicken 
                        is still warm.

                                 TEDDY
                        Right?
                                 LEYNA
                        At least starving to death won’t be 
                        a problem.

           Off his look--

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        I just mean it’s comforting to know 
                        that eating is one less thing to 
                        have to worry about.

                                 TEDDY
                        Right.

           Teddy pushes his food around a bit.

                                 LEYNA
                        Did I say something wrong?

                                 TEDDY
                        No, you just reminded me that we 
                        may be the only unfrozen people 
                        left in the world.

                                 LEYNA
                        Oh... Right. Sorry.

                                 TEDDY
                        Not your fault. But don’t you find 
                        that strange?

                                 LEYNA
                        What?

                                 TEDDY
                        I mean...

           Teddy points his fork at her, then himself.

                                 LEYNA
                        Yeah, I guess.

                                 TEDDY
                        It’s either coincidence, cosmic, 
                        or... calculated.

                                 LEYNA
                        Calculated?

                                 TEDDY
                        I don’t know. I don’t want to make 
                        it a thing.
                                 LEYNA
                        It already is a thing, Teddy. To 
                        your point.

                                 TEDDY
                        So maybe we talk about it then.

                                 LEYNA
                        About what?

                                 TEDDY
                        Us.

           Leyna shifts uncomfortably and glances at the other PATRONS.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        They can’t hear us this time, if 
                        that’s your concern.

           That stings.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, bad joke.

                                 LEYNA
                        No, you’re right. You deserve an 
                        explanation and I never got the 
                        chance to give you one...

           She drops her head to fight back the tears but she’s losing. 
           She shields her eyes with her hands.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           A long, guilty beat from Teddy. He looks around, his eyes 
           landing on a middle-aged COUPLE two tables over.

                                 TEDDY
                        What do you think they’re fighting 
                        about over there?

           The MAN rubs his temples in frustration as the WOMAN looks 
           like she’s doing her best not to scream at him.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Money? Kids?

                                 LEYNA
                        Well, for starters, he’s wearing a 
                        wedding ring and she’s not.

           Teddy looks more carefully. Leyna’s right.
                                 TEDDY
                        Good spot. So cheating?

                                 LEYNA
                        Or divorce.

                                 TEDDY
                        Yeah...

           Teddy mulls this.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Think we would’ve ended up like 
                        them?

                                 LEYNA
                             (uncomfortable)
                        I don’t know, Teddy.

           Teddy lingers on the couple as he processes a thought.

                                 TEDDY
                        You know what? We don’t need to 
                        talk about it right now. Let’s just 
                        enjoy ourselves tonight and focus 
                        on unfreezing the world first.

           Leyna nods and they get back to their meal.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Teddy and Leyna walk down the hall, an awkward distance 
           between them. Eyes forward or on the floor.

           They stop in front of her door.

                                 LEYNA
                        Thank you for dinner.

                                 TEDDY
                        Thanks for joining me. I forgot how 
                        nice it is to not eat alone.

                                 LEYNA
                        I’m sorry I made it awkward back 
                        there.

                                 TEDDY
                        No, it’s me. I’m the one acting 
                        weird... Because this is weird.

                                 LEYNA
                        Yeah. It is.
           Leyna hangs by the door, her body language as hesitant as the 
           tone in her voice.

                                 TEDDY
                        Anyway, I was thinking of heading 
                        out early tomorrow if that’s okay 
                        with you. We can make it to 
                        Albuquerque by nightfall if the 
                        roads are clear.

                                 LEYNA
                        Sure.

                                 TEDDY
                        Great, I’ll swing by around seven?

                                 LEYNA
                        Okay.

                                 TEDDY
                        Okay...

           Awkward beat.

                                 LEYNA
                        Good night, Teddy.

                                 TEDDY
                        Night.

           Teddy walks to his room. Leyna watches him for a beat before 
           unlocking her door and heading inside.

           Teddy gets to his door and looks back as hers shuts. 
           Disappointed, he heads inside--

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. TEDDY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Teddy and Leyna drunkenly stumble inside his apartment, lips 
           locked, hands grabbing at each other. Teddy kicks the door 
           closed and fumbles for the light but she grabs his hand and 
           draws it back around her.

                                 TEDDY
                        Can’t see.

                                 LEYNA
                        I know--

           They trip over something and fall onto the bed, giggling like 
           giddy honeymooners.
                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        I love how your bed is so close to 
                        the door.

                                 TEDDY
                        Is that a nice way of saying my 
                        apartment is small?

                                 LEYNA
                        It’s cozy. Like a closet.

                                 TEDDY
                        The queen of backhanded compliments 
                        strikes again.

           They kiss again, more deeply this time, and wrap their arms 
           around each other.

           INT. TEDDY’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           They lay naked in bed, still wrapped up in each other.

                                 LEYNA
                        Probably space.

                                 TEDDY
                        Space?

                                 LEYNA
                        I have all the money and time in 
                        the world, right?

                                 TEDDY
                        Yeah.

                                 LEYNA
                        Space. Final answer.

                                 TEDDY
                        Explain.

                                 LEYNA
                        Looking up at the stars always made 
                        me feel small in a good way, like 
                        no matter what I was dealing with 
                        in that particular moment, it was 
                        infinitesimal compared to 
                        everything that’s happened -- and 
                        will happen -- in the universe. I 
                        want to experience what it would 
                        feel like to be on the other end of 
                        that, looking back at our planet 
                        from above.
           Teddy sees Leyna light up at the thought.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        Seeing all the civilizations, the 
                        vastness of the continents... think 
                        it would give me perspective.

                                 TEDDY
                        On what?

                                 LEYNA
                        The future? Life? I won’t know 
                        until I get up there. 

           Teddy’s moved by this. He kisses her.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        Good answer?

                                 TEDDY
                        Great answer.

                                 LEYNA
                        What about you?

                                 TEDDY
                             (thinking a beat)
                        Route 66.

                                 LEYNA
                        What?

                                 TEDDY
                        Historic Route 66--

                                 LEYNA
                        I know what it is. Why?

                                 TEDDY
                        It’s quintessential Americana. 
                        There’s something cool about a road 
                        that connects Chicago to the Santa 
                        Monica Pier.

           Leyna’s not convinced.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        You seem disappointed by my answer.

                                 LEYNA
                        I was expecting something bigger 
                        than... a road.
                                 TEDDY
                        Oh, it’s so much more than a road.

                                 LEYNA
                        I’m listening.

                                 TEDDY
                        Okay, well I may not be as eloquent 
                        as you but it’s history! Sky City, 
                        Grand Canyon, The Petrified Forest. 
                        The list goes on.

                                 LEYNA
                        Yeah, but you could do that now. 
                        The point of the question is that 
                        you have unlimited money and time.

                                 TEDDY
                        So we would stay at the nicest 
                        hotels and drive a Bentley.

                                 LEYNA
                        We?

                                 TEDDY
                        Oh, you’re definitely coming.

                                 LEYNA
                        How about you drive and I’ll fly to 
                        LA and meet you at the Pier?

                                 TEDDY
                        You’ll come around, I can sense it.

                                 LEYNA
                        I probably won’t.

                                 TEDDY
                        Whatever. In reality, I get two 
                        weeks off a year and money is 
                        limited so I like to keep my 
                        vacation dreams somewhat realistic.

           She plays with his hand.

                                 LEYNA
                        Actually, I wanted to talk to you 
                        about that.

                                 TEDDY
                        What? Dreams?

                                 LEYNA
                        Career.
                                 TEDDY
                        Let me guess. You’ve decided to 
                        drop out of business school with 
                        three months left to create the 
                        next Facebook.

                                 LEYNA
                        Not quite.

                                 TEDDY
                        I thought you promised to become a 
                        billionaire so I can quit my job.

                                 LEYNA
                        Fair warning. Once I hit a billion, 
                        I’m going to have a harem of men.

                                 TEDDY
                        A harem, huh? Sounds unsanitary.

                                 LEYNA
                        I’ll make sure you’re all bathed 
                        and fed.

                                 TEDDY
                        Classy. So what did you want to 
                        talk about?

                                 LEYNA
                        What are your thoughts on Redwood 
                        Capital?

                                 TEDDY
                        They’re the most successful venture 
                        capital fund in the world. Why?

           Off her look, Teddy sits up.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Wait, did you get an offer?

                                 LEYNA
                        Maybe.

                                 TEDDY
                        Holy shit! But wait, aren’t they in 
                        San Francisco?

                                 LEYNA
                        They’re setting up a Midwest office 
                        here in Chicago. I’ll be one of 
                        their first employees.
                                 TEDDY
                        That’s amazing! Way to bury the 
                        lede, Jesus! This is a dream job!

                                 LEYNA
                        I know! I’ll get to hunt for the 
                        next unicorn that will hopefully 
                        make the world a better place, and 
                        the best part is I get to stay 
                        here, with you.

                                 TEDDY
                        Everything I want to hear. I’m so 
                        proud of you!

           He hugs her.

                                 LEYNA
                        Well, I haven’t accepted yet.

                                 TEDDY
                        What? Why not?

                                 LEYNA
                        I wanted to get your input first. 
                        So you think I should take it?

                                 TEDDY
                        I mean, that’s up to you but YES!

                                 LEYNA
                        Good, because I was supposed to get 
                        back to them tonight.

                                 TEDDY
                        Go-go-go.

           Leyna grabs her phone.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        We need to celebrate.

           Teddy gets up and rummages through his fridge.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        I’m pretty sure I had a bottle 
                        of... here it is.

           He pulls out a CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE.

                                 LEYNA
                        Don’t you have work tomorrow?
                                 TEDDY
                        Like I said, I’m gonna quit my 
                        shitty job.

                                 LEYNA
                        Thought I needed to make a billion 
                        dollars first.

                                 TEDDY
                        You will.

           He UNCORKS the bottle and--

           INT. TEDDY’S SUITE - NIGHT

           POP! Teddy opens a mini-bottle of champagne from the mini-
           fridge and kicks the door shut.

           He takes a big gulp straight from the bottle and looks out 
           over the St. Louis skyline, a sadness in his eyes.

           EXT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - MORNING

           Teddy packs their stuff into the 4-Runner as Leyna emerges 
           from the hotel.

                                 LEYNA
                        Haven’t had to wake up this early 
                        since before everything froze.

                                 TEDDY
                        Well, hopefully we’ll get back to 
                        those days soon.

                                 LEYNA
                        Want me to drive?

                                 TEDDY
                        That’s okay. I can start us off.

           Leyna gets in shotgun as Teddy slams the trunk shut.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           A clear highway across the PLAIN STATES. Nothing but 
           flatland, prairies, and farms for as far as the eye can see.
           INT. SUV - DAY

           They ride in silence, staring out at the road that stretches 
           to the horizon. It’s a hypnotic monotony when--

           BANG! The sound of a tire FLAPPING. Their SUV starts to rock. 
           Teddy gently steps on the brakes.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - SHOULDER - DAY

           They pull to a stop and get out. Teddy checks the tires -- 
           the left front tire is completely shredded up.

                                 TEDDY
                        Well, tire’s completely gone.

                                 LEYNA
                        Drug dealers need to take better 
                        care of their cars.

                                 TEDDY
                        It’s oddly comforting to know that 
                        major inconveniences still occur.

                                 LEYNA
                        Ever the optimist.

           They look up and down the highway. A single car in each 
           direction. Teddy points to the further one.

                                 TEDDY
                        I’ll check that one?

                                 LEYNA
                        Sure.

           They split up and head towards their respective cars.

           ON TEDDY

           He reaches a SUBARU STATION WAGON carrying a family of four. 
           Two DADS and their young SON and DAUGHTER.

                                 TEDDY
                        Shit.

           ON LEYNA

           Leyna approaches a small Mercedes Cross-Over SUV. She peeks 
           inside to see a PREGNANT MOM driving alone.

                                 LEYNA
                        Oh, no.
           BACK AT THE SUV -- MOMENTS LATER

           Leyna and Teddy reconvene.

                                 TEDDY
                        What you got?

                                 LEYNA
                        One of those smaller Mercedes SUVs 
                        carrying a pregnant mom. You?

                                 TEDDY
                        A family of four in a Subaru.

                                 LEYNA
                        Oh, come on.

                                 TEDDY
                        Yeah...

           They mull the decision.

                                 LEYNA
                        A Subaru would fit more stuff.

                                 TEDDY
                             (defensive)
                        We don’t have that much stuff and 
                        we can grab more on the way.

                                 LEYNA
                        But we can’t leave a pregnant woman 
                        out here all alone.

                                 TEDDY
                        It’s a family of four, Leyna.

                                 LEYNA
                        Mine’s a family of two.

                                 TEDDY
                        Mine’s a gay couple.

                                 LEYNA
                        That shouldn’t-- I mean-- You can’t 
                        assume we’re in hostile territory 
                        just because it’s middle-America.

                                 TEDDY
                        I didn’t. I’m just saying...

           They fall back into a difficult silence.
                                 LEYNA
                        I have an idea.

           STATION WAGON

           Leyna and Teddy move the Son into the middle seat and gently 
           place the Pregnant Woman in his seat.

                                 TEDDY
                        God, they’re going to flip out when 
                        the world unfreezes.

                                 LEYNA
                        Hope the shock doesn’t force her 
                        into labor.

           Leyna wraps the seatbelt around the Pregnant Woman’s belly.

                                 TEDDY
                        At least she won’t be alone. I’ll 
                        grab the rest of our stuff.

           INT. MERCEDES - DAY

           They’re loaded up with Teddy at the wheel.

                                 TEDDY
                        Ready?

                                 LEYNA
                        Let’s do it.

           He shifts the car into gear and hits the gas.

                                 LEYNA (V.O.)
                        Tokyo?!

           INT. TEDDY’S CAR - NIGHT

           WINTER. Teddy hits the brakes in stop-and-go traffic as they 
           head out of pre-frozen Chicago. Leyna looks at him in shock.

                                 TEDDY
                        They said it’s a two-year stint. I 
                        just need to set up shop and get 
                        the local analysts trained up.

                                 LEYNA
                        Those offers are never “just two 
                        years.” I have friends who were 
                        supposed to go for a year five 
                        years ago and they’re still there.
                                 TEDDY
                        Don’t be so dramatic.

                                 LEYNA
                        Dramatic?!

                                 TEDDY
                        Can we just talk this through?
                             (back to the traffic)
                        God, is all of Chicago heading out 
                        of town tonight?

                                 LEYNA
                        Well, are you going to take it?

                                 TEDDY
                        That depends on you.

                                 LEYNA
                        Don’t throw this on my plate.

                                 TEDDY
                        This isn’t a decision to be made 
                        alone. We’re a couple.

                                 LEYNA
                        Moving abroad together is a big 
                        decision, Teddy.

                                 TEDDY
                        I realize that.

                                 LEYNA
                        And I can’t leave my new job after 
                        just two months.

                                 TEDDY
                             (sheepish)
                        Do they have a Tokyo office?

           This sets Leyna off.

                                 LEYNA
                        You are so selfish!

                                 TEDDY
                        What?! I didn’t mean--
                             (honking the horn)
                        Let’s move, buddy!

                                 LEYNA
                        What happens if you don’t?
                                 TEDDY
                        If I don’t what?

                                 LEYNA
                        If you don’t take it.

                                 TEDDY
                        Then they’ll get some other schlub 
                        to go in my place, I guess.

                                 LEYNA
                        But you’re their only Asia analyst.

           Teddy’s stumped. Leyna eyes him.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        You already said yes, didn’t you...

           Caught red-handed, his silence is his answer.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        You are unbelievable!

                                 TEDDY
                        This is huge career opportunity! 
                        I’d be running all of Asia, do you 
                        understand what that means?! No 
                        more graveyard shifts or late-night 
                        calls or flying back and forth 
                        every month. These next two years 
                        could set up the rest of my career!

                                 LEYNA
                        And what about mine?

           A guilty beat from Teddy.

                                 TEDDY
                        Can you at least try and meet me 
                        halfway on this?

                                 LEYNA
                        What does that even mean?!

                                 TEDDY
                             (relenting)
                        I... I don’t know.

                                 LEYNA
                        There is no halfway, Teddy! You 
                        made this decision without me 
                        because you assumed I would just 
                        give up my career and follow you 
                        halfway around the world!
                                 TEDDY
                        That’s not true!

                                 LEYNA
                        Well your actions scream otherwise!

           Teddy SIGHS and shakes his head. The traffic clears up.

                                 TEDDY
                        Finally.

           He steps on the gas.

           EXT. RURAL ILLINOIS - NIGHT

           They drive in silence. The winter air is cold and crisp 
           outside. Snow packs both sides of the desolate highway. Up 
           ahead, there’s a rest stop. Teddy pulls in.

           INT. TEDDY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           He parks in front of the bathrooms.

                                 TEDDY
                        Bathroom break. Need to go?

           Leyna can’t even look at him.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll leave the engine on so please 
                        don’t drive away.

           Still nothing. He steps out and runs into the bathroom.

           EXT. REST STOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Teddy re-emerges to see the car’s lights off and Leyna 
           leaning on the hood, looking up.

                                 TEDDY
                        What are you doing?

                                 LEYNA
                        The stars.

           Teddy looks up. The sky is crystal clear and millions of 
           stars shimmer above them.

                                 TEDDY
                        Whoa.
           He joins her on the hood.

                                 LEYNA
                        This doesn’t mean I’m not still mad 
                        at you.

                                 TEDDY
                        I know.

           It’s hard not to be entranced by the sight.

                                 LEYNA
                        How did you think I was going to 
                        respond to that?

                                 TEDDY
                        Just like you did. Honestly, the 
                        firm didn’t give me much of a 
                        choice. I could turn it down and 
                        search for another job here.

                                 LEYNA
                        Is that what you want?

           Teddy hesitates too long.

                                 TEDDY
                        I want what’s best for us.

                                 LEYNA
                        What does that mean to you?

           Difficulty as Teddy searches for the right words.

                                 TEDDY
                        I don’t know. If it means losing 
                        you, I don’t want to take it, 
                        obviously. But if taking this job 
                        sets us up financially... I know 
                        it’s a massive ask but I would ask 
                        you to make that sacrifice.

                                 LEYNA
                        You know I can’t make that decision 
                        for you. We’re not married. It’s 
                        your career.

                                 TEDDY
                        I know.

           Teddy sighs as he takes in the stars.
                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        You’re right about looking up at 
                        the stars. It gives... perspective.

           Leyna looks at him with a profound sadness. After a beat, she 
           looks back up to the sky--

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           FROZEN WORLD. That same sky, much more brilliant above the 
           deserts of New Mexico. WE TILT DOWN to their Mercedes as it 
           drives down a desolate highway.

           INT. MERCEDES - NIGHT

           Leyna’s at the wheel now as Teddy sleeps in shotgun. She 
           YAWNS and rubs her eyes. She’s getting sleepy so she pulls 
           over. Teddy comes to.

                                 LEYNA
                        How are you feeling?

                                 TEDDY
                        Still tired. How long was I out?

                                 LEYNA
                        My guess? Maybe ten hours.

                                 TEDDY
                        Seriously? I feel like I could 
                        sleep for another day.

                                 LEYNA
                        That settles it then.

                                 TEDDY
                        Settles what?

                                 LEYNA
                        How about we camp out tonight?

           Leyna points up out the window. Teddy leans forward and looks 
           up to see the night sky.

                                 TEDDY
                        Holy hell. Where are we?

                                 LEYNA
                        Halfway to Flagstaff.

                                 TEDDY
                        So we passed Albuquerque already?
                                 LEYNA
                        A couple hours ago.

                                 TEDDY
                        You’re a boss.

                                 LEYNA
                        Got lucky. Nothing but empty road.

           They get out of the car.

           EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - NIGHT

           With the tent set up along with two foldable chairs, Teddy 
           carries a few branches and tumbleweed.

                                 TEDDY
                        This is all I could find.

           He dumps it onto a pile of branches in a makeshift fire-pit.

                                 LEYNA
                        All right, here goes nothing.

           Leyna dowses the pile with lighter fluid and pulls out a 
           lighter. She flicks it a couple times and it LIGHTS UP.

           She brings the flame to the base of the pit and... it starts 
           to burn.

                                 TEDDY
                        Nice!

           She stands back and lets the lighter fluid do the rest of the 
           work. Once it’s going, they take a moment to look around and 
           settle in. Leyna pops open the cooler and hands Teddy a beer.

           EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           They sit by the fire and gaze up at the sky like they did at 
           the rest stop. A dome of stars that stretches from one 
           horizon to the other.

           Teddy drinks it in as Leyna steals glances at him with that 
           same sad look in her eyes.

                                 TEDDY
                        Name one thing you’re thankful for.

                                 LEYNA
                        What do you mean?
                                 TEDDY
                        Being in this frozen mess.

           Leyna takes a beat to think.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Like, I know this sounds bad but 
                        I’m actually thankful for the peace 
                        and quiet. It’s made me realize how 
                        stressed I was, how my mind was 
                        constantly racing, how I was way 
                        too focused on work...

                                 LEYNA
                        You did grind your teeth a lot in 
                        your sleep.

                                 TEDDY
                        Yeah. I feel like I’ve been given a 
                        second chance, you know? To reflect 
                        without all the distractions and 
                        actually string two coherent 
                        thoughts together. I was so tense 
                        and coiled up like a stress-ball 
                        before the freeze...

           He looks to her, earnest and apologetic.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry if I took it out on you.

                                 LEYNA
                        I was no better, but thank you. 
                        That means a lot.

                                 TEDDY
                        So how about you?

                                 LEYNA
                        Time.

           Teddy looks to her, surprised.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        Here. With you.

           Teddy smiles. Thankful as well. He looks back up to the 
           stars. Content in this moment.

           However, Leyna keeps her gaze on him. That sadness lingering 
           in her eyes. She wants to say more... but still can’t get 
           herself to speak up.
                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to turn in.

                                 TEDDY
                        Okay, I’m gonna hang out here a bit 
                        longer if that’s okay.

                                 LEYNA
                        Of course.

           She squeezes his shoulder and heads inside the tent. Teddy 
           finishes his beer and gazes back up at the stars.

           INT. TENT - NIGHT

           Teddy unzips the opening and crawls inside as Leyna lies in 
           her sleeping bag, facing away. She sniffles and quietly wipes 
           her eyes.

                                 TEDDY
                        You okay?

                                 LEYNA
                        I’m fine.

           He lays down next to her.

                                 TEDDY
                        Are you though?

                                 LEYNA
                        It’s nothing.

                                 TEDDY
                        Is it one of those nothings where 
                        I’m supposed to ignore that and 
                        keep asking? Or is it a “leave me 
                        alone” nothing?

           She lets out a sad laugh.

                                 LEYNA
                        If only men could read women’s 
                        minds.

                                 TEDDY
                        I bet it’s a shit-show in there.

           She elbows him.
                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Seriously though, if you want to 
                        talk, I’m kinda the only option you 
                        got unfortunately.

           She rolls over, her eyes wet.

                                 LEYNA
                        It’s just... this whole thing. I 
                        thought I could do it.

                                 TEDDY
                        Do what?

                                 LEYNA
                        Pretend like nothing’s wrong.

                                 TEDDY
                        There’s a lot wrong.

                                 LEYNA
                        I know. I just...

           He reaches for her and draws her in. Whatever she was holding 
           back comes out now. Her sobs grow.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.

           He holds her in silence, gently stroking her head and letting 
           her cry. After a long beat, she pulls back and wipes her 
           tears, trying to play it off.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        God, I’m a mess. 

                                 TEDDY
                        Never.

           They exchange a look. She leans in and kisses him. It’s warm. 
           Comforting. Familiar. They kiss again, more passionately this 
           time as we--

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. TEDDY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           WINTER. Teddy’s on top of Leyna, in the middle of sex. His 
           face buried into the mattress while she faces the ceiling, 
           her eyes closed, trying to concentrate... Mentally, they’re 
           oceans apart. Her concentration breaks. She tries to regain 
           focus but he stops.
                                 TEDDY
                        I’m sorry.

           He lays down next to her, embarrassed... or annoyed?

                                 LEYNA
                        That’s okay.

           Teddy remains silent. He’s clearly bothered.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 TEDDY
                        Nothing.

           This only bugs Leyna more.

                                 LEYNA
                        Can we stop pretending like 
                        nothing’s wrong?

                                 TEDDY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 LEYNA
                        Let me be more clear. Can you stop 
                        pretending like nothing’s wrong?

                                 TEDDY
                        I’m not.

                                 LEYNA
                        We can’t keep kicking the can down 
                        the road forever. You’re leaving in 
                        two months.

                                 TEDDY
                        I’ve told you what I want so really 
                        it’s up to you.

                                 LEYNA
                        That’s not fair, Teddy.

                                 TEDDY
                        I can do long-distance.

                                 LEYNA
                        But you’ve never done it! I have 
                        and even Chicago to Boston was 
                        hard. Tokyo is a world away!

                                 TEDDY
                        So you don’t even want to try.
                                 LEYNA
                        I don’t want my heart broken again 
                        and I’m talking from experience.

                                 TEDDY
                        With a previous boyfriend who isn’t 
                        me. It’s not us.

                                 LEYNA
                        Tokyo is fourteen hours ahead. You 
                        work from six to six while I work 
                        nine to nine. That means we’ll have 
                        maybe a one-hour window in the 
                        mornings to talk.

                                 TEDDY
                        We’ll have weekends.

                                 LEYNA
                        It’s not like I haven’t thought 
                        this through, Teddy. It’s two 
                        years, at least. And I know you 
                        expect me to quit my job and follow 
                        you wherever you go--

                                 TEDDY
                        Now you’re just putting words in my 
                        mouth.

                                 LEYNA
                        But my job is just as important to 
                        me as yours is to you.

                                 TEDDY
                        I know it is.

                                 LEYNA
                        Then act like it!

           Teddy’s defenses start to come up.

                                 TEDDY
                        Hang on. I’ve put in seven years at 
                        my firm. Seven years of slaving 
                        away over late nights and weekends 
                        so I could get an opportunity of a 
                        lifetime like this.

                                 LEYNA
                        But you hate your job!

                                 TEDDY
                        I wouldn’t expect a first-year 
                        analyst to understand, okay?
                                 LEYNA
                        What is that supposed to mean??

                                 TEDDY
                        It means you haven’t been at your 
                        job long enough to deal with the 
                        politics and bullshit that comes 
                        with any job so excuse me if I take 
                        your idealistic view on career 
                        strategy with a grain of salt.

                                 LEYNA
                        You are being such an asshole right 
                        now! I’m sorry that I love my job 
                        and can’t commiserate with you on 
                        how miserable work is!

                                 TEDDY
                        Give it three years. Then we’ll see 
                        if you still use “love” and “job” 
                        in the same sentence.

           Leyna’s taken aback by his flippant vitriol.

                                 LEYNA
                        Why are you so desperate to drag me 
                        down with you?

                                 TEDDY
                        Because I don’t understand why you 
                        won’t come with me! Or do long-
                        distance! Or even try!

                                 LEYNA
                        Because I know how that ends.

                                 TEDDY
                        No, you’re just going to turn it 
                        into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

                                 LEYNA
                        You’re asking me to choose between 
                        my career and chasing you.

                                 TEDDY
                        No, I’m not!

                                 LEYNA
                        You are and we’re talking in 
                        circles now.
                                 TEDDY
                        Well, why can’t you do the same job 
                        in Tokyo? There are plenty of 
                        venture capital firms out there.

                                 LEYNA
                        Because I’ve already invested in 
                        three companies which could change 
                        the landscapes of healthcare, clean 
                        tech, and AI--

                                 TEDDY
                        Oh my god, stop convincing yourself 
                        that you’re changing the world. You 
                        know ninety-nine percent of those 
                        companies go bust before they ever 
                        make it to market. Most are just 
                        pie in the sky ideas with great 
                        pitchmen who collect investments 
                        from naive idealists like you.

           He’s crossed the line. A stab at Leyna’s pride.

                                 LEYNA
                        And what do you do besides analyze 
                        some stock to see if its price will 
                        go up a point? Real noble work.

           Shots fired. Teddy’s hurt and it shows. Leyna quickly reins 
           it in.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean that.

           He gets out of bed.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

                                 TEDDY
                        I can’t be here right now.

           Teddy gets dressed.

                                 LEYNA
                        Teddy...

           He puts his shoes on and storms out.

           INT. TENT - MORNING

           Teddy awakens, his face riddled with guilt. He looks over at 
           Leyna, who sleeps peacefully with her naked back to him.
           He reaches for her when suddenly, SHE GLITCHES.

           Teddy freezes.

           She glitches again -- in and out of existence -- like a buggy 
           computer program. He reels back as Leyna comes to. She yawns 
           and rolls over to him.

                                 LEYNA
                        Morning...
                             (off his horrified look)
                        What’s wrong?

           Teddy scrambles to open the tent.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

           He rushes out.

           EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - MORNING

           He sprints over to the car, rips the door open, and grabs the 
           hunting knife as Leyna emerges from the tent.

                                 LEYNA
                        What are you doing?

                                 TEDDY
                        What are you?!

                                 LEYNA
                        What?! I’m me. Leyna!

                                 TEDDY
                        Bullshit! I just saw you glitch 
                        like some... hologram!

           Leyna freezes. Beat.

           Her tone changes.

                                 LEYNA
                        Teddy...

                                 TEDDY
                        Stop and answer the goddamn 
                        question! What is this place?!

           She mulls how to answer this, and lets out a heavy SIGH.
                                 LEYNA
                        It was supposed to be a way for me 
                        to get closure.

                                 TEDDY
                        Closure? For what?

                                 LEYNA
                        Our relationship. For us.

                                 TEDDY
                        What are you talking about?!

                                 LEYNA
                        The night you proposed...

           Teddy furrows his brow.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Teddy and Squid sit in a booth.

                                 SQUID
                        I mean, if you want me to be real, 
                        you kinda brought this on yourself.

                                 TEDDY
                        How?

                                 SQUID
                        You don’t have to go to Tokyo.

                                 TEDDY
                        Dude, you sound just like her.

           Squid shrugs.

                                 SQUID
                        Well?

                                 TEDDY
                        They made it clear that if I want 
                        to move up in the firm, I gotta 
                        earn my stripes abroad.

                                 SQUID
                        So go to another hedge fund.

                                 TEDDY
                        It’s not that easy.
                                 SQUID
                        If you ask me, it sounds like 
                        you’re choosing your career over 
                        your relationship. And I’m guessing 
                        that’s how it sounds to her, too.

                                 TEDDY
                        Says the guy who’s never been in a 
                        real relationship.

                                 SQUID
                        By choice, baby. To avoid 
                        emotionally taxing decisions like 
                        this until I’m ready to get 
                        serious.

                                 TEDDY
                        How’s this for getting serious?

           Teddy pulls out a RING BOX and puts it on the table. Squid 
           reels back like it’s garlic to a vampire.

                                 SQUID
                        Oh, bro. Put that away.

                                 TEDDY
                        What? Why?

                                 SQUID
                        ‘Cuz that shit feels mad forced. 
                        Are you kidding me right now?

                                 TEDDY
                        I gotta do it.

                                 SQUID
                        Let me ask you this. If you weren’t 
                        moving abroad, would you still 
                        propose to her right now?

           Teddy hesitates a beat, which is all Squid needs.

                                 SQUID (CONT’D)
                        See?

                                 TEDDY
                        Timing is everything.

                                 SQUID
                        Yes! Timing is everything.

           Teddy shoves the ring box back in his pocket.
                                 TEDDY
                        Thought you’d be more supportive.

                                 SQUID
                        I am being supportive by giving you 
                        my honest opinion.

                                 TEDDY
                        So what am I doing wrong?

           Squid sighs.

                                 SQUID
                        Listen, she could’ve gotten a job 
                        in Silicon Valley for more money 
                        and a better career track but she 
                        chose to stay in Chicago. For you.

                                 TEDDY
                        But it’s different. I didn’t throw 
                        down an ultimatum like it’s me or 
                        her job. She could’ve moved to San 
                        Francisco and I would’ve dealt with 
                        it. Because that’s what you do to 
                        make a relationship work.

           Squid rolls his eyes and drops his head.

                                 SQUID
                        You don’t get it, man.

                                 TEDDY
                        I gotta do this. I can’t lose her.

                                 SQUID
                        Don’t put this on me if it doesn’t 
                        end well.

                                 TEDDY
                        I will definitely take it out on 
                        you. Wish me luck.

           Teddy turns to head out.

                                 SQUID
                        Fifth grade. Maddy Walker.

           Teddy stops.

                                 TEDDY
                        Why are you bringing that up?
                                 SQUID
                        ‘Cuz you asked me if you should ask 
                        her to be your girlfriend, and I 
                        already knew that she didn’t like 
                        you, but I was afraid of hurting 
                        your feelings so I said do what you 
                        want. Then, after you got rejected, 
                        you found out I knew all along and 
                        wouldn’t talk to me for an entire 
                        month because I didn’t warn you.

                                 TEDDY
                        Yeah, so?

                                 SQUID
                        I’m warning you.

           Teddy thinks a beat, then--

                                 TEDDY
                        Wish you had kept that to yourself. 
                        I like the supportive Squid better.

                                 SQUID
                        I’m trying to be.

                                 TEDDY
                        Well, you can be supportive by 
                        inviting our friends over to my 
                        place this Friday after I propose.

           With that, Teddy walks out. Squid watches him exit like a 
           dead man walking.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Leyna walks away from Teddy, who’s down on bended knee. Tears 
           stream down her face as she exits the restaurant.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Teddy sits at the light, texting her over and over. The light 
           turns green as he types away but he’s too distraught to 
           notice. The car behind him TAPS his horn but Teddy keeps 
           texting. He’s holding up traffic now. The car HONKS, longer 
           and louder this time as the light turns yellow.

                                 TEDDY
                        All right! Christ!

           He sends the text and steps on the GAS but the light is RED. 
           A TRUCK comes barreling through the intersection--
           SMASH!!!

           The CRUNCH of twisting metal. In this version, the truck 
           doesn’t just clip his rear bumper -- he’s T-boned HEAD-ON. 
           His car crumples from the impact and SLAMS into a light pole.

           FROM ABOVE:

           His HORN blares. The car is flattened into an impossible 
           sliver. The TRUCK DRIVER stumbles out of his cab and rushes 
           over to Teddy’s window. He GASPS and collapses to the ground 
           as a CROWD gathers to help. We can’t see inside but from 
           their reaction, we know it’s bad.

           EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - MORNING

           Teddy stands there in shock, shaking his head in disbelief.

                                 TEDDY
                        That truck clipped my car and I 
                        spun out. I walked away.

                                 LEYNA
                        No... You didn’t.

                                 TEDDY
                        The engagement party back at my 
                        place. Squid. Our friends.

           Leyna shakes her head.

                                 LEYNA
                        The algorithm takes real memories 
                        and builds new ones off of them.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Leyna sprints down the hallway in a panic. She asks a NURSE 
           who points her around the corner.

           INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

           She arrives but it’s too late. A SURGEON comes out to tell 
           her that Teddy has died. She stands frozen in shock.

           EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY

           Teddy stands there with that same look of shock.
                                 TEDDY
                        No... No, I don’t believe you.

                                 LEYNA
                        It’s true.

           Leyna takes a step towards him.

                                 TEDDY
                        So then this is...?

                                 LEYNA
                        A place someone built for people 
                        like me. People who don’t know how 
                        to move on.

           Something’s starting to click in Teddy’s brain. Tears start 
           to stream down his face.

                                 TEDDY
                        Why would you do this?

                                 LEYNA
                        Because it’s all my fault. Had I 
                        picked up your call... Had I just 
                        picked up the first time...

           Leyna starts to cry.

                                 TEDDY
                        No! You don’t get to do that!

           Leyna tries to choke back tears but they keep coming.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        You don’t get to grieve when I’m 
                        standing right in front of you!

           It’s all too much for Teddy to process. He takes the hunting 
           knife and slices his forearm.

                                 LEYNA
                        What are you doing?!

           His arm starts to gush blood and he winces at the pain.

                                 TEDDY
                        You’re telling me this isn’t real??

                                 LEYNA
                        Please don’t!

           He does it again, drawing another line down his flesh. It 
           splits open and begins to spurt blood.
                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        STOP!

           He gets inside the car and starts the engine.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        Teddy!

           He peels out and takes off down the highway. WE STAY ON LEYNA 
           as she crumples to the sand.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Leyna stands there alone, frozen in shock, as the world 
           around her slows. Squid arrives along with a few other close 
           friends but WE STAY ON HER as the background changes to--

           INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

           Friends and family mourn Teddy’s death. Leyna remains frozen 
           in shock as the mourners fade away and the background once 
           again changes to--

           INT. TEDDY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           She stands in front of Teddy’s bed in the midst of boxing up 
           her things when she collapses and starts to BAWL. She 
           clenches the sheets as her body expels all the pain.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Leyna sits in the bathtub, knees to her chest, as the water 
           pours over her. Her face numb from all the crying.

           INT. PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           A PSYCHIATRIST talks to her but she can’t hear him. In fact, 
           he’s blurred out-of-focus and his voice is muffled just like 
           everyone else’s.

           She’s despondent, unmoved, unable to feel--

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:
           INT. BOARDROOM - DAY

           The same look. WE PULL BACK to reveal a boardroom where Leyna 
           sits with her co-workers. Someone’s talking but again, it’s 
           muffled and out of focus. She stares into nothingness when--

                                 BOSS (O.S.)
                        Leyna.

           Her BOSS (50) turns to her and she snaps out of her trance.

                                 LEYNA
                        Yes?

                                 BOSS
                        Joji was asking a question.

           Leyna looks over at JOJI (32), a handsome unassuming type, 
           who’s in the midst of giving a presentation to the team.

                                 LEYNA
                        I’m sorry Joji, what was the...?

           Joji sees her having trouble and covers for her.

                                 JOJI
                        It’s okay. I’ll follow up later.

           As she fades back to despondence, we turn our attention to 
           the presentation Joji has on-screen. It’s a live-feed of New 
           York City at ground-level. Taxis drive by. Horns honk. 
           Pedestrians battle the summer heat.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        So, our team has started the world-
                        building phase for each Playground 
                        as seen here. So far, we’ve built 
                        New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago 
                        with more cities to come over the 
                        next six months. As you can see, 
                        it’s photo-real with sight, sound, 
                        touch, taste and smell replicated 
                        to exact specs...

           Joji holds up an earpod.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        You enter the Playground using this 
                        connector, as Osahon will show us.

           He hands it to his teammate, OSAHON (30), who sits in a 
           chair. Osahon takes the earpod and places it in his ear. It 
           glows a soft blue, his eyes close, and his body slumps in the 
           chair. He’s out like a light.
           Osahon then pops up on-screen inside VR New York.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        It’s that simple.

           IMPRESSED MURMURS from everyone.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        Now, because the VR playground 
                        operates in hyper-speed, one second 
                        is equal to six hours inside, so...

           The live-feed moves in super fast-forward and stops. As 
           quickly as Osahon passed out, he re-awakens.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        Welcome back, O.

                                 OSAHON
                        Good to be back.

                                 JOJI
                        How long were you inside?

                                 OSAHON
                        Twenty-four hours.

           Very IMPRESSED MURMURS from the investors.

                                 JOJI
                        And who did you meet with?

                                 OSAHON
                        Just our teammate Sarah, who’s back 
                        at the lab.

           The screen changes to a live-feed of a LAB where a team of 
           SCIENTISTS huddle around SARAH (27). She waves to the camera.

                                 SARAH (ON SCREEN)
                        Hey guys.

                                 JOJI
                        Hey, Sarah. How are you feeling?

                                 SARAH (ON SCREEN)
                        Good, thanks. It was good catching 
                        up in the Playground, O.

                                 OSAHON
                        Likewise.
                                 JOJI
                        There we have it. In four seconds, 
                        Osahon and Sarah were able to enter 
                        the Playground, meet up, and spend 
                        an entire day inside, all of which 
                        was recorded on our feed which we 
                        will show you later...

           An excited energy permeates throughout the room.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        And so there we have it. Our first 
                        successful beta test.

           The room ERUPTS in APPLAUSE, jolting Leyna back to reality. 
           Joji clocks this.

           INT. LEYNA’S OFFICE - DAY

           As Leyna retreats to her office, Joji KNOCKS on her door.

                                 LEYNA
                        Hey, come in.

                                 JOJI
                        How you doing?

                                 LEYNA
                        Great! What you’ve created is truly 
                        a game-changer. I’m speechless.

                                 JOJI
                        Thanks, but I meant... how are you 
                        doing?

           Leyna’s mood shifts. She looks at Joji, his face still fixed 
           with concern. She opens her mouth, ready to spew out the next 
           lie, but his look makes her hesitate.

                                 LEYNA
                        Honestly? I don’t know how to 
                        answer that.

           Joji sits down across from her.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        It’s been over a year and some days 
                        are better than others...

           He nods in support.
                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        But that shouldn’t be your concern. 
                        I need you to stay focused on your 
                        company and creating the future.

                                 JOJI
                        You were the only investor to 
                        believe in us. Without you, we’d be 
                        nothing, so your well-being is my 
                        concern. And my company’s concern.

                                 LEYNA
                        I appreciate that and I’m sorry if 
                        I don’t seem present--

                                 JOJI
                        Don’t ever apologize for your 
                        grief.

           She looks at him, surprised and thankful.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        You know, I lost my mother when I 
                        was twelve.

                                 LEYNA
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t know that.

                                 JOJI
                        It was sudden. Her heart just 
                        failed one day and she was gone...

           This strikes a chord with Leyna.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        That void never goes away, not 
                        really. In fact, I missed her so 
                        much that I tried to rebuild her.

                                 LEYNA
                        What?

                                 JOJI
                        I was a dumb kid with a penchant 
                        for programming, so I collected her 
                        social media profiles, hacked all 
                        her e-mails, voice recordings, 
                        anything I could find, and 
                        Frankenstein’ed this Siri-like 
                        voice app. Even added her profile 
                        pic with a moving mouth to it.

                                 LEYNA
                        Did it work?
                                 JOJI
                        It was rudimentary. I programmed 
                        her to learn from questions and 
                        adapt, but again, I was twelve. The 
                        most she could do was tell me the 
                        weather or read Google searches...

           He lets out a small, sad chuckle.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        But it helped me cope, especially 
                        on the days when all I wanted to do 
                        was simply give her one last hug.

           There’s something endearing about him.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        And then that led me to wonder, 
                        what if I could create a virtual 
                        space where real people could 
                        interact with each other? Not just 
                        through a pair of goggles but with 
                        all five senses. Hence, the 
                        Playground was born. And it all 
                        came from me wanting to hug my dead 
                        mother. Morbid, I know.

                                 LEYNA
                        No, that’s really sweet. Why 
                        haven’t you told that story before?

                                 JOJI
                        I guess I wasn’t ready to share 
                        that part of me with anyone... 
                        until now.

           Leyna eyes Joji a beat. He stands.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, I should go. I’ll send a 
                        progress update next week.

                                 LEYNA
                        Thanks.

           He stops at the door and turns back.

                                 JOJI
                        The void may never be filled, but 
                        it does get better.
           Leyna responds with a thankful nod. He exits and closes the 
           door behind him--

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY

           Leyna SMASHES the back window of a car open with a rock. She 
           crawls inside and unlocks the door.

           She moves the DRIVER over to the passenger seat and takes off 
           down the highway after Teddy.

           INT. LEYNA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           WINTER. Leyna and her roommate, EMI (31), sit in sweatpants 
           and watch a horror movie. Emi cowers behind a pillow.

                                 EMI
                        Why do we do this to ourselves?

                                 LEYNA
                        I really don’t know.

                                 EMI
                        We should go out.

                                 LEYNA
                        To where?

                                 EMI
                        I don’t know. A bar?

                                 LEYNA
                        That’s worse than a horror movie.

           Emi pauses the movie and turns to Leyna, her tone cautious.

                                 EMI
                        I think it’s time.

           Leyna rolls her eyes.

                                 EMI (CONT’D)
                        It’s been almost two years.

                                 LEYNA
                        I’ve tried.

                                 EMI
                        Have you?
           This stumps Leyna when her PHONE buzzes with a text. Joji’s 
           corporate photo pops up on-screen. Emi grabs it.

                                 EMI (CONT’D)
                             (attracted)
                        Who is this?

                                 LEYNA
                        Give it back.

                                 EMI
                        Not until you answer.

                                 LEYNA
                        He’s the founder of one of the 
                        start-ups we seeded. Now gimme.

           Emi types in Leyna’s passcode and unlocks the phone.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        Uhh, since when do you know my 
                        password?

                                 EMI
                        We’re roommates.

                                 LEYNA
                        That’s not okay.

                                 EMI
                        He’s asking what you’re doing 
                        tonight.

                                 LEYNA
                        No, he’s not.

                                 EMI
                             (talking out her typing)
                        “Not much. You?”

                                 LEYNA
                        Emi!

           WHOOSH. The text is sent. Leyna snatches the phone back.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe you just did that.

                                 EMI
                        He’s obviously interested.

                                 LEYNA
                        It’s not like that.
                                 EMI
                        Really? Because I don’t have any 
                        work people texting me at nine PM 
                        on a Saturday night.

           BZZZ. A reply.

           JOJI: I hope I’m not being inappropriate but would you like 
           to grab a drink tonight?

           Leyna blushes.

                                 EMI (CONT’D)
                        He ask you out?

                                 LEYNA
                        No.

                                 EMI
                        Liar.

                                 LEYNA
                        It’s inappropriate.

                                 EMI
                        Just say yes.

           Leyna GRUMBLES.

                                 EMI (CONT’D)
                        I know I’m being annoying but I’m 
                        doing this because I love you.

                                 LEYNA
                             (relenting)
                        I know.

                                 EMI
                        Worst case, you turn around and 
                        come right back home to me.

           Leyna hesitates.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Leyna enters to find Joji waiting in a booth. He stands to 
           greet her.

                                 LEYNA
                        Hey.

                                 JOJI
                        Thanks for coming out.
           He offers her a seat as a SERVER approaches. Joji looks to 
           Leyna.

                                 LEYNA
                        Club soda with lime, please.

                                 JOJI
                        Two.

                                 LEYNA
                        Oh, you can drink. Don’t mind me.

                                 JOJI
                        That’s okay. I’m happy to just sit 
                        and chat.

           Just then, another Server brings over a cheesy-looking punch 
           bowl with two straws in it.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        Oh, we didn’t order this.

                                 SERVER
                        No, they did for the entire bar.

           The Server points to a smiley OLD COUPLE at another booth.

                                 SERVER (CONT’D)
                        They come here every year to  
                        celebrate their anniversary. This 
                        is the first drink they had 
                        together, so enjoy!

           The Old Couple wave to Joji and Leyna. They wave back and 
           everyone starts to CLAP and congratulate the old pair.

           They turn to the bowl. A straw for each of them.

                                 JOJI
                        Well...

                                 LEYNA
                        That is really sweet.

                                 JOJI
                        It is.

                                 LEYNA
                        I’ll feel bad if I don’t at least 
                        take a sip.

                                 JOJI
                        Yeah, I’m really bad with parental 
                        guilt. Are they still looking?
                                 LEYNA
                        They’re literally watching every 
                        table to make sure they take a 
                        drink from it.

                                 JOJI
                        In a creepy or cute way?

                                 LEYNA
                        Like a cult ritual suicide way?

           Releasing the straw from his mouth--

                                 JOJI
                        Well, that settles that.

                                 LEYNA
                        I’m sorry. That was dark.

                                 JOJI
                        I like this side of you.

           They exchange a glance. The Old Couple look to their table.

                                 LEYNA
                        Oh, they’re looking at us.

                                 JOJI
                        Please, after you.

                                 LEYNA
                        Together?

                                 JOJI
                        Sure.

           They lean in at the same time and drink.

                                 LEYNA
                        Actually, not bad.

                                 JOJI
                        Very... fruity.

           They wave back at the Old Couple, point to the drink and 
           mouth, “thank you.” The Old Couple return their smiles and 
           the Old Man gives a thumbs up.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        Yep, they definitely poisoned us.

           Leyna LAUGHS which brings a smile to Joji’s face.
           EXT. BAR - NIGHT

           As patrons come and go, through the window we see Leyna and 
           Teddy talk the night away. It’s a lively conversation and the 
           first time we’ve seen Leyna LAUGH this much since Teddy died.

           INT. LEYNA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Leyna returns home, waking Emi up on the couch. 

                                 EMI
                             (groggy)
                        Hey, babe.

                                 LEYNA
                        I’m sorry. Didn’t mean to wake you.

                                 EMI
                        Mama wanted to wait up for you.

                                 LEYNA
                        You’re the best.

           Leyna joins Emi on the couch and lays down on her. Emi wraps 
           her arms around Leyna and strokes her hair.

                                 EMI
                        So how did it go?

                                 LEYNA
                             (beat)
                        It went.

           Emi smiles.

                                 EMI
                        That’s what mama likes to hear.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. LEYNA’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Leyna gets dressed for another night out when Emi walks in.

                                 EMI
                        Out again?

                                 LEYNA
                        Maybe.

                                 EMI
                        Two nights this week. Same guy?
                                 LEYNA
                        Yes, but it’s not like that.

                                 EMI
                        That shade of lipstick says 
                        otherwise.

                                 LEYNA
                        Go away.

                                 EMI
                        Can’t. Need to pee.

           EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- NIGHT

           MONTAGE:

           -Leyna meets with Joji at a restaurant. They have a lively, 
           animated conversation.

           -The conversation continues at a bar. They sit a bit closer.

           -Now they’re the last ones sitting at a third bar, engrossed 
           in each other’s company.

           EXT. LEYNA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Joji walks Leyna home. Their breaths visible in the cold air. 
           They pull up to Leyna’s apartment.

                                 LEYNA
                        Well, here’s me.

                                 JOJI
                        I had a lot of fun tonight.

                                 LEYNA
                        So did I. Thanks for inviting me... 
                        I needed that.

                                 JOJI
                        Me, too.

           Beat. Their faces close, Joji leans in and kisses her. After 
           a beat, she pulls back.

                                 LEYNA
                        I’m sorry.

                                 JOJI
                        No, I’m sorry.
                                 LEYNA
                        It’s just with work and 
                        everything...

                                 JOJI
                        Right. You’re right.

           They exchange another look. Joji offers a warm smile. 
           Suddenly, she kisses him. Now he’s the one to pull back.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        Are you sure?

           INT. LEYNA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           They burst into the apartment and rush over to her bedroom.

           INT. LEYNA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They shut the door and start undressing each other when Joji 
           pulls back again.

                                 JOJI
                        Tell me if my checking in gets 
                        annoying but I just wanna make sure 
                        you’re sure--

                                 LEYNA
                        I appreciate that and yes.

           They get back to it. They fall onto the bed and she pulls the 
           covers over them as we PUSH-IN ON the frost-covered windows--

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           SUMMER.

           WE PULL BACK from the windows, now open with the fan on full-
           blast. Leyna and Joji lay there, sweaty, naked, entwined. 
           Leyna’s hair is much shorter now.

                                 JOJI
                        Water?

                                 LEYNA
                        Yes, please.

           Joji gets up and we see that it’s a different bedroom. He 
           steps out naked into--
           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           --a different apartment. The living room is filled with both 
           of their things. They’ve moved into a new place together.

           He pours a glass of water and returns to the bedroom.

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           He hands her the glass.

                                 LEYNA
                        Thanks.

                                 JOJI
                        Oh, there’s one other thing.

                                 LEYNA
                        What?

           He gets down on one knee, still naked. Leyna sits up.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        Wait, what are you doing?

           From behind his back, he pulls out a ring box.

                                 JOJI
                        Leyna, it’s been four years since 
                        we first met and three incredible 
                        years since we started dating. I 
                        can’t imagine spending my life with 
                        anyone else. Will you marry me?

           Leyna GASPS, frozen in shock a beat too long.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        Please... say something.

                                 LEYNA
                             (beat)
                        Yes. Yes!

           Joji exhales relief and gives her a huge hug. He puts the 
           ring on her and they kiss--

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Teddy down on one knee as Leyna walks away.
           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Teddy texts furiously, oblivious of the truck as headlights 
           barrel down on him--

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Leyna JUMPS AWAKE in a cold sweat. Joji wakes up beside her.

                                 JOJI
                        You okay?

                                 LEYNA
                             (lying)
                        Yeah. Bathroom.

           She gets up and walks out of the room.

                                 EMI (V.O.)
                        Another nightmare?

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Leyna paces around, on the phone to Emi.

                                 LEYNA
                        Ever since Joji proposed, they’ve 
                        returned. It’s like--

                                 EMI (V.O.)
                        Nothing. It’s nothing. Don’t let 
                        that guilt back into your life. 
                        You’ve suffered enough. You’re 
                        allowed to be happy.

                                 LEYNA
                        But what if I’m not?

                                 EMI (V.O.)
                        That’s it. I’m coming over.

                                 LEYNA
                        No, no. It’s fine.

                                 EMI
                        Are you fine?

           Off Leyna’s silence--

                                 EMI (CONT’D)
                        I think there’s someone you should 
                        talk to.
           EXT. CAFE - DAY

           Leyna sits and waits nervously at a table outside.

                                 SQUID (O.S.)
                        Leyna.

           Leyna turns to see Squid. Five years older and more refined 
           than when we first met him. He carries a NEWBORN BABY in a 
           sling on his chest.

                                 LEYNA
                             (looking at the baby)
                        Oh my god.

                                 SQUID
                        I know, right?

           He goes in for a hug, the baby between them.

                                 LEYNA
                        When you said baby, I assumed it 
                        was a woman.

                                 SQUID
                        Well, she is a girl so technically 
                        you’re not wrong. It’s mama’s day 
                        off so papa’s running defense for 
                        baby Misa.

                                 LEYNA
                        Misa. That’s a pretty name.

                                 SQUID
                        Thanks, I chose it.

           EXT. CAFE - LATER

           They sit at the table, eating and talking.

                                 SQUID
                        Been married two years now and this 
                        one came along six months ago.

                                 LEYNA
                             (disbelief)
                        Squid is a father.

                                 SQUID
                        I know, I know.

                                 LEYNA
                        I think it’s great.
                                 SQUID
                        It’s a work in progress. So how 
                        have you been?

                                 LEYNA
                        Well...

           Leyna holds up her engagement ring.

                                 SQUID
                        Oh, whaaat! Congrats!

                                 LEYNA
                        Thanks.

                                 SQUID
                        Who’s the lucky guy?

                                 LEYNA
                        We met through work.

                                 SQUID
                        That’s great to hear, honestly. I’m 
                        really happy for you.

           Off her hesitance--

                                 SQUID (CONT’D)
                        Right?

                                 LEYNA
                        No, it is great. He’s really great. 
                        It’s just... I’ve been seeing Teddy 
                        in my dreams. Nightmares, actually.

           Squid deflates.

                                 SQUID
                        I see.

                                 LEYNA
                        With all of the therapy and grief 
                        counseling, I thought I had made 
                        peace with what happened, but...

                                 SQUID
                        It took me awhile, too. But it’s 
                        been five years, Leyna.

                                 LEYNA
                        I know.
                                 SQUID
                        It’s okay to move on. He would’ve 
                        wanted you to. And that’s coming 
                        from his best friend, so you know 
                        it’s the truth.

           Leyna nods but it’s still hard for her.

                                 LEYNA
                        I’m sorry I cut you guys off.

                                 SQUID
                        Don’t be.

                                 LEYNA
                        It was so kind of you to reach out 
                        and check on me but I just didn’t 
                        know how to--

                                 SQUID
                        We all grieve differently. It’s 
                        water under the bridge.

           Baby Misa starts to cry.

                                 SQUID (CONT’D)
                        Uh oh, someone’s awake...

           Leyna watches fondly as Squid bounces his baby.

                                 LEYNA
                        You really do make a great father.

                                 SQUID
                        Hold that judgment ‘til you see me 
                        change a diaper. It’s a disaster. 
                        Speaking of...

           Squid checks her diaper.

                                 SQUID (CONT’D)
                        Yep. She always does this at the 
                        worst possible moment. It’s like 
                        she knows.

           The Server brings the bill and Leyna pays for it.

                                 SQUID (CONT’D)
                        Hey, no. Let’s split it.

                                 LEYNA
                        That’s okay. I should let you go.
                                 SQUID
                        Sorry about that. This girl drops 
                        some serious bombs. It’s a public 
                        health hazard.

                                 LEYNA
                        Please don’t tell her that once 
                        she’s of age.

                                 SQUID
                        What fun is it being a dad if you 
                        can’t embarrass your kid?

                                 LEYNA
                        Thanks again for meeting me.

                                 SQUID
                        Anytime. And I mean that.

           They stand and give each other a big hug.

                                 SQUID (CONT’D)
                        We should do this again, seriously. 
                        You can meet wifey next time.

                                 LEYNA
                        I’d like that.

           Squid grabs his things and looks to her, sympathetic.

                                 SQUID
                        Not sure this helps but it’s not 
                        your fault, Leyna. None of us ever 
                        thought that.

           Leyna’s heart silently breaks. She forces a thankful smile.

                                 LEYNA
                        Bye, Squid.

           Squid nods and goes on his way.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Leyna SNAPS AWAKE again. Those same panicky breaths. Cold 
           sweat. Joji wakes up more urgently this time.

                                 JOJI
                        Leyna--

                                 LEYNA
                             (between gasps)
                        I’m fine.
                                 JOJI
                        You can barely breathe. I’m taking 
                        you to the hospital.

                                 LEYNA
                        No, don’t.

           Joji begrudgingly relents as Leyna struggles to catch her 
           breath. He rubs her back, too concerned to let it go.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES - DAY

           FROZEN WORLD. As Leyna drives down the highway, the Los 
           Angeles skyline comes into view. Beyond it, the BLACK WALL.

           Leyna’s eyes widen. It’s a surreal sight.

           INT. LAB - NIGHT

           Leyna enters a high-tech lab. The HUM of fans cooling 
           servers. Multiple computer screens line a long desk.

           Joji sits at the main terminal, the glow from the computer 
           lighting his face.

                                 LEYNA
                        You look like an evil genius 
                        sitting alone in the dark here.

           He doesn’t bite on the joke.

                                 JOJI
                        Hey.

           They kiss and she sits down on the couch, perplexed.

                                 LEYNA
                        So, why did you ask to meet here?

           An uncomfortable look from Joji.

                                 JOJI
                        When I came up with the initial 
                        concept for the Playground, it was 
                        so people could hyper-speed date in 
                        a safe space, right?

                                 LEYNA
                        Right.
                                 JOJI
                        Creating the world was straight-
                        forward. Trees, food, cars, etc. 
                        They’re all either static objects 
                        or repeat some basic function. Easy 
                        to program, easy to manage. The 
                        most difficult part was creating 
                        convincing background actors that 
                        humans could interact with at shops 
                        and on the streets--

                                 LEYNA
                        Because human beings are the most 
                        complex decision-making systems in 
                        the universe.

                                 JOJI
                        Exactly.

           Off his reticence--

                                 LEYNA
                        What is it, Joji?

                                 JOJI
                        Remember I told you how I created 
                        an avatar of my mom after she died?

                                 LEYNA
                        Yeah.

                                 JOJI
                        Okay, well...

           He presses ENTER. A WOMAN (35) pops up on-screen.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        Say hi to my mom.

           Photo-real like she’s on the other end of a FaceTime call, 
           moving around, waiting for someone to speak.

           Leyna’s impressed by how realistic Joji’s Mom looks.

                                 LEYNA
                        Is this your original rendition?

                                 JOJI
                        No, I updated it recently.

                                 LEYNA
                        Why?
                                 JOJI
                             (beat)
                        I wanted to see if I could hug her.

           Leyna, perplexed. Joji presses ENTER and the screen changes 
           to a VIDEO of Joji talking with his Mom at a restaurant.

           Leyna watches in shock.

                                 LEYNA
                        Where is this...?

                                 JOJI
                        Inside the Playground. Last week.

           ON VIDEO: a teary Joji hugs his Mom.

           Joji presses ENTER and the video cuts out. He turns to Leyna, 
           who’s still in shock.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s crazy. It’s been over 
                        twenty years but being able to tell 
                        her about you and say goodbye -- 
                        really say goodbye -- in person... 
                        It was the most cathartic thing 
                        I’ve ever experienced.

                                 LEYNA
                        So you performed a Turing test on 
                        yourself in the Playground?

                                 JOJI
                             (nodding)
                        And she passed with flying colors.

                                 LEYNA
                        Why are you telling me this?

           The difficult part...

                                 JOJI
                        I built him.

                                 LEYNA
                        Who?

           Joji’s look says it all. He presses a key on his computer and 
           TEDDY pops up on-screen. Leyna GASPS in horror.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        No...
                                 JOJI
                        Just hear me out--

                                 LEYNA
                        Why would you do that??

           Joji can see the terror in her eyes.

                                 JOJI
                        Because I don’t want to see you in 
                        pain anymore.

                                 LEYNA
                        This is not the way. This is not 
                        how we’re supposed to grieve.

                                 JOJI
                        Says who?

           They exchange a heavy look. Hers scared, his worried.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been having the same 
                        nightmare for the last eight months 
                        but you won’t talk about it or seek 
                        professional help--

                                 LEYNA
                        Stop.

           He gives her a beat to process. She turns away from the 
           screen, confused and scared.

                                 JOJI
                        All I know is, after seeing my mom 
                        inside, that little tiny void in my 
                        heart, the one I thought would 
                        never go away, is gone. And I feel 
                        so much better.

           Leyna looks back at Teddy’s face on-screen with a mix of 
           confusion and fear and anger.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        It’s up to you. Say the word and 
                        I’ll delete the program and we’ll 
                        never speak of it again. But I just 
                        need to believe that you’re all in 
                        on us and not hung up on the past.

           Leyna considers this for a beat but she grabs her bag and 
           storms out the door instead.
                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        Leyna, wait!

           She’s gone. Joji drops his head.

           EXT. NORTH AVENUE BEACH - NIGHT

           Leyna walks along the beach as YOUNG LEYNA AND TEDDY walk and 
           talk behind her, ice creams in hand. Her heart sinks a bit.

           EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The neon sign bathes Leyna in blue and red. As she passes by, 
           we see LEYNA AND TEDDY sitting inside the window, cracking up 
           at something. Her heart sinks a bit more.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Leyna stands outside the restaurant where Teddy proposed. 
           It’s closed now, lights off, doors locked. She sucks in a 
           choppy, panicked breath and walks away as Teddy’s car pulls 
           away from the back parking lot and speeds down the street. 

           Her heart’s on the verge of breaking.

           EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT

           Leyna stands at the corner in a depressed trance. Suddenly, 
           we see Teddy’s CAR charge into the intersection and get T-
           BONED by the SEMI. The SOUND OF METAL CRUNCHING AND TWISTING 
           slams into her brain.

           Leyna covers her ears and SCREAMS--

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Joji lies in bed waiting anxiously when he hears the front 
           door open and shut. He sits up as Leyna enters the bedroom.

                                 JOJI
                        Hey...

           She sits down next to him, emotionally exhausted.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I’m sorry about earlier. It 
                        was selfish and stupid of me to--
                                 LEYNA
                        Let’s do it.

           Joji stops.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        I want to do it. For me. For us.

           Joji studies her to make sure she’s ready. Her eyes clear, 
           she holds his gaze. He nods.

           INT. LAB - NIGHT

           She sits down on a sofa as Joji punches commands into his 
           terminal. He then holds up an earpod.

                                 JOJI
                        You’ll have the same device once 
                        you’re inside so we can communicate 
                        in case of emergency. Otherwise, 
                        you’ll have complete privacy. I 
                        made sure nothing records...

           Leyna nods.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        When you’re ready to exit the 
                        Playground, just put the pod in 
                        your ear, say your full-name and 
                        the word, “extract.” That will tell 
                        the program to pull you out.

                                 LEYNA
                        Okay.

                                 JOJI
                        Some elements might be buggy since 
                        I had to hack the main program but 
                        it shouldn’t pose any risks. Also,  
                        You can only enter once.

           Leyna looks to him.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        After that, his profile will be 
                        wiped from the program because...

           Joji looks down at the earpod, hesitant to hand it over. She 
           puts her hands over his. She understands why.

                                 LEYNA
                        Thank you. You’re the best partner 
                        a person could ever ask for.
                                 JOJI
                        Just come back to me, okay?

           He hands her the earpod. She hugs him, puts it in her ear, 
           and lays down.

                                 JOJI (CONT’D)
                        Ready?

           She exhales a nervous breath.

                                 LEYNA
                        Yes.

                                 JOJI
                        Entering in 3... 2... 1.

           The earpod glows blue and she closes her eyes--

           INT. LEYNA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Leyna awakens inside her old apartment. She takes out the 
           earpod and steps out into the living room to find Emi already 
           frozen on the couch, in the middle of eating ramen.

                                 LEYNA
                        Emi?

           No response.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        What the...?

           Leyna pulls out her cell phone and tries calling TEDDY but it 
           doesn’t work. She tries MOM. DAD. Nothing. Confused, she 
           heads out of the apartment.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - DAY

           Leyna pulls into the PARKING LOT by the Pier and gets out. 
           Crowds of tourists frozen at the beach. Seagulls mid-flight. 
           Ocean waves still lap and the sun still shines but there’s a 
           stillness to everything else.

           And before her, over the Pacific Ocean, the great BLACK WALL.

           She climbs the stairs up to the Pier to get a better look. It 
           stretches down the Pacific for as far as the eye can see and 
           into the sky. It’s surreal.
           Part of the Pier is consumed by it. Everything beyond the 
           roller coaster is pitch black.

           As she approaches, she spots Teddy standing right up against 
           the wall, looking into its emptiness.

                                 LEYNA
                        Teddy.

           Without turning--

                                 TEDDY
                        How did you know I’d be here?

                                 LEYNA
                        It’s where Route 66 ends.

                                 TEDDY
                        You remembered.

                                 LEYNA
                        I did.

           A sad beat from him.

                                 TEDDY
                        I believe you now.

           He holds up his arm. The cuts from the hunting knife are gone 
           as if they never happened.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        I glitched earlier and the wounds 
                        disappeared... It’s kinda cool if 
                        you think about it, I guess.

           Leyna’s not sure how to respond.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Was anyone else hurt in the 
                        accident?

                                 LEYNA
                        No.

           A sigh of relief from Teddy,.

                                 TEDDY
                        Good... How long has it been? Since 
                        I died?

                                 LEYNA
                             (heavy beat)
                        Five years.
                                 TEDDY
                        Jesus. Five years... Lots happened 
                        since, I imagine.

                                 LEYNA
                        Some things. Squid’s a father now.

                                 TEDDY
                        You’re joking.

                                 LEYNA
                        Married with a baby daughter.

                                 TEDDY
                        Wow. Never thought I’d see the day.

                                 LEYNA
                        Don’t think anyone did. He makes a 
                        good father, though.

                                 TEDDY
                        I don’t doubt it. And my parents?

                                 LEYNA
                        They’re doing good.

           This hits Teddy particularly hard. He gives a thankful nod.

                                 TEDDY
                        Are you seeing anyone?

           She hesitates. He turns to her.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay.

           And he does seem at peace.

                                 LEYNA
                        Yes. We’re engaged.

           Teddy takes this in stride.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        He’s the one who built this place.

                                 TEDDY
                        Well, tell him he needs to fix a 
                        few bugs.

           She tries to match his levity but it’s too difficult.

                                 LEYNA
                        I should never have done this.
                                 TEDDY
                        You’re telling me.

                                 LEYNA
                        I am so sorry.

                                 TEDDY
                        So we’re here because you want to 
                        apologize? For what? Because you 
                        said no?

           Tears well up in her eyes. It’s triggering for Leyna.

                                 LEYNA
                        You died because of me.

                                 TEDDY
                        What? No, Leyna. I died because I 
                        was on my phone like an idiot and 
                        not paying attention. It’s pretty 
                        straight-forward.

                                 LEYNA
                        I know what you’re doing and it 
                        doesn’t make me feel any better.

                                 TEDDY
                        What I’m doing is telling you the 
                        truth. Don’t get me wrong, you 
                        could’ve handled the night a whole 
                        lot better, too. But my death is on 
                        me. And only me.

           He sits down on the bench.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t just that night, either. 
                        It’s everything. I tried to force 
                        you to choose between living my 
                        life and your own. That’s not what 
                        a good partner does. It was selfish 
                        and unfair and...

           He shakes his head and turns to her, sincere, guilty, sad.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        I am so sorry for what I put you 
                        through. If I could take back the 
                        all the pain you’ve had to endure 
                        because of me, I would.

           She starts to cry. Not just tears of sadness but those of 
           finality. This is it. She takes the seat next to him.
                                 LEYNA
                        I’m just glad I got to spend this 
                        time with you.

                                 TEDDY
                        Me, too.

           He faces the eternal blackness of the WALL.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        So what’s the fiancé like?

                                 LEYNA
                        Sweet. Hard-working. Honest to a 
                        fault. Like you.

                                 TEDDY
                        I hope he’s better than me because 
                        you deserve someone truly great.

           Leyna trembles. This is hard to hear.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        So what happens now?

                                 LEYNA
                        I don’t know.

                                 TEDDY
                        You’re not going to keep me in here 
                        like some digital harem, are you?

           Leyna unexpectedly SNORTS, which makes Teddy smile. She pulls 
           out the earpod from her pocket.

                                 LEYNA
                        I put this in and I leave. Forever.

                                 TEDDY
                        And me?

                                 LEYNA
                        This world will shut down...

                                 TEDDY
                             (understanding)
                        Forever.

           Leyna nods. Teddy accepts this and stands back up.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Then I might as well step inside 
                        that wall. I’m super curious as to 
                        what’s beyond it.
                                 LEYNA
                        Think there’s something on the 
                        other side?

                                 TEDDY
                        Maybe nothing. Maybe everything.

           Leyna stands with him.

                                 LEYNA
                        Teddy, I--

           He wraps his arms around her and squeezes her tight. She does 
           the same and a catharsis washes over her. Not wanting to let 
           go but knowing she has to.

                                 TEDDY
                        I got you to do Route 66 after all.

                                 LEYNA
                        You did.

                                 TEDDY
                        I hope this next guy takes you to 
                        space.

           They squeeze each other as tight as they can. After a long 
           beat, they release.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        So, who goes first in these 
                        situations?

                                 LEYNA
                        How about we both go on three?

                                 TEDDY
                        That’s a good plan.

           Leyna inserts the earpod. It glows blue.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Okay. One...

           He takes a step back towards the Black Wall.

                                 LEYNA
                        Two...

           Another step. He’s on the edge of it.

                                 TEDDY
                        Hey...
           She stops. They exchange one last look. He grins.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Go fuck yourself.

           She smiles back through tears.

                                 LEYNA
                        Go fuck yourself.

           He steps back and disappears into the blackness as a WHITE 
           LIGHT ENVELOPS OUR SCREEN--

           INT. LAB - NIGHT

           Leyna’s eyes open. Joji rushes over.

                                 JOJI
                        Are you okay?

           She takes the earpod out and wraps her arms around him. He 
           holds her as she cries softly.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           SPRING. 

           A sunny day. The breeze blows gently through the trees as 
           Joji and a very pregnant Leyna walk through the cemetery. 

           Joji stops shy and hangs back, letting Leyna have a moment 
           alone with Teddy’s grave.

           She stands before the headstone.

                                 LEYNA
                        Hi, Teddy. It’s been awhile. I’m 
                        sorry I haven’t visited since the 
                        funeral. I couldn’t face you or 
                        anything that reminded me of you 
                        for a long time...

           She looks down at her belly.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        A lot has happened since. I’m due 
                        in five weeks if you can believe 
                        that. Squid, of all people, is 
                        giving me baby tips which are 
                        surprisingly helpful...
           Her tone shifts now.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        I came because I know that wasn’t 
                        really you in the Playground, so I 
                        wanted to say it here... Thank you 
                        for everything. You were a good 
                        person and I hope you’re resting in 
                        peace, wherever you are...

           She takes out the earpod and places it on his headstone.

                                 LEYNA (CONT’D)
                        Goodbye, Teddy.

           A calm washes over her. A large weight has lifted off her 
           shoulders. She caresses the headstone and walks back to Joji. 
           As they leave, we stay on the earpod and slowly PUSH-IN...

           ...as it starts to glow a soft blue.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
