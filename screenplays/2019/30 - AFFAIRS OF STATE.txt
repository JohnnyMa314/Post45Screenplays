           EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOTS OF WASHINGTON, DC - DAY

           The rain-soaked city buzzes - bursting at the seams - as an 
           imposing motorcade barrels through the cordoned-off streets. 
           Sirens whirl and onlookers gawk as we’re sucked into...

           INT. THE BEAST - CONTINUOUS

           Silence. 

           The kind of quiet only eight inches of ballistic glass 
           affords. Where a man sits isolated - in the eye of the storm. 

           This is HARRY BAKER AXTON, President of the United States. 

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        Are we going to talk about it?

                                 AXTON
                     (without looking up)
                        The General Assembly?

           BEN WOLCOTT (49), the Secretary of State, and a contemporary 
           of Axton, shifts uneasily in his seat across from POTUS. 

                                 BEN
                        No. 

                                 AXTON
                        The situation with the Houthi 
                        rebels in Yemen?

                                 BEN
                        No. 

                                 AXTON
                        Then no, we’re not going to talk 
                        about it. What’s next? 

           Ben opens his briefing book, smiles. 

                                 BEN
                        I didn’t want to talk about it 
                        anyway. 

           Axton looks up, a wry smile, before peering through the glass 
           at the crowds, the countless faces - men, women, and children 
           - he represents, but will never touch.

           PRE-LAP the murmurs of a large crowd as we...

                                          MATCH CUT TO:
           EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT

           Where dozens of bundled-up Londoners excitedly hold signs 
           that read “Change” and “Ella.” They erupt, barely held back 
           by a bike-rack, as ELLA WALKER approaches with purpose. 

           She’s mid-forties, energized by - and quietly terrified at - 
           the looming end to her campaign. 

           Ella melts into the crowd, embracing some, taking selfies 
           with others; she’s at home in the masses until SANDRA - mid-
           thirties and not messing around - whisks her away. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Paxhouse is gonna go hard on Tom.

           Ella gives a stern look. They walk briskly into...

           INT. TV STUDIO - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           This interaction is quick, snappy: 

                                 ELLA
                        Will he also be announcing his 
                        transition to Puritanism? 

           An AUDIO TECH scrambles to mic Ella who barely notices. 

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        Pious, pompous ass.

                                 SANDRA
                        Oh good, yep, right into the mic. 

                                 ELLA
                        Could be worse. He could ask me why 
                        we’re seven points down. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Try not to highlight that.

                                 ELLA
                        I put my life into this, and it 
                        won’t even be close.

                                 SANDRA
                        Chin up.

                                 ELLA
                        Thanks.
                                 SANDRA
                        No, I mean lift your chin up, so it 
                        doesn’t look like you have three. 

                                 ELLA
                        Would you ever say that to a man?

                                 SANDRA
                        No. But I work for a woman. 

           As applause erupts off screen.

                                 ELLA
                        Damn right you do.

           And Ella enters the white-hot studio, smiling and waving. 

           INT. TV STUDIO - ON SET - LATER

           Ella sits at a preposterously large table, across from her 
           opponent, Prime Minister KEVIN PAXHOUSE (50s, smarmy). A 
           stodgy MODERATOR stationed between the two. 

                                 PAXHOUSE
                        The MP’s husband has off-shore bank 
                        accounts that have evaded scrutiny 
                        for years. Her husband is 
                        bankrolling--

           We focus on Ella as Paxhouse drones on. We can’t make out 
           what he’s saying, but for a few phrases. 

                                 PAXHOUSE (CONT’D)
                        ...Ella’s husband...her husband. 
                        The MP’s husband... 

           Jotting down notes, Ella allows herself a slight grin.

                                 MODERATOR
                        I want to give the MP a chance to 
                        respond before we wrap it up.

           Ella holds up her pad of paper for the camera and audience. 
           We see nine tally marks. 

                                 ELLA
                        Nine. That’s how many times the 
                        Prime Minister just mentioned my 
                        husband. And I want to let you in 
                        on a secret about why he did it. 

           The moderator perks up: The staid debate getting interesting. 
                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        A clever consultant told him that 
                        saying so would force me to clarify 
                        - not just the lies the Prime 
                        Minister tells with frightening 
                        ease - but what he really wants, 
                        his winning strategy, is to force 
                        me to remind the United Kingdom 
                        that I don’t have a husband. 
                     (Beat. Audience leans in.)
                        I have an ex-husband. He’s betting 
                        that bothers you. But what bothers 
                        me is that he didn’t spend his time 
                        talking about nine ways he’s going 
                        to stabilize the NHS, or nine ways 
                        we can combat the crisis in Yemen, 
                        or, hell, nine ways he’ll spruce up 
                        “Number Ten.” 

           Laughter in the crowd as Paxhouse tries to jump back in, but 
           is cut off by a determined Ella. 

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        Listen, if you’re better off today 
                        than you were when the Prime 
                        Minister took office, sure, dismiss 
                        the divorcee. But if you aren’t, or 
                        if people you care about aren’t, 
                        then it’s time for somebody who 
                        isn’t stuck in the past. Time for 
                        somebody who knows that when 
                        something isn’t working you make a 
                        change. I am that person.

           The crowd applauds. 

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        If you don’t believe me, just ask 
                        my ex-husband. 

           The crowd goes wild. We hold on Ella taking it all in as the 
           darkened, cheering crowd turns to...

           EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOTS - LONDON - NIGHT

           We wind our way through London’s greatest hits - from Big Ben 
           and Buckingham Palace to the famous ferris wheel and those 
           double-decker buses. 

                                 ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        A snap election seen largely as a 
                        lock for the establishment is 
                        thrown into turmoil.
                                 ANCHOR 2 (V.O.)
                        MP Ella Walker stood up forcefully 
                        to the PM. Is it too little too 
                        late? Or will Kevin Paxhouse soon 
                        be our ex-Prime Minister?

                                 ANCHOR 3 (V.O.)
                        Does this showing put Walker’s 
                        likability problem to rest? 

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Ella sits watching TV with Sandra and a contingent of 
           STAFFERS working in controlled chaos. 

                                      ANALYST 2 (ON TV)
                                 Her ambition reminds me of 
                                 Thatcher.
                ANALYST (ON TV)
           This was a real rallying cry 
           for women. We will not be 
           slut-shamed.

                                 ELLA
                        Oh, Christ!

                                 SANDRA
                        They love you.

                                 ELLA
                        They love a plot twist. A tighter 
                        race. This’ll help, but we’ll still 
                        lose by five. 

           LINDSEY (20s) freezes, having clearly heard Ella’s pessimism. 

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, sorry, no, no - keep milling 
                        about busily.
                        (perfunctorily)
                        There’s purpose in what you’re 
                        doing. 

           Lindsey, having picked up the tea set and papers, walks off. 
           Sandra looks to her boss. 

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 SANDRA
                        You should be chuffed right now. 
                        Your plan is working. We’re 
                        incredibly close.
                     (switching gears)
                        Do you want to talk about it?
                                 ELLA
                        It?

                                 SANDRA
                        Him.

           EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C./VARIOUS SHOTS - EARLY MORNING

           The OPENING TITLES ROLL against a series of moments - 
           Washington waking up:

           A rowing team passes Jefferson on the Potomac; food trucks 
           unfurl their hoods by Washington; a cyclist pedals past the 
           steps to Lincoln. 

           Dawn breaks over D.C. And as the pounding of a ball becomes 
           more prevalent and the unmistakable language of basketball - 
           “Pick right! Shot. Watch left.” - takes hold:

           MAIN TITLES END ON

           President Harry Baker Axton

           Dribbling the ball up court. His court.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE BASKETBALL COURT - MORNING

                                 ND PLAYER
                        Take him, POTUS. 

           A nervous young aide, BILLY, gives the President a wide berth 
           as ANITA, a sharply-dressed woman in her fifties, calls out 
           from the sidelines:

                                 ANITA
                        He’s got no left, kid!

           With that, the President rockets by Billy with his right for 
           an easy lay-up. A little too easy.

                                 AXTON
                        That’s game.

           A few high-fives and “good games” end what we glean is an 
           early-morning routine in the Axton Administration. The 
           President approaches Anita who, as Chief of Staff, has earned 
           the right to trash her boss’ game:

                                 ANITA
                        I told him you have no left. 
           Their bond is self-evident and their banter quick as they 
           trek up the South Lawn driveway and we PAN UP to REVEAL: THE 
           WHITE HOUSE, bathed in the glow of a late-November morning.

                                 AXTON
                        I can go left or right.

           Anita thinking a moment. Axton notices. 

                                 AXTON (CONT’D)
                        You’re trying to formulate a joke.

                                 ANITA
                        No, I’m--

                                 AXTON
                        Something to do with Compromiser-in-
                        Chief, maybe. 

                                 ANITA
                        It’s not fun when you help.

                                 AXTON
                        The letter I read last night--

                                 ANITA
                        Farmer in Minnesota.

                                 AXTON
                        No, bike shop manager in Dubuque. 
                        She made a compelling case about 
                        the unintended consequences of the 
                        CFPB’s sustainability rule--

                                 ANITA
                        Which--

                                 AXTON
                        The one we rolled out last year. 
                        Let’s get a working group to dig in 
                        this week. See if we should adjust. 

           Anita makes a note as they continue to walk. 

                                 AXTON (CONT’D)
                        And let’s push Approps on a clean 
                        CR. I want to give the American 
                        people some sense of confidence as 
                        we enter the holidays.

                                 ANITA
                        I’ll have OLA reach out.
                                 AXTON
                        The twenty-three-year-old press 
                        aide’s still afraid to guard me.

                                 ANITA
                        He’s a twenty-three-year-old press 
                        aide. If he wasn’t terrified every 
                        time he walked through the 
                        Northwest Gate, I’d fire him for 
                        cause. 

                                 AXTON
                        What’s next?

                                 ANITA
                        You have half hour before the PDB. 
                        And Alexander needs ten minutes 
                        prior to your “siv-itz” to discuss 
                        G7 protocol. 

           Axton waves to a groundskeeper. 

                                 AXTON
                        Morning, PJ!
                     (back to Anita)
                        Alexander fills ten minutes. Give 
                        him two. I’ll see you in the Oval.

                                 ANITA
                        Mr. President, the snap election--

                                 AXTON
                        --Yep.

           Which shuts that down, Anita not sure why.

                                 ANITA
                        Pardoning at six, sir.

                                 AXTON
                        The indignities of this office 
                        never cease to amaze me. 

                                 ANITA
                        I’m the one who calls you sir. Sir.

           An AGENT opens the door as they reach the White House.

                                 AXTON
                     (back turned; on the move)
                        Damn right you do. 
           INT. OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

           Axton, now in a sharp suit, sits by the fireplace next to 
           Anita as GENERALS and intimidating men and women in power 
           suits, plus Ben, provide the Presidential Daily Briefing. 

                                 HARRY
                        What’s next?

                                 GENERAL
                        Yemen.

                                 AXTON
                        Deteriorating.

                                 GENERAL
                        Quickly, sir. And Russia isn’t 
                        stepping up to the plate. It’s 
                        DNI’s assessment that President 
                        Vitaly is playing both sides. 

                                 AXTON
                        And what does my Secretary of State 
                        say?

                                 BEN
                        The situation is untenable, sir. 
                        Sooner rather than later, our hand 
                        is going to be forced. Possibly 
                        unilaterally. But provoking Russia--

                                 AXTON
                        Only escalates the tensions. 

                                 BEN
                        And doing so would torpedo the Iran 
                        deal. So, we play nice with Vitaly 
                        for the time-being and end-run the 
                        rebels separately. 

                                 AXTON
                        We’ll build a consensus at the G7-
                        plus-one. 

                                 GENERAL
                        The snap election could affect that-

                                 AXTON
                        I know where Paxhouse stands.

                                 ANITA
                        And Walker--
                                 AXTON
                        Walker can only win if the affluent 
                        suburbs come in plus eleven, the 
                        urban areas hold steady, and the 
                        rural west is depressed relative to 
                        three years ago. Chances are 
                        roughly seven percent. 
                     (slowing down)
                        Her recent debate performance 
                        notwithstanding. 
                     (off their looks)
                        What? I do my reading assignments.

           He closes his briefing book, signaling the end of the 
           meeting. The generals and suits are replaced by a more 
           political-looking crew, including BECCA, the early-thirties 
           press secretary, and an older political strategist, CONNOR. 

           Axton moves to the Resolute Desk, props himself up casually. 

                                 CONNOR
                        Your UNGA speech played well. 

                                 AXTON
                        It was platitudes without a plan.

                                 ANITA
                        Someone’s in a good mood today. 

                                 AXTON
                        Don’t do the thing where you talk 
                        about me like I’m not in the room. 

                                 ANITA
                        Mhmm. 

                                 AXTON
                        And don’t talk about my mood to 
                        other staff when you walk out of 
                        here, either. It’s unbecoming.

                                 CONNOR
                        Unbecoming?

                                 AXTON
                        It’s annoying. And I’m the 
                        President and it annoys me. 

                                 ANITA
                     (joking)
                        You know his mood is bad when he 
                        reminds you he’s the President. 
                                 AXTON
                        What’s next?

                                 BECCA
                        I’m planning to confirm your France 
                        travel at the top of tomorrow’s 
                        briefing, sir. And we’re drafting 
                        statements in advance of the 
                        Paxhouse-Walker election. 

           On Axton - a beat too long, his attention elsewhere.

           INT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Connor and Becca close the door to the Oval behind them as 
           they encounter AIDES going about their business.

                                 CONNOR
                     (to aide)
                        He’s in a bad mood.

                                 BECCA
                     (to another aide)
                        Totally off today. Not himself. 

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Axton takes a seat behind his desk. Something’s on his mind. 
           As we’re thrust back twenty-some years to BEGIN FLASHBACK:

           EXT. OXFORD UNIVERSITY - EVENING

           The sun sets over the Radcliffe Camera Library, its Palladian 
           dome striking against the orange-red of the advancing night. 
           This is Oxford University...

           INT. OXFORD PUB - EVENING

           Where President Axton is just Harry (27), a grad student and 
           TA at the turn of the Millennium, drinking with his best 
           friend Ben (27) who’s a long way off from Secretary of State.

           STEPH (21), winds her way through the raucous bar to Axton 
           who’s chatting with Ben. She grabs Axton’s arm.

                                 STEPH
                        I need a favor. My friend over 
                        there, pretty girl in green, she 
                        needs a bit of saving. Stuck with a 
                        complete ass. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEPH (CONT'D)
                        You seem moderately normal. Go 
                        pretend to be her boyfriend, and 
                        next round’s on me.

           Ben gives Axton a nudge. He wants a free drink...

                                 AXTON
                     (beginning to go)
                        Over there in green?

                                 STEPH
                        Can’t miss her. 

           INT. OXFORD PUB - MOMENTS LATER

           Axton approaches a woman in a greenish dress. We can’t yet 
           see her face, but she’s talking to PATRICK (25) who is 
           unusually handsome albeit somewhat boring. Axton eavesdrops.

                                 PATRICK
                        The trauma will always be there. I 
                        have a hard time talking about it.

           Axton winces, readies himself, slides into the conversation. 

                                 AXTON
                     (handing her a drink)
                        Hey honey, here you go.

           Axton puts his arm around her and we REVEAL: It’s Ella (22), 
           a driven undergrad decades from running for Prime Minister. 

                   PATRICK
                                          ELLA
           Honey?
                                 Honey?

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        And you are?

                                 AXTON
                        Very funny, dear. I’m only the love 
                        of your life. 
                     (offering Patrick a shake)
                        Name’s Harry.
                     (now less confident)
                        I’m Harry...

                                 PATRICK
                        Patrick. And you know her how?

                                 AXTON
                        Longtime boyfriend.
                                 ELLA
                        Longtime?

                                 AXTON
                        Longtime.

                                 PATRICK
                        Oh, I didn’t know--

                                 AXTON
                        No, suppose you didn’t. 

           Ella, at first recoiling, recognizes a charm in Axton’s false 
           bravado and goes with it. She kisses him on the cheek. 

                                 ELLA
                        Patrick was just recounting his 
                        trip to Rwanda rebuilding schools 
                        and helping combat genocide. 

           Axton’s eyes bulge. He doesn’t know what to say for a beat...

                                 AXTON
                        Thank you for your service. 

                                 PATRICK
                        I’m not in the military. I don’t 
                        believe in violence. 

                                 AXTON
                        Fortunate for both of us. You’re a 
                        very tall, classically handsome 
                        man. Any girl would be lucky--

                                 ELLA
                        Sweetie, should we go?

                                 AXTON
                        Please God.

           INT. OXFORD PUB - MOMENTS LATER

           Ella and Axton make their way to the bar. 

                                 ELLA
                        Kind of a bold move. 

                                 AXTON
                        Slightly less so considering your 
                        friend bribed me. 

                                 ELLA
                        What friend?
           Steph approaches angrily. Ben’s in back at the bar. 

                                 STEPH
                        Who the hell’s this?

                                 ELLA
                        I’m Ella.

                                 AXTON
                     (to Ella)
                        Lovely to meet you.

                                 STEPH
                        Wanker - you got the wrong girl!

                                 AXTON
                        You said the green dress.

                                 STEPH
                     (leaving)
                        It’s clearly turquoise! 

           Axton and Ella alone now. He eyes her. A chagrined smile. 

                                 ELLA
                        She’s wrong, you know.

                                 AXTON
                        I didn’t get the wrong girl? 

           Their eyes meet, his false confidence turning real. Ella  
           thinks a beat. Smiles. 

                                 ELLA
                        This dress is more of a sea foam.

           Off these two, a glimmer between them. And we END FLASHBACK: 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

           Anita enters, finds Axton at his desk where we left him.

                                 ANITA
                        I’ve been your chief of staff long 
                        enough to know when something’s 
                        bothering you. 

                                 AXTON
                        Nothing’s bothering me.

                                 ANITA
                        With respect, Mr. President--
                                 AXTON
                        And if there was something 
                        bothering me, doesn’t mean it needs 
                        to be analyzed like a piece of 
                        legislation or a matter of state. 
                        I’m a person. People get bothered. 

                                 ANITA
                        You’re the President. 

                                 AXTON
                        And what does it say of your mood 
                        when you’re reminding me that I’m 
                        the President?

           Whatever mild tension existed now breaking.

                                 ANITA
                        Lassitude? 

                                 AXTON
                        Lassitude? 

                                 ANITA
                        I’ve been Googling synonyms for 
                        exhaustion. 

                                 AXTON
                     (thinking a moment)
                        Torpor.

                                 ANITA
                        Oh, good one.

                                 AXTON
                        Speaking of exhaustion, how many 
                        days until my meeting with Sam?

                                 ANITA
                        410, sir. 

           They smile a moment. Axton takes a breath before digging in: 

                                 AXTON
                        Let’s stand up a meeting with the 
                        Chiefs on Yemen and set a call with 
                        the Kremlin to follow. And I have 
                        notes on the OMB...

           We pull out as Axton and Anita continue the diligent work of 
           the presidency even as their words trail off and we PRE-LAP:

           EXT. LONDON SKYLINE - NIGHTFALL

           The sun sets on London. We follow the night quickly - 
           stylistically - ever darker until:

           INT. PUB - NIGHT

           Locals toss back beers, eyes on the small TV behind the bar:

                        the House of Commons will conclude. 

           INT. 10 DOWNING STREET - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Where Paxhouse, surrounded by the trappings of the Prime- 
           Ministership, consults his victory speech.

                        Paxhouse aims to strengthen his

                        several thorny international 
                        issues, foremost among them: what 
                        to do in Yemen where rebels, 
                        thought to be backed by Russia, 
                        have made a bad situation worse. 

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Sandra on the couch. Ella in the background with a document.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)
                        And MP Ella Walker, recently 
                        thought un-electable, surging here 
                        at the end - looking to upend the 
                        political system and send her own 
                        global message. 

           We find Ella, focused, frustrated. 

                                 ELLA
                        This concession speech is shit. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Fortunately, you won’t need it. 
                                 ELLA
                        An optimist to the end. 

           An excited AIDE rushes in. This has to be good news. 

                                 AIDE
                        Exit polls. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Yeah, out with it!

                                 AIDE
                        High-end suburbs are plus... 
                     (fumbling with phone)
                        ...plus eight!

           Ella and Sandra deflate; the aide notices - just as Lindsey 
           walks by with more tea. She also notices. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Great, great - keep us posted. 

                                 ELLA
                     (once the room is clear)
                        Plus eight is not plus eleven. 

                                 SANDRA
                        It’s still early. 

                                 ELLA
                        Yeah.

                                 SANDRA
                        You may be right to take a pass on 
                        the speech though. Just to be 
                        responsible. 

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

           CLOSE ON: An iPad, which Axton peruses, as we catch the 
           headline about the snap election: 

           “Early returns suggest Paxhouse to remain; too soon to say.” 

           Axton quickly covers the iPad as the door to the Oval opens 
           and an aide escorts BOB inside. 

           Bob’s the Chairman of the National Turkey Federation [nb: 
           this is a real thing] and he looks exactly like you’d expect 
           the Chairman of the National Turkey Federation to look.

                                 AXTON
                        Mr. Chairman. 
                                 BOB
                        Mr. President, please call me Bob. 

           As an OFFICIAL PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a picture. 

                                 AXTON
                        All right, should we pardon some 
                        turkeys, Bob?

           Axton ushers him to the door to the Rose Garden, ready to 
           exit when Bob gets uncomfortable...

                                 BOB
                        I’m sorry, sir. This is the seventh 
                        year we’ve done this--

                                 AXTON
                        And my support for the National 
                        Turkey Federation remains 
                        steadfast. 

                                 BOB
                        I have to confess something.

           Axton really doesn’t have time for this, but hides it well.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        We say the pardoned turkeys go off 
                        to a farm in Pennsylvania to live 
                        out their lives. 

                                 AXTON
                        Yes.

                                 BOB
                        And they do.

                                 AXTON
                        Good. 

                                 BOB
                        But the rest of their lives is only 
                        about three weeks. You see, we 
                        fatten them up so direly that they 
                        succumb to obesity within days of 
                        their supposed freedom. 

                                 AXTON
                        Well, all turkeys die.

                                 BOB
                        They literally collapse under their 
                        own weight. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        And since they’re technically 
                        pardoned, we don’t allow them to be 
                        eaten. Typically, we incinerate 
                        them. 

                                 AXTON
                        OK, Bob, I’ll be sure not to 
                        mention that to the children 
                        waiting for us in the Rose Garden. 

                                 BOB
                        Their names this year are Candied 
                        and Yams!

           As they exit the Oval...

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

           Ella at work on her speech.

                                 ELLA
                        First line: I want to congratulate 
                        Prime Minister Paxhouse on the 
                        impressive race he ran against my 
                        ex-husband. 

                                 SANDRA
                     (laughing)
                        Okay, that’s pretty good.

           The aide from before bursts back in with an iPhone.

                        The rural west!

           Sandra takes the phone. Ella stands.

                                 SANDRA
                     (reading)
                        Down nine.

                                 ELLA
                        West was supposed to be up.

                                 SANDRA
                        Holy shit. Down nine.

                                 ELLA
                        Down nine?

           Another AIDE enters. 
                                 AIDE 2
                        Urban exits.

                                 ELLA
                        Steady?

                                 AIDE 2
                        Up from three years ago. Four 
                        percent. 

                                 ELLA
                        Urban areas weren’t supposed to 
                        move. 

                                 SANDRA
                        If these trends hold, you’re the 
                        next Prime Minister of the United 
                        Kingdom. 

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - EVENING

           Axton enters from the Rose Garden to find Ben waiting. 
           Something very clearly on his mind. News. 

                                 BEN
                        This is going to be awkward. 

           BEGIN FLASHBACK:

           INT. OXFORD DORMS - AXTON’S ROOM - MORNING

           A sea foam dress rests on the floor. We find Axton and Ella - 
           together, asleep. Axton slowly stirs, rolls over. His hand 
           inadvertently touches Ella’s, waking them both. 

                                 AXTON
                        Hi. 

                                 ELLA
                        Hi. 

           A prolonged, uneasy beat before Ella spots the clock. 

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        Shit. I have a class!

                                 AXTON
                        Ah, me too. 
                     (as she hurries from bed)
                        Whoa, Ella: that’s it? I don’t even 
                        know your last name.
                                 ELLA
                        I’m sure that’s not necessary.

           Axton gets up. He’s shirtless and she notices. He approaches.

                                 AXTON
                        Can I have your number?

                                 ELLA
                        Not sure that’s necessary either.

                                 AXTON
                     (wry)
                        Should we hug?

                                 ELLA
                        Look, I don’t know what got into 
                        me. This isn’t who I am. 

                                 AXTON
                        Who are you?

           Ella puts her hand out for an extremely platonic shake.

                                 ELLA
                        I’m Ella Walker, and I do not do 
                        one-night stands. 

                                 AXTON
                     (smirking)
                        In that case, you really better 
                        give me your number.

           PRE-LAP the crackling of chalk against slate.

           INT. OXFORD CLASSROOM - DAY

           A PROFESSOR (70s) turns from the chalk board, pontificating. 

                                 PROFESSOR
                        Moral licensing is the idea wherein 
                        one believes that the good they’ve 
                        done entitles them to the wrong 
                        they’re about to do. Take the 
                        American President, for example. 
                     (off students’ murmurs)
                        No, really. Clinton likely 
                        rationalized his behavior with Ms. 
                        Lewinski such that he had done so 
                        much good for so many people that 
                        he permitted himself the dalliance. 
                                 ATTENTIVE STUDENT
                        The good outweighed the bad.

                                 PROFESSOR
                        Correct. Now, here’s where it gets 
                        interesting. We usually look at 
                        moral licensing on an individual, 
                        self-centric level. But, where’s my 
                        American TA. Harry...

           Axton, with other TAs (it’s a big class), raises his hand.

                                 PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
                        Yes, you...

                                 AXTON
                        Harry Axton.

                                 PROFESSOR
                        Right. American Harry Axton. 

           REVEAL: Ella, seated in the middle, recognizes him. Stunned.

                                 PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
                        Last year, your President was mired 
                        in scandal. Imagine it, a President 
                        discussing his sex life! I don’t 
                        think we’ll ever see a more 
                        embarrassing moment at the White 
                        House! And yet today... 

                                 AXTON
                        People love him. 

                                 PROFESSOR
                        Exactly! His approval ratings have 
                        never been higher! Now, most 
                        Americans would say cheating on 
                        your wife with an intern is...

                                 AXTON
                        Not ideal.

           The large lecture hall rumbles with a bit of laughter.

                                 PROFESSOR
                        And yet those same Americans are 
                        willing to look past it. Why do you 
                        think that is?

                                 ELLA (O.S.)
                        Because Bill Clinton has a penis.
                                 HARRY
                        Pretty sure that’s what got him 
                        into trouble in the first place.

           More laughter, except for from Ella who turns to Axton. He 
           realizes in this moment exactly who Ella is. He’s shocked. 

                                 ELLA
                        Pretty sure that’s also what 
                        ensures he’ll never truly face the 
                        consequences of his actions. 

                                 HARRY
                        What if he didn’t know?
                     (beat)
                        Suppose he was single and he didn’t 
                        know she... worked there? What if 
                        he just really liked her?

           Ella takes a beat. They’re talking about something else now. 

                                 ELLA
                        How could he not know?

                                 AXTON
                        There are lots of people at the 
                        White House. He can’t be expected 
                        to know all of them. What if--

                                 ELLA
                        No “what if’s.” I’m talking about 
                        the real world, where he won’t be 
                        held accountable.

                                 AXTON
                        He got impeached in the real world.

                                 ELLA
                        And came out ahead. All because of 
                        his cock.

           The classroom goes wild. The professor works to quiet them.

                                 AXTON
                        I get what you’re saying. This 
                        Lewinski girl’s life is ruined.

                                 ELLA
                        Don’t do that.

                                 AXTON
                        Don’t do what?
                                 ELLA
                        Her life doesn’t have to be defined 
                        by a blowjob.

           The professor, who seems to be enjoying the debate, grimaces. 

                                 AXTON
                        Maybe it doesn’t have to be, but 25 
                        years from now, this is what she’ll 
                        be known for.

                                 ELLA
                        I refuse to believe that the world 
                        will be so uninteresting in 25 
                        years that we’ll still be talking 
                        about this. 

                                 AXTON
                        As long as we’re still talking. 

                                 PROFESSOR
                        All right, all right. I think you 
                        two are in violent agreement. 

                                 AXTON
                        It’s all Clinton’s fault. 

                                 ELLA
                        It’s not all Clinton’s fault. He 
                        didn’t force himself on her.

                                 AXTON
                        He didn’t have to. He’s the 
                        President, and she’s an intern.

                                 ELLA
                        Don’t do that either.

           The Professor gives a “here-we-go” look.

                                 AXTON
                        What?

                                 ELLA
                        Discount her experience entirely. 
                        They’re both people. By your 
                        rationale, the President can’t have 
                        a relationship with anybody because 
                        he’s more powerful than everybody.

                                 AXTON
                        Presidents have peers. 
                                 ELLA
                        Not in the States. 

                                 AXTON
                        OK, so back to my initial question: 
                        what if somebody in a position of 
                        power just happened to like 
                        somebody who... wasn’t? Yet.

           Off Ella, considering.

           EXT. OXFORD CLASSROOM - LATER

           Axton exits with a sea of students, looking for Ella on the 
           outdoor walkway. He spots her. Struggles to catch up. 

                                 AXTON
                        Ella!
                     (catching up)
                        Ella Walker! I knew I recognized 
                        that name. 

           She keeps walking. 

                                 AXTON (CONT’D)
                        You reached out to the professor-- 

                                 ELLA
                        The internship.

                                 AXTON
                        Right! Right. You get it?

                                 ELLA
                        Interview’s tomorrow.

                                 AXTON
                        You’ll get it. You’re very 
                        political.

                                 ELLA
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 AXTON
                        Nothing, it’s just... all that talk 
                        and I don’t actually know where you 
                        stand on Bill Clinton. 

                                 ELLA
                        I find that cynicism and charm are 
                        mutually exclusive. 
                                 AXTON
                        What if I’m genuinely charmed by 
                        you and you’re too cynical to see 
                        it?
                     (she’s ahead of him now)
                        How ‘bout a tour?
                     (she turns, confused)
                        Once you get the internship, can I 
                        get a tour of 10 Downing Street?

                                 ELLA
                        Number 10.

                                 AXTON
                        Huh?

                                 ELLA
                        We call it Number 10 here. Not Ten 
                        Downing Street. Not Downing Street. 
                        Just Number 10.

                                 AXTON
                        That’s a fun British fact.
                     (off her eye roll)
                        You really don’t think we should 
                        talk?

                                 ELLA
                        There’s nothing to discuss. We 
                        bonked. Turns out you’re my TA. It 
                        was a mistake.

                                 AXTON
                        Or fate.

                                 ELLA
                        Fuck fate.

                                 AXTON
                        How refreshingly unromantic. 

                                 ELLA
                        Are you suggesting there’s some 
                        baseline of romance I’m expected to 
                        live up to?

           For the first time, Axton’s caught off guard. She notices.

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        Relax. I’m messing with you.

                                 AXTON
                        Wait, bonk?
                                 ELLA
                        Yeah, like fuck.

                                 AXTON
                        As in fate?

                                 ELLA
                        Fate removes choice, so yes, fuck 
                        fate. Now, I’m choosing to leave.

           INT. OXFORD DORM - AXTON’S COMMON AREA - NIGHT

           Axton sits at his small dorm desk. Ben approaches. 

                                 BEN
                        Are we going to talk about it?

                                 AXTON
                        What’s there to talk about?

                                 BEN
                        She’s your student.

                                 AXTON
                        She’s not. I’m an unpaid TA.

                                 BEN
                        You grade her papers. 

                                 AXTON
                        She’s amazing.

           Ben’s now behind the desk, too - they both eye the phone.

                                 BEN
                        Are you gonna call her?

           END FLASHBACK and...

                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - EVENING

           Where we find President Axton and Secretary Wolcott. They’re 
           in the same position, huddled together looking hesitantly at 
           a phone. Only this time, they’re at the RESOLUTE DESK. 

           Axton can’t wrap his head around this moment, he lingers...
                                 BEN
                        Sir.
                     (still nothing)
                        Harry.

           Which prods Axton to pick up the phone as we INTERCUT with:

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Where Ella - seated with Sandra - takes a deep breath. She 
           looks at the phone. A beat. She picks up.

                                 AXTON
                        Madam Prime Minister-elect.

                                 ELLA
                        Mr. President.

                                 AXTON
                        Congratulate. 

           Axton has a paper with “Talking Points” before him. 

                                 ELLA
                     (light-hearted)
                        Is that an order?

           The first bulleted point reads: “Congratulate.” We hang on 
           this awkward beat for a moment before he recovers.

                                 AXTON
                        Congratulations - excuse me - on 
                        your momentous victory tonight. 

                                 ELLA
                        Thank you, sir. It’s been a surreal 
                        evening, but I look forward to the 
                        work ahead, and I particularly look 
                        forward to the continued alliance 
                        between our two nations.

           A beat, clearly Axton’s turn to speak. We find the talking 
           points page again. He’s at the second bullet, which reads: 
           “Discuss Special Relationship.” He’s completely thrown. 

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        Well, it’s been a long day. A 
                        remarkable day.

                                 AXTON
                        I pardoned a turkey today.
                                 ELLA
                        Maybe not quite so much for you--

                                 AXTON
                        Funny thing... the birds die just a 
                        few weeks after the pardoning. They 
                        literally collapse under their own 
                        weight before being incinerated. 

                                 ELLA
                        Well. That is a funny thing if I’ve 
                        ever heard one.

           This is brutal.

                                 AXTON
                        I look forward to meeting you at 
                        the G7-plus-one in France.

                                 ELLA
                        It will be good to see you, too - 
                        and to work toward an international 
                        consensus on Yemen. 

           She’s going there...

                                 AXTON
                        Right. Well, Prime Minister 
                        Paxhouse and I were largely on the 
                        same page with respect to-- 

                                 ELLA
                     (putting him in his place)
                        As you know, Mr. President, we’ve 
                        begun a new chapter tonight.

                                 AXTON
                        Right.

                                 ELLA
                        Thank you for your call, Mr. 
                        President.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 AXTON
                        Madame Prime Minister.

           Axton hangs up, head in his hands. 
                                 AXTON (CONT’D)
                        One day, a very, very long time 
                        from now, we’ll laugh about what 
                        just happened. 

                                 BEN
                        Sir, if it’s all the same to you, 
                        I’m going to laugh about that the 
                        moment I walk out of your office.

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Sandra eagerly awaits what Ella has to say.

                                 ELLA
                        All things considered, I’d say he’s 
                        handling things... fine.

                                 SANDRA
                        How’d he react about Yemen?

                                 ELLA
                        He spoke primarily of obese birds. 

           An aide pops her head in.

                                 AIDE
                        Ma’am. The President of Russia is 
                        on the line.

                                 SANDRA
                        This is going to get complicated. 

           Off Ella... complicated’s an understatement.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - BASEMENT CROSS HALL - MORNING

           We track along the famous red carpeting and arched, marble 
           ceiling of the Basement Cross Hall where Presidents make the 
           trek from their elevator toward the West Wing. 

                                 TV PUNDIT (V.O.)
                        The UK has a new leader, and 
                        President Axton has a new player to 
                        contend with.

           We find a television and zero-in on a pundit roundtable.

                                 TV PUNDIT 2 (ON TV)
                        All while he struggles to develop a 
                        plan to deal with the crisis in 
                        Yemen and unpack Russia’s role in 
                        the devastation. 

                                 TV PUNDIT 3 (ON TV)
                        The Iran Deal he’s hyped for months 
                        may hang in the balance.

                                 TV PUNDIT 4 (ON TV)
                        It has nothing to do with hype. The 
                        Iran Deal represents the most 
                        sweeping, systematic reforms that 
                        country’s seen in generations.  

                                 TV PUNDIT 2 (ON TV)
                        Hype or not, the President’s tied 
                        his legacy to the deal. 

                                 TV PUNDIT 3 (ON TV)
                        And if he doesn’t play the next few 
                        months very carefully, he can kiss 
                        both goodbye.

           INT. PALM ROOM/EXT. COLONNADE - CONTINUOUS

           Where a door swings open, Axton bursts through, and Anita 
           falls into step.

                                 AXTON
                        Hello. 

                                 ANITA
                        Morning, sir.

           They walk briskly through the bright and airy Palm Room, then 
           down the Colonnade famous for countless presidential strolls. 
                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        PDB at nine; senior advisors is 
                        nine-thirty; and your sit-room 
                        briefing’s at ten. Then, depending 
                        on what we learn, speech prep-- 

                                 AXTON
                        I’d like a look at the readout of 
                        my call last night before it goes 
                        to press. 

                                 ANITA
                        The Walker congratulations? It’ll 
                        be pro-forma. 

                                 AXTON
                        All the same. I’d like to see it. 

                                 ANITA
                        Okay.

                                 AXTON
                        Matter of fact, just send whomever 
                        wrote it to the Oval. 

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

           The door to the Oval creaks open. Anita peeks her head in.

                                 ANITA
                        I have Billy for you.

                                 AXTON
                        The basketball kid?

                                 ANITA
                        Turns out, he also writes pro-forma 
                        press releases. 

           She opens the door farther - revealing a wide-eyed Billy 
           who’s clearly never been in the Oval Office before. 

           EXT. OUTER OVAL OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Anita closes the door to the Oval behind her and looks to the 
           President’s secretary, TORI, seated just outside the door. 

                                 ANITA
                        Tori, do you have a copy of 
                        yesterday’s PDB?

           Tori nods, reaches into her desk. Off Anita, considering...
           INT. OVAL OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Billy stands in front of the Resolute Desk as Axton looks 
           over a paper.

                                 AXTON
                        It’s nice work. Just a few nits. 

           Billy can barely speak. Beads of sweat dot his forehead.   

                                 AXTON (CONT’D)
                        For instance, here you’ve written 
                        “deepening our special 
                        relationship.” That’s hitting my 
                        ear wrong.

                                 BILLY
                        Oh, I’m so sorry, sir. I was told 
                        it’s the diplomatic term of art...

                                 AXTON
                        This comma. Do we think it’s 
                        necessary?

                                 BILLY
                        Well, I just thought it was a nice 
                        pause within the sentence, but-- 

           Axton scribbles on the page. Crossing out entire sentences.

                                 AXTON
                     (handing over the paper)
                        I think we can be a little more 
                        concise. Brevity is important. 
                     (as Billy heads out)
                        And Billy.

           He turns, nervous as hell.

                                 AXTON (CONT’D)
                        How many people were listening in 
                        on the call last night?

           Billy squints, thinking, as we...

                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - LATER

           CLOSE ON: Anita watching intently from the back of the room 
           where Becca stands at the podium before dozens of reporters.  
                                 BECCA
                        Before I take your questions, I 
                        have a readout of the President’s 
                        congratulatory call to Prime 
                        Minister-Elect Ella Walker of the 
                        United Kingdom.

           She shuffles papers, looks down, begins reading.

                                 BECCA (CONT’D)
                        “President Axton last night called 
                        Prime Minister-Elect Ella Walker to 
                        offer his congratulations following 
                        the outcome of the general election 
                        in the United Kingdom.”

           An awkward beat. Becca turns the paper over. Nope, that’s it. 
           Anita exits out the back.

                                 BECCA (CONT’D)
                        AP, kick us off.

                                 AP REPORTER
                        Thanks, Becca. Did the President 
                        and Prime Minister-elect discuss 
                        Russia’s role in the war in Yemen? 

           INT. PRIVATE STUDY OFF THE OVAL - CONTINUOUS

           REVEAL: Axton and Ben having lunch, watching the briefing. 

                                 BECCA (ON TV)
                        You know, I’ll have to let the 
                        readout speak for itself.

           The door to the study swings open and Anita enters, our 
           attention drawn away from the television. 

                                 ANITA
                        With all due respect, what the hell 
                        is going on?

                                 AXTON
                        In which hemisphere?

                                 ANITA
                        This one. I read your PDB from 
                        yesterday. 

           Axton knows what’s coming. Ben doesn’t. 
                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Those numbers you cited about Ella 
                        Walker’s election weren’t in there. 
                        That coupled with your edited 
                        readout and botched congratulations 
                        call lead me to ask again--

           “Botched” is a strong--
                                 What the hell is going on? 

           They look at each other. Ben nods to Axton, then:

                   AXTON
                                           BEN
           Shut the door.
                                 Close the door.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           Where Becca continues sparring with the press corps.

                                 REPORTER 2
                        Becca, Prime Minister Paxhouse is 
                        disputing the results of the 
                        election. Does that put the 
                        President in a difficult position?

           PULL OUT to REVEAL:

           INT. BRITISH OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Ella marks up a draft speech as Sandra assiduously checks her 
           phone. The American press briefing plays in the background. 
           Ella reacts to the reporter’s question. 

                                 ELLA
                     (eyes remain on paper)
                        No, it puts me in a difficult 
                        situation. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Paxhouse is all bluster. It’s hard 
                        for a man like that to admit he 
                        lost to you. Besides, he’s getting 
                        exactly no traction. The U.K. is 
                        swept up in Ella-fever. 

                                 ELLA
                        Thank you.

           Sandra gives a quizzical “what for?” look.
                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        For being my cheerleader when I 
                        needed one. For believing that this 
                        was possible when I didn’t. 
                     (off Sandra’s grin)
                        You didn’t believe it either!

                                 SANDRA
                        Of course I didn’t. May not have 
                        gone to Oxford, but I’m not dead 
                        from the neck up. 

                                 ELLA
                     (smiling)
                        Sod off!

                                 SANDRA
                        I’m not lying about the Ella-fever. 
                        That’s real. More people learn 
                        about you, more they love you. 
                     (concerned)
                        But it’s like you said. The press 
                        will look for a plot twist. 

                                 ELLA
                        There’s nothing to find. 

                                 SANDRA
                        So your college sweetheart becomes 
                        the American President... and you 
                        keep it a secret for seven years?

                                 ELLA
                        Essentially. 

                                 SANDRA
                        But you told me.

                                 ELLA
                        As my campaign manager, telling you 
                        was the responsible decision. 
                        Telling anyone else would have been 
                        the irresponsible decision. You’re 
                        the only one who knows.

                                 SANDRA
                        What about at Oxford?

                                 ELLA
                        He was my TA. Not something I 
                        wanted to advertise.  

                                 SANDRA
                        So nobody? 
                                 ELLA
                        Well, Ben, of course. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Ben?

                                 ELLA
                        The Secretary of State.

                                 SANDRA
                        Naturally.  

           INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Back with Becca adeptly handling the press. 

                                 BECCA
                        Again, I won’t speculate on the 
                        internal politics of an ally, 
                        except to say the next Prime 
                        Minister will continue to enjoy a 
                        Special Relationship with the 
                        United States. 

                                 REPORTER 2
                        A follow up?
                     (off Becca’s nod)
                        Ms. Walker seems less than 
                        comfortable with the options 
                        floated by this White House and 
                        outgoing Prime Minister Paxhouse 
                        with respect to Russia vis-a-vis 
                        Yemen. How do you move past that? 

                                 BECCA
                        The Brits once literally set the 
                        White House on fire. If we got past 
                        that, I think we’ll be fine.

                                 ANITA (PRE-LAP)
                        We’re screwed! 

           INT. PRIVATE STUDY OFF THE OVAL - MOMENTS LATER

           Where we find Axton, Ben, and a now in-the-loop Anita.

                                 AXTON
                        It’s not ideal.

                                 ANITA
                     (to Axton)
                        How could you not flag this for me?
                                 BEN
                        She only had a seven--

                                 ANITA
                        Percent chance. So POTUS mentioned. 
                        Do I need to mention probability 
                        forecasting is nonsense?

                                 BEN
                        We can contain this.

                                 ANITA
                        Who else knows?

                                 AXTON
                        No one outside of this room. 

                                 ANITA
                        Except, of course, for the woman 
                        preparing to move into Ten Downing 
                        Street. 

                                 AXTON
                        Number Ten.

                                 ANITA
                        What?

                                 AXTON
                        They call it Number Ten. The Brits, 
                        I mean. 

                                 ANITA
                        Who knows on her end?

                                 AXTON
                        Unclear. We haven’t been in touch 
                        in twenty-some years. 

                                 BEN
                        Except for last night’s call.

                                 ANITA
                     (sarcastic)
                        Which went great. 

                                 AXTON
                        I know you’re frustrated. 

                                 ANITA
                        Mr. President, were you in love?

                                 AXTON
                        Excuse me?
                                 ANITA
                        The situation is dire enough as it 
                        is, but I need to know how--

                                 AXTON
                        We weren’t.

                                 ANITA
                        Sir, if this got out--

                                 AXTON
                        I know.

                                 ANITA
                        It would entirely derail the legacy 
                        plan we’ve put into place. Her 
                        election would be re-litigated. And 
                        it would overwhelm the Vice 
                        President’s campaign.

                                 BEN
                        We’ve kept the Vice President 
                        isolated. She has total cover.  

                                 ANITA
                        Every foreign policy decision you 
                        make would be tainted by the 
                        appearance of impropriety. The 
                        global credibility you’ve built 
                        drop by drop over the last seven 
                        years would be poured away in 
                        buckets. 

                                 AXTON
                        I agree with everything you just 
                        said. But I think Ben’s right. We 
                        can contain this. 

                                 ANITA
                        On our side. Maybe. But not her’s. 
                        She wasn’t even an MP when you won. 

                                 AXTON
                        So?

                                 ANITA
                        So your ex-boyfriend becomes 
                        President of the United States, you 
                        mention it to some people.

                                 AXTON
                        Not Ella. 
                                 ANITA
                        How do you know?

                                 AXTON
                        I know.

                                 ANITA
                        You’re willing to bet your 
                        presidency on that?

           A beat. Axton exhales. 

                                 AXTON
                        We’ve got some time to get our 
                        heads around this.

           As attention turns back to the TV playing the press briefing, 
           which is wrapping up. Connor hands her a piece of paper. 

                                 BECCA  (ON TV)
                        Right, meant to mention this at the 
                        top. I can confirm the President’s 
                        travel next month to Paris, France 
                        for the G7-plus-one where he will 
                        meet with world leaders, including 
                        his first face-to-face with Prime 
                        Minister-Elect Walker. 

           Back on Axton, Ben, and Anita - watching. 

                                 BEN
                        Time flies. 

           BEGIN FLASHBACK on the...

           I/E. OXFORD UNIVERSITY BOOKSTORE - DAY

           JINGLING of Christmas bells, which ring as Ella enters the 
           bookstore. She notices Axton at the counter, purchasing 
           something. Scrambling to look busy, she finds a book as...

                                 AXTON
                        Ella, hey. 

                                 ELLA
                        Hi. 
                     (an awkward beat)
                        Listen, I got your message. It’s 
                        been--I’m not trying to avoid you.

                                 AXTON
                        It’s okay if you are. 
           He smirks. She allows a slight smile. 

                                 ELLA
                        Just a crazy week. 

                                 AXTON
                        Oh. Right. The interview. How’d--

                                 ELLA
                        I made it to the next round.

                                 AXTON
                        That’s great. Congratulations. 

                                 ELLA
                        It’s not a done deal. Final 
                        interview’s in six weeks. 

                                 AXTON
                        I’m sure they’ll find you equally 
                        prompt and productive then. 
                     (a beat; Axton redirects)
                        OK, I’ll let you get back to 
                        your... light porn.

           REVEAL: Ella’s accidentally grabbed an erotic romance novel. 
           He begins to go. We’re on her a beat before...

           EXT. OXFORD UNIVERSITY - MOMENTS LATER

           Axton striding through campus. This time Ella follows. 

                                 ELLA
                        Why’d you say that?

                                 AXTON
                        No judgment here. Erotica is a  
                        foundation of literature--

                                 ELLA
                        “Prompt and productive.” Why’d you 
                        use those words? 

                                 AXTON
                     (lighting a cigarette)
                        Oh.

                                 ELLA
                        You smoke?

                                 AXTON
                        You care that I smoke?
                                 ELLA
                        No. 
                     (frustration building)
                        I care that you went through my 
                        files. I care that you read the 
                        professor’s recommendation letter. 
                        That’s completely over the line!

                                 AXTON
                        I didn’t read it.

           He gives a look. His eyes a bit bulgy. Ella goes ashen.

                                 ELLA
                        Bloody hell! 

                                 AXTON
                        It was before I knew who you were.

                                 ELLA
                        So I’m the girl who slept with the 
                        guy who wrote her a letter of 
                        recommendation?

                                 AXTON
                        No, you’re the girl who does not do 
                        one-night stands. 

                                 ELLA
                        You don’t know anything about me.

                                 AXTON
                        I’d like to.

                                 ELLA
                        You’re my teacher. 

                                 AXTON
                        I’m an unpaid TA. 

                                 ELLA
                        Do you grade papers?

           Axton hesitates. Ella’s got him.

                                 AXTON
                        Because the professor’s like a 
                        hundred years old!

                                 ELLA
                     (re: a book he’s holding)
                        What’s that? 
                                 AXTON
                        Less titillating than what you’re 
                        used to...

                                 ELLA
                        “The History of Number 10”? 

                                 AXTON
                        Talking to someone you like is hard 
                        enough. I wanted to have something 
                        to talk about.

                                 ELLA
                        Harry, this isn’t happening. 

                                 AXTON
                        Why?

                                 ELLA
                        Don’t you remember? I have a 
                        longtime boyfriend. 

                                 AXTON
                        The colorblind guy? Word is he 
                        can’t even get a call back. 

                                 ELLA
                        He said it’s okay if I’m avoiding 
                        him.  

           Their eyes meet. 

                                 AXTON
                        Okay, now I’m actually confused 
                        because I just said that to you.

                                 ELLA
                        Sorry, yeah, I could see how that 
                        could confuse my sentiment. 

                                 AXTON
                        Which is... that we’re...

                                 ELLA
                        Not happening. 

           She begins to go. He calls after her:

                                 AXTON
                        Fine. We’ll just be friends.

           Off Ella, not convinced. 
           END FLASHBACK and PRE-LAP the rumble of...

           EXT. SOMEWHERE OVER THE ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY

           Air Force One streaks through the sky. 

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE - SERIES OF SHOTS - MOMENTS LATER

           We track through the famous interior of Air Force One, now 
           adorned with Christmas decorations. Garland sweeps along the 
           side hallway of the plane, passing the Secret Service cabin, 
           computer area, and staff quarters until we reach the 
           conference room - door closed - protected by a USSS Agent. 

           INT. AIR FORCE ONE CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ben and Anita sit at a large table. Two holiday wreaths flank 
           the flat screen TV behind them, which displays a map of the 
           plane’s progress across the Atlantic. They hold phones, 
           connected by wires to the table. They’re speaking with:

           INT. ROYAL AIR FORCE AIRBUS VOYAGER - CONTINUOUS

           Sandra, also in private quarters on a flight. Begin INTERCUT:

                                 BEN
                        The President simply wanted to 
                        ensure that we are on the same page 
                        with our most important ally. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I come bearing the same message 
                        from the Prime Minister. 

                                 ANITA
                        Being on the same page is 
                        important... 

           A taut beat before Ben jumps in. 

                                 BEN
                        To do that, President Axton asked 
                        us to build relationships with our 
                        counterparts based in mutual 
                        respect, trust... and transparency.

                                 SANDRA
                        Personal relationships are key. 
                                 ANITA
                        For better or worse.

           Another beat. Sandra’s still not biting. 

                                 BEN
                        The Special Relationship is based 
                        on our shared history. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Shared histories can be 
                        complicated. 

           WIDEN to REVEAL Axton seated at the other end of the table, 
           listening on his own phone. He mouths “she knows” to Ben and 
           Anita, who heed his advice.

                                 ANITA
                        We know.

                                 SANDRA
                        So do I. 

           Anita and Ben nod back to Axton. It’s clear which special 
           relationship they’re discussing. 

                                 ANITA
                        How many other people know-- I mean 
                        really understand the nature of the 
                        shared history, of the special 
                        relationship?

           This is the key question. A long beat ensues. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Just the Prime Minister. 

           Anita rolls her eyes “no way,” Ben exhales, and Axton nods - 
           knows it’s true. Ella didn’t tell anyone. 

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        And on your side?

                                 BEN
                        The special relationship is 
                        understood by the President, his 
                        Chief of Staff, and myself. 

                                 ANITA
                        No wider understanding exists.
                                 SANDRA
                        Well, then I think we understand 
                        that the right people understand 
                        the importance of limiting 
                        understanding of the special 
                        relationship.

                                 BEN
                        Our understanding--

                                 AXTON
                     (un-muting/hanging up)
                        I can’t bear this any longer. We’ll 
                        see you in Paris, Ms. Whetstone. 

           INT. ROYAL AIR FORCE AIRBUS VOYAGER - CONTINUOUS

           Sandra’s momentarily taken aback to have heard from the 
           President of the United States. Then, she looks to the corner 
           of the room where Ella’s been listening in, more composed.

                                 ELLA
                        He was listening in.

           Sandra looks to the phone Ella is still holding. 

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        Right.

                        Is it one kiss or two?

           Axton standing with Ben, Anita, and ALEXANDER (40), the 
           persnickety, perfectly-dressed Chief of Protocol.
                                 ALEXANDER
                        There are basically two schools of 
                        thought: firm handshake, double 
                        kiss on the cheek. Or firm 
                        handshake, no kiss. Never one kiss.

                                 AXTON
                        And in this instance?

                                 ALEXANDER
                        To foster an environment suitable 
                        for successful diplomacy, I’m of 
                        the mind that an embrace always 
                        bests a handshake. But it is your 
                        first time meeting Prime Minister 
                        Walker, so I could go either way.

                     (to Ben and Anita)
                        This wasn’t worked out on a staff 
                        level?

                        I’ll wing it.

                                 ALEXANDER
                     (worry building)
                        Those are my least favorite words! 
                        Sir, Mr. President, sir: There are 
                        too many variables. Building 
                        bridges between leaders is the 
                        first step to building bridges 
                        between governments! And if you 
                        know anything about structural 
                        engineering, building bridges takes 
                        planning, foresight--

                                 AXTON
                        Alexander. I’ve got this. 

           INT. G7 CONVENTION HALL - FAMILY PHOTO STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Axton enters from off-stage. The pack of reporters perk up. 
           Camera shutters flutter. A commotion befitting the American 
           President rumbles through the room as he meets...
                                 AXTON
                        Remy.

           REMY THOMAS, the very tactile French President (think Gad 
           Elmaleh). They shake hands. Remy kisses Axton on the cheek.

                                 REMY
                        Bienvenue.

                                 AXTON
                        Merci. 

           Axton makes his way down the line of six other leaders, but 
           we don’t see those greetings. We’re focused on Ella at the 
           end, standing poised. Axton comes to her.

           They’re face to face. First time in 22 years. They share a 
           look for a split second, and Axton’s about to lean in when 
           Ella holds her right hand out firmly. 

                                 ELLA
                        Mr. President.

           Axton smiles, takes her hand. They shake.

                                 AXTON
                        Madam Prime Minister. It’s a 
                        pleasure to mee--

                                 ELLA
                        The pleasure’s mine. Lovely to see 
                        you again. 

           That throws Axton a bit, but he recovers quickly. Smiles.

           INT. G7 CONVENTION HALL - FAMILY PHOTO STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           The leaders, each in front of their flags, pose together for 
           a family photo. The French President, playing host, is in the 
           middle next to Axton. Ella is on one far end and PRESIDENT 
           VITALY (formidable, clever, 68) on the opposite far end. As 
           the photos wrap, leaders disperse. Axton approaches Ella [nb: 
           “pull-aside” is a diplomatic term for an impromptu meeting].

                                 AXTON
                        Madam Prime Minister--

                                 ELLA
                        Ella.

                                 AXTON
                        Ella. I’d love a brief pull-aside 
                        with you if--
           Remy butts in. Puts his arm around Axton.

                                 REMY
                        Harry, we have to discuss the new 
                        Ambassador; he’s a disaster--

           As multiple leaders approach Ella, congratulating her. 

                                 REMY (CONT’D)
                        You’d do well to recall him. Tres 
                        vite! And don’t get me started on--

           Axton turns towards Ella, who’s been enveloped by the 
           leaders. We pull away as Ella and Axton are tugged in 
           opposite directions.

           INT. G7 CONVENTION HALL - MEETING ROOM - LATER

           A presentation wrapped. Axton, Ella, and the other leaders 
           close their briefing books, remove their translation devices. 

                                 AXTON
                        Ella, would now work?

           EDITH WEBER (50s), the German Chancellor, approaches Axton. 
           Edith’s bubbly, but dead serious when it comes to her work.

                                 EDITH
                     (smiling throughout)
                        Harry, my friend, climate-based 
                        migration is becoming a thing, and 
                        your UNGA speech left me a little, 
                        how should I say... pissed-the-hell-
                        off.

           Harry looks briefly to Ella - and we’re with her now - 
           cornered by the Japanese Prime Minister, TARO ISHIBA, who 
           speaks through a TRANSLATOR. 

                                 TRANSLATOR
                        Former Prime Minister Paxhouse’s 
                        posturing on automobiles hurt both 
                        our countries, and it is my hope--

           We pull away. Ella and Axton mired in the affairs of state. 

           INT. G7 CONVENTION HALL - MEETING ROOM - LATER

           Leaders and their aides continue to shuffle to and fro. 
           Axton’s with Ben, handing him a document.
                                 AXTON
                        Taro’s proposal. Proximate targets, 
                        nothing remotely forward-looking--

           He notices Ben’s attention drawn to something behind him. 
           Axton turns to find:

                                 ELLA
                        Mr. President, you wanted a pull-
                        aside?

                                 AXTON
                        I did.

           They head off together. Ella nods to Ben.

                                 ELLA
                        Lovely to see you again, Ben.

           Ben looks around, puzzled, worried someone could have heard - 
           but no one’s around... save for Sandra.

                                 SANDRA
                        Here we go.

           As we PRE-LAP a swift ZIPPERING.

           INT. TENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Axton finishes zipping a large white tent door from the 
           inside. Ella sits across from him. 

                                         WE PULL OUT TO:

           INT. U.S. CONTROLLED PREP ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Where the tent sits awkwardly in the middle of the room. An 
           AGENT clicks on a stereo that plays POP MUSIC [nb: this is 
           really how the United States Government helps combat spying]. 

           INT. TENT - CONTINUOUS

           The music can be heard, but less clearly. 

                                 AXTON
                     (re: music)
                        It muffles any listening devices. 
                        And the tent ensures no cameras...
                                 ELLA
                        Thank you for the basic training in 
                        op-sec, but I have bilat prep I 
                        could be tending to so why don’t we-

                                 AXTON
                        Yes, no, of course. I just think we 
                        need to talk...
                     (Ella’s not budging)
                        About us. Our past. 

                                 ELLA
                        Mr. President, I was just elected 
                        Prime Minister, not prom queen. 

                                 AXTON
                        Which is exactly why we need to get 
                        a handle on a few things, 
                        especially our history. 

                                 ELLA
                        Mr. President--

                                 AXTON
                        Ella, first of all, call me Harry. 
                        Second, this is no longer just a 
                        personal matter. 

                                 ELLA
                        Harry. You want to talk? Let’s talk 
                        about tomorrow’s principal’s 
                        meeting. 

                                 AXTON
                        Ella, seriously, we--

                                 ELLA
                        I don’t think I’ve ever been more 
                        serious in my life. 

                                 AXTON
                        Fine. Let’s talk about tomorrow. 
                        I’m going to need you to leave some 
                        space for Vitaly to--

                                 ELLA
                        Continue flouting basic 
                        international norms of behavior? 

                                 AXTON
                        No. Space to preserve flexibility. 
                                 ELLA
                        There’s an inspired foreign policy 
                        doctrine if I’ve ever heard one. 

                                 AXTON
                        We need to maintain a range of 
                        ideas that includes Vitaly, so he 
                        can find his way to a position we 
                        can work with. 

                                 ELLA
                     (unzipping the tent)
                        I’d like a little space myself. 

           INT. U.S. CONTROLLED PREP ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ella steps out of the tent. The music’s louder now. Axton 
           follows her, notices the agent (MARK). 

                                 AXTON
                        Mark.
                     (as Mark begins to go)
                        And Mark...

           Mark clicks the stereo OFF. Ella and Axton alone again, this 
           time in silence. 

                                 ELLA
                        If there’s nothing more to discuss, 
                        my team’s waiting.

                                 AXTON
                        It’s a mistake not to talk about 
                        it. 
                     (that hangs a moment)
                        Always is.

           Ella considers, notices another corner of the prep room. 

                                 ELLA
                        The other leaders know about this?

           And we REVEAL: Life-size cardboard cutouts of all the Prime 
           Ministers and Presidents we’ve seen at the G7. 

                                 AXTON
                        No, and I’d like to keep it that 
                        way - though I imagine they have 
                        equally bizarre prep strategies. 
                                 ELLA
                        Your secret’s safe with me. 
                     (then)
                        Tell me about them.

           Axton approaches the cutout of the German Chancellor.

                                 AXTON
                        Edith’s laser-focused on migration 
                        right now. She’s been good on the 
                        issue, but Germany’s on the front 
                        lines of a crisis that could spill-- 

                                 ELLA
                        No, tell me about them. I know 
                        their positions. I’ve studied their 
                        backgrounds. Tell me about what 
                        makes them tick. 

           Axton isn’t quite sure where to begin.

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        What they’re afraid of. What they 
                        think is funny. Politics is 
                        personal. 

                                 AXTON
                        Okay. You know how everybody calls 
                        her “Steady Eddie”?

                                 ELLA
                        For her longevity on the world’s 
                        stage and dedication to democracy. 

                                 AXTON
                        Sure, sure - all of that. But she 
                        can drink like a fish without the 
                        slightest wobble. 

                                 ELLA
                        Really?

                                 AXTON
                        Once saw her put back five pints of 
                        Guinness and then convince 
                        President O’Malley to agree to 
                        increased tariffs on Irish pharma 
                        products flowing into Germany. It 
                        was masterful.  

                                 ELLA
                        And our host for the weekend?

           We focus on a photo of Remy Thomas. 
                                 AXTON
                        Hands-on in diplomacy and 
                        interpersonal interactions. 

                                 ELLA
                        I noticed that. 

                                 AXTON
                        It’s almost cliche. 

                                 ELLA
                        Your neighbor to the North?

           We note the CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER’S cardboard cutout. 

                                 AXTON
                        How such a polite citizenry elected 
                        such an immense prick, I will never 
                        understand. 

                                 ELLA
                        Not cliche though. 

                                 AXTON
                        No, and he’s a reliable partner. 
                        Just a miserable person.

           Moving to the ITALIAN PRESIDENT’S cutout. 

                                 AXTON (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and Lorenzo, my God, great guy - 
                        but, by all means, avoid him at the 
                        dinner tomorrow night. His stories 
                        are endless.

                                 ELLA
                        And with the translation...

                                 AXTON
                        Doubly-so!

           They smile - for the first time in a while - together. Until 
           they reach the next cutout: Prime Minister Ella Walker.  

                                 AXTON (CONT’D)
                        Ella Walker. 

           She rolls her eyes.

                                 AXTON (CONT’D)
                        Afraid of spiders. A planner. 
                        Accomplice to boat theft.

                                 AXTON (CONT’D)
                        Never really understood what makes 
                        her tick. 

                                 ELLA
                        That’s quite enough, Harry.

                                 AXTON
                        She’s--

                                 ELLA
                        Ready to move on to Anatoly. 

           Axton takes a breath, his momentum cut short, as they move to  
           Vitaly’s cutout. Ella’s not ready to re-live their past.  

                                 AXTON
                        Certainly as deluded as you’d 
                        expect from a strongman who’s been 
                        in power twenty-some years--

                                 ELLA
                        Twenty-two.

                                 AXTON
                        Right... 22. Tends to respond to 
                        carrots.  

                                 ELLA
                        When was the last time you tried a 
                        stick?

           INT. G7 CONVENTION HALL - TRANSLATION ROOM - DAY

           A group of TRANSLATORS sit in a darkened room, watching 
           something we do not see. They speak simultaneously. Different 
           languages. We don’t have any idea what they’re saying, but we 
           hear FRENCH, ENGLISH, ITALIAN, JAPANESE, and RUSSIAN.

           INT. CONVENTION HALL - MEETING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The eight leaders sit around a circular conference table, the 
           G7 logo emblazoned in the center. Each has an earpiece that 
           they hold to their ears when necessary. Aides, including Ben 
           and Sandra, sit back-bench at attention along the walls.

                                 AXTON
                        We all come to this table with 
                        different perspectives--

                     (in Russian)
                        And varying levels of experience. 
           A shot at Ella. She lets it go.

                                 VITALY (CONT’D)
                     (in broken English)
                        Welcome, Ms. Walker. It’s important 
                        you are here, despite controversy 
                        over your election in your home 
                        country. 

                                 ELLA
                        Thank you, Mr. President. I suppose 
                        we can’t all win with 97.5 percent 
                        of the vote. 

           The room is taken aback - the implication clear. 

                                 AXTON
                        But I think we can agree that 
                        Yemen’s civil war has to end. 

                                 ELLA
                        Of course. But we need to be 
                        intellectually honest as we frame 
                        the conversation. Yemen isn’t 
                        fighting a civil war so much as a 
                        dozen foreign countries are 
                        fighting proxy wars on Yemeni soil.

                        Russia is at the top of that list, 
                        Anatoly. Your security forces’ 
                        arming of the insurgency is--

                        Edith, I don’t understand. I’ve 
                        seen no evidence of that. Merely 
                        rumors. 

                                 ELLA
                        There’s a saying: It’s difficult to 
                        get a man to understand something 
                        when his salary depends on his not 
                        understanding it.

                     (in broken English)
                        Truth is, I’ve been so tied up 
                        helping the Americans with Iran... 
                        maybe Russia pulls back on this 
                        front and focus on finding what you 
                        say is illegal action in Yemen?
                                 AXTON
                        Anatoly, I appreciate the 
                        insinuation, and it should be noted 
                        that your cooperation has been 
                        crucial in our continued progress 
                        with respect to Iran.

                                 ELLA
                        It should also be noted that doing 
                        the right thing in one part of the 
                        world does not give you license to 
                        do the wrong thing in another. 

           Remy puts his hand on Ella’s arm. 

                                 REMY
                     (in English)
                        Ella, I fear you’re demanding 
                        purity at the expense of progress. 

                                 VITALY
                     (in Russian)
                        And I fear you’re a little 
                        confused, Ms. Walker. 

                                 ELLA
                        You men, so fearful.

           Edith smirks.

                        I know a saying, too: Intelligence 
                        is the ability to hold conflicting 
                        thoughts and still function. 

                                 AXTON
                        Okay, let’s focus on--

                                 ELLA
                        Does it ever occur to you all that 
                        there is no other room?
                     (a beat)
                        Maybe it’s the clarity that comes 
                        with being new, maybe cynicism 
                        hasn’t yet set in -- but it strikes 
                        me there is no other room. No one 
                        else to make these decisions. We’re 
                        it. Think about that. I mean, 
                        Jesus, we’re the ones who are 
                        supposed to know better. And, right 
                        now, we’re failing the people of 
                        Yemen.

                        History is staring us in the face, 
                        and I won’t blink.

           We land on Vitaly as Ella removes her ear piece, covers the 
           small mic in front of her, and says something in Russian. 

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                     (in Russian)
                        And, Anatoly: I don’t get confused.  

           Vitaly stares back, blinks, then offers an inscrutable smile.

           EXT. FRENCH MANOR - NIGHT

           MOTORCADES pull down the driveway. Heavily armed MEN and 
           WOMEN scope the surroundings and talk into radios.

           INT. FRENCH MANOR - NIGHT

           A sophisticated party where world leaders and French high 
           society meet and mingle. Ella and Sandra enter together. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Russia’s Foreign Minister already 
                        reached out at the staff level. 
                        That’s a good sign, ma’am. 

                                 ELLA
                        Time will tell. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I know I should play it cool, but 
                        you bent the world’s leaders to 
                        your will today. And I’m bursting.  

           Sandra grabs two glasses of champagne. Hands one to Ella, 
           swigs the other. Axton approaches. Sandra peels off. He’s 
           clearly frustrated. He looks at Ella’s glass.

                                 ELLA
                        I told you I was going to try the 
                        stick approach.

                                 AXTON
                        That was a sledgehammer in there! 

                                 ELLA
                        You really want to do this here? 

                                 AXTON
                        Do you honestly feel good about 
                        this afternoon?
                                 ELLA
                        You mean when I stood up to a 
                        foreign foe or when the leader of 
                        the free world sat back and played 
                        middleman instead of statesman?

                                 AXTON
                        Ella, I’m trying to give you the 
                        benefit of the doubt, but you seem 
                        more intent on making a point than 
                        making a deal.  

                                 ELLA
                        I’ve found that the latter flows 
                        from the former. 

                                 AXTON
                        All your experience on the world’s 
                        stage teach you that?

                                 ELLA
                        Right out of Vitaly’s playbook. 
                        Nice, Harry. What else has the 
                        dictator taught you?  

                                 AXTON
                        My point is I’ve been in this fight 
                        longer than you, and you have to  
                        learn to pick your battles. 

                                 ELLA
                        Good advice. 

           She leaves - this battle’s not worth it - but turns back. 

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        You’re right by the way. It is a 
                        stage, and sometimes you have to 
                        put on a show.  

           We’re on Ella, determined but shaken. The Italian President 
           approaches with a translator.  

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)

           Axton standing with the Canadian Prime Minister, JOSHUA. 
                                 AXTON
                        Remy’s team did a nice job. 

                                 JOSHUA
                        Of all the G7’s I’ve been to, this 
                        is certainly one of them.

                                 AXTON
                        Right... Well, I trust the United 
                        States can continue to count on 
                        Canada’s support as we develop--

                                 JOSHUA
                     (walking away)
                        Always, always. 

           Axton rolls his eyes, spots Ella cornered in conversation 
           with Lorenzo. He takes a drink, eyes her, thinking about the 
           way they left it. He’s about to approach when:

                                 REMY
                        Beautiful woman.

           Remy sidles up next to Axton, touches the back of his neck.

                                 REMY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t mean that in a French way. 
                        I just can’t help noticing her.
                     (uncomfortably close)
                        And you are a handsome man.

                                 AXTON
                        Thank you, Remy. 

                                 REMY
                        It could be... a match made in G7!
                     (beat)
                        Could you imagine?!

           Remy is amused with himself. Axton tries to move away, can’t.

                                 REMY (CONT’D)
                        Poor woman. Stuck in a conversation 
                        she clearly wants no part of.

                                 AXTON
                     (sarcastic)
                        I can’t imagine.

                                 REMY
                        Why doesn’t she just make up an 
                        excuse to leave?
                                 AXTON
                        You know, I should go intervene. 

                                 REMY
                     (as Axton leaves)
                        Smart.

           INT. FRENCH MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Axton reaches Ella, Lorenzo, and the translator. He 
           eavesdrops a second and then slides in, handing her a drink. 

                                 AXTON
                        Here’s your drink... Madam Prime 
                        Minister. 

           She looks him up and down. Takes the drink.

                                 ELLA
                        Thank you. Should we continue our 
                        conversation?

                                 AXTON
                     (having fun with her)
                        Which conversation was that?

                                 ELLA
                        ...Rwanda. 

           INT. FRENCH MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Ella and Axton walking away from Lorenzo and the translator. 

                                 ELLA
                        I feel really bad.

                                 AXTON
                        For comparing me to a brutal 
                        dictator?

                                 ELLA
                        For invoking a genocide to get out 
                        of a conversation. 

                                 AXTON
                        You’re right. That’s worse. 

                                 ELLA
                        Why’d you come over? 

           He looks back at Remy. 
                                 AXTON
                        Sometimes our interests align. 

           Axton’s hand rests on the small of her back, a momentary 
           reminder of their past. Holds a beat. Then he takes it away 
           deliberately. Too easy to fall back into whatever that was.  

                                 ELLA
                        Didn’t feel like it 10 minutes ago.

                                 AXTON
                        I’m sorry about what I said. 

                                 ELLA
                        Saving me from Lorenzo fully makes 
                        up for it.

                                 AXTON
                        I warned you about him yesterday. 
                        Not that I expected you to listen. 

                                 ELLA
                        I listened... How do you think I 
                        got Edith to accuse Vitaly first? 

           They spot Edith Weber in the corner. Ella raises her whiskey 
           glass to Edith who returns the gesture. 

                                 AXTON
                        All very clever. Unfortunately, the 
                        Foreign Minister is already making 
                        noise. And not in a good way.

                                 ELLA
                        I learned to block out the noise a 
                        long time ago. 

           They find a table, sit.

                                 AXTON
                        Time will tell. 

           On Ella, suddenly doubtful of her strategy, when: A MIME 
           makes his way past them “pulling” himself along a “rope.”

                                 ELLA
                        Thank God this is closed press. 

                                 AXTON
                        Remy hosted the G20 three years 
                        ago. Opted for a cabaret show on 
                        the final night. Turkish President 
                        stormed out.

                                 AXTON (CONT'D)
                     (noticing)
                        Anita!

           Anita turns, approaches. 

                                 AXTON (CONT’D)
                        Ella, this is my chief of staff--

                                 ELLA
                        Anita Jacobs, of course. I’m very 
                        impressed by your work. Especially 
                        given who you have to deal with 
                        every day.

                                 ANITA
                        We all have our burdens to bear. 

                                 ELLA
                        I could never stand the smoking.

           Anita’s taken aback by the forthrightness. 

                                 AXTON
                        I quit.

                                 ANITA
                        His worst habit now is asking 
                        “what’s next?” every ten minutes.

                                 ELLA
                        That is a bad habit. 

                                 ANITA
                        Pleasure to meet you, Madam Prime 
                        Minister.

           Anita goes. Axton ensures no one is listening, then:

                                 AXTON
                        Why’d you assume she knew?

                                 ELLA
                        The look you gave her as she 
                        approached. Your lips tensed and 
                        your eyes bulged a bit. 
                     (he does the look)
                        Like that!

           They both laugh, Axton momentarily moved by the specificity. 
           Ella touches his knee. Didn’t mean anything by it. 

                                 AXTON
                        No way.
                                 ELLA
                        What?

                                 AXTON
                        I call bullshit. You would never 
                        take a risk like that on such a 
                        flimsy premise. You listened in on 
                        the call. 

                                 ELLA
                        So did you. 

           Axton sits back, smiles. Ella, realizes her mistake. 

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        Sandra briefed me--

                                 AXTON
                        Too late. 

           INT. FRENCH MANOR - LATER

           Axton and Ella still sitting together as Remy, standing in 
           the front of the room, wraps up a toast. 

                                 REMY
                     (in English)
                        So, let’s raise our glasses. To our 
                        community of nations, to forging 
                        new partnerships, and learning from 
                        the past as we look to the future.

           Axton and Ella, glasses raised, cheers. 

                                 AXTON
                        Speaking of the future, my team 
                        wanted me to ask you--

                                 ELLA
                        Oh, Harry. Please start over. 

                                 AXTON
                        Excuse me?

                                 ELLA
                        “My team wanted me to ask you.” 
                        You’re the President of the United 
                        States--

                                 AXTON
                        People keep reminding me of that.
                                 ELLA
                        So, if you have something to ask 
                        me, ask me. 

                                 AXTON
                        Now you’ve made it awkward. 

                                 ELLA
                        I’ve made it awkward?

                                 AXTON
                        The more we talk about it, the more 
                        awkward it becomes. 

                                 ELLA
                        If our countries heard this 
                        conversation, they’d impeach you 
                        and dismiss me. 

                                 AXTON
                        Who could blame them?

                                 ELLA
                        Are you trying to invite me to a 
                        State Dinner?

                                 AXTON
                        Yes. No.
                     (off Ella’s confusion)
                        I mean yes, but not a State Dinner, 
                        which is reserved for Heads of 
                        State, which in your country’s case 
                        would be...

                                 ELLA
                        The Queen. 

                                 AXTON
                        Yes. Lovely woman. But I mean an 
                        Official Dinner. They’re just as 
                        good, but different in... Why is 
                        this so hard? I’m diplomatically 
                        obligated to ask.

                                 ELLA
                        And I’m diplomatically obligated to 
                        say yes. 

           EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOTS OF WASHINGTON, DC - MORNING

           Washington, DC in winter. A light snow blankets the National 
           Mall. Over:
                                 NEWS REPORT (V.O.)
                        Two weeks after the 46th annual 
                        summit concluded, new trade 
                        partnerships have been set...

           EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOTS LONDON - AFTERNOON

           Bundled-up Londoners brace against a stiff wind as:

                                 BRITISH NEWS REPORT (V.O.)
                        The question of Yemen looms. And 
                        Russian President Vitaly’s next 
                        move is anybody’s guess. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - SITUATION ROOM - LATE MORNING

           Axton enters quickly. Everyone around the formidable wooden 
           table rises. He motions for them to sit, just as he does, 
           quickly. The NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR pipes up:

                                 NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
                        Russia’s reversing course. 
                        Squeezing the insurgents.  

                                 AXTON
                        How so?

                                 NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
                        They’ve cut off the flow of arms 
                        and, it appears, funds. 

                                 AXTON
                        According to whom?

                                 NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
                        Assets on the ground alerted us, 
                        and our partners in Oman and Saudi 
                        Arabia are reporting the same.

                                 BEN
                        I’ll be damned. 

                                 AXTON
                        Vitaly’s reaction in Paris would 
                        not have portended this. Keep 
                        tracking it. Could be a head fake. 
                        Either way, gives us a moment to 
                        exhale for the holiday.
                     (rising)
                        Enjoy New Year’s. 
           INT. WHITE HOUSE - TREATY ROOM - EARLY EVENING

           Axton seated behind a desk - larger than the Resolute - in 
           the Treaty Room. This office, a bit more functional than the 
           Oval, serves as the President’s after-dark workspace. Clocks 
           with times from notable cities around the world - Beijing, 
           Sydney, Tehran, Cairo, London - line one wall. 

           Axton looks up from his briefing book as Ben enters. 

                                 AXTON
                        Word from the Foreign Minister?

                                 BEN
                        Not much to report. They’re playing 
                        it close to the vest.

                        We lose leverage if Iran sees that 
                        Russia is shaky.

                        This is looser than I’d like. 

                                 AXTON
                        Foreign policy’s messy. Let’s pick 
                        it up tomorrow. 

                                 BEN
                        Need anything else?

                                 AXTON
                        No, please, go enjoy the night with 
                        your family. 
                     (as Ben heads out)
                        Give Victoria and the boys my best. 

                                 BEN
                        Mr. President, I know what you’re 
                        thinking about doing... and I think 
                        it’d be best if you didn’t. 

                                 AXTON
                        Are you speaking as my oldest 
                        friend or as my Secretary of State?

                                 BEN
                        Have a good evening, Harry. 

           Which answers that. As he closes the door, Axton consults the 
           series of clocks - notices it’s nearing midnight in...
           INT. 10 DOWNING STREET - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATE NIGHT

           Where we find Ella, ensconced - reading documents in a 
           darkened, wood-paneled private room. Probably the first 
           moment of quiet she’s had in a year. She’s wearing an old, 
           faded “Oxford” sweatshirt. 

           She comes across press clippings in her bulky nightly memo, 
           including the “family photo” with Axton. Ella crosses to a 
           window through which we can make out crowds gathering below, 
           ready to celebrate. An ASSISTANT enters.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Ma’am, the American President--

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - TREATY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Axton on the phone at his desk. INTERCUT with Ella:

                                 AXTON
                        I had an interesting briefing 
                        today. 

                                 ELLA
                        As did I. Though I imagine I was 
                        less surprised by it than you. 

                                 AXTON
                        What you did was risky. 

                                 ELLA
                        Why are you calling me...
                     (consulting a clock)
                        Half hour before New Year’s?

           BEGIN FLASHBACK

           EXT. OXFORD UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

           Axton, in a tuxedo, walks past kids running with sparkler 
           fireworks. He crosses under a “Happy New Year” sign into...

           INT. OXFORD DORMS - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Where Axton stops in front of a mirror. He undoes his bow tie 
           and considers his reflection before:

                                 AXTON
                        Stupid.
           PRE-LAP a knock. 

           INT. OXFORD DORMS - ELLA’S DORM DOOR - NIGHT

           Ella skeptically eyes Axton who stands at her door. His bow 
           tie is re-tied. She notices he’s holding roses

                                 ELLA
                        I’m allergic. 

           She shuts the door in his face. A beat. He knocks. She opens. 
           Axton flings the roses down the hall without missing a beat 
           or breaking eye contact. Problem solved. 

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 AXTON
                        Had a hunch you might be alone.

                                 ELLA
                        Rather rude hunch, isn’t it? 

                                 AXTON
                        No, not because I think you are a 
                        loser or in any way unpopular, I 
                        just thought I’d... check. I worked 
                        on that “hunch” line on the way--

                                 ELLA
                        What’s with the dinner jacket?

                                 AXTON
                     (smiles, regaining poise)
                        We call them tuxedos. I was at a 
                        gala. Left early. Kind of romantic 
                        when you think about--

                                 ELLA
                        Thought you wanted to be friends.

                                 AXTON
                        That’s right.

                                 ELLA
                        Do you usually bring your friends 
                        roses? 

           EXT. OXFORD WALKWAY - NIGHT

           We find Axton and Ella walking together. No one’s around.
                                 ELLA
                        Is this really necessary?

                                 AXTON
                        Friends don’t let friends stay in 
                        on New Year’s Eve. Plus if what 
                        they say about Y2K is legitimate...

                                 ELLA
                        Could be our last night.

           Axton gives her a look, veers off the path.

           EXT. OXFORD - MOMENTS LATER

           They come upon a small riverbank. A little boat is tied up on 
           shore. Axton eyes it, smiles at Ella.

                                 ELLA
                        No way. Harry, no. 

           EXT. SMALL RIVER - MOMENTS LATER

           Ella and Axton cruising a darkened River Cherwell.  

                                 ELLA
                        It was Clinton’s fault, by the way.

                                 AXTON
                        Then why’d you jump down my throat--

                                 ELLA
                        Didn’t like the way you framed it, 
                        removing all agency from the woman.

                                 AXTON
                        I wonder if maybe we should talk 
                        about something other than 
                        infidelity and power dynamics in 
                        the workplace. 

                                 ELLA
                        I think it’s best to immediately 
                        discuss the most uncomfortable 
                        things imaginable. That way, you 
                        know right away if you can stand a 
                        person or not. Anybody can chat 
                        about the weather or sports or 
                        university. But why waste weeks on 
                        that stuff only to learn you don’t 
                        actually respect a person when you 
                        get to the things that matter?
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELLA (CONT'D)
                     (off Axton pondering)
                        What?

                                 AXTON
                        Just trying to figure out which 
                        fraught topic we can cover next.

                                 ELLA
                        Teachers fraternizing with 
                        undergrads?

                                 AXTON
                        You know I’m a TA. And that’s not 
                        what this is. I like you, Ella. 

                                 ELLA
                        Tell me about your family.

                                 AXTON
                        Can we start with something 
                        simpler? Systemic racism, maybe?

                                 ELLA
                        I bet it’s actually pretty simple 
                        if you say it out loud and limit 
                        yourself to 20 words. 

           Axton’s perplexed. 

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        Try it. I swear. 

                                 AXTON
                        My dad left. But he waited just 
                        long enough to be sure I knew 
                        exactly what was going on. 

                                 ELLA
                        19 words, nice. How old were you?

                                 AXTON
                        Eleven. Spent the next 11 years 
                        trying to cheer up my mom. 

           Ella puts her hand on his knee.

                                 ELLA
                        And now you’re on your third fancy 
                        post-graduate degree in hopes of 
                        what? Delaying re-entry into the 
                        real world?

                                 AXTON
                        I don’t know. 
                                 ELLA
                        I can’t imagine not knowing. I 
                        could never not know what’s next. 

                                 AXTON
                        I have plans. Big plans... I just 
                        don’t know what they are yet. 

                                 ELLA
                        I know my plan.

                                 AXTON
                        The internship. 

                                 ELLA
                        That’s phase one.

                                 AXTON
                        You have phases? 

                                 ELLA
                        Internship upon graduation. Engaged 
                        by 27. Kids at 30. MP by 40. And, 
                        hopefully a cabinet position in my 
                        fifties. 

                                 AXTON
                        That’s 21 words. 

                                 ELLA
                        Nix the “hopefully.”

           Ella turns toward the evening night. Axton looks to see if 
           anyone is nearby. Then: he begins to put his arm around her.

                                 AXTON
                        You must be cold. 

                                 ELLA
                        Oh, Harry. Please start over. 

                                 AXTON
                        What?

                                 ELLA
                     (mocking)
                        “You must be cold.”
                     (she moves her hand from 
                      his knee to his thigh)
                        If you want to put your arm around 
                        me, put your arm around me. 

                                 AXTON
                        Well, now you’ve made it awkward. 
           As we pull away into the darkness, they bicker lightly. It’s 
           familiar to us. But their voices fade as we fall into... 

                                 ELLA
                        I’ve made it awkward? 

                                 AXTON
                        The more we talk about it...

           ...BLACK and END FLASHBACK.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Axton’s staring out the window. Ben - standing with Anita, 
           Becca, and Connor - snaps him from his trance. 

                                 BEN
                        She’s going to want to reset the 
                        relationship on her terms.

                                 CONNOR
                        Which plays into our hands. Give 
                        her assurances on intel-sharing and-

                                 AXTON
                     (moving from window)
                        Won’t be that easy. Prime Ministers 
                        have a long history of debasing 
                        themselves for American Presidents: 
                        from Eden, Eisenhower and the Suez 
                        Crisis to Blair, Bush, and Iraq. 
                        Ella won’t make the same mistakes. 

                                 BECCA
                        But Yemen isn’t Iraq and the Iran 
                        deal is an obvious good--

                                 BEN
                        She’s under enormous pressure. 
                        Paxhouse won’t go away.

                                 AXTON
                        No roses, right?

                                 ANITA
                        Sir?

                                 AXTON
                        The flowers for the Official 
                        Dinner? What are they?

           Folks tilt their heads. Did he really just ask that?

                        I guess priorities change in the 
                        last year of a presidency.

                                 NEWS REPORT (O.S.)
                        Preparations are underway for the 
                        Official Visit of Prime Minister 
                        Ella Walker to the White House. 

           - Axton with Alexander trying on a tux and reviewing menus, 
           fabrics, and flowers. Axton’s not sure about the tux. 

           - Ella working with Sandra on a speech.

           - Axton in the Treaty Room at night, eyes the “London” clock.

           - Ella in her private office opening a large package. A note 
           reads: “In case you want to talk” before we REVEAL: The 
           cutout of the chatty Italian President. 

           - Axton getting more opinions on the tux from staffers. Billy 
           gives a thumbs up.

           - Ella trying on a dress. We don’t see it. She’s not paying a 
           moment’s attention to the outfit or her stylists. Instead, 
           she’s focused on the briefing book she brought along.

           EXT. SOUTHEAST WASHINGTON, D.C. - MORNING

           We track along with an Amtrak train hurtling to Union 
           Station, the rails seemingly headed into the Washington 
           Monument in the distance - which pierces the morning sky.

                        Walker’s set to meet with President 
                        Axton. We expect a pool spray at 
                        the top of their bilateral meeting.   
           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

           Where Axton and Ella sit in front of the fireplace. The 
           British and American press fan out: boom mics loom; cameras 
           click; and reporters rest recorders on the empty couches. 

                                 AXTON
                        So if I could conclude by again 
                        welcoming the Prime Minister. I 
                        look forward to leveraging our 
                        relationship to have a positive 
                        impact around the world. Thank you.

                        Thank you, pool. Thank you!

           The journalists are slow to move, yelling questions. 

                                 REPORTER
                        Could you have imagined this moment 
                        when you were both back at Oxford? 

                                 AXTON
                        Thank you, pool. We’ll have more--

                                 REPORTER
                        Did you know each other?

           The room quiets. 

                                 AXTON
                     (lighthearted)
                        I can assure you Ella would have 
                        been far too busy and popular to 
                        hang around with the likes of me. 

                                 ELLA
                        Actually, that’s not quite right. I 
                        knew you from a lecture hall class. 
                        You were one of the TAs.

           Axton is stunned, but hides it well. The press are intrigued.

                                 REPORTER
                        Which class?

                                 ELLA
                        But to your question, no, I 
                        couldn’t have imagined this moment 
                        back then. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           The press are gone. Axton and Ella are alone. 

                                 AXTON
                        How many reporters do you think are 
                        descending on Oxford as we speak, 
                        searching for anybody who claims to 
                        have known both of us?

                                 ELLA
                        Harry--

                                 AXTON
                        Hundred? Two hundred?

                                 ELLA
                        The real risk is saying anything 
                        that’s easily disproved. I’m sure 
                        you’ve been doing this long enough 
                        to know that’s politics 101.
                     (a beat)
                        Look, Iran is important to me, too, 
                        Harry. 

                                 AXTON
                        You have a funny way of showing it.

                                 ELLA
                        Working toward a better deal and 
                        standing up to Vitaly aren’t 
                        mutually exclusive. 

                                 AXTON
                        I need you to support reinstating 
                        practical cooperation between NATO 
                        and Russia. 

                                 ELLA
                        I won’t do that. 

                                 AXTON
                        Ella--

                                 ELLA
                        Not until they cease all 
                        intervention in Yemen. 
                                 AXTON
                        You saw the same intel I did. 
                        They’ve scaled back. I just need--

                                 ELLA
                        Space. You’ve mentioned. 

                                 AXTON
                        We have a real opportunity in Iran. 
                        I’m talking about immense good-- 

                                 ELLA
                        You’re talking about kicking the 
                        can down the road. 

                                 AXTON
                        How can you say that?

                                 ELLA
                        Inspection notice requirements. 
                        Delayed funds. Reactor sunset 
                        clauses.  

                                 AXTON
                        Compromises. 

                                 ELLA
                        Designed to put off the most 
                        difficult decisions.

                                 AXTON
                        If I wanted to put off the most 
                        difficult decisions, I wouldn’t 
                        have tackled immigration in my 
                        first four months in office!

                                 ELLA
                        Tackle is a strong word. Two-hand-
                        touch maybe.

           Axton, frustrated, takes a beat. 

                                 AXTON
                        Is that what you think of me? Of my 
                        Presidency? 

                                 ELLA
                        I think... you’ve been a very 
                        effective President. 

           Axton knows exactly what that means. 
                                 AXTON
                     (sharp)
                        Thirty million newly insured 
                        Americans might agree with you.

                                 ELLA
                        Eighteen million under-insured 
                        Americans might not. 

           She may have just overstepped. Axton exhales. Sits back.

                                 AXTON
                        You’re playing with fire. 

           BEGIN FLASHBACK

           EXT. SMALL RIVER - LATER

           Their boat rounds a bend, emerging from the darkness, nearer 
           campus now. Ella grabs something under her seat. 

                                 ELLA
                        Give me your lighter. 
                     (off his hesitation)
                        Come on, I’m already an accomplice 
                        to theft. Don’t hold me back now.

                                 AXTON
                     (sees what she’s holding)
                        That’s a flare. Not a firework.

                                 ELLA
                        Same difference. 

                                 AXTON
                        You want people to notice to us?

                                 ELLA
                        It’s New Year’s and a firework-- 

                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                                          AXTON
           --won’t draw attention.
                                 Flare.

                                 AXTON (CONT’D)
                        I legitimately think you shouldn’t.

           Ella moves in much closer, touching his chest, whispers.

                                 ELLA
                        And I legitimately think you should 
                        quit smoking. 
           As her lips linger near his ear, she pulls back, having 
           swiped the lighter from his jacket pocket. She smiles, 
           prepares to ignite the flare. Does so.

           Sending it... sideways into a telephone poll by the 
           riverbank. They both laugh forehead to forehead. 

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        Should we go somewhere? 

                                 AXTON
                        Here’s fine.

                                 ELLA
                        Harry, if this is going to 
                        happen... Nobody can see us. Ever.

           Harry looks around. Nobody’s remotely in sight. 

                                 AXTON
                        Like I said, here’s fine--

           She kisses him. Then again, more passionately. Their hands 
           gliding up and down each other’s bodies. Axton removes her 
           jacket. Kisses her neck. Ella runs her hands through his 
           hair, loving it until...

                                 ELLA
                        Oh my god!

           She pulls him back by the hair to see what she sees. A 
           transformer on the telephone poll is smoking. Intensely. 

           EXT. RIVERBANK - MOMENTS LATER

           Having ditched the boat, Axton and Ella dash into a field. 
           Ella stops to remove her heels. It begins to rain. Axton 
           grabs her hand, they run. Fast. Laughing. 

           INT. OXFORD DORM - ELLA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Axton and Ella reach her door. They kiss immediately. Just as 
           a flurry of students barrel down the hall. 

                                 DRUNK STUDENT
                        The power’s out at Magdalen!

                                 ANOTHER DRUNK STUDENT
                        Y2K is real!

           The students continue on. One particularly drunk student dry 
           heaves in the corner as his friends laugh and snap pictures. 
           INT. OXFORD DORM - ELLA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Axton and Ella tumble into his room to get out of the chaos. 
           They continue kissing before backing away from each other as 
           if to come up for air. Ella grabs Axton’s undone bow tie. 

                                 ELLA
                        The undone bow tie is my favorite 
                        look in the world. 

           He pulls her in. They kiss. She pulls off his bow tie. He 
           begins to undress her. Ella starts to undo his belt buckle. 

           Ella pulls him towards her. He removes her bra as they fall 
           into bed together where they begin to make love.

           INT. OXFORD DORM - ELLA’S ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Ella rolls over, wakes to find... an empty bed. Axton’s gone.  
           She’s hurt, but she’ll choose to be furious instead. 

           EXT. OXFORD UNIVERSITY WALKWAY - LATER

           Ella walks toward a bridge. She’s cold, shivering. She’s 
           pissed, and so are we. But just as she crests the Magdalen 
           Bridge over the River Cherwell and we hate Axton for leaving 
           her, we spot him - running to catch up.

                                 AXTON
                        I went to look for your coat...

           As he begins to explain, she softens - but hides that she was 
           saddened in the first place. 

                                 AXTON (CONT’D)
                        But that boat is long gone, so I 
                        grabbed this. 

           She smiles, her momentary disappointment in him now 
           evaporated as she accepts his gift. It’s the “Oxford” 
           sweatshirt we saw before - only brand-new. 

           We PAN down to the river below to find a BRITISH ROWER 
           braving the cold, who crosses out of sight below the bridge 
           as we END FLASHBACK and...

                                          MATCH CUT TO:
           EXT. POTOMAC RIVER - DAY

           An AMERICAN ROWER exits from below the THEODORE ROOSEVELT 
           BRIDGE along the Potomac River as the sun sets over DC. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - TREATY ROOM - NIGHT

           From behind, we find Axton at his desk - on the phone. 

                                 AXTON
                        How’s the Blair House?

           INT. BLAIR HOUSE - ELLA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 ELLA
                        Surprisingly cozy. 

                                 AXTON
                        I slept there my first week. 

                                 ELLA
                        Residence wasn’t ready?

                                 AXTON
                        No, the President wasn’t ready.

                                 ELLA
                        That’s either very endearing or 
                        very embarrassing. 

                                 AXTON
                        Lemme know if you decide before I 
                        start my memoir. I just wasn’t 
                        comfortable sleeping where Lincoln 
                        did. You know what I mean at all?

           Ella turns. REVEAL: A bust of Churchill staring at her. 

                                 ELLA
                        I do.

                                 AXTON
                        Do you want to come over?

                                 ELLA
                        You know I can’t. 
           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: Axton pours drinks. He approaches Ella seated on 
           the couch, taking in the quiet of the Oval Office at night.

                                 AXTON
                        How’d it feel?

           A beat. 

                                 AXTON (CONT’D)
                        Lying to that reporter? 
                     (off Ella’s look)
                        Come on, you always saw yourself 
                        here. Visiting the White House as 
                        Prime Minister. 

                                 ELLA
                        I didn’t.

                                 AXTON
                        Sure, you did.

                                 ELLA
                        I mean I didn’t lie. The reporter 
                        asked if I could have imagined the 
                        moment. The moment included the 
                        person who was on the other side of 
                        that fireplace. 

           She nods to the two chairs they were seated in during the 
           pool spray, flanking the fireplace. 

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        And that, Mr. President, is 
                        something I never imagined. 

                                 AXTON
                        Parsed like a true politician. 

                                 ELLA
                        Cynic. 

                                 AXTON
                        People find me charming. 

           They both smile a beat. But Axton seems off, taken by a 
           memory he’s not ready to re-live. Ella notices, redirects.

                                 ELLA
                     (re: Oval Office)
                        Takes on a different dynamic at 
                        night. 
                                 AXTON
                        Like all the history is still here, 
                        sitting with us. Ghosts of 
                        Presidents past.

                                 ELLA
                        Skeletons, too. 
                     (then)
                        You know how much worse it would be 
                        for me, right?

                                 AXTON
                        Because I have a penis?

                                 ELLA
                        I still can’t believe I said that.

                                 AXTON
                        I still can’t believe nobody from 
                        that class remembers you said it. 
                     (then)
                        The thing you’re kindly not saying 
                        is that you’re at the dawn of your 
                        career. I’m at the end of mine.

                                 ELLA
                        There’s life after the White House, 
                        Harry.

                                 HARRY
                        You know outgoing Presidents get 
                        one final flight on Air Force One? 
                        It’s called a “Special Airlift 
                        Mission.” SAM for short. Been 
                        looking forward to landing on a 
                        private island and getting away 
                        from all of this. Greatest honor of 
                        my life, don’t get me wrong, but--

                                 ELLA
                        You want to be even more secluded?

                                 AXTON
                        I want some clarity. Seven years 
                        behind ballistic glass can distort 
                        your perspective. I can see people 
                        out on Pennsylvania Avenue, peering 
                        through the wrought-iron gates or 
                        on the sidewalks as I drive by. 
                        Struggling to see me. And I wonder 
                        if they realize, I’m trying to see 
                        them, too.

           This strikes a chord with Ella. 
           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - ROSE GARDEN - NIGHT

           Ella and Axton, a few drinks later, stroll through the Rose 
           Garden, the illuminated Oval Office behind them.

                                 ELLA
                        Why didn’t you find someone?

                                 AXTON
                        My best guess is nobody compared. I 
                        threw myself into work. Made plans. 
                        What about you? Why the divorce? 
                        Why no kids at 30?

                                 ELLA
                        It just never felt right.

                                 AXTON
                        That simple?

                                 ELLA
                     (moving closer)
                        Whether something feels right or 
                        not is the least simple thing in 
                        the world.

           EXT. OXFORD DORMS - ESTABLISHING SHOTS - NIGHT

                                 ELLA (O.S.)
                        This feels wrong.

           INT. OXFORD DORMS - ELLA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Axton sits across from Ella who reluctantly indulges his mock 
           interview. He slips into a British accent for a moment. 

                                 AXTON
                        Pretend it’s not me.

                                 ELLA
                        Harry, that’s hard to do 
                        considering we’ve had sex...

                                 AXTON
                        Ms. Walker, my name is Montgomery, 
                        Richard Montgomery, and I’m 
                        wondering why we should hire you 
                        for this internship--
                                 ELLA
                        Are you doing a British accent?

                   AXTON
                                       ELLA (CONT'D)
           I’m asking the questions. 
                                 Because it was quite bad. 

                                 AXTON
                        Why should we choose you over the 
                        other candidates?

                                 ELLA
                        That’s a preposterous question. I 
                        don’t know the other candidates--

           Axton scribbles on a piece of paper.

                                 AXTON
                        Critiquing the questioner. Smart.

                                 ELLA
                        Some men can handle that sort of 
                        thing.

           A flirtatious look between them. Axton jots something down.

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 AXTON
                        Marking the time when the 
                        interviewee came on to the 
                        interviewer.

           She kisses him. He kisses her back sweetly, the way you kiss 
           someone you’ve spent every day of the last six weeks with. 

                                 AXTON (CONT’D)
                        Okay, lightning round!
                     (Ella rolls her eyes)
                        Biggest fear.

                                 ELLA
                        Spiders. 

                                 AXTON
                        Favorite food. 

                                 ELLA
                        Indian?

                                 AXTON
                        Is that a question, Ms. Walker?
                                 ELLA
                        Indian!

                                 AXTON
                        How honest are you?

                                 ELLA
                        I am brutally, harshly honest. 

                                 AXTON
                        First quote that comes to mind: go!

                                 ELLA
                        “It’s rare for a man and woman to 
                        fall equally in love.” Eleanor 
                        Roosevelt. 

           That stymies the moment for a beat, but Axton moves past it.

                                 AXTON
                        If you were a superhero--

                                 ELLA
                        Harry, my interview is tomorrow!

                                 AXTON
                        You don’t think superpowers will 
                        come up? 

                                 ELLA
                        Ask me something real.

                                 AXTON
                        Where do you see yourself in 20 
                        years?

           Off Ella, considering, as we END FLASHBACK and...

           gates across Pennsylvania Avenue to the Blair House.

           Ella with breakfast and a briefing book, sits across from her 
           bed, which is unmade only on one side. Sandra enters.  

                                 SANDRA
                        Morning, ma’am. How was last night?
                                 ELLA
                        He showed me the Oval Office at 
                        night. It was... affecting. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Question: Have you turned on the TV 
                        or otherwise come across news yet?
                     (off Ella’s concern)
                        I truly hate this part of the job. 
                        I should warn you it’s not great, 
                        but it’s not...

           Ella reacts to a news report on her laptop.

                    ELLA
                                       SANDRA (CONT'D)
           Shit. Shit!

                        presumably to discuss Yemen.

                        Oh my God, he knows. 

                                 SANDRA
                        He doesn’t. He just sounds that way 
                        because he speaks fluent misogyny. 
                        He’s making it about caving on your 
                        campaign promise. We need to get to 
                        the tent though. Bit more... news.

                        Vitaly’s testing Paxhouse’s theory 
                        of last night’s... visit.  

                                 AXTON
                        Doesn’t track. If Vitaly thought 
                        the Prime Minister was coming to 
                        our side, he wouldn’t test her now.

                                 BEN
                        Maybe it’s not her he’s testing.

           - White House florists inspect bouquets. No roses. 

           - Chefs prepare dishes in the industrial basement kitchen.

           - Men in tuxedos and women in formal gowns make their way

           INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - PRIVATE QUARTERS - EVENING

           Axton, in a perfectly-tailored tux, talks with Ben. 

                                 BEN
                        Harry.
                     (Axton groans)
                        I haven’t said anything yet!

                                 AXTON
                        But you called me Harry, so I know 
                        whatever you’re about to say is 
                        friend advice, and I much prefer 
                        your Secretary of State advice.

                                 BEN
                        Then consider it both. The 
                        consensus we built in the Middle 
                        East hinges on Iran, which hinges 
                        on Vitaly, which hinges on your ex-
                        girlfriend not screwing it up!
                                 AXTON
                        Don’t talk about the Prime Minister 
                        like that. 

                                 BEN
                     (humbled)
                        All I’m trying to say is, for a guy 
                        who’s going to be an airport one 
                        day and a hundred high schools, and 
                        a battleship... that guy shouldn’t 
                        be intimidated. 

                                 AXTON
                        I’ve never thought about it like 
                        that. I’m a battleship. I’m. A. 
                        Battleship! Doesn’t change the fact 
                        that I don’t want to get into a 
                        disagreement with our foremost ally 
                        in front of 300 strangers. 

           Ella enters forcefully, trailed by Sandra and Anita. 

                                 ELLA
                        You don’t need to worry about that. 
                        There’s nothing to discuss. My 
                        position hasn’t, and won’t, change. 
                        I will not ease up on Russia and 
                        neither should the most powerful 
                        country on Earth.

           It’s a big moment - and the whole room stops dead in their 
           tracks as we PAN down and notice right along with them - the 
           dress we didn’t see in the montage. Ella looks unbelievable. 

                                 AXTON
                        You--

                                 ELLA
                        Don’t you dare undermine the geo-
                        political stand I just took by 
                        commenting on my dress. I know how 
                        good I look. 

                                 AXTON
                        I’m--

                                 ELLA
                        A battleship. Let’s go. 

           Sandra can barely contain her pride as they walk past. 
           INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A FORMAL MAN enters from the Cross Hall, announces:

                                 FORMAL MAN
                        The President of the United States 
                        accompanied by the Prime Minister 
                        of the United Kingdom.

           Axton and Ella enter as the room erupts. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM - LATER

           We follow them. Ella watching Axton. Axton watching Ella. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM - LATER

           Axton rises to deliver a toast. Ella is seated at his side. 

                                 AXTON
                        As America entered its gravest test 
                        since the Civil War, and the 
                        globe’s future was more uncertain 
                        than ever, Winston Churchill came 
                        to visit the White House. A few 
                        days turned into nearly a month. 
                        And with the help of a not-
                        insignificant amount of scotch, 
                        right upstairs, a President and a 
                        Prime Minister forged a bond that 
                        broke the back of the Nazi’s and 
                        won the war. After Churchill 
                        departed, FDR took to his suddenly 
                        too-quiet office and penned his new 
                        friend a letter. “It’s fun to be in 
                        the same decade as you,” he wrote. 
                        Eight decades later, I raise my 
                        glass to the new Prime Minister. 

           He looks to her like there’s no one else in the room.

                                 AXTON (CONT’D)
                        Though our paths may cross only for 
                        one year, I can already tell: It’s 
                        fun to be in the same decade as 
                        you.

           As the guests CLINK champagne, we find Ella, quietly moved. 
           INT. WHITE HOUSE - FOYER - LATER

           Two glasses are set down. Ella and Axton sit on the red-
           carpeted marble steps. They both sip their drinks. 

                                 ELLA
                        Do most of your State Dinners end 
                        like this, drinking on the steps?

                                 AXTON
                        No, this has a very Official Dinner 
                        vibe. But we could drink upstairs.

                                 ELLA
                        I’m not sure that’s a good idea.

           She kisses him on the cheek. They hold a beat. Maybe. Nope.

                                 AXTON
                        Do you want me to walk you across 
                        the street?

                                 ELLA
                        Why don’t we FaceTime Kevin 
                        Paxhouse while we’re at it?

           Axton smiles. So does she. She gets up to go.

                                 AXTON
                        Is that really it? The optics?

           She thinks a beat. Doesn’t answer. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER

           Axton paces impatiently. Enters his bedroom. We hold at the 
           door as he disappears. He returns - passing us with purpose.

           INT. BLAIR HOUSE - DOOR TO BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Axton knocks. He catches his reflection in an ornate mirror. 
           He quickly undoes his bow tie. Ella opens the door. He’s 
           debonair in this moment.

                                 AXTON
                        Did you know the White House has 
                        tunnels? 

           From the side, she pulls him in. 
           INT. BLAIR HOUSE - ELLA’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           They’re close. 

                                 ELLA
                        If you think this will have any 
                        effect on my decision with respect--

                                 AXTON
                        I don’t.

                                 ELLA
                        Because I signed off on new 
                        sanctions against Russia no less 
                        than ten minutes ago.  

                                 AXTON
                        I understand.

           Chemistry says they have to kiss this instant. 

                                 ELLA
                        Does the Secret Service know you’re 
                        here?

                                 AXTON
                        Of course. Six of them trailed me 
                        through the tunnel, and we crossed 
                        two underground checkpoints to get 
                        here. Kind of romantic if you think 
                        about it.

                                 ELLA
                        And they know why you’re here?

                                 AXTON
                        I mentioned a tariff emergency.

                                 ELLA
                        A tariff emergency?

                                 AXTON
                        It wasn’t my finest work. But they 
                        don’t know. 

                                 ELLA
                        You’re not giving appropriate 
                        credit to the men and women you 
                        entrust with your life. And if you 
                        are, you should rethink who you let 
                        carry a gun around you. 
                                 AXTON
                        We’re going to talk ourselves out 
                        of another moment, aren’t we?

           EXT. ROOF OF THE BLAIR HOUSE - LATER

           Ella and Axton sit atop the roof of the Blair House, 
           overlooking the White House gleaming against the backdrop of 
           Washington after midnight. 

                                 ELLA
                        It’s endearing.
                     (beat)
                        I decided it’s endearing that you 
                        slept here your first week in 
                        office.

                                 AXTON
                        My team didn’t believe me.

                                 ELLA
                        That you slept--

                                 AXTON
                        That your ex-boyfriend became 
                        President of the United States, and 
                        you really didn’t tell anybody.

                                 ELLA
                        It’s not what I wanted for my claim 
                        to fame. That wasn’t my plan.

                                 AXTON
                        I know.

           A beat. Axton takes a sip of his drink. Ella breaks in:

                                 ELLA
                        It was odd watching you get 
                        inaugurated, but also not as weird 
                        as you’d think. There was this 
                        duality. The idea of you - this 
                        global figure - and then there was 
                        the 27-year-old guy I knew who was 
                        just trying to figure out his life. 

                                 AXTON
                        We’re different things to different 
                        people. 

                                 ELLA
                        That’s right. 
                                 AXTON
                        Question I’ve always had is what 
                        are we to each other?

           Ella breaks the simmering tension. 

                                 ELLA
                        A secret.

                                 AXTON
                        Sometimes I wonder if running for 
                        office was my way of sending out a 
                        flare. Hoping it’d bring you back 
                        to me, that we’d cross paths in 
                        public life. 

                                 ELLA
                     (after a long beat)
                        Maybe it’s enough, you know, same 
                        decade and all. Maybe merely 
                        existing at the same time as 
                        someone you love can be enough.

                                 AXTON
                        No. It’s not enough. 

           They’re close again. Eyes locked. 

                                 ELLA
                        I wasn’t honest with you at Oxford.

           Ella looks toward the Washington Monument. She’s on the verge 
           of saying something important, then - disappointed - exhales:

                                 ELLA (CONT’D)
                        I’m not actually allergic to roses. 

                                 AXTON
                        Please, for the love of God, 
                        pretend you are for the rest of 
                        your life. I drove my staff crazy 
                        about that.

           Ella looks ready to cry. Or laugh. She laughs. Then: 

                                 ELLA
                        I think about the way it ended 
                        every day. But if we stayed 
                        together, we wouldn’t have this. 
                     (re: the White House)
                        We wouldn’t be here. 
                                 AXTON
                        Maybe we’d be someplace else. Maybe 
                        we’d have two kids. A normal life 
                        with normal people who aren’t 
                        around to take a bullet for you, 
                        but just to be there. 

                                 ELLA
                        On the other hand, you wouldn’t be 
                        a future battleship. 

                                 AXTON
                        Legacy’s a strange thing to think 
                        about without a family. 

           A quiet beat. Ella starts to laugh to herself a bit. 

                                 ELLA
                        It’s funny. We got the two jobs on 
                        Earth that make it impossible for 
                        us to be together. 

                                 AXTON
                        I guess you were right all along.

                                 ELLA
                        About what?

                                 AXTON
                        Fate. 

           As we PRE-LAP the thunder of...

           EXT. JOINT BASE ANDREWS - DAY

           The Prime Minister’s Royal Air Force plane barrels by us. A 
           series of shots track the plane that takes Ella from Axton. 
           Soaring through the air. Touching down in London at SUNSET. 

           EXT. WASHINGTON MONUMENT - SUNRISE

           The sun crests the tip of the Washington Monument as frenzied 
           news reports - as if from the heavens - bleed together.

                        The bombshell report, which is 
                        reportedly backed up by scandalous 
                        pictures, comes on the heels of the 
                        Prime Minister’s first official 
                        visit. Neither the White House nor 
                        Downing Street has commented.

           Sandra and Ella, shell-shocked, watch in disbelief.

                        Kevin Paxhouse has already called 
                        for Ms. Walker’s resignation, her 
                        duty to country clearly conflicted.

                        She’s proven she’ll bend over 
                        backwards for the American 
                        President. 

                                 SANDRA
                        If we’re going to survive this, I 
                        need to know everything. 

                                 ELLA
                        You do know everything. 

                                 SANDRA
                        I didn’t know there were pictures. 

                                 ELLA
                        Neither did I! 

                                 SANDRA
                        And I don’t know what happened that 
                        night after the President--

                                 ELLA
                        Nothing happened. You don’t think I 
                        know that would create an actual 
                        conflict of interest?

                                 SANDRA
                        I do. And we didn’t spend months, 
                        alone, working our asses off to get 
                        elected for this to take us down.

           Axton mutes the television. Picks up the phone. INTERCUT:

           INT. 10 DOWNING STREET - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 ELLA
                        The whole trip was a risk that 
                        wasn’t worth it. 

                                 AXTON
                        The moment we let our past effect 
                        state decisions, like a routine 
                        official visit, then everything 
                        they’re saying about us is true. 

                                 ELLA
                        They’re not saying the same things 
                        about us, Harry. 

                                 AXTON
                        Come on, Ella. You don’t think this 
                        is destabilizing for me, too?

                                 ELLA
                        Destabilizing, yes; defining, no! 
                        Jesus, Harry, you’ve always been so  
                        careless about this. I cannot 
                        believe two meaningless months 
                        decades ago are going to cost me 
                        everything. 

                                 AXTON
                        If it makes you feel better to 
                        revise history, that’s fine, but--

                                 ELLA
                        Must be easy to talk about history 
                        when you’ll be remembered as the 
                        47th President of the United 
                        States, and I’ll go down as the 
                        Prime Minister who fucked him! 
                        This. Wasn’t. Worth. It.

           They hang up. Each suspended momentarily in their own quiet 
           isolation - even as the world around them swirls with...

           YELLING. Sandra on the phone, grapples with Ben and Anita who 
           are on a speakerphone as we intercut with...

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - CHIEF OF STAFF’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 BEN
                        We deny. Now! Every second we sit 
                        on our hands--

                                 ANITA
                        We can’t say a thing before we know 
                        exactly what the pictures are.

                                 BEN
                        There’s no way they have anything.

                                 SANDRA
                        Sounds like they do. London Live’s 
                        holding the photos for prime time.

                                 BEN
                        Shiny press scandal to distract 
                        from the policy failings of Ella’s 
                        G7 stunt, maybe? 

                                 SANDRA
                        Excuse me?! If anybody leaked it, 
                        it was your side--

           An infuriated Ben responds, goes back and forth with Sandra, 
           but we’re focused on Anita. After a beat, she breaks in.

                                 ANITA
                        They would never have done it, Ben.

                                 BEN
                        How do you know?

                                 ANITA
                        I know.

                                 BEN
                        Then, who did?

           BEGIN FLASHBACK

           INT. OXFORD DORMS - ELLA’S ROOM - AFTERNOON 

           Axton’s watching TV on the couch. Ella’s leaning on him. 
           We’re on her a beat. She mutes the TV, sits up.
                                 ELLA
                        You know how I like to talk about 
                        the uncomfortable thing right away?

                                 AXTON
                        I am aware of that quirk of yours. 

                                 ELLA
                        Sometimes it’s harder than others. 

                                 AXTON
                        I bet it’s pretty simple if you say 
                        it out loud and limit yourself...

                AXTON (CONT’D)
                                          ELLA
           To twenty words. 
                                 I got the internship.

                                 AXTON
                        What? That’s incredible!

           He kisses her, then clocks that something is really wrong.

                                 AXTON (CONT’D)
                        OK, you’ve succeeded in making me 
                        uncomfortable, but I have no idea 
                        why.

                                 ELLA
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 AXTON
                        For what?

                                 ELLA
                        For making you uncomfortable. 
                        For... I don’t know.

                                 AXTON
                        Ella, what’s going on? Talk to me.

                                 ELLA
                        The whole thing just reminds me... 
                        this is about to be over.

                                 AXTON
                        What’s over?

                                 ELLA
                        Us.

                                 AXTON
                        That’s not true. 
                                 ELLA
                        Your program ends in a month. I 
                        start the month after that. 

                                 AXTON
                        I’ll move to London. 

                                 ELLA
                        And do what?

                                 AXTON
                        I don’t know.

                                 ELLA
                        That’s the wrong answer.

                                 AXTON
                        I want to be with you. How is that 
                        the wrong answer?

                                 ELLA
                        It just is. I’m the easy way out 
                        for you, Harry. The path of least 
                        resistance. 

                                 AXTON
                        Ella, you are a lot of things. Easy 
                        isn’t one of them.

                                 ELLA
                        You’re jumping from degree to 
                        degree... to me.

                                 AXTON
                        Only you could think I’m an idiot 
                        for seeking more education.

                                 ELLA
                        I don’t think you’re an idiot. I 
                        think you’re... very good at 
                        getting an education. 

                                 AXTON
                        I know you’re what’s next for me.

                                 ELLA
                        Maybe that’s true, but it doesn’t 
                        mean the reverse is also true. I’m 
                        22 years old and I need to figure 
                        some things out on my own.
                                 AXTON
                        Bullshit, Ella. You’re the most 
                        frustratingly figured-out person on 
                        earth. You have your entire life--

                                 ELLA
                        And it’s your job to what? Disrupt 
                        my plan? Sweep me off my feet?

                                 AXTON
                        That’s your problem. You look at 
                        everything as “either or,” like 
                        being happy inherently comes at a 
                        cost. Like my wanting to be with 
                        you is a threat to your plan. If 
                        you’d get out of your head for one 
                        second, you’d see that’s not the 
                        case. You can do both. 
                     (calming down)
                        I just want to be a part of what 
                        you want.

                                 ELLA
                        I want some space.

           Axton, reaching a breaking point, collects himself a beat.

                                 AXTON
                        Do you love me?

                                 ELLA
                        I don’t know.

                                 AXTON
                        That’s not how love works. You 
                        know.

                                 ELLA
                        I don’t.

                                 AXTON
                        How can you not know?

                                 ELLA
                        Because...

                                 AXTON
                        Because what?!

                                 ELLA
                     (yelling)
                        Because I didn’t see you!
                                 AXTON
                        What?

                                 ELLA
                        When you asked me a couple of weeks 
                        ago where I saw myself in 20 years -  
                        I didn’t see you. I don’t see you.

           If a person could break into pieces, Axton would in this 
           moment. He stares, crushed, struggling to say anything.

                                 AXTON
                        I’ll make sure no one sees me 
                        leave. 

           He goes, closing the door softly behind him - leaving Ella, 
           broken just the same. We stay with her a beat. 

                                 NEWS HOST (PRE-LAP)
                        This is devastating. 

           END FLASHBACK

           As we cut quickly through a series of news CLIPS: 

           CLIP 1: A serious NEWS HOST addresses the camera. 

                                 NEWS HOST (CONT’D)
                        If you’re just joining us, the 
                        world sits stunned tonight as 
                        shocking 22-year-old photos 
                        threaten the globe’s most important 
                        geo-political alliance.  

           CLIP 2: A PANEL debates the repercussions.

                                 PANELIST 1
                        No doubt damning for both leaders.

                                 PANELIST 2
                        But Ella Walker has the most 
                        explaining to do. 

                                 PANELIST 3
                        I don’t see her surviving this. 

           CLIP 3: A PARTISAN HOST whips up his TV audience. 
                                 PARTISAN HOST
                        To think this lie - this 
                        international conspiracy - would 
                        have continued if not for some 
                        random Oxford student who happened 
                        to come across the incriminating 
                        evidence. Kevin Paxhouse tried to 
                        warn us. Tells you everything you 
                        need to know about President Axton 
                        and Ella Walker! 

           CLIP 4: A former Oxford STUDENT’s interviewed on LONDON LIVE.

                                 RANDOM FORMER OXFORD STUDENT
                        I was cleaning out my flat when I 
                        saw them. 

           The production cues up a series of PHOTOS. They show the 
           Oxford student huddled in a corner, dry heaving. It’s 
           familiar to us.  

                                 RANDOM FORMER OXFORD STUDENT (CONT’D)
                        It was the Millennium. I was kind 
                        of out of my head when my mates  
                        took these. Not the most flattering 
                        photos of me. 

           In the background, the pictures show Axton and Ella at her 
           dorm door. Three quick shots reveal the damning progression: 
           Ella and Axton getting close, kissing, and entering her dorm.

                                 LONDON LIVE HOST
                        Considerably less flattering for 
                        the Prime Minister and American 
                        President, I’d say. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRIVATE DINNING ROOM

           Axton rises - as pissed as the London Live Host is smug.

                                 AXTON
                        Is Becca briefing?

                                 ANITA
                        Yes.

           He’s on the move quickly into...

                                 ANITA (CONT’D)
                        Sir, where are you going?
           INT. WHITE HOUSE - OUTER OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Axton barges through. Anita and Ben behind him.

                                 AXTON
                        To rip the press to shreds.

                                 BEN
                        Mr. President--

                                 AXTON
                        To tell the world the truth. That 
                        none of this is Ella’s fault.

                                 ANITA
                        Slow down. That’s literally the 
                        worst thing you could do right now.

           As they step down into...

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LOWER PRESS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Where Billy sits, stunned, next to the sliding door to the 
           briefing room, which we see via a TV hanging above Billy. 
           Becca is fending off an unruly press corps. 

                                 REPORTER (ON TV)
                        Becca, did the President have 
                        anything to do with Ms. Walker’s 
                        divorce?

           Axton moves toward the door, ready to slide it open.

                                 ANITA
                        What? You’re going to give a big 
                        speech? Be Ella’s knight in shining 
                        armor?

                                 AXTON
                        I’m going to do what’s right. 

                                 ANITA
                        And what’s that? There’s no one to 
                        attack. This wasn’t Vitaly or 
                        Paxhouse or anybody. It was... 
                        random.

                                 AXTON
                        All the same, I’m--

                                 ANITA
                        As your Chief of Staff, I order you 
                        not to go out there. 
                                 AXTON
                        That’s not how this works.

                                 ANITA
                        As a woman then!

           She didn’t want to say it. Last resort. But it was the truth, 
           and it resonates with Axton who stops dead in his tracks.  

                                 REPORTER 2 (ON TV)
                        Did the Prime Minister use her 
                        romantic relationship to...

           Axton retreats. Doesn’t say a word. Realizes he’s helpless to 
           fix this: because of who he is and because of who Ella is.

           INT. 10 DOWNING STREET - OFFICE - DAY

           Ella - shattered all over again - watches a TV, which shows:

                                 NEWS REPORT (CONT’D)
                        Paxhouse continues to build a 
                        coalition as Walker’s polls 
                        plummet.

           A slimy LATE NIGHT HOST has a laugh at her expense:

                                 LATE NIGHT HOST
                        I guess the British really are 
                        coming!

           As the laughter on screen fades, Sandra enters to find Ella.

                                 SANDRA
                        Do I need to read you the quote 
                        about “the man in the arena”?

                                 ELLA
                        There’s a reason it’s called the 
                        man in the arena. A face “marred by 
                        dust and sweat and blood” is indeed 
                        worthy of credit, but add a little 
                        make-up... 

                                 SANDRA
                        Ella--

                                 ELLA
                        I spent my whole life trying not to 
                        be defined by men and now it’s all 
                        I’ll ever be. 
                     (then, realizing)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELLA (CONT'D)
                        It’s 25 years later and the world 
                        found something else to talk about.

                                 SANDRA
                        What?

                                 ELLA
                        Nothing.

           Lindsey enters in the background, sorting papers.

                                 SANDRA
                        Permission to speak freely?

                                 ELLA
                        Oh, Jesus.

                                 SANDRA
                        You need to fight this. So what if 
                        the world’s talking--

                                 ELLA
                        Sandra, I’m exhausted. I’m not sure 
                        I even want the job anymore.

                                 SANDRA
                        Would a man ever say that?

                                 ELLA
                        You work for a woman.

           Sandra leaves. Lindsey, in the background, mumbles something 
           that goes unheard as she leaves, too. 

           INT. 10 DOWNING STREET - OFFICE - LATER

           A BLURRED PERSPECTIVE. Ella looking through the bulletproof 
           glass of her office, down to the street. She turns back to 
           the TV, which shows a WOMAN on the street being interviewed.

                                 REPORTER (ON TV)
                        What do you think about the scandal 
                        enveloping the Prime Minister?

                                 WOMAN ON STREET (ON TV)
                        I always had a bad feeling about 
                        her. Now I know what it was! 

           Ella’s struck by this. We hold on her - something inside her 
           growing - as Lindsey enters the background with tea and an 
           ANALYST bloviates on TV.
                                 ANALYST (ON TV)
                        She speaks for so many. A nation 
                        shocked, but maybe not surprised.

           As the analyst continues on, Ella’s attention turns to:

                                 ELLA
                        Lindsey. What did you say earlier?

                                 LINDSEY
                        Ma’am?

                                 ELLA
                        When I was talking to Sandra, you 
                        mumbled something. What was it you 
                        said? 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I’m sorry, I-- After you said she 
                        works for a woman. She being Ms. 
                        Whetstone, Sandra, I mean... I just-

                                 ELLA
                        Go on then.

           Lindsey musters confidence, looks her boss square in the eye.

                                 LINDSEY
                        She works for the Prime Minister. 
                        We all do.

           Lindsey, pleased to have gotten it out, exits. Ella thinks a 
           beat before - like lighting - calling to:

                                 ELLA
                        Sandra!

                                 SANDRA
                     (entering)
                        Parliament?
                     (Ella nods)
                        When?

                                 ELLA
                        Now’s good.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           Anita enters to find Axton behind his desk.
                                 ANITA
                        Statement’s out to press making 
                        clear this was a six week 
                        relationship 22 years ago. That it 
                        is not and never was ongoing. Now 
                        we work to weather the storm.

                                 AXTON
                        I want to thank you. For earlier. 
                        For keeping me from making a fool 
                        out of myself. And Ella.

                        Part of the job description.

           Axton smiles. Then:

                                 AXTON
                        I lied to you. When I said we 
                        didn’t love each other. That was a 
                        lie. I loved her. 

                                 ANITA
                        I know.

                                 AXTON
                        I looked into her a few years after 
                        Oxford. Saw she was engaged. Her 
                        plan was right on track. So I spent 
                        years trying to forget her. 

                                 ANITA
                        That’s a long time to try and 
                        forget someone.
                     (then)
                        I know this is normally the kind of 
                        conversation you’d have with Ben, 
                        but I appreciate--

                                 AXTON
                        I’m glad to be having it with you. 
                        When this is all over, I want you 
                        and Ben to come down to the island 
                        with me. Bring your families. We 
                        can celebrate eight great years. 
                        Complicated, but great. 

           Anita nods. Starts to head out.

                        It’s going to be significantly 
                        harder this time.
                     (off Anita’s confusion)
                        To forget her. Now that she’s...

           Ella exits the back of her Jaguar. We barely see her through 
           the hordes of press and umbrellas.

                        Prime Minister Walker will address 
                        Parliament today as the legislature 
                        considers a vote of no confidence. 

           INT. BRITISH PARLIAMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Parliament. Boisterous. Ella enters. All eyes on her. MPs 
           tiered behind her and in front. Paxhouse smirks as Ella 
           reaches the rostrum. She steps up. Holds a beat before: 

                                 ELLA
                     (counting each word on her 
                      fingers)
                        There’s. Just. Something. About. 
                        Her. I. Don’t. Like. Sound 
                        familiar?
                     (off the room’s unease)
                        I’ve heard those eight words a lot. 
                        During my career. My campaign. My 
                        premiership. Some of you are 
                        probably thinking it right now!

           MPs hoot and holler. Ella gamely smiles along with them.

                        But what does it mean? What don’t 
                        we like? Surely, some of you were 
                        miffed that I used my maiden name 
                        when I first ran for office, even 
                        though I was married. There was 
                        something about it you just didn’t 
                        like.

                        When Madeleine Eaton came back to 
                        Parliament just a month after she 
                        and her husband had a baby, surely 
                        some of you snickered over drinks 
                        at the Westminster Arms. There was 
                        just something about it you didn’t 
                        like. And when I ran for PM, a 
                        single divorcee, there was just 
                        something about it Kevin Paxhouse 
                        didn’t like.  

           Paxhouse is less comfortable than before.

                        It’s why he ran against my ex-
                        husband more than me. It’s why the 
                        basis for the vote he’s asking you 
                        to take is the identity of my ex-
                        boyfriend. For those of you who’ve 
                        asked whether I might be unduly 
                        influenced by the American 
                        President: Have you also wondered 
                        whether he might be unduly 
                        influenced by me? If not, why not?

           The room is beginning, slowly, to turn.

                        Our biases run deep. They’re vexing 
                        things. No single speech or person 
                        is going to wipe away what 
                        generations of Kevin Paxhouses have 
                        wrought. Instead, I’m simply asking 
                        you to recognize them. So the next 
                        time you say, “There’s just 
                        something about her I don’t like,” 
                        you know what you’re really saying 
                        is: “There’s just something about 
                        women in politics I don’t like.” 

           Grumbling in the crowd.

                        Which is true. It’s upsetting. It’s 
                        a little threatening. Even though 
                        we know everything’s not perfect, 
                        when somebody different steps up to 
                        try and help, we become unnerved. 
                        It disrupts the natural order of 
                        things. The natural order that 
                        instantly compares me to Thatcher, 
                        but gives Kevin Paxhouse space to 
                        get his bearings.

                        difficult” and men as “mavericks.” 
                        Women as “nasty” and men as

                        this job though. There’s just 
                        something about it I like. There’s 
                        just something about it that suits

                        I am not a newer Margaret Thatcher.

                        not going anywhere. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - RESIDENCE OFFICE - DAY

           We pull out from a TV playing Ella’s speech to find Axton 
           transfixed. A door opens. We’re on Axton.

                                 AIDE (O.S.)
                        Sir, motorcade’s on the South Lawn.

           INT. THE BEAST - DAY

           Axton staring, still transfixed, peering out the window of 
           the Beast - where this all began. The rain pelting quietly  
           against impenetrable steel and ballistic glass. Ben’s there.

                                 BEN
                        Do you want to talk about it?

           Axton doesn’t answer. He peers out the window - speeding 
           through the rain - to a group of onlookers braving the 
           weather for a glimpse. Axton looks beyond Ben to the driver. 

                                 AXTON
                        Stop. Stop!

           EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

           We’re with the crowd. In the rain. The Beast slowly reverses 
           into frame. Axton gets out, greets the ecstatic crowd. 
           Axton sees them, and they see him.

                        will be no vote. Ella Walker has

           Another woman on the street is interviewed for local news.

                        I don’t give a damn who she bonked 
                        20 years ago. Ella Walker is in 
                        charge, and I am here for it!

           BEGIN MONTAGE - VARIOUS

           - Ella, having seen the report on TV, smiles wryly, then gets 
           back to work, signing legislation.

           - Axton campaigning passionately. Soaking it up.

           - Ella shaking hands with a world leader.

           - Axton playing basketball. Billy fouls him. Axton hits the 
           ground. Billy’s afraid. 

           Just as the momentum peaks, we slow down to find...

           - Ella, in her faded Oxford sweatshirt, looks to the tattered 
           book Axton bought 22 years ago: “The History of Number 10.”

           - Axton, alone in the Treaty Room. He eyes the “London” 
           clock. Thinks better of calling and then goes back to work.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - LOWER PRESS - DAY

           Axton steps down into Lower Press, more composed than his 
           last visit. He approaches the sliding door. Billy’s there, 
           very nervous. Anita and Ben stand behind Axton. He looks to 
           them. They nod. Axton’s about to open the door. But first he 
           turns and FIST BUMPS Billy.

           We’re on Billy. That meant the world to him. We find the TV 
           above Billy and see Axton at the podium.

                        Good afternoon. For 11 months, my 
                        Administration has negotiated with 
                        Iran through Russia. A path of 
                        least resistance. That ends today. 
                        Crippling sanctions are going into

                        Here’s my plan.

                        After eight years as President of 
                        the United States, Harry Baker 
                        Axton was asked this week if he had 
                        any last words for the American 
                        People. He said simply: Thank you.

           The elevator door opens. Axton exits, turns a corner to find:

           The entire hallway is lined with STAFFERS. It’s impossible 
           not to be overwhelmed by the sheer number of them. Axton 
           begins to make his way down the line. Shaking hands. Hugging.

                        Today marks his final full day in 
                        the White House. His last year saw 
                        its share of turbulence, but these 
                        final few months have been 
                        historically productive for a lame-
                        duck Administration. The 
                        President’s aides cite progress in 
                        Yemen and unprecedented relief to 
                        the 18 million under-insured 
                        Americans. 

           His eyes well. He looks like he needs to take a deep breath, 
           but can’t. We close in on him, taking it all in, until we 
           find him finally in the...
           INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

           His last night. Anita enters quietly.

                                 ANITA
                        Messages are pouring in from around 
                        the world. There’ll be plenty of 
                        time to look at them, but I thought 
                        you might want to see this one. 
                        Secret Service almost didn’t let it 
                        through.

           She hands him a small box. We pull away as she departs. Axton 
           begins to open it. We don’t see what’s inside, instead 
           pulling back - appreciating the full scope of the darkened 
           Oval Office.

           ... As one President transitions to the past. 

           EXT. BLUE SKY - DAY

           Air Force One, now the Special Airlift Mission, soars.

           EXT. ISLAND AIRPORT - DAY

           A gorgeous tropical island. The dull roar of jet engines on 
           the tarmac drowns out most other noise. AIRPORT WORKERS make 
           preparations. A SUPERVISOR rolls up in a cart, gives a 
           signal. The workers begin to disperse. 

           INT. SPECIAL AIRLIFT MISSION - DAY

           Axton sits contentedly in the conference room. The small 
           package by his side. The onboard map behind him lets us know: 
           He’s crossing the Atlantic...

           INT. 10 DOWNING STREET - CABINET ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Ella leads a meeting of the cabinet. Sandra, back-benching, 
           reacts to something on her phone. She approaches Ella. 

                                 SANDRA
                     (whispering)
                        A large plane that looks 
                        suspiciously like Air Force One 
                        just touched down at Heathrow. 
           EXT. LONDON STREETS - AFTERNOON

           News helicopters track a small caravan of black SUVs snaking 
           their way through the streets of London toward...

           INT. 10 DOWNING STREET - CABINET ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A television now tuned to the news. Ella watches. So does the 
           rest of the Cabinet. 

                                 NEWS ANCHOR  (ON TV)
                        An unexpected first visit by the 
                        now-former President of the United 
                        States. 

                                 NEWS ANCHOR 2 (ON TV)
                        Hundred pounds says I know where 
                        he’s headed.

                                 ELLA
                        Excuse me.

           As Ella exits and closes the door, the Cabinet members jump 
           to their feet, huddling by a window - looking down.

           EXT. 10 DOWNING STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Ella exits the famous black door just as the SUVs stop short. 
           The press - a lot of them - are assembled in their usual spot 
           across the street, having heard the news...

           Axton exits his car. Approaches Ella in full view of the 
           press who snap away.

                                 AXTON
                        I got your package. I think we 
                        should talk.

                                 ELLA
                        I lied to you. 

                                 AXTON
                     (lighthearted)
                        I’m very confused. You are or are 
                        not allergic to roses--

                                 ELLA
                        I saw you. I saw you, and it scared 
                        me. 

           This means everything to Axton. 
                                 AXTON
                        Can we go somewhere? 

           Ella looks to the hordes of reporters, cameras. Turns back...

                                 ELLA
                        Here’s fine.

           She pulls him in... And for the first time in 23 years, they 
           kiss. The press go wild. They keep kissing. Ella wants the 
           world to see.

           INT. 10 DOWNING STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Ella and Harry enter the foyer of Number 10. 

                                 ELLA
                        I’ll see if I can get someone to 
                        give you a tour.

           Harry smiles, sits down. We hold on him as he places the 
           package by his side. He eyes it. For the first time, we see 
           what’s inside. 

           It’s a flare. 

           Axton smirks. And, with the weight of the world literally 
           lifted, he exhales as we...

                                           SLAM CUT TO:

           INT. 10 DOWNING STREET - CABINET ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ella swings the door open assuredly. No sense of 
           dishevelment. Just polish and poise. She sits before the 
           cabinet. Her cabinet.

                                 ELLA
                        Let’s get back to work.

           And they do.

                                          CUT TO BLACK.
