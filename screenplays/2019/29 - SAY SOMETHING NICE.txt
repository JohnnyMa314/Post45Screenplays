           INT. MERCEDES PASSENGER VAN - NIGHT

           Plush seats, sexy lighting. LIV OLSEN (30), effortlessly cool 
           and edgy (p.s. it took hours to perfect this look), addresses 
           a group we can’t yet see. 

                                 LIV

                        ‘normal’ life behind. Because 
                        tonight, you’re with me, and 
                        together we’re going to ‘liv it up’ 
                        - trademark - and you’ll have the 
                        BEST. NIGHT. OF. YOUR. LIFE. 
                        Wooooo!

           A chorus of charged “WOOOO’s” erupt around her.

           This is a bachelorette party. And Liv is their HBIC. 

           Liv downs a shot of tequila. An unmissable diamond ring 
           sparkles on her finger.

           Six WOMEN (20s,30s), all cat ears and sequined clothes, with 
           the exception. The BRIDE (30s)wears a “FUTURE MRS.” sash.  

                                 BRIDE
                          (yelling)
                        I want a tattoo!

           The SISTER BRIDESMAID (30s) shakes her head, mouths “no.” 

                                 LIV
                        Don’t worry - there’s plenty of 
                        time for questionable decisions.

           BRIDESMAID 1 raises her hand. Like at school.

                        No problem. Paula?

           PAULA (50s), the driver but oh so much more, gives a thumbs 
           up, then presses a button. A hidden compartment slides open, 
           revealing band-aids, deodorant, tampons, gum, dry shampoo, 
           hair elastics - everything needed for a girls’ night out. Liv 
           throws Bridesmaid 1 some lactaid chewables.

                        I call it!

           This sets off a chorus as Liv hands out meds.

                        Calli’s Finale. 

           The words light up the TV. The bach party CHEERS.

           The party bus comes to a stop and Paula turns a dial. 
           Britney’s “Work B*tch” comes on as the interior lights go 
           down, and Liv squares off with the troops. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Remember, all I can do is take you 
                        through the night. It’s up to you 
                        to enjoy it. And as Queen Oprah 
                        says, you only get in life what you 
                        have the courage to ask for - so 
                        ladies - get courageous!

           Liv opens the door and leads the bachelorette party out onto 
           the -

           THE LAS VEGAS STRIP

           Bright lights. Car horns. Music. Crowds of people. The 
           thrilling, pulsing immensity of Sin City at night. 

           Liv arranges the bachelorette party for a photo.

                        your cheeks. Yes you hot fire 
                        babes! We are going to filter the 
                        shit out of this!

           A FLASH as Paula takes the photo, each girl their hottest 
           sultry self. 

           Liv pivots, leading the girls into the casino. All swagger. 
           “You want a hot body, you want a Maserati...”

           EXT./INT. THE ARIA - LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

           BELLMEN open the doors, nodding at Liv, who leads a group of 
           SORORITY GIRLS, all shiny hair, French manicures and 
           (probably) HPV. Liv’s sidekick GABRIEL (20s) - gay, fun, loud 
           but could/might/will cut you - lifts the rope for them at the 
           front of the long line.

           Throbbing EDM. DING. Elevator doors open on a VIP balcony. 
           Liv leads a different bachelorette party of KARDASHIAN CLONES 
           to a table stacked with Swarovski crystal bottles of liquor.

           Liv signals STEVE AOKI in the DJ booth and a massive overhead 
           screen morphs to a photo of the “Kardashians.” The 
           bachelorette party loses their minds. 

                                 BRIDE
                          (to Liv)

           The music cranks. 

           - the Kardashian bachelorette party tears up the dance floor, 
           100% living their best life. A serious faced Gabriel vogues 
           nearby.

           - On the bus, Liv pops champagne. Paula catches the cork with 
           one hand as she steers. Bridesmaids admire Liv’s ring.

           - A SOCCER MOM bachelorette party is front row at MAGIC MIKE 
           LIVE. A DANCER walks by Liv, bumping fists.

           on how to play craps at the Hard Rock Cafe. She WINS! 

           - Gabriel serves platter of Shake Shack burgers and fries to 
           a CO-ED bach party. Liv shows the BRIDE and GROOM her phone.

                        sitting there, watching the sun 
                        come up, Austin just says “marry

           Liv tugs the engagement ring off her finger and tosses it 
           into the van’s glove compartment on a pile of other rings.

                        he gets the importance of image. 
                        And I know he respects and admires

                        please! 

                                 GABRIEL
                        Liv, people come to Vegas to be a 
                        wild and slutty. It’s straight 
                        foolish not to offer more than 
                        bottle service at the ‘klerb.’

                                 LIV
                        Oh I’m sorry. Are backstage photos 
                        with Ricky Martin too basic for 
                        you? Because I don’t hear anyone 
                        else complaining.
                          (to Sonic Worker)
                        Hey man hey! Heyyyy!

           Liv waves her arm but can’t get his attention. She doesn’t 
           notice as a GUY (30s), sitting on the hood of his car and 
           leaning against the windshield, looks over at her. 

                                 GABRIEL
                        Ricky Martin is divine. God bless, 
                        never change. But why not offer 
                        extreme experiences. Dirty divas 
                        and freaky freaks. Savage Nights by 
                        Gabriel for Liv It Up! Like a 
                        collab - like   Gucci and Disney. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GABRIEL (CONT'D)
                        By the way, I’m Gucci in this 
                        scenario - no shade.

           Gabriel does an invisible hair flip. Liv sighs. 

                                 LIV
                          (to Sonic Worker)
                        Yo! Yoooo!

           Sonic Worker - deep into his iPad. The guy on the hood - 
           jumps down and goes up to the counter. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                          (to Gabriel)
                        Look. My goal is to have Liv It Up 
                        everywhere. A curated good time 
                        from a local social media 
                        influencer who gets you the best 
                        pics and access to the coolest shit 
                        wherever you are. We’re going to be 
                        the Drybar of the experience 
                        economy. Brand consistency is 
                        everything. 

                                 GABRIEL
                        And I want to contribute.  

                                 LIV
                        And I want you to. To my vision. 
                        Like tours of David Copperfield’s 
                        secret magic warehouse. That’s 
                        kitschy, bizarre, exclusive. And I 
                        asked you to find an in weeks ago.

                                 GABRIEL
                          (please god no)
                        Liv. 

                                 LIV
                        Think iconic optics that make 
                        everyone wish they were there. Not 
                        stripper poles.

           Lucas walks up, carrying a fast food bag and to go cup. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Hi.

           He hands them to Liv.

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        It’s an inspired combination. 
                        Especially for breakfast. I always 
                        just get coffee. 
                                 LIV
                        What is happening.

                                 LUCAS
                        I brought your order. You see, I 
                        like this time of day because it’s 
                        quiet and peaceful. I come here for 
                        my coffee and the view. Which is 
                        hard to do when someone is yelling 
                        about tater tots.

                                 LIV
                        Rude. 

           Gabriel has a big, open mouth smile, delighted by this 
           exchange. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Not rude. Helpful. You’re welcome. 

                                 LIV
                        Excuse me? 

           But Lucas walks off, across the parking lot. Liv and Gabriel 
           watch him climb into a vintage Scout.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck just happened? 

                                 GABRIEL
                        He bought you breakfast and then 
                        put you on blast. It’s the most 
                        magical thing I’ve ever seen.   

           As Lucas drives away -

                                 LIV
                        I should throw this milkshake at 
                        his car. But I want it. What are 
                        the odds, do you think, that he 
                        spit in and or poisoned this?

                                 GABRIEL
                        Not high enough.

           Beat. Liv takes a careful sip of her milkshake.

           EXT/INT. LIV AND AUSTIN’S HOUSE - FOYER - MORNING

           Liv closes the door, drops her bag and stares at a wall 
           mirror. She puts on lip gloss and takes off her shirt, 
           adjusting her hair and bra for maximum sex appeal. Then walks 
           down a hall toward a closed door.
           INT. LIV AND AUSTIN’S HOUSE - BEDROOM 

           Liv opens the door, looking cute, ready to seduce, then 
           freezes. On the bed two people make tender, gentle, gag-me-
           with-a-spoon love. 

           Liv watches in disbelief. Then -

                                 LIV 
                        WHAT THE FUCK?

           AUSTIN (32) shouts and SHINEE (26) screams, as Liv rushes the 
           bed, grabs a pillow and starts beating him with it. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        You! fucking! dick!

           Shinee grabs the covers and slides to the floor. Austin gets 
           up, covering himself with one pillow while Liv beats him with 
           the other. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Liv! Stop!

           Liv looks down at Shinee. 

                                 LIV
                        Who are you?

                                 SHINEE
                        I’m Shinee. 

           Like a red flag to a charging bull. RAGE. Liv YELLS and 
           charges. Pillows go flying.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAISY AND FELIX’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Liv faces DAISY (30s) and her husband FELIX (30s) across a 
           counter. They drink coffee but Liv swigs from a bottle of 
           tequila.

                                 DAISY
                        Did you kill them? Are they dead? 
                        Do you need me to help dispose of a 
                        body? I have a go bag.

                                 LIV
                        Almost a year together and this is 
                        what I get. Can I sue him?

           Felix chuckles. A look from Daisy and he gets serious.
                                 FELIX
                        I’ll have my paralegal look into it 
                        as soon as I get in.

                                 LIV
                        I did so much for him. That fresh 
                        as death David Beckham Bradley 
                        Cooper wardrobe? Me. Those rad 
                        vacations that made everyone wish 
                        they were us? Me. I made him 
                        pinterest boards. I did butt stuff. 
                        Our life was on point! And he has 
                        the audacity to throw it all away. 
                        Do you know how many photos I’ll 
                        have to take down? So much good 
                        content. Just gone.

                                 DAISY
                        Austin gave you hemp floor mats for 
                        your car as a Christmas gift, Liv.      
                        And what did he give you for your 
                        birthday? An empty box? 

                                 LIV
                        He said it contained the space he 
                        gave me to be myself. It was a 
                        metaphor.

                                 DAISY
                        No. It wasn’t.

                                 FELIX
                          (to Daisy)
                        Can you imagine if I did that? You 
                        would literally kill me.  

                                 DAISY
                        I would. 

                                 LIV
                        He’s going to want me back. He’s 
                        probably planning out what to say 
                        as we speak.

           It’s clear from Daisy and Felix’s expressions this isn’t A) 
           likely or B) a good idea. Daisy walks over and embraces Liv.

                                 DAISY
                        I’m so sorry for what you’re going 
                        through. 

                                 LIV
                        Thank you.
                                 DAISY
                        But the best thing Austin has ever 
                        had to offer is that he managed to 
                        pull off long hair after turning 
                        thirty. And barely. Let him go. You 
                        deserve so much better.

                                 LIV
                        Exactly. He was lucky to even be 
                        with me. We were so cool together. 

                                 DAISY
                        You know what? I’ll stay home, we 
                        can watch Dr. Phil and eat garbage
                        This can be a safe, healing space 
                        for you to have profound 
                        realizations about life and 
                        yourself, and how to make better 
                        choices and see things clearly with 
                        the help of your tirelessly 
                        insightful best friend. 

           Too in her head, Liv totally misses the point.

                                 LIV
                        Fuck that. I’m not going to cry 
                        into a fucking pillow. Ima take an 
                        ambien and chill. Wait for that 
                        apology. Be fucking breezy. 

                                 DAISY
                        You sure you don’t want to talk 
                        about your feelings? Maybe hydrate 
                        with something besides tequila. 

           Daisy tries to pull the tequila away but Liv doesn’t release 
           her grip on the bottle. 

                                 LIV
                        Nope, I’m all good. 

                                 DAISY
                        Are you?

                                 LIV
                        Yes, totally. Go. Go make that 
                        money.

                                 DAISY
                        And you’ll call if you need 
                        anything.

           Daisy hugs Liv, who gives Felix a thumbs up. Daisy and Felix 
           head out the door. 
           Liv’s alone in the sudden quiet. She stares at her phone, 
           which is also quiet. No texts. No messages.

           Liv opens Instagram, taps her way to Austin’s feed. 

           Insert: A post from Austin. Black letters on a white 
           background. “So I close my eyes to old ends, and open my 
           heart to new beginnings.”

                                 LIV
                          (to herself)
                        Who the fuck are you calling old 
                        ends you Bon Iver wannabe?

           A few lines down, in the comments: ImYourShinee “you’re 
           heart’s so fine it blows my mind bb <pink hearts>.” 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        It’s ‘your’ not you are, dipshit. 

           Liv’s taps ImYourShinee, going to her feed.

           Insert: “Shinee - living for adventure, authenticity and 
           shining my light.” 

           Insert: Annoying photos of latte foam and sunsets. Boomarang 
           video of waves washing over pedicured feet in the sand. “Woke 
           up like this” caption on a pretend messy selfie with glasses 
           that you know are fake. 

           Then Liv GASPS. 

           Insert: A photo of Shinee kissing the cheek of a smiling 
           Austin. Caption: “when bae takes you for sushi and 
           champagne.”  

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Bae?

           Liv scrolls faster. Shinee and Austin on a beach, at a bar, 
           in the car, on a hike, on a bike, at a concert. Months of 
           images.

           Liv’s puts the phone down and picks up the bottle of tequila. 
           She takes a meaningful chug, closes her eyes and takes a 
           breath.  

           Liv’s eyes open. She picks up the phone.

           Liv taps, calling Austin on speaker.

           Voicemail picks up. 
                                 AUSTIN (O.S.)
                        Go for Austin.

           Liv ends the call. Redials. Ringing. Voicemail. “Go for 
           Austin.” 

           A beat as Liv looks around the quiet kitchen. Then she 
           springs into action. Opens a laptop, props up her phone, 
           unlocks an iPad. Inserts charge cables. Swigs from the 
           bottle. 

           Liv cracks her knuckles. Let the stalking begin. 

           She pulls up Austin’s Facebook page on one screen, while 
           scrolling through Shinee’s account on another, while also 
           clicking through a Google calendar.  

           Liv sees a photo of Shinee with part of a random arm in the 
           frame. She finds a match - the same photo, Austin and Shinee 
           together.

           More tequila. And down the rabbit hole we go.

                                 AUSTIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Go for Austin.

                                 LIV (V.O.)
                        Hi, you disgusting plop of human 
                        DNA. I just want you to know that I 
                        know everything. And you don’t get 
                        to just walk away from the mess 
                        you’ve made. Your  reckoning is 
                        nigh. Consequences are upon you. 
                        You messed with the lady bull and 
                        now you’re going to get the lady 
                        horns.

           - Facebook - Liv types a scathing comment on every one of 
           Austin’s posts and photos. “These skinny jeans are why you 
           have ass acne, bro.” “Does your family know you like mommy 
           porn?”

           - Instagram - Liv taps through Austin’s feed, replying to 
           every comment on every photo. “You’re so boring I want to 
           kill myself.” “U owe me like 400 orgasms.” 

           - Twitter - Liv posts, @-ing Shinee, Austin, and Chrissy 
           Teigen. 

           - LinkedIn - Liv messages Austin’s contacts. “He was skimming 
           money from the bagel fund.” “He slept with your wife and your 
           daughter and probably your mother.” 
           - Snapchat - Liv looks into the camera - with a filter that 
           gives her dog ears and a tongue - as she rants another 
           voicemail. 

                                 LIV
                          (in the filter’s high 
                           squeaky voice)
                        Truth bomb alert. You should really 
                        work on your oral skills since your 
                        dick is nothing special. 

           DING-DONG. Liv carries pizza into the kitchen, staggering a 
           little. She really needs to sleep. Instead, she pours a diet 
           coke and tequila.

           - Tumblr - Liv posts “cheater” memes and gifs. The page 
           heading reads “Austin Blows and Now the World Knows.”

           - Reddit - Liv trolls an AMA page called “Ask me about my 
           cheating boyfriend.”

           - Liv’s phone buzzes. A series of all caps texts from Austin. 
           “PLEASE STOP!!!” “THIS IS CRAZY!!!!!!” Liv cackles like a 
           villain.

           - Liv lays on the floor, filming an Insta-story.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                          (slurring, still using a 
                           fun filter)
                        ...you’re cheap, you have no taste, 
                        you’re stupid, and you no joke have 
                        the worst morning breath of anyone 
                        I’ve ever encountered. Like is your 
                        mouth rotting? Could you literally 
                        be dead inside?

           The phone beeps and the screen shows an incoming call from 
           “Daisy.” Liv declines it.

           - Liv is back at the table facing her laptop. 

           - YouTube - Drunk, delirious, Liv uploads a video and presses 
           play.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                          (way too loud, into camera)
                        The thing is, you’re not even 
                        masculine enough to actually be 
                        toxic. So instead, let’s call out 
                        the girl on girl crime that 
                        happened here. I’m calling you out 
                        Shinee!  Own what you did. Own it, 
                        Shinee! Own it! Own it! Own! It!
           - Liv’s phone buzzes on the table. Daisy again. Liv picks it 
           up and throws it into the other room.  

           - Liv types a long email on her laptop. The “TO” line is 
           lengthy. Definitely ALL her contacts. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                          (reading out loud)
                        To those of you who are members of 
                        Austin’s family, please don’t 
                        procreate further. 

           Liv giggles to herself, delighted. 

           EXT. DAISY AND FELIX’S HOUSE - DAY

           A car screeches to the curb, and Daisy rushes out of the 
           driver’s seat to the front door.

           INT. DAISY AND FELIX’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Liv photoshops an image of Austin, replacing his nose with a 
           penis. She’s a wild-eyed mess, giving off a “9/11 was a 
           conspiracy” vibe. Daisy runs in.

                                 DAISY
                        Liv. Back away from the internet.

                                 LIV
                        This monster rode elephants in 
                        Thailand that weren’t even part of 
                        an authorized sanctuary. I’m 
                        reporting him to the World Wildlife 
                        Federation. Global citizen’s 
                        arrest!

           Daisy walks slowly to the table.  

                                 DAISY
                        Hey. Liv. Look at me. 

                                 LIV
                        What? Why are you here?

                                 DAISY
                        Oh, no reason. Just wanted to see 
                        if YOU LOST YOUR DAMN MIND. 

                                 LIV
                        He’s been cheating on me for 
                        months, Daisy. Months. 
                                 DAISY
                        It’s awful, he’s awful. But you 
                        gotta stop. You’re making a huge 
                        mess. Just talk to me.

           Daisy tries to close the laptop but Liv pulls it toward her.

                                 LIV
                        No! He needs to be humiliated just 
                        like I am. I’m about to get on the 
                        dark web and see if I can sell his 
                        identity.

           Daisy grabs Liv’s iPhone, and rushes out of the room. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           INT. DAISY AND FELIX’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Daisy goes to a shelf where the wireless router sits blinking 
           green lights, and yanks out the plug. 

                                 DAISY
                        This is now an intervention!  

           Liv follows, swaying boozily. 

                                 LIV
                        Austin’s a coward and he needs to 
                        pay for what he did. 

                                 DAISY
                        And if you want to go egg his car 
                        or cut the sleeves off his shirts 
                        and set them on fire, I am down for 
                        that. But this? Trust me - I’m 
                        saving you from yourself.

           Daisy walks towards the door. Liv rushes after her. Daisy 
           wheels on her, finger pointed. Like to a bad dog.

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        No!

           Liv freezes. 

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        This is a forced unplugging! You 
                        are not internetting responsibly. 
                        You must chill. 
                                 LIV
                        Fine.

           She holds out her hands for her device but Daisy doesn’t 
           relent.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        I have to work, Daisy. How am I 
                        supposed to do that without my 
                        stuff?

                                 DAISY
                        Call Gabriel. 

                                 LIV
                        Call Gabriel with what? 

           Daisy realizes.

                                 DAISY
                        Ok, I’ll call Gabriel.  

           Daisy gives Liv a one arm hug, holding the electronics away 
           from their bodies.

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        I’m doing this for your own good. 
                        Best friend rules. I love you. I’m 
                        always on your side. Okay?

           Liv reaches for her laptop but Daisy holds it out of reach.

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        Now go to your room and get some 
                        sleep. 

           Daisy points. Liv shuffles down the hall. 

                                                            BLACK.

           Night falls on Vegas. From blazing sunlight to blinding 
           lightbulbs.   

           INT. LIV AND AUSTIN’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sober, Liv looks around her bedroom. The closet’s open, half-
           empty. Austin’s already outta there.

           Liv swipes through her clothes, coming upon her raddest 
           leather pants. Swipe. Swipe. Her sexiest shirt. A glint in 
           Liv’s eye. 

           To Beyonce and Nicki Minaj’s “Feeling Myself”... 
           EXT. LIV AND AUSTIN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Liv exits and struts to the ‘LivItUp’ bus, feeling herself 
           completely. 

           INT. MERCEDES PASSENGER VAN - NIGHT

           Liv gets in the front passenger seat and smiles at Paula, who 
           clocks the look and the attitude. 

                                 PAULA
                        I’m sorry about your break-up.

                                 LIV
                        Fuck it. Fuck him. He’s cancelled. 
                        It’s in the rearview.

                                 PAULA
                        Okay. 

                                 LIV
                        I’m great. 

                                 PAULA
                        Really? 

                                 LIV
                        Absolutely. 

                                 PAULA
                        Because my computer literally went 
                        up in flames after I read what you 
                        posted on Facebook last night. It 
                        was like The Ring. A charred 
                        skeleton, who I assume was Austin, 
                        crawled out of the screen and went 
                        right for my face. 

                                 LIV
                        I got it out of my system. It’s all 
                        in the past and I’m all about the 
                        future. 

                                 PAULA
                        Okay.

           Paula nods but her face stays skeptical. 

                                 LIV
                        I have to move. 
                                 PAULA
                        I have a second bedroom. It really 
                        belongs to my foster cats but I’m 
                        sure they would share.   

           Beat.

                                 LIV
                        So kind. But I wouldn’t want to put 
                        them out. 

                                 PAULA
                        I’m only going to say this once. 
                        But if you want Austin disappeared, 
                        I know a guy. The desert is full of 
                        secrets.

                                 LIV
                        Paula, you’re the best. But it’s 
                        okay. I’m like a phoenix rising 
                        from the ashes. The future is 
                        bright and everything is aces.

           Liv opens the glove compartment and looks at the fake 
           engagement ring. She grabs a handful, rolls down the window 
           and chucks them out into the night. 

           INT. THE ARIA - NIGHT

           Liv leads FIVE WOMEN in matching track suits through the 
           casino. As they arrive at the night club entrance, Gabriel 
           hands Liv her phone.

                                 GABRIEL
                        Daisy told me to give you this. 
                        Also, we have a problem. They gave 
                        away our table.

           Liv turns the phone on as they walk inside.

                                 LIV
                        Tell me you fixed it, Gabriel.

                                 GABRIEL
                        I got us another spot. 

                                 LIV
                        That’s not the right answer.

           Liv, Gabriel and the women crowd into the VIP elevator. 

           DING.
           Gabriel leads Liv and the bach party out onto the mezzanine. 
           Liv halts when she sees HER regular table, overlooking the 
           dance floor, occupied by another group of women. 

           Manager JUAN walks quickly over to Liv.

                                 JUAN
                          (to the bach party)
                        Ladies! Welcome! We have a 
                        wonderful spot for you this way. 

           Liv puts her hand up to stop him. 

                                 LIV
                        You gave away my table. What the 
                        fuck, Juan.

                                 JUAN
                        I tried calling you. I had no 
                        choice. One of them is a Maloof. 
                        There was literally nothing I could 
                        do. You get it.  

           Juan puts his fist out for a bump. Liv slowly pushes it down 
           with one finger.

                                 LIV
                          (ice)
                        Such a shame, Juan. I liked coming 
                        here. But all good things must end. 
                        I’ll call my cousin, and tell him 
                        to call his friends, to let them 
                        know this place is R.I.P.

                                 JUAN
                        Don’t do that. What can I do?

                                 LIV
                        I don’t know, Juan. What can you 
                        do?

                                 JUAN
                        Bottle service! Anything you want!

                                 LIV
                        Comped room service in the 
                        penthouse suite.

           Juan sweats. Liv doesn’t blink.

                                 JUAN
                        Fine. Done!
                                 LIV
                          (to bachelorette party)
                        Who’s ready to party?!!!
                          (to Juan)
                        Never again.

           Juan nods, looks relieved as he leads them away. Gabriel 
           leans over to Liv. 

                                 GABRIEL
                        Who’s your cousin?

                                 LIV
                        Diplo.

           Gabriel stares at her. 

                                 GABRIEL
                        Is that true?

           Liv shrugs. It’s not an answer. 

                                 GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry about Austin, btw.

                                 LIV
                        How did you know?

                                 GABRIEL
                        I’m alive on planet earth and I 
                        have the internet.

           Liv’s phone buzzes in her hand. She looks down and sees alert 
           after alert. 181 text messages. 23 voicemails. 415 emails. 

           A look of doubt, maybe regret, crosses Liv’s face. She hands 
           the phone to Gabriel.

                                 LIV
                        I don’t want to see this again 
                        tonight.

           Liv joins in with the bachelorette party. 

           INT. MERCEDES PASSENGER VAN - NIGHT

           Selena Gomez’s “Come and Get It” is so loud the windows 
           rattle. The bachelorette party is standing and dancing. 

                                 PAULA
                        Stoplight!
           Everyone grabs hold of something except one poor bridesmaid 
           who goes flying when the van comes to a stop. 

           INT. BEAUTY AND ESSEX - NIGHT

           Dark, loud, sexy. The bachelorette party raise their glasses 
           in a ‘cheers!’ Liv’s voice is loudest.

           INT. MAGIC MIKE LIVE THEATER - NIGHT

           A DANCER movies to give Liv’s BACHELORETTE a lap dance, but 
           Liv signals him. 

                                 LIV
                        My turn! 

           INT. MERCEDES PASSENGER VAN - NIGHT

           Gabriel has a tray of Shake Shack. Liv is the first one to 
           grab food.

           INT. FRANK’S TIKI ROOM - NIGHT 

           Liv sits with the bachelorette party, and leans across the 
           table.

                                 LIV
                          (drunk)
                        There is no happily ever after, 
                        girls. Because Prince Dickface is a 
                        big fat cheater. Like, look at me. 
                        You’re welcome. You know? And the 
                        girl, she’s a pumpkin spice latte 
                        with unicorn hair. It’s like a 
                        joke. 

           A MAN IN A SUIT approaches the table.  

                                 MAN IN A SUIT
                        Good evening, ladies. 
                          (to Liv)
                        Would you like to dance?

                                 LIV
                        It’s your lucky night, bro. I’m all 
                        about making some bad decisions 
                        right now.

           Liv stands and reaches for the man’s hand, but he hands her 
           an envelope instead. 
                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                          (playful)
                        What’s this?

                                 MAN IN SUIT
                        Olivia Olsen, this is a cease and 
                        desist order. And you’ve been 
                        served.

           Liv, Gabriel, the bachelorette party - all mouths are open in 
           shock. 

                                 BACHELORETTE
                        Damn that’s cold. Didn’t even grind 
                        with you first.

           Gabriel hands Liv her phone.

           INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Felix hustles Liv through the busy halls. 

                                 FELIX
                        Because this is civil court, we can 
                        appeal to the judge’s sympathy. If 
                        you apologize, plead guilty, then 
                        maybe we can negotiate a damages 
                        payment for Austin, and it’ll all 
                        be done.

           Liv stops in her tracks. 

                                 LIV
                        You want me to give him money?! 

                                 FELIX
                        The only real defense against libel 
                        is if every single thing you said 
                        about Austin online is true.

                                 LIV 
                        It is...to me.

                                 FELIX
                        Everything? All of it?

                                 LIV
                        Well, define true.

                                 FELIX
                        There are real, legal consequences 
                        for what we say in there, Liv. 
           Daisy joins them in the hallway. She gives Liv a hug. 

                                 DAISY
                          (to Liv)
                        Just go in there, say you’re sorry, 
                        do whatever they say and we never 
                        have to see that assface ever 
                        again.

                        Why am I being treated like a 
                        criminal? Austin’s the bad guy. Not 
                        me. 

                                 DAISY
                        That’s right. And he lost when he 
                        decided to bone Coachella Barbie.

                          (to Felix)
                        But also, as my lawyer, can you 
                        find a way to mention that he’s a 
                        bedwetter.

                                 FELIX
                        I’ll do my best.

                        God, I love watching you in court. 
                        You’re like my real life Suits. 

           Daisy gooses Felix as they walk through the doors. Liv stops 
           though, not ready to go in yet. She walks toward the water 
           fountain across the hall.

                                 LIV
                          (loudly)
                        A huge bedwetter. Peed all over me 
                        one night during March Madness.

           Liv bends, takes a sip of water.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sounds traumatic.  

           Liv startles and turns, now face to face with LUCAS BONES - 
           the same Lucas from the Sonic parking lot - easy smile, 
           relaxed fit everything, radiates chill. He’s a socks with 
           Birks guy, on the inside. 
           Lucas drinks from the fountain.

                                 LIV
                        It was traumatic.  

                                 LUCAS
                          (re: the water fountain)
                        Are you filling up to get revenge? 
                        Or suing for urinary assault?

                                 LIV
                        That idiot is suing me. And he’s 
                        going to wish he died when I’m done 
                        with him. 

                                 LUCAS
                        I love the smell of death threats 
                        in the morning.

                                 LIV
                        I’m not death threating him. I said 
                        he’ll wish he were dead. 

           Liv crosses her arms and stares at Lucas. He smiles. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        You’re the rude guy from Sonic. 

           Recognition on Lucas’ face. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Oreo milkshake and tots. 

                                 LIV
                        I think you should apologize.

                                 LUCAS
                        And I’m still waiting for a thank 
                        you.

                                 LIV
                        That’s unlikely. Why are you here? 
                        Pressing charges because someone 
                        harshed your vibe? Stole your 
                        sunshine? Used a plastic straw?

                                 LUCAS
                        I think I hear a mocking tone. 

                                 LIV
                        Oh I’m sorry. I meant my mocking 
                        tone to be completely clear.
                                 LUCAS
                        Do you always make fun of people 
                        you’ve just met?

                                 LIV
                        Only if they deserve it.

           The courtroom door opens and Felix motions at Liv to get 
           inside. Liv walks to the door and notices Lucas is right 
           behind her.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        You’re going in here?

           Lucas checks the door number.

                                 LUCAS
                        Yep. 

           Oh. Hm. Lucas smiles as he follows her inside. 

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Liv sits next to Felix at one table, with Daisy behind the 
           rail. Liv shoots a glance to Lucas, who sits in the back 
           corner. On the other side of the aisle, Austin sits with his 
           LAWYER, with Shinee sitting behind them. Shinee wears 
           sunglasses and ‘melodramatic purple’ fedora.

                                 BAILIFF
                        All rise. 

           Everyone does, as JUDGE ROBERTA STONE (50s) enters the room 
           and takes the bench. She flicks through some paperwork, looks 
           up at Liv, then at Austin. 

                                 JUDGE STONE
                        I have sixteen year old twins, a 
                        boy and a girl. They share a car, 
                        which is supposed to teach them how 
                        to compromise and communicate. 
                        Yesterday, my son put the car keys 
                        in his underwear so my daughter 
                        threw his laptop in the pool. 
                        They’re both grounded. Luckily 
                        their adolescent lizard brains are 
                        still evolving and the tedious 
                        emotional hysterics and juvenile 
                        narcissism that make a mother feel 
                        as though procreation is a life

                        You sent Mr. Neff’s entire family 
                        an email that states, and I quote, 
                        “Austin has a big ole nipple 
                        fetish.”

                        In my day, we just burned a man’s 
                        car if he did us wrong. No 
                        evidence, no crime. Now everybody 
                        needs a stage and an audience.

                        Your honor, my client understands 
                        the damage that she’s caused. 
                        She’s taken all mention of Mr. Neff 
                        from her online accounts and is 
                        prepared to admit wrongdoing.

                        My client’s career was placed in 
                        jeopardy, and he lost valuable 
                        relationships because of the 
                        vitriol and lies from Ms. Olsen.

                        distress caused by her hounding 
                        texts and voicemails.  

           Austin hands his lawyer a piece of paper. The lawyer sighs.

                        My client would also like the court 
                        to recognize that the genital wart 
                        Ms. Olsen referred to is actually a

                        I can’t wait to hear what it is.

                                 LIV
                        I am the victim of Austin’s 
                        unfaithful behavior. It provoked 
                        me. Is he not therefore ultimately 
                        responsible for everything that 
                        occurred because of that 
                        provocation? 

                                 JUDGE STONE
                        By that same logic, wouldn’t it 
                        also be true that since you decided 
                        to enter into a relationship with 
                        him in the first place, you are 
                        ultimately responsible for whatever 
                        occurs in the aftermath of that 
                        decision?

                                 JUDGE STONE (CONT’D)
                        If a relationship ends without the 
                        consent of one of the party’s 
                        involved, there’s often no justice 
                        or resolution for said party.

           Liv shoots a smug look to Austin.

                        However, Mr. Neff, though you did a 
                        morally reprehensible thing, you 
                        didn’t break any laws. And Ms. 
                        Olsen, as much right as you have to 
                        be angry, you did break the law. 
                        Which means I have no choice but to 
                        find you guilty of slander.

                        forward with some closure. What you

                        aggressive, but, most importantly, 
                        untrue. Hopefully, what you put out 
                        into the world going forward will 
                        be more honest.

                                 BARRY
                        Are you sure? We can save Bull. 
                        We’re also behind on Blue Bloods - 

                                 LIV
                        NO. No. Really, it’s okay.  

           Kay shoots a look at Barry and puts down her fork. 

                                 KAY
                        Honey. Since you’re home for a 
                        while, we were wondering if you 
                        would help us throw a little party. 

                                 LIV
                        Party for what?

                                 BARRY
                        Forty years of love and friendship. 

           Barry and Kay hold hands across the table. 

                                 KAY
                        I was just going to do something 
                        small, but since you’re home, we 
                        thought you could help us make it 
                        extra special. 

                                 BARRY
                        Now we know you have a business to 
                        run, so we’re prepared to pay you. 
                        No special treatment just because 
                        we put a roof over your head.
                                 KAY
                        Well, maybe a little special 
                        treatment. 

           Liv watches her parents smile at each other across the table. 

                                 LIV
                        You don’t have to pay me. Of course 
                        I’ll do it. 

           Thrilled, Kay and Barry lean over and each kiss one of Liv’s 
           cheeks.

           INT. OLSEN HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Liv and her adult life are now crammed in her childhood 
           bedroom. An Ever After poster next to Abercrombie & Fitch 
           magazine ads taped to the wall. A weathered collage of  
           fabulous turn of the century couples Gwyneth and Brad, Reese 
           and Ryan, Winona and Johnny, JLo and Ben.

           Liv’s in bed, on her laptop. A Go Fund Me page open on the 
           screen. She photoshops a black and white image of her face - 
           adding a single tear to her cheek - before uploading to the 
           site. The goal is set for one hundred thousand dollars. 

           Liv picks up her phone and holds the button, making her apps 
           wiggle. Her finger hovers over the “x” on Instagram...but she 
           can’t do it. She sets the phone down and turns out the light.

           INT. OLSEN HOME - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Liv wakes. The first thing she does is check her phone. No 
           donations yet to the Go Fund Me page. 

           Liv also has an email from Las Vegas Justice Court. Liv 
           groans and climbs back under the covers. 

           INT. LIV’S CAR - DAY

           Liv drives, aggressively, on speaker phone with Daisy. 

                                 LIV
                        I’m going to the media. This is an 
                        abortion of justice. This is a 
                        civil rights violation. My freedom 
                        of speech is under attack!
           INT. DAISY’S CAR - DAY

           Daisy drives, also on speaker. 

           INTERCUT BETWEEN LIV AND DAISY.

                                 DAISY
                        But what if you just did it. 

                                 LIV
                        I am! I’m calling Howard Stern 
                        today for sure. And John Oliver. 
                        And Gloria Allred! 

                                 DAISY
                        No, I mean what if you just did 
                        what the judge said. 

                                 LIV
                        Are you serious right now?

                                 DAISY
                        It’s the fastest way to get this 
                        all behind you. 

                                 LIV
                        This isn’t about fast, Daisy. This 
                        is about winning. Everyone’s 
                        against me. But they underestimate 
                        me. I’m coming for them now. I’m 
                        fucking Wonder Woman.

                                 DAISY
                        But she’s so polite.

                                 LIV
                        She’s a warrior and a killer. 

                                 DAISY
                        Wonder Woman doesn’t kill people. 

                                 LIV
                        It’s a metaphor! Expand your mind 
                        sis. This is about the patriarchy.

                                 DAISY
                        But the judge was a woman.

                                 LIV
                          (not listening)
                        I AM Wonder Woman. I AM Beyonce. I 
                        AM Ruth Bader Ginsberg.  

           Daisy sighs. 
           Liv’s car pulls into a parking spot in front of the Clark 
           County Government Office. 

           Liv scream/whoops. Daisy jumps as the sound floods her car 
           speakers. 

           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           Liv sits, sunglasses still on, across from a bare desk 
           holding nothing but a closed laptop and a short tidy stack of 
           files. 

           Lucas enters the room and shuts the door. He’s looking at a 
           file as he steps behind his desk to take a seat. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Olivia Olsen?

           Liv freezes in recognition. Of all the people...

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Hi. 

                                 LIV
                        You’re my court appointed mediator? 

                                 LUCAS
                        I am. Lucas Bones. And you are the 
                        Olivia Olsen who got Stoned.

                                 LIV
                        No, I didn’t. Not today. 

           Lucas holds up her file.

                                 LUCAS
                        Your sentence. From Judge Stone. 
                        She’s famous for doling out 
                        creative justice. We call it 
                        getting Stoned. Three years ago, 
                        she made a guy stand in front of 
                        Planet Hollywood with a sign that 
                        said ‘I never paid my child support 
                        but the quarter slots are my jam.’ 
                        She likes public shaming.

                                 LIV
                        Well, that’s ironic. Because I 
                        publicly shamed someone who super 
                        deserved it and she punished me for 
                        it. 

           Lucas holds up a sheet of paper - a printout of tweets.
                                 LUCAS
                        ‘You owe me seven hundred dollars 
                        for the laser hair growth cap. 
                        Especially since it didn’t work, 
                        baldie.’ And there’s a photo.

           infrared light (it’s a thing).

                        factual.

                                 LUCAS
                        ‘At @AustinSauce it's pronounced 
                        Oprah, not Ofrah. Hastag times up.’ 
                        And you @-ed Oprah.

                                 LUCAS
                        These are pretty funny. Super mean, 
                        but still.

           Detecting a vibe, Liv decides on a charm offensive. 

                                 LIV
                        Your name is Bones, huh.

                        Does anyone ever call you Bonesy? 
                        Or Bone Bone?

                                 LUCAS
                        Lucas is fine. 

                                 LIV

                        Vegas on lock. I grew up here, I 
                        know everyone and anything you want 
                        to do, I can hook you up. Maybe we 
                        help each other out. Do you like 
                        burlesque, Bone Bone? Or magic 
                        shows? Or burlesque with magic 
                        shows? 

           Lucas folds his hands and looks at Liv.

                        Okay.

           Lucas gets up, opens the door, then returns to his seat.

                        huge mistake.

                        this?

           sunset. SWIPE. Liv and Austin smiling in cocktail attire,

                        And I will not be told what I can 
                        and can’t say.  

           Liv stands, turns on her heel and storms out the door like a 
           force of nature. Lucas lets out a breath. He picks up the 
           paperwork, chuckling at Liv’s insulting tweets.

           EXT./INT. LIV’S CAR - DAY

           Liv gets in, slamming the door. She smacks the steering wheel 
           in frustration, then raises her arm to throw her phone across 
           the car...but doesn’t because that shit’s expensive. 

           INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Liv sits at a table with four other PEOPLE. All of them have 
           their arms crossed, except instructor ESTEBAN. 

                                 ESTEBAN
                        All of you are here because you 
                        wound up in court due to your 
                        issues with anger. By way of 
                        introduction, why don’t we go 
                        around the room and hear what 
                        happened.

           Esteban points at AUBREY (20s), a pale gamer who probably 
           bleeds Monster energy drink.

                                 AUBREY
                        ZombiMuskrat sent me a Kappa, which 
                        turned into a copypasta assault, so 
                        I paused my play and then he PJSalt-
                        ed me.  

                                 ESTEBAN
                        So what did you do?

                                 AUBREY
                        I crushed his X-box with his 
                        Fortnite Smasher figurine.  
           Esteban lets out a low whistle. Liv leans toward KELLY (30s), 
           a sullen woman sitting next to her. 

                                 LIV
                        Think a different kind of smashing 
                        would help this guy? 

           Aubrey whips his head toward her, face turning red. 

                                 AUBREY
                        What did you say to me?

           Aubrey, triggered, vibrates with rage.

                                 LIV
                        Dude, you’re turning purple. 

                                 ESTEBAN
                        Okay, Aubrey, now is a perfect time 
                        to practice deep breathing as a way 
                        to calm yourself. And we’re all 
                        going to do it with you. Breathe in 
                        one two, then out one two. 

           Aubrey huffs air in and out through gritted teeth. Everyone 
           joins in. Liv yawns. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           Biker dude DON (50s), cries as he talks, his voice deep. 

                                 DON
                          (tearful)
                        I’m not angry! I just have so many 
                        emotions!

           Don’s large fists slam on the table, making everyone jump.

                                                           CUT TO:

           Everyone lies on the floor. More deep breathing. Liv is 
           dozing, mouth open.

                                                           CUT TO:

           Kelly, face of stone, arms still crossed. 

                                 KELLY
                        I punched my husband a few times 
                        because he hit on my sister, and he 
                        went crying to the police like a 
                        little bitch. 
           Liv holds her hand up for a high five. Nothing.

                                                           CUT TO:

           Esteban passes out paper - checklists, emotional charts, 
           worksheets. No one in the room is enthusiastic. Except 
           Esteban.

                                                           CUT TO:

           Now it’s Liv’s turn. Her head is held high. 

                                 LIV
                        My ex cheated on me, and I told the 
                        internet, and he went to a lawyer, 
                        like a little bitch. 

           Liv holds up her hand for a high five from Kelly. Still 
           nothing. But she looks over and Aubrey’s holding his hand up 
           for a high five. 

                                 AUBREY
                          (smiling)
                        You’re a troll. Me too. 

                                 LIV
                        No. Not a troll. A warrior for 
                        justice.

           Aubrey’s still smiling. 

                                 AUBREY
                        Troll. 

                                 LIV
                        Aubrey. Don’t start some shit. 

                                 AUBREY
                        Why don’t you take some deep 
                        breaths?

                                 LIV
                        Why don’t you shuffle back to your 
                        virgin cave and do your Power 
                        Rangers cos play. 

                                 AUBREY
                        You don’t know me! Chode eating 
                        fuck puppet!

           Beat.
                                 LIV
                        I don’t know what that is.

                                                           CUT TO:

           Aubrey, Don and Kelly gather their papers and head to the 
           door.

                                 ESTEBAN
                        I’ll see you all next Saturday for 
                        the ‘Ear-responsible’ listening 
                        skills seminar.

           Esteban pulls on his ear to make sure they get it. No one 
           looks at him as they leave. Liv hangs back, puts on a 
           charming smile.

                                 ESTEBAN (CONT’D)
                        You know, people who talk a lot of 
                        shit are usually covering up some 
                        mighty insecurities. 

                                 LIV
                        Spare me. If I can get you two 
                        front row tickets to Gaga, can we 
                        say I’ve completed this thing.

                                 ESTEBAN
                        Make it four. 

                                 LIV
                        Deal.

           Liv smiles. 

           INT. DAISY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Liv and Daisy do their thing: wine on the couch.

                                 LIV
                        At least half the people in the 
                        room have been or will be 
                        incarcerated. It’s so insane that 
                        this is my life right now. So 
                        insane. 

                                 DAISY
                        But did you feel a little bit like 
                        a badass though? 

                                 LIV
                        Maybe a little. I bribed the 
                        instructor. 
                                 DAISY
                        You’re like a little menace to 
                        society. It’s so weird not to see 
                        what you’re doing online all day. 
                        It’s like you’re dead. 

           Liv makes a face. 

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        Have you started writing the nice 
                        things yet?

                        No.

                                 DAISY
                        Too soon?

                                 LIV
                        It’s not too soon - it’s too 
                        impossible.

                                 DAISY
                        Just throw some shit down. Make it 
                        up. 

                                 LIV
                        I literally can’t. I can’t make 
                        myself do it. 

           Liv throws herself back against the pillows.

                          (small voice)
                        Can you just do it for me?

                                 DAISY
                        Hell yeah. 

                                 LIV
                        Really?!

                                 DAISY
                        Totally! 

           Daisy gets her laptop off the table and opens it. Liv scoots 
           closer. Felix walks through the room, sees the big smiles. 

                                 FELIX
                        What’s going on?

                                 DAISY
                        I’m helping Liv with her stupid 
                        nice things for Austin. 
                                 FELIX
                        You can’t do that. 

                                 LIV
                        Yes she can.

                                 FELIX
                        No she can’t. 

                                 DAISY
                        Why?

                                 FELIX
                        I’m Liv’s lawyer.  

                                 LIV
                        So?

                                 FELIX
                        If you do something fraudulent - 
                        like have someone else fulfill the 
                        terms of your sentence - and I 
                        knowingly cover it up, I’ll be 
                        disbarred. Do you want that?

           Beat of silence. Felix makes a face.

                          LIV
                                                     DAISY
           No.
                                          No.

                                 FELIX
                        Great. Then stop. 

                                 DAISY
                        What if I just said things out loud 
                        and Liv happened to write them 
                        down.

           Felix shakes his head. 

                                 LIV
                        No?

           Felix mouths a “no.”

           INT. OLSEN HOME - DAY

           Liv sits next to Barry at the kitchen table. He’s looking at 
           the screen with bifocals, tapping at keys, one finger at a 
           time.

                        We can start with Facebook and

                        I’ll be in the john. 

           Liv posts a photo of a cactus instead of Barry’s face - his

           INT. THE PATIO DESSERTS AND DRINKS - DAY

           Lucas enters and sees Liv at a table. She’s styling two mug 
           of coffee and a slice of the shop’s infamous Over the Rainbow 
           crepe cake and taking photos. Lucas walks over and sits down.

                                 LUCAS
                        Hi.

                                 LIV
                        One sec. I know I can’t post these 
                        pics now but they’re good to have 
                        on file. 

           Liv smiles, her charm on full blast.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for meeting me. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Sure. Surprised, and glad actually, 
                        to hear from you. 

                                 LIV
                        I just wanted to say that you 
                        haven’t seen me at my best. 
                        Honestly, the injustice of writing 
                        these things - it gets to me. Which 
                        is why, I’d really like your help. 

                                 LUCAS
                        That’s what I’m here for.

           Liv pulls out her phone to type notes.

                                 LIV
                        Excellent. Since you know the judge 
                        so I was thinking you could give me 
                        a few examples of what she wants to 
                        hear me say?

                                 LUCAS
                        Oh. Um, I think it can be anything 
                        not insulting about what’s his 
                        name.

                                 LIV
                        Totally, totally. But like, what 
                        would you say if you were me? 

           Lucas thinks.
                                 LUCAS
                        What was it you said about the 
                        waist trainer?

           Liv smiles remembering. 

                                 LIV
                        That he wears it to bed every night 
                        because he wants to be able to wear 
                        women’s jeans like Jared Leto. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Is that true?

                                 LIV
                          (shrugging)
                        I don’t know what he did when I 
                        wasn’t home.

                                 LUCAS
                        You could say ‘Austin is committed 
                        to having great style.’

                                 LIV
                        That’s it?

                                 LUCAS
                        Yeah.

           Liv is about to type that into her phone. But - 

                                 LIV
                        The thing is he doesn’t actually 
                        have great style on his own. I 
                        picked out most of his clothes. So 
                        he really doesn’t deserve credit 
                        for that. What else would you say?

                                 LUCAS
                        Um. Was he a good 
                        conversationalist?

                                 LIV
                        Ugh, he’s actually so boring. Next?

                                 LUCAS
                        Could you compliment his hair?

           Liv shoots Lucas a look, but types it down. “Lux hair.”

                                 LIV
                        What else?
                                 LUCAS
                        I’m not going to do these for you, 
                        Liv. 

                                 LIV
                        I know, but I need more examples. 
                        It’s really helpful. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Why don’t you do one?

                        literally can. not.

                                 LUCAS
                        Does he have a nice smile?

                        He yelled at the neighbor’s kids 
                        for disturbing his meditation time. 

                                 LUCAS

                        Did he ever recommend a good book?

                                 LUCAS
                        There’s got to be something. 

                                 LIV
                        There’s not. That’s my point.

                                 LUCAS
                        Then why were you dating him?

           Liv’s phone buzzes - text from Daisy. <broken heart emoji>. 

           INT. CAESER’S PALACE CASINO - EVENING

           Liv wanders the floor near the restaurant. The ching-ching-
           ing of machines is a constant. She spots Daisy, slumped in 
           front of a nickel slot machine.

           yard long strawberry daiquiri. She’s already three yards in.

                        hard earned money to fly to Boca to 
                        visit his mother this summer - I 
                        want to go to Lake Como like we

                        Okay. Sure. We can do that. 

           INT. CASINO BOUTIQUE - EVENING

           Sia’s “Cheap Thrills” begins as Liv leads Daisy into the 
           store.

           - Liv and Daisy come out of dressing rooms in new dresses. 

           - Liv gives Daisy “sex hair.”

           - Liv and Daisy put on “sex lipstick.”
           - They put on high heels, though Liv shows Daisy two pairs of 
           “LivItUp” flip flops in her bag. 

           - As Liv and Daisy leave the store, they tuck in the price 
           tags on their dresses. Liv gives a wink and a nod to the 
           SALES GIRL, who nods back.

           INT. CAESER’S PALACE CASINO - EVENING

           - Liv and Daisy slo-mo stride across the casino floor. Daisy 
           wobbles. They grab hands. 

           - Liv leads Daisy down a dark hallway, and through a door, 
           which takes them to a tiny room with a bar, a BARTENDER and 
           four seats. As Liv and Daisy sit, the bartender presents them 
           each with a plate of fave drunk foods, but the tiniest 
           portions: a tiny burger, a tiny onion ring, a tiny hot dog, 
           tiny slice of pizza, and a tiny haystack of fries. 

                                 DAISY

                        Marriage is so much work and

           Daisy hands Liv her phone. As they pose for a pic, Liv 
           notices a COUPLE kissing. IDEA. She walks up to them.

                        Because he’s funny and strong.

           Liv and the woman share a look. The woman shrugs again. Liv 
           makes a note in Daisy’s phone. “Funny and strong.”

           Liv approaches a BARTENDER.

                        Liv, you’re sitting too close to

                        Barry, move her chair back a bit.

           Barry moves behind Liv and tugs at her chair, scooching it 
           back a little at a time.

           INT. COSTCO - DAY

           Liv straggles behind her parents who push a grocery cart 
           filled with toilet paper.

                        We’re getting in our steps.

                        That too. 

           Barry and Kay smile as they turn down an gigantically long 
           aisle where at least ten food sample tables are set up. 

           MONTAGE. 

           - Kay and Barry sample a tiny paper thimble of soup.

                        sodium.

           - Kay and Barry are greeted with warm hugs by a SAMPLE MAN. 
           He pulls out a full size hot dog, rips it in half and gives 
           them each a piece. He offers one to Liv but she declines.

           - Kay and Barry pass up the pickle samples, but Liv takes a 
           spear. 

           - Kay, Barry and a reluctant Liv all toast their tiny paper 
           cups of mango juice. 

           - Walking with Barry, who’s eating a cookie, Liv spots a MAN 
           and PREGNANT WOMAN holding hands as they look over a display 
           of outdoor grills.

           Ahead of them, Kay digs through a display of detergent, 
           lifting each one to find the “most full.”

                                 BARRY
                        With her by my side? No way. 

           As Liv follows her parents to the exit, Liv passes a WOMAN 
           sitting alone at a bistro table with small square of pizza. 
           Sensing a kindred soul, Liv makes eye contact and holds up 
           her cookie as a “cheers” to lone wolf living. Just then 
           another WOMAN sits at the bistro table with two little ice 
           cream cones. They kiss. Liv sighs and walks away. 

           INT. OLSEN HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

           Liv logs in to “Barry’s” social media. Nothing new on 
           Austin’s Facebook page. Liv clicks her way to Shinee’s 
           profile. 

           Insert: A photo of a manicured hand wearing a diamond ring. 
           The caption reads “I said yes!”

           Liv’s mouth open in shock. 
           INT. MERCEDES PASSENGER VAN - AFTERNOON

           As the vehicle inches through grand strand traffic, Liv faces 
           the group of the night: a white haired BRIDE (80s) and her 
           BRIDESMAIDS (60s-dead). The early bird special daytime crew.

                        Where did Gabriel find this group?

           Paula shoots Liv a look as Liv looks out the window. 

           INT. DRINK AND DRAG BOWLING ALLEY - AFTERNOON

           Liv and Paula sit at the bar while the elder-bach party 
           shrieks in delight watching a DRAG QUEEN cabaret.

                                 LIV
                        Paula, what do you want your life

                        know. I know I want a lot and I 
                        want it to be cool, but what the 
                        fuck is happening? Why is the 
                        universe working against me?

                                 PAULA
                        Sometimes we just have to be 
                        patient until our soulmates find 
                        us. That’s how I feel about my

                        Meow. Kittens are hard to come by,

                        connections. 
           Liv picks up her phone to text him but sees an email from 
           Lucas. 

           Insert: “The compliments you sent don’t meet the judge’s 
           criteria. Let’s discuss Monday.” 

           Liv stands, furious.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Liv drives as Waze navigates a residential neighborhood. Liv 
           looks, searching, then pulls to the curb parking in front of 
           small, modern home. 

           EXT. LUCAS’ HOUSE - DAY

           As Liv stalks toward the front door, it opens and Lucas steps 
           out followed by an adorable, gorgeous goldendoodle. 

                                 LIV
                        Lucas Bones.

                        got your email, rejecting all my 
                        hard work, I felt we needed to meet 
                        and discuss. 

                                 LUCAS
                        I agree. But at the office, Monday. 
                        Not my home right now. Which by the 
                        way, how do you know where I live?

                                 LIV
                        Oh please. You’re not Osama. It 
                        wasn’t that difficult to find you.

           The dog walks over to Liv, sitting down beside her. 
           Involuntarily, Liv begins petting him. 

                                 LUCAS
                        You know, it’s pretty inappropriate 
                        for you to show up like this. 

           Liv bends down, using both hands to scratch the dog’s head. 
           He pants, smiling.
                                 LIV
                        I think the way you’re lording this 
                        whole process over me is pretty 
                        inappropriate as well. 

           The dog licks Liv’s hands.  

                                 LIV (CONT’D)

                        Aw, he’s giving me kisses. 

           Liv’s words trail off as she leans over the dog, who licks 
           her face. 

                                 LUCAS
                        That’s Shiloh.

                                 LIV
                        I love him.

                                 LUCAS
                        He’s pretty magical. We were just 
                        on our way to the barn. 

           Lucas opens the car door for Shiloh, who trots over and jumps 
           in. 

                                 LIV
                        Hey.  We need to talk about this. 

           Lucas opens the driver’s side door.

                                 LUCAS
                        Fine. If you can’t wait until 
                        Monday then come on. 

           A beat. Liv walks towards his car. 

           INT. LUCAS’ CAR - DAY

           Lucas drives, Liv is shotgun and from the backseat Shiloh is 
           panting happily over her shoulder. 

                                 LUCAS
                        So the list you sent. 

                                 LIV
                        What about it?
                                 LUCAS
                        Read them to me.

           Liv picks up her phone, taps, reads off the screen. 

                                 LIV
                        ‘Superman would be jealous of your 
                        gorgeous biceps, triceps and 
                        quads.’ 

           Liv is reading the compliments Gabriel wrote for the first 
           time but plays it off. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        ‘You’re so wise, you could have 
                        your own page of Pinterest 
                        quotes.’’Your ankles are perfectly 
                        proportioned to your knees.’ 
                          (covering)
                        His lower skeletal structure 
                        is...really nice. You want me to 
                        say that instead?  

                                 LUCAS
                        You didn’t write those.  

                                 LIV
                        ...Yes, I did. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Keep going.

                                 LIV
                        ‘You have delicious ear lobes.’ 
                        ‘You really know how to touch a 
                        woman in her bathing suit area.’ 
                        Okay, fine. I didn’t write them. 
                        But I told you - I can’t. Oh wait, 
                        I have one. ‘Thanks for ensuring I 
                        got an STD test since you couldn’t 
                        keep it in your pants!’ There. 
                        That’s literally the best I can do. 
                        I wish you could understand my 
                        side. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Oh, I understand. I understand that 
                        you can spend years with a person, 
                        then, when they leave, you find 
                        yourself unable to locate any good 
                        memories of your time together? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LUCAS (CONT'D)
                        Days pass in a fog of misery and 
                        resentment and you’re left with 
                        nothing but a little rage monster 
                        that wants to burst out and wreak 
                        havoc for the precious time wasted 
                        in a relationship that turned out - 
                        surprise! - to be doomed. Trust me, 
                        I understand.

                                 LIV
                        Now imagine having to say nice 
                        things about her.  

                                 LUCAS
                        I don’t have to. She doesn’t live 
                        here. So I just pretend she’s dead.

           Liv laughs, shocked.

                                 LIV
                        Wow. Bitter, party of one. Glad I’m 
                        not the only one who has issues 
                        with their ex.

                                 LUCAS
                        Love is a battlefield. 

           Liv pets Shiloh over her shoulder, looking out the window.

                                 LIV
                        He’s getting married. Literally two 
                        weeks ago, we were living together. 
                        And now, he’s engaged. What does it 
                        say about me that I could be with 
                        someone so crappy?

           Soul searching is a new look for Liv.

                                 LUCAS
                        It says that relationships are 
                        stupid and you should just get a 
                        dog instead.    

           Lucas smiles and Liv smiles back. 

           EXT. JOHNSON’S J BAR B STABLES - DAY

           Lucas leads Liv and Shiloh through the gate of the historic 
           equestrian complex that’s more than fifty years old and 
           closed to the public. Tall, unique metal signage reads 
           “Johnson’s J Bar B.”
           INT. BARN - JOHNSON’S J BAR B STABLES - DAY

           Lucas greets JOHNSON (60s) with a handshake. 

                                 LUCAS
                        J, this is Liv.

                                 JOHNSON
                          (to Liv)
                        Howdy do.

                                 LIV
                        Oh, uh, howdy.

           Liv shakes Johnson’s hand as well. He steps back and 
           appraises her. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Easy cowboy. Eyes up here.

           Johnson smiles and nods at Lucas. He pulls a pair of cowboy 
           boots off a shelf and hands them to her.

                                 JOHNSON
                        I’ve got a good eye.

           EXT. CORRAL - JOHNSON’S J BAR B STABLES - DAY

           Liv, now in cowboy boots and hat, stands in a dusty ring. 
           Lucas leans against the fence. 

                                 LIV
                        I just want to make sure you have 
                        made note of how agreeable I’m 
                        being right now. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Noted.

           Johnson leads a horse, wearing a western saddle. She has pep 
           in her step and holds her head high. 

                                 JOHNSON
                        This is Mimi. She’s steady but real 
                        sensitive. If you’ve got a hitch in 
                        your giddy up, she’s gonna catch 
                        it.

           Johnson loops Mimi’s reins around the fence post and moves to 
           give Liv a boost onto her back. Before she knows it, Liv is 
           in the saddle. Lucas swings up on his horse and trots over to 
           Liv and Mimi. 
                                 LUCAS
                        Horses are intuitive. If you’re 
                        tense, she’ll be tense. If you’re 
                        nervous, she won’t trust you.

                                 LIV
                        So it’s mutual. 

                                 LUCAS
                        You have to slow down, relax, 
                        breathe - be chill. 

           Liv nods but Mimi jolts her head. Liv yells in surprise and 
           off Mimi goes, tearing across the corral as Liv holds on for 
           dear life. Lucas kicks his horse and goes after her, grabbing 
           the reins and slowing Mimi down.  

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?

                                 LIV
                        This horse is a lunatic!

           Mimi snorts. Lucas nudges his horse to walk, continuing to 
           hold Mimi’s reins. Now that Lucas is in charge, Mimi relaxes. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        What the hell am I doing here? 

                                 LUCAS
                        Are you kidding? You’re at a secret 
                        barn in the middle of Las Vegas 
                        that you didn’t even know existed. 
                        You’re welcome. 

                                 LIV
                        I see. You want cool points. 

                                 LUCAS
                        You said you knew everything about 
                        Vegas. But you didn’t know about 
                        this.  

                                 LIV
                        You know what would really make you 
                        cool? If you can tell me how to get 
                        out of having to say nice things to 
                        my low down dirty ex.

           Lucas hands Liv the reins. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Don’t look now but you’re calmly 
                        riding a horse. 
           Liv realizes she’s comfortably keeping pace with Lucas’ 
           horse. Easy peasy. Shiloh trots ahead of them.

                                 LIV
                          (re: Shiloh)
                        Maybe I should get a dog. 

                                 LUCAS
                        My ex-wife didn’t want pets. As 
                        soon as she left, I got Shiloh, 
                        started riding. I find that I like 
                        animals a lot more than people.    

                                 LIV
                        Why did you get married?

                                 LUCAS
                        We thought it was love. And it 
                        wasn’t a bad relationship the first 
                        few years. It just wasn’t meant to 
                        be a ‘til death do you part 
                        situation. We forced it. 

                                 LIV
                        I’m part of the matrimony 
                        industrial complex so whenever I 
                        hear about a divorce, I think yay. 
                        That’s two more potential weddings. 
                        Good for business.

           Beat.

                                 LUCAS
                        I’m trying to think of a more tone 
                        deaf comment that a person could 
                        make. And I think - yeah, you win. 

                                 LIV
                        Oh I can do worse.

                                 LUCAS
                        I believe it.

           Liv looks around, taking in this little bit of secret Vegas.

                                 LIV
                        This isn’t bad, Bones.

                                 LUCAS
                        Like I said, you’re welcome. 

           Liv smiles.
           EXT. BARN - JOHNSON’S J BAR B STABLES - LATER

           Liv sits on a hay bale playing with kittens from a box at her 
           feet. Mother cat is stretched out sleeping nearby. Luke walks 
           over. Liv looks up at him. 

                                 LIV
                          (whisper)
                        Kittens!

           Lucas sits down and picks one up, dragging a piece of straw 
           across his chest for the kitten to chase. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        I live here now. This is my new 
                        home. In this box full of cuteness.

                                 LUCAS
                        Why don’t you take one?

                                 LIV
                        I can barely take care of my own 
                        self. Not in the market for a 
                        dependent.

                                 LUCAS
                        I don’t think you ever regret 
                        getting a pet. You get the best of 
                        both worlds - being alone with but 
                        with a friend who doesn’t talk. 

                                 LIV
                        Sounds a little sad. 

                                 LUCAS
                        It makes things easier.

           Liv watches Lucas snuggle the kitten. It’s hard not to get a 
           little weak in the knees.

           EXT. LUCAS’ HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

           Lucas, Liv and Shiloh get out of the car. Liv lingers before 
           walking to her car. 

                                 LIV
                        Thanks for the...that. I’m dirty 
                        and sore - what else can a girl ask 
                        for?

           Ugh. Awkward.
                                 LUCAS
                        Anytime.

           Liv and Lucas smile at each other, and Liv turns. Then turns 
           back. 

                                 LIV
                        I have a secret spot too. 

           Liv waits. 

                                 LUCAS
                        You want to go now?

                        Why not? Live a little. 

            Lucas smiles. Points at herself.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        See what I did there. ‘Liv’ a 
                        little. 

                                 LUCAS
                        I got it.

           INT. CRYSTALS CITY CENTER - EVENING

           Liv and Lucas walk through the nearly empty mall. 

                                 LUCAS
                        I’ve managed to avoid every mall on 
                        the strip. Until now. 

                                 LIV
                        Don’t be too proud of yourself. You 
                        don’t know what you’ve been 
                        missing.

           Liv turns into the Louis Vuitton store. 

           INT. LOUIS VUITTON - EVENING

           Liv waves as she approaches shopguy HARRIS. 

                                 LIV
                        Hey Harris, can we go up?

                                 HARRIS
                        Sure, Liv. Place is empty. 
           Liv smiles at a confused Lucas as Harris leads them through a 
           doorway.

           INT. AKHOB - EVENING

           Darkness. The DING of an elevator. Liv leads Lucas through a 
           doorway into a stark white space, with a wide staircase 
           leading into a series of rooms that are bathed with ever-
           changing displays of light. This is Akhob, James Turrell’s 
           color immersion exhibit that’s located in a secret room on 
           the fourth floor above the LV store. 

           Liv leads Lucas through the two rooms as they watch their 
           shadows change, and the walls shift colors. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Beautiful.

                        It’s not really a secret but I 
                        think it’s special. I brought my 
                        parents once but they were more 
                        freaked out than impressed. They’re 
                        not art-installation-over-the-Louis-
                        Vuitton-store-types. They’re more 
                        the let’s-hit-the-Eddie-Bauer-
                        outlet-and-eat-Lean-Cuisine types. 

                                 LUCAS
                        They’re still together?

                        You’re lucky. My parents fought 
                        constantly. Broke up, got back 
                        together, broke up again. It was 
                        chaos.

                        They’re sweet but boring. They 
                        really leaned into the whole 
                        growing old together thing. 

           DING. A flood of footsteps as a wave of Japanese GIRLS enter 
           from the elevator, posing and taking photos. Liv and Lucas 
           are surrounded.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got one more spot. It’s not 
                        really a secret but I’m pretty sure 
                        you’ve never been. 
                                 LUCAS
                        I’ve seen Blue Man Group.

                         Nope. Come on.

           EXT. LUCAS’ CAR - NIGHT

           Lucas and Liv get out of the car, which is parked in lot in 
           front of nondescript industrial building. A sign reads “BREAK 
           SH*T”

           INT. BREAK SH*T - NIGHT

           Liv gives a head nod to the GUY at the front counter who 
           hands over safety goggles and two yellow Styrofoam bats.

                                 LUCAS
                        I was hoping for goat yoga. 

                                 LIV
                          (to guy behind the counter)
                        Since you been gone.

           He gives her a thumbs up.

           INT. BREAK SH*T BREAK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Liv and Lucas stand in a generic room filled with old, cheap 
           furniture and lamps. 

                                 LIV
                        Ever been to a break room before?

           Luke shakes her head. The sounds of punching and shouting are 
           audible from other rooms. Kelly Clarkson’s “Since You Been 
           Gone” starts playing - loudly - from the speakers on the 
           wall. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                          (shouting)
                        It’s pretty self explanatory. And 
                        cathartic. 

           Liv uses her bat to knock a fake plant of a stand. The vase 
           shatters into a million impossible pieces (candy glass). 

           Then, Liv unleashes like a valkyrie going to war. A lamp goes 
           flying, everything is swept off a side table, she beats the 
           life out of a frame on the wall. Kelly Clarkson wails about 
           breathing for the first time. Lucas takes it all in. 
           Liv throws the bat aside and uses her hand to pull down a 
           bookcase. Books (paper maché) go flying. She pulls out a 
           shelf and beats the books with it, then throws it to the 
           side. Liv looks up at Lucas. Signals him to go. 

           Lucas kicks over a chair. Liv smiles, points at the bat. 
           Lucas uses it to smash a lamp. He picks up a figurine and 
           throws it against the wall. He smiles. Liv smiles back. 

           Liv and Lucas pick up the coffee table and throws it against 
           the wall. Liv rips apart a pillow. Lucas tosses figurine 
           after figurine in the air then hits them with a bat. Liv hits 
           Lucas across the back. He hits her back and they trade blows, 
           laughing. Lucas grabs Liv’s bat and they stop, breathing 
           hard, faces kinda close together. It’s a charged moment. 
           Kelly Clarkson stops singing, and they come back to Earth. 

           EXT. BREAK SH*T / LUCAS’ CAR - NIGHT

           Liv and Lucas walk to his car. A little awkward. How does 
           this night end? Then Liv’s phone DINGS. She looks at the 
           screen.

                                 LIV
                        Oh my god. Paula says Gabriel 
                        changed the passwords for all the 
                        LivItUp accounts. My website is 
                        down, my Instagram is gone. 

           Liv stops and turns to Lucas. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        I can’t not be on the internet! 
                        That’s my whole business. I have to 
                        fix this. 

                                 LUCAS
                        I can’t be privvy to this. You’re 
                        not supposed to be on social media.

           Liv is shook. This is serious. 

                                 LIV
                        You wanted to help me. 

           Liv can tell Lucas doesn’t quite take this as seriously as 
           she’d like. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Lucas.

                                 LUCAS
                        Okay. I’ll email the judge. 
                                 LIV
                        Thank you. I gotta call Paula.  

           Liv gets in the car, phone to her ear. Lucas sighs, then gets 
           behind the wheel.

           INT. HALLWAY - COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Liv walks toward the courtroom door, where Lucas is waiting. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Where’s your lawyer? 

                                 LIV

           They go inside. 

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Liv and Lucas sit in the galley, as Judge Stone completes a 
           sentencing. Judge Stone looks down at her docket. 

                                 JUDGE STONE
                        Olivia Olsen. 

           Liv stands and walks through the gate. 

                                 LIV
                        Here, your honor. 

                                 JUDGE STONE
                        You’ve got two minutes. 

                                 LIV
                        Your honor, my business has been 
                        greatly affected by my inability to 
                        interact on social media. And the 
                        person I outsourced my accounts to 
                        has stabbed me in the back like the 
                        ungrateful scammer that he is. My 
                        livelihood depends on being online. 
                        I’m hoping you would reconsider 
                        this portion of the sentence. 

                                 JUDGE STONE
                        So you’re here today because you 
                        can’t go another - 
                          (she consults the file)
                        - eight days without Facebook. 
                                 LIV
                        It’s more nuanced than that, your 
                        honor - 

                                 JUDGE STONE
                        Have you completed the other 
                        portions of your sentence? 

                                 LIV
                        I’m working on that. 

           Judge Stone looks out into the room and sees Lucas, beckoning 
           him to come forward. 

                                 JUDGE STONE
                          (to Lucas)
                        Is that true?

                                 LUCAS
                        Yes, your honor. I can attest that 
                        Liv - Ms. Olsen - is making 
                        progress toward completing the 
                        terms of her sentence. 

                                 JUDGE STONE
                        Has Ms. Olsen submitted the 
                        required written comments to you or 
                        a portion thereof? 

           Liv and Lucas share a look. Her eyes are pleading. 

           But he can’t lie.

                                 LUCAS
                        Not yet, your honor, but - 

                                 JUDGE STONE
                        Then Ms. Olsen, I’m afraid I can’t 
                        alter your sentence. You have a 
                        little over a week to wrap things 
                        up. If your sentence requirements 
                        are incomplete by the deadline, 
                        I’ll see you back in this 
                        courtroom. Neither of us want that. 
                        Is that clear?

                                 LIV
                        Yes, your honor. 

           Liv ignores Lucas, avoiding eye contact as she walks out. 
           INT. HALLWAY - COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Liv comes out of the courtroom in a huff. Lucas is a few 
           steps behind. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Liv! Wait!

           Liv doesn’t. 

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        What did you expect me to do?

           Liv stops and turns to face him. 

                                 LIV
                        I certainly didn’t expect you to 
                        lie. 

                                 LUCAS
                        I didn’t lie. 

                                 LIV
                        You said I didn’t submit anything 
                        when you know I did. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Liv. You didn’t write those things. 
                        And I know you’re not going to 
                        anger management, no matter what 
                        Esteban says. 

                                 LIV
                        So what? Why do you even care? 

                                 LUCAS
                        Because I have integrity. My job 
                        requires having integrity. 

                                 LIV
                        You don’t think I have integrity? 

                                 LUCAS
                        I didn’t say that. But -

                                 LIV
                        But?

                                 LUCAS
                        You haven’t once acknowledged that 
                        you’re in this position as a 
                        consequence of your own actions. 
                        You slandered someone, Liv. You 
                        have to deal with it! 
                                 LIV
                        You’re so judgemental! Just because 
                        you’re divorced and have a dog 
                        doesn’t make you a guru on life. 
                        You’re messed up just like everyone 
                        else. You know what your thing is? 
                        You hide. With your animals and 
                        never going out and no social 
                        media. You’re not better than me - 
                        you’re just trying to pretend life 
                        isn’t messy. At least I’m not

                        Your life is messy because you made 
                        it that way. You spend so much time 
                        and energy being loud and outraged 
                        but you’re not fooling anyone.

                        It means all this is one big act to 
                        cover up that not that deep down 
                        you know you were wrong. But you 
                        don’t respect the truth, or other

                        something better. 

           Liv is hurt. And furious.

           Liv and Lucas stare, blood drawn on both sides. Liv turns and 
           walks out. 

           MONTAGE. 
           - Liv leads a bach party to the door of Jewel night club. 
           Without Gabriel, Liv has to wait for CLIPBOARD DIVA to find 
           their name, and radio inside. 

           - Inside the club, Liv is forlorn - no drinking, no dancing.

           - Liv uses Barry’s account to look at Gabriel’s Instagram - 
           feather boas, body shots, stripper poles. 

           - Liv watches NCIS with her parents.

           - Another bach party. Liv doesn’t have any “woo’s” left in 
           her.

           - Liv peruses Gabriel’s “Savage Nights” website. 

           - Liv sends an incoming call from Lucas to voicemail.

           - Liv drinks alone at the Golden Tiki. 

           - Liv, in bed, with her laptop. A blank Word doc open on the 
           screen. Liv stares at it. And stares. 

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. OLSEN HOME - BEDROOM - DAY

           It’s afternoon. Liv’s still in bed, watching Will & Grace on 
           her laptop. A knock at the door and Kay pokes her head in.

                                 KAY
                        We’re heading out.

           Kay’s smiles. 

                                 KAY
                        We’ll see you tonight.

                                 KAY
                        Right, right. Of course you are. 
                        Well, maybe we’ll see you later.

                                 LIV
                        Ok. 

           Liv completely misses Kay’s excited smile as she shuts the 
           door.
           EXT. ETHEL M’S CHOCOLATE FACTORY SECRET CACTUS GARDEN - NIGHT

           A million colorful lights are strung throughout the large, 
           private cactus garden at Ethel M.’s chocolate factory 
           headquarters. A hipster bach party formes a hyman pyramid, 
           dangerousl close to a lot of cacti, the BRIDE in a white 
           romper, each bachelorette in a different pastel.Everyone’s 
           wearing sunglasses (it’s 9pm). Liv takes a photo.

                                 LIV
                        Ok! Karaoke at the Gold Spike and 
                        champagne on the way. 

           As they dismantle and make their way to the bus, Paula rushes 
           over to Liv, carrying an iPad. 

                                 PAULA
                        He’s here, he’s here.

                        Who?

           Liv looks up to see another BACHELORETTE PARTY in short, 
           tight skirts and high, high heels walk in, followed by 
           Gabriel. They share a mutual icy glare.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Voldemort.

           A woman in a “Bride” sash, tiara, candy penis necklace, white 
           feather boa. It’s fucking Shinee.

                        pics then we’ve got pre-show botox 
                        before Lionel Ritchie.

           Shinee gathers with her bridesmaids, posing for a photo.

                        Remember me?

           Shinee squints, thinks. 

                                 SHINEE
                        Are you a waitress at Outback?

                                 LIV

                        underneath my boyfriend.

                                 SHINEE

                        kind of woman who ruins other 
                        women’s lives. 

           The women eye each other. Shinee’s bridesmaids gather to back 
           their girl. 

           A tense beat. And then Shinee shrugs. Fucking SHRUGS. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        That’s it? Fucking shrug your

                        It’s not personal. I love him. 

           Liv sees a small tattoo on Shinee’s wrist - courier font 
           letters spell “TAN.”

                                 LIV

                                 SHINEE
                        It’s Austin’s initials. Thomas 
                        Austin Neff.

                                 SHINEE
                        No, Thomas is his first name. After 
                        his great-grandfather, the one who 
                        started that railroad. 

           Liv did not know this fact. But still -

                        He’s a cheater. Why don’t you think

                                 SHINEE
                        Because he loves me. We make each 
                        other happy.

                        We were happy. 

                                 SHINEE
                        No.

                                 LIV
                        No?

                                 SHINEE
                        He said you fought all the time. 

                                 GABRIEL
                        Ouch. That’s gonna leave a mark.

           Shinee is the only one without a trace of malice. 

                                 SHINEE
                          (to Liv)
                        But it’s okay. He wasn’t meant to 
                        be with you. You know that. He knew 
                        that. He was just too afraid to 
                        tell you because you’re batshit 
                        crazy, so having you catch us like 
                        that was the only way to get him 
                        out. It’s annoying that he’s such a 
                        pussy, but we’re working on that. 
                        We have our whole lives together to 
                        make each other better. But I am 
                        sorry.  

           Before Liv can react, Paula pushes Liv down the path, the 
           hipster bach party trailing behind. As they board the bus, 
           Liv watches Shinee and her girls pose for photos, happy, 
           untroubled. Gabriel art directs. It’s too much. 

                                 LIV
                        Paula, change of plans. Planet 
                        Hollywood. Now.
           INT. PLANET HOLLYWOOD CASINO - NIGHT

           Walking quickly, Liv leads the hipster bach party through the 
           casino floor. They approach a closed set of doors where an 
           USHER on a headset is waiting. When she sees Liv, the usher 
           opens the door. 

           INT. THEATER - PLANET HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           Empty stage, lively crowd. The usher leads them to a row of 
           seats just as the lights go down. The opening bongo beats and 
           maraca shakes of the beloved classic “All Night Long.” 

           The crowd goes WILD as - that’s right - LIONEL RITCHIE takes 
           the stage. The hipsters cheer. But Liv’s not paying 
           attention. She’s searching the crowd. 

           Liv spots Gabriel a few rows down and makes her way to him, 
           scooting past people, climbing over seats. Gabriel sees her 
           when she’s just a few feet away. A double take and then he 
           works his away toward the aisle. Liv follows. 

           Gabriel and Liv dodge DANCERS in the aisle who are “jamming 
           in the street, all night long.” But as they get closer to the 
           stage, they’re swept up in a group that’s taken onstage. Now 
           in front of a singing crowd with Lionel a few feet away, 
           Gabriel and Liv are pushed together. 

                                 LIV
                          (under her breath, but over 
                           the music)
                        I could sue you. 

                                 GABRIEL
                        With your track record? Girl, bye.

           As the song ends, the crowd cheers. Liv and Gabriel are 
           shuffled to the side of the stage. Liv grabs Gabriel’s arm 
           and pulls him backstage. 

                                 LIV
                        Backstabber!

                        No, self-serving entrepreneur. And 
                        I learned from the best, honey.

                                 LIV

                        make sure everyone on the planet 
                        knows it.
                                 GABRIEL
                        Come at me, bitch. What’re you 
                        going to do?

           With an eyeroll, Gabriel walks away. Liv thinks. It’s a good 
           question - what is she going to do? 

           INT. KITCHEN - OLSEN HOME - NIGHT

           Liv rushes in. The house is dark. She sees anniversary cards 
           on the counter, gifts her parents gave each other. 

           Liv freezes, realizing she’s the worst daughter ever.

                                 KAY (O.S.)
                        We had a nice night. 

           Liv looks up. Kay’s in the doorway, in her robe. 

                                 LIV
                        Mom, I’m so sorry.

                        It’s not like we needed a party. We 
                        were happy to celebrate by 
                        ourselves. But it would have been 
                        nice. And you said you’d help.

                                 LIV
                        I know. I’ve just been so busy and 
                        ...it’s been a hard time.

                                 KAY

                        Austin’s betrayal really kind of 
                        wrecked my life -

                                 KAY
                        Liv, honey. When you choose to 
                        focus on the past, it means you’re 
                        going to miss out on the present. 
                        And when you focus on the people 
                        who aren’t in your life anymore, 
                        you’re missing out on the ones that 
                        are. 

           With that, Kay turns and walks away. Liv lays her head down 
           on the counter. Angry at everything. Especially herself. 
           INT. OLSEN HOME - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Liv lies in bed awake. It’s possible she hasn’t slept all 
           night. 

           EXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

           Liv stares at the building, then sighs. 

           INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Liv returns to the same room, with Esteban and the surly 
           anger management group. As Liv goes to shut the door - 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Excuse me.

           Liv turns. Coming in right behind her is Judge Stone. They 
           share a look then both take a seat. 

           Liv opens her mouth to speak and Judge Stone immediately 
           holds up a hand to stop her. They sit.

           Everybody takes turns sharing - - 

                                 AUBREY
                        I started VR boxing. The graphics 
                        are garbage but it makes me feel 
                        better. 

                                                           CUT TO:

                                 KELLY
                        My sister and I are going to 
                        counseling. Sometimes I hate her so 
                        much but I love her to death, you 
                        know?

                                                           CUT TO:

                                 LIV
                        I don’t feel like the person I am 
                        and the person people see me as are 
                        the same thing. I keep hurting 
                        people without meaning to. And I’m 
                        tired of fighting all the time. 

                                                           CUT TO:
                                 JUDGE STONE
                        My husband and I fought over 
                        everything. When you’re going 
                        through it, the righteous 
                        indignation gives you fire. Keeps 
                        you going. But eventually, it burns 
                        you out. My marriage lasted six 
                        years, but I kept fighting. Until 
                        one day I realized the war had 
                        ended a long time ago and I was out 
                        fighting on that battlefield alone. 
                        He remarried. Had a kid. Moved 
                        away. Literally, built a whole new 
                        life. And here I was banging the 
                        same drum, telling my sad story, 
                        living in the past. 

                                 LIV
                          (kindly)
                        I hate him. 

                                 JUDGE STONE
                        It took me way, way too long to 
                        realize I needed to let it go. 

           This resonates with Liv.

                                                           CUT TO:

           The group files out. Aubrey hugs Esteban. Liv stops Judge 
           Stone. 

                                 LIV
                        I can’t bring myself to say 
                        something nice about Austin. 

                                 JUDGE STONE
                        Remember what I told you in court. 
                        I said you had say positive things 
                        about your time in that 
                        relationship - not with the idiot 
                        boyfriend. 

           Liv realizes - she’s right. 

                                 JUDGE STONE (CONT’D)
                        I want you to find closure. Find 
                        the lesson in the mess. Get your 
                        side of the street clean. Move on 
                        with your life and don’t worry 
                        about anyone else’s.

           Liv touches her heart and leans toward Judge Stone for a hug, 
           but Judge Stone blocks the gesture. 
           EXT./INT. PEPPERMILL RESTAURANT - DAY

           Liv enters the colorful Vegas institution, which is dim 
           compared to the bright desert sun, but multi-colored and neon 
           lit within an inch of its life. She sees Austin sitting in a 
           bright purple booth and steels herself, walking over to join 
           him. 

           Liv and Austin look at each other across the table. 

                                 LIV
                        I’m surprised you came.  

                                 AUSTIN
                        I’m recording this. 

           Austin holds his phone on the table. 

                                 LIV
                        You did me dirty. And I’ve spent a 
                        lot of time hating on you. Not sure 
                        that will every change.

           Austin moves to leave the booth. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        But. 

           Liv takes a deep breath. This is hard. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        I have learned pretending to be 
                        happy and being happy aren’t the 
                        same thing. And I said something 
                        things about you that weren’t true, 
                        and I wish I hadn’t.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Is that...are you apologizing?

                                 LIV
                        Maybe you have something to say to 
                        me too. About lies, lying, being a 
                        liar? 

                                 AUSTIN
                        You told my family I liked mommy 
                        porn. I watched it one time and it 
                        made me super uncomfortable, and 
                        you know it.
                                 LIV
                        You have to admit what you did was 
                        super duper fucked up. It was 
                        humiliating and chickenshit - 

                                 AUSTIN
                        I know, okay? I know. 

           Austin can’t meet her eyes.

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        But were you happy?

           Liv is quiet. 

                                 AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        Exactly. If you need to hear me say 
                        it, I’ll say it - I’m sorry it went 
                        down that way. Okay? But just admit 
                        it - we were meant to be exes.

                                 LIV
                        Fine. And...I’m sorry too.

           Beat. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        I really hate you though. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        I really hate you too. 

                                 LIV
                        I’m glad it’s over. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Same. 

           Liv and Austin smile at each other. Their version of peace. 

           MONTAGE

           To Ariana Grande’s “Thank u, next...” (you knew this one was 
           coming.)

           - Liv at her parents’ kitchen table, working her laptop and 
           phone. 

           - Liv shakes hands with a GUY in a control room, packed 
           tightly with equipment. 

           - Liv and Paula at the bar in Mr. Chow. Liv shows Paula her 
           laptop screen: LivItUp’s website - Paula’s headshot next to 
           Liv’s under the heading “Partners.”
           - Liv beats the life out of a pillow with a foam bat at anger 
           management. Aubrey, Kelly and Don cheer her on.

           - Returning from a walk, Lucas and Shiloh get the mail and 
           find an invitation from Liv, with an address and a time. 

           - Liv sits in front of her laptop, deleting all photos of her 
           and Austin.

           - Liv leads a bach party onstage at Absinthe to meet the 
           performers and take photos. 

           - Liv serves her parents a homemade dinner. They smile in 
           gratitude but it’s still a little frosty. 

           - Liv works her phone and laptop in the passenger van, while 
           Paula drives. 

           END MONTAGE

           EXT. OLSEN HOME - NIGHT

           On the phone, Liv paces next to the Liv It Up van, parked in 
           the driveway. 

                                 LIV
                          (into phone)
                        ...Hi. It’s Liv. I hope you got the 
                        invite for tonight and I really 
                        hope I see you there. I owe you a 
                        thank you and an I’m sorry. I mean 
                        both of those things very much. I 
                        really really do. 

           Liv looks up to see Kay and Barry exit the house, and ends 
           her call.

                                 BARRY
                        Puzzle later? I got a bad two 
                        thousand piece mamajama with your 
                        name on it.

                                 KAY
                        The new Ken Burns documentary about 
                        the soft drink industry starts 
                        tonight. 

                                 BARRY
                        I cannot wait. 

           They stop as they see Liv and the van. Paula waves from 
           inside. Like Vanna White, Liv indicates the stairs.
                                 KAY
                        What’s all this?

                                 LIV
                        A surprise for you. 

                                 BARRY
                        What about dinner?

                                 LIV
                        There will be food, I promise. 

           Liv ushers her parents aboard. 

           INT. MERCEDES PASSENGER VAN - EVENING

           Liv hands Kay and Barry each a glass of champagne then moves 
           to the front seat. Liv hits a button and the van goes dark, 
           with the exception of twirling lights, as if from a disco 
           ball.  

           Liv presses another button and the TV screen comes on, 
           showing a photo of Kay and Barry on their wedding day. Patti 
           Austin and James Ingram’s “Baby, Come to Me” starts to play.

                                 LIV
                          (on the mic)
                        The year was 1983. The place, Lake 
                        Havasu. The venue, a pontoon boat. 
                        The occasion, a joining of souls 
                        between Katherine Elliott Markus 
                        and Bernard James Olsen. 

           Liv and Paula share a smile. 

           EXT. NEON BONEYARD - NIGHT 

           The passenger van pulls up outside the dark entrance to Las 
           Vegas’s most nostalgic tourist attraction, the place old 
           signs go to die, the Neon Boneyard. 

           As Liv leads Kay and Barry off the bus, they’re surrounded by 
           darkness. Then - 

           A POP as a bevy of old neon signs pop on, including a new 
           neon sign that reads “Kay & Barry.” A crowd of friends and 
           family line the entryway. 

           Kay and Barry react with surprise and joy. 
                                 LIV
                        Mom, Dad. Happy anniversary. I’m so 
                        sorry it’s late. 

           Kay and Barry pull Liv into a hug. 

           EXT./INT. NEON BONEYARD - NIGHT

           Guests, including Kay and Barry, follow the trail past the 
           signs, all light up at ground level. Liv and Paula watch the 
           scene.

                                 PAULA
                        You ready for this?

                        Yep.

                                 PAULA
                        SHIT. 

                                 LIV
                        What?

                                 PAULA
                        They started the appetizer service 
                        too early. Excuse me. 
                          (screaming)
                        Doris! Doris! Get over here!

           Liv notices her parents walking hand in hand. She smiles. 
           Then she spots Daisy and Felix walking in. Liv beelines it 
           over to them. 

                                 LIV
                        You came!

                        We’re Kay and Barry Stans for life,

                        am. Always. I really promise. 

           Daisy smiles. 

                                 DAISY
                        More night swims.

                        I would love a glowing review on

                        suite at Caeser’s for your mother 
                        in law. Massages, room service - 
                        the works. So you can go to Lake

           Daisy gasps and throws her arms around Liv. 

           EXT. NEON BONEYARD PARK - NIGHT

           Guests crowd around tables and chairs, and a bar. A small 
           stage is set up next to a screen. Liv takes the stage.

                          (tapping the mic)
                        Hi everyone. 

           A soft light clicks on, illuminating Liv. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for coming to celebrate 
                        Kay and Barry and forty years of 
                        marriage. Woo hoo!

           Everyone claps. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        It’s a real achievement. When I 
                        think about these marvelous 
                        meddlers who raised me, I think 
                        about one thing in particular - how 
                        they always like to match. 

           Barry and Kay, as usual, are wearing similarly colored 
           clothing. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        It’s an obvious metaphor but an apt 
                        one. These two make sense together. 
                        They compliment and balance each 
                        other. They match. 

           Liv sees Lucas enter at the back. Eye contact. Smiles. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        They love each other in the small 
                        moments. The quiet moments. The 
                        routine of a shared life.

                        That’s where trust is built. Mom, 
                        Dad, you inspire me. 

           Barry and Kay share a kiss. Liv shares a look with Lucas.

                        One more thing - 

           Paula signals a CAMERAMAN with a rig on his shoulder and the 
           red light comes on. Liv appears on the screen there and: 

           - on Fremont Street. A gigantic Liv towering over a crowd on 
           one of the largest LED screens in the world. 

           - on the Strip. Liv on the massive billboard screen outside 
           Planet Hollywood. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        I have spent a lot of time making 
                        and using content to control how 
                        others see me, and the people 
                        around me. But tonight, I’m making 
                        content that’s new and different. 
                        It’s totally honest, totally real 
                        and will live on the internet 
                        forever. And what you think about 
                        it will be out of my control. Eek, 
                        here goes. 
                          (deep breath)
                        Austin, it’s not your fault I 
                        wasn’t happy and I don’t blame you 
                        anymore.

           Chyron: “1.”

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Because you were always at band 
                        practice, I had time to develop my 
                        business. So your negligence had a 
                        positive outcome.

           “2.” And so on, as the comments continue.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        When you went vegan, I learned I’m 
                        allergic to tofu, and it’s really 
                        helpful for me to know that. 

           On the screen overlooking the Strip - 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t fair of me to tell 
                        everyone you had webbed feet when 
                        it’s just the one toe. 
           On Fremont street, as ZIPLINERS fly through the air 
           underneath the screen - 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Thanks to the garbage fire of our 
                        relationship, I’ve learned that I 
                        need to listen to the people around 
                        me who love me. I’m grateful for 
                        that.

           Lucas watches Liv on stage as she makes her amends. 

                                                    FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. NEON BONEYARD PARK - NIGHT

           The party now in full swing. Liv watches her parents dance. 

                                 LUCAS
                        This is quite a shindig. 

           Liv turns to find Lucas standing next to her. 

                                 LIV
                        You came. I wasn’t sure you would 
                        since, you know, people. 

                                 LUCAS
                        That was some speech. 

                                 LIV
                        It was long. 

                                 LUCAS
                        I had to rehydrate halfway through.

                                 LIV
                        I had a lot to say. Think the judge 
                        will accept it?

                                 LUCAS
                        If she can make it all the way 
                        through. 

           They share a smile. 

                                 LIV
                        You’ve been really nice to me. 
                        Thank you. 

                                 LUCAS
                        Technically, you’ve completed your 
                        sentence.

                        So you’re no longer my 
                        responsibility, in a professional 
                        capacity.

                                 LIV
                        Does that mean we can dance 
                        suggestively?

                                 LUCAS
                        I think we can take our chances. 

           Lucas takes Liv’s hand. As they start to walk away, Paula 
           approaches Liv.

                                 PAULA
                        It’s time. 

                                 LIV
                          (to Lucas)
                        Give me just one minute, okay?

           Lucas nods. Liv makes her way to the stage. Once she’s at the 
           mic, she has some hecklers. “Not another speech!” “Please 
           don’t talk!”

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Ladies and gentleman, one last 
                        surprise for the evening. All the 
                        way from the Wynn, our wealthiest 
                        relative and my third favorite 
                        cousin, give it up for Diplo!

           As the crowd cheers, lights come up on DIPLO at a mounted DJ 
           stand atop a giant neon sign.   

                                 DIPLO
                        Happy anniversary Aunt Kay and 
                        Uncle Barry! This one’s for you!

           Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers’s “Islands in the Stream” 
           starts to play. Kay and Barry come together on the dance 
           floor. Liv and Lucas walk towards each other. The music 
           shifts as Diplo puts a unique spin on the classic song. 

           As Liv and Lucas come together on the dance floor, Liv grabs 
           his face and kisses him. Lucas dips her. In the swirl of 
           dancing bodies, they’re still, lost in the moment. Fully in 
           the present. 

                                                          THE END.
           POSTSCRIPT.

           Footsteps echo in a cavernous space. Voices whisper. Suddenly 
           - overhead lights THUNK on revealing a massive warehouse. 
           Contraptions, devices, large and small, as far as the eye can 
           see.

           Liv squeals in glee. Standing next to her are Paula and a 
           BACHELORETTE PARTY.

                        I know a guy. 

           Then out of the shadows steps the legend himself - DAVID 
           COPPERFIELD - solemn, mysterious. Paula holds out a bag of 
           McDonald’s and David breaks into a smile. 

                                 DAVID

                        and a riddle for the mind - are you 
                        ready?

           MONTAGE. 

           - Liv and Paula take a bach party horseback riding at 
           Johnson’s J Bar B stables. 

           - Liv and Lucas lay on the hood of Lucas’ car in the parking 
           lot of the Sonic eating tater tots.

           - Liv and a bach party are backstage at Lionel Ritchie, 
           taking photos.

           - Gabriel is escorted out of Planet Hollywood Casino.

                                 GABRIEL
                        I didn’t know Gwen had no touching 
                        rule!

           - Liv at the jail as Gabriel is released. 
                                 LIV
                        I used your bonus money to bail you 
                        out. We good?

           Gabriel throws his arms around her in a hug.

           - Liv, Lucas, Daisy and Felix walk around Container Park, 
           laughing and talking together. 

           END MONTAGE.
