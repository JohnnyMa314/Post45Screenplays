           INT. BALDWIN HILLS MALL - MACY’S - DAY (1998)

           Holiday season. A large Christmas tree looms in the 
           center. Train tracks snake around the aisles. 

           A SECURITY GUARD hustles toward SHOPPERS gathered around 
           a screaming 12-YEAR OLD AMBER JOHNSON (clever, adorably 
           chubby).

                                 AMBER
                                (French)
                        Ou est mon chien? La salle de bain est au 
                        bout du couloir. Est ce fromage? Ca pue!!
                                (translation)
                        Where is my dog? The bathroom is down the 
                        hall. Is this cheese? It stinks!

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        What is she saying? 

                                 CONCERNED HUSBAND
                        It’s French.

                                 CONCERNED WIFE
                        How do you know? You don’t speak French.

                                 CONCERNED HUSBAND
                        Vule Vucu Shay Avenue.

                                 CONCERNED WIFE
                        Shut up, Carl.
                                (loud, to Amber)
                        Are you lost, little girl? 

           Amber CRIES harder.

                                 AMBER
                        Le vert est ma meilleure couleur!
                                (translation)
                        Green is my favorite color!

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Where are your parents?

           Amber’s eyes quickly fleet to --

           ANGLE ON. 

           SAVANNAH JOHNSON (20s, a total train wreck) steps around 
           a display case full of expensive watches just as the 
           SALES CLERK wanders over to help Amber.  

           Savannah takes out a switchblade. She picks the lock, 
           then slides the glass case open. She dumps the watches 
           into her purse. 

           BACK ON.

                                               Oyegun

           Amber plops down on the floor. Arms flailing about. 

                                 AMBER
                        Mon chat est malade.
                                (translation)
                        My cat is sick!

           The Sales Clerk joins the fray. 

                                 SALES CLERK
                        Oh it’s her cat. She says her cat is 
                        sick.

           Amber stops crying. Her eyes widen. 

                                 SALES CLERK (CONT’D)
                                (French)
                        Nous pouvons vous aider a trouver votre 
                        chat. Pouvez-vous nous dire ou vous 
                        l'avez vu pour la derniere fois?

                                 AMBER
                                (stumped)
                        Uhhh --

           Amber shoots a panicked look to Savannah who is still 
           raiding the display case. She does an impromptu bird 
           call. 

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Cuuukooo. Cuuukooo!

           ANGLE ON.

           Savannah looks up. She sees Amber is in trouble.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Shit. 

           ANGLE ON.

           Amber scrambles to her feet. The Sales Clerk helps her 
           up. Amber jerks away.

                                 AMBER
                        Gracias, Señiora. 

           She scurries to the exit. Shoppers watch her go, confused 
           as hell. What was that?

           Savannah slinks out of the store after her.

           EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - DAY (1998)

           Savannah and Amber rush out of the mall and into an 
           awaiting vehicle. DRAGON (40s, Savannah’s boyfriend, 
           tattoos, grills, gold chains) is in the driver’s seat. 

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Let’s go, let’s go. 

           The car peels off. Savannah and Dragon kiss, hard. Amber 
           is grossed out in the backseat. 

                                 DRAGON
                        Open that shit, lemme see what ya’ll got.

           Savannah shows him her haul. Dragon sifts through the 
           jewelry while driving. 

                                 DRAGON (CONT’D)
                        Where’s my Gucci? You know I gotta rock 
                        the Gucci.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        I would have gotten it for you, baby, but 
                        Amber didn’t give me enough time.

                                 AMBER
                                (quietly)
                        How was I supposed to know that Sales 
                        Lady spoke French? 

           Savannah turns to Amber. 

                                 SAVANNAH
                        It’s all good. You just gotta think on 
                        your feet. A job ain’t always gonna go 
                        how you expect. 

           Amber nods, deflated. Savannah squeezes her knee.  

                                 SAVANNAH (CONT’D)
                        But you had fun though.

                                 AMBER
                                (smiles)
                        Yeah. Next time I’m gonna use my 
                        Mandarin. 

           Dragon turns to Savannah. 

                                 DRAGON
                        Damn, she knows Mandarin?

                                 SAVANNAH
                        All she does is read. She doesn’t have 
                        any friends.

           Amber’s smile fades. She stares solemnly out the window. 

           INT. CICELY’S INGLEWOOD HOUSE - DAY (1998)

           The house is pristine. CICELY (60, a regale, genteel 
           Southern Belle) puts up Christmas decorations. Amber and 
           Savannah ENTER. Amber races to Cicely.

                                 AMBER
                        Grandma!

                                 CICELY
                        Shoes.

                                 AMBER
                        Sorry.

           Amber takes off her shoes then goes in to hug Cicely.

                                 CICELY
                        There’s my baby girl.

           Savannah plops down on the couch. Her shoes are still on.

                                 CICELY (CONT’D)
                        Savannah.

                                 SAVANNAH
                                (dry)
                        Ma. 

                                 CICELY
                                (to Amber)
                        Our favorite show that comes on at 7:30.

                                 AMBER
                        What is Jeopardy?

           Cicely and Amber high five. She caresses Amber’s cheek. 

                                 CICELY
                        Go wash up. I’ll make the popcorn.

                                 AMBER
                        Extra butter?

                                 CICELY
                        You know it. 

           Amber sprints off. Savannah takes out a cigarette. Cicely 
           stares, noticing something on Savannah’s wrist...

                                 CICELY (CONT’D)
                        Where’d you get that watch?
            "Assisted Living"  
                                               Oyegun

                                 SAVANNAH
                        This? This... is... for you. Merry 
                        Christmas, Ma.

           Savannah takes off the new watch and hands it to Cicely. 

                                 CICELY
                        You bought me an expensive watch?

                                 SAVANNAH
                        It’s nice, right? It’s a TAG Heuer. You 
                        can wear it to Church on Sundays, on 
                        Wednesdays, on Fridays --

                                 CICELY
                        Cut the crap, Savannah. You stole this, 
                        didn’t you?

           Cicely gives the watch back. 

                                 SAVANNAH
                        What?
                                (off her blank stare)
                        Alright. So maybe I went to the mall and 
                        grabbed a few things. Is that a crime?

                                 CICELY
                        Yes. It is literally a crime. It’s called 
                        stealing. You’re a thief.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Woah, I’m an artist. Like Picasso. 

                                 CICELY
                        Picasso? Really? Picasso never stole a 
                        TAG whatever it is watch.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        You don’t know that. He cut his own ear 
                        off. The man had problems. He could have 
                        stolen some shit.

                                 CICELY
                        Goddamn it, Savannah! 
                                (calming breath, to Jesus)
                        Father, forgive me for taking your 
                        precious name in vain. 
                                (then, to Savannah)
                        Was Amber with you when you Picassoed 
                        this watch?

                                 SAVANNAH
                        No.

           Cicely turns to see a guilt-ridden Amber in the doorway. 
           Back to Savannah, Cicely shakes her head, disappointed.

                                 CICELY
                        You never had sense and I don’t think 
                        you’re ever gonna get sense. Worst part 
                        is, you want Amber to end up wasting her 
                        life just like you. 

           Savannah blanches, pissed and hurt. A moment, then... 

                                 SAVANNAH
                        What am I doing? I don’t need to be here. 
                        I have Dragon. 

                                 CICELY
                        What is Dragon?

                                 SAVANNAH
                        My man. We can go live with him. He’ll 
                        take care of us.

                                 CICELY
                        Who is we? 

           Savannah hands Amber her coat. Amber looks to Cicely, 
           scared. Cicely realizes what is happening.

                                 AMBER
                        Grandma? 

                                 CICELY
                        Now wait a minute --

                                 SAVANNAH
                        Save it, Ma. I can’t live in this fucking 
                        house anymore.

                                 CICELY
                        Watch your language.

                                 SAVANNAH
                        See what I’m saying? Why do I have to 
                        watch my language? You watch my language. 
                        It’s always ‘no shoes in the house, 
                        Savannah,’ ‘no smoking in the house, 
                        Savannah,’ ‘why can’t you keep a job, 
                        Savannah?’ ‘Don’t have sex on the couch, 
                        Savannah.’ I’m sick of this. I’m sick of 
                        you. 

           Cicely crosses her arms. 

                                 CICELY
                        Fine. Go. When you fall on your face, and 
                        you will, you’ll be back. 

           Savannah stares at Cicely for a beat.

                        Amber, let’s go. 

                                 AMBER
                                (horrified)
                        No... Grandma please. I don’t wanna go.

           Cicely, stone-faced, turn away as Savannah leads Amber 
           out. Off Amber, heartbroken, we...

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. FANCY JEWELRY STORE - LOS ANGELES - DAY

           THROUGH A MAGNIFYING LENS: a diamond necklace. 

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                                (British accent)
                        Perfect symmetry. You can barely see the 
                        inclusions. 

           WIDER REVEALS: The woman, in a black wig, studying the 
           necklace with a pair of Binocular Loupes, is GROWNUP 
           AMBER (30s. Think Natasha Rothwell).

           Amber sits across from a WEALTHY COUPLE. A tray of 
           champagne flutes is beside her. A framed picture of the 
           store owner, a man with long hair and a goatee, hangs 
           behind her.

           Amber bites the necklace. 

                                 WEALTHY WOMAN
                        Goodness, is that really necessary?

                                 AMBER
                        A chipped tooth is cheaper than a chipped 
                        diamond.

                                 WEALTHY MAN
                        How much is it worth? 

                                 AMBER
                        Ten maybe twenty thousand dollars. 

                                 WEALTHY MAN
                        Are you fucking serious? Twenty grand. I 
                        make more than that in my sleep.

                                 AMBER
                                (to herself)
                        Where do you sleep?

                                 WEALTHY WOMAN
                        Maybe we don’t sell it then.

                                 WEALTHY MAN
                        Oh no, you made me come down to this 
                        shithole cause you found a bunch of your 
                        great aunt’s junk and are feeling too 
                        sentimental to toss ‘em. We’re selling 
                        it. 

           The wealthy woman shrinks. Amber clocks this. The guy 
           rises, pulls out his cell phone. 

                                 WEALTHY MAN (CONT’D)
                        Finish this up. I need to make a call.

           He steps away. Amber notices his expensive TAG Heuer 
           watch. 

                                 AMBER
                        He’s a real gem. Maybe I ought to bite 
                        him.

                                 WEALTHY WOMAN
                        Don’t bother. He doesn’t taste very good.

           They share a polite chuckle.

                                 WEALTHY WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        She practically raised me. My aunt. I 
                        don’t care how much the necklace is 
                        worth. I can’t bare to part with it.

           Amber nods.

                                 AMBER
                        Help yourself to some complimentary 
                        champagne. It’s the really bubbly kind. 
                                (re: necklace)
                        I’ll sort you out.   

           Amber takes the necklace and heads into --

           INT. FANCY JEWELRY STORE - BACKROOM - DAY

           Amber steps inside. She’s about to walk to the back door 
           with the necklace when she stops. Torn.

                                 AMBER
                                (to herself, no accent)
                        Come on, you can’t bitch out... Left 
                        foot, right foot. You have the necklace. 
                        There’s the door. Walk out. Just walk 
                        out. That was the plan. 
            "Assisted Living"  
                                               Oyegun

           Amber takes another step then stops. She can’t leave. She 
           GROANS, annoyed with herself. 

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                                (to herself)
                        So what if it’s her great aunt’s? I 
                        clocked those red bottoms and that Prada 
                        Bag. Her husband ain’t shit, but he 
                        didn’t hit her... at least not in front 
                        of me. Plus she already has white 
                        privilege, she doesn’t need this necklace 
                        too. 

           Amber notices the body of the store owner, the man with 
           the ponytail and goatee from the photo. He’s knocked out 
           next to an empty champagne glass and a bottle of sleeping 
           pills. She checks his pulse then picks up the pills.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Damn, how much did I give him?
                                (then)
                        You can do it, Amber. Just leave!

                                                             SMASH TO:

           INT. FANCY JEWELRY STORE - DAY

           Amber reemerges with a smile and the necklace. She hands 
           it to the wealthy woman.

                                 AMBER
                                (British accent)
                        Here you go. Cleaned for ya. You 
                        shouldn’t have to sell it if you don’t 
                        want to. 

                                 WEALTHY WOMAN
                                (touched)
                        Thank you. 

           Then Amber eyes the wealthy man on the phone pacing at 
           the front of the store. 

                                 AMBER
                        Your husband looks like he could use a 
                        drink. 

           Amber takes the tray of champagne over to him. 

                                 WEALTHY MAN
                                (laughs like a douche, into 
                                the phone)
                        The lake house. Yeah, we’ll be there all

                                 AMBER
                        Champagne?

           He reaches over, not bothering to look at Amber. His TAG 
           Heuer watch glistens. He takes the glass. Amber lightly 
           grazes his wrist. Blink and you miss it. 

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Enjoy.
                                (turning, under her breath)
                        Asshole. 

           Amber slips his watch into her pocket and walks to the 
           back room.

           EXT. STREET - HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - DAY

           Amber exits onto a busy street. She moves through a 
           flurry of TOURISTS, stopping at a parked HOT DOG CART. 

           In one motion: she slips off her wig, pulls on a hat and 
           apron then slides the watch into a vat of raw hot dogs. 

           Her cell phone RINGS. Unknown number. She picks up.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Hello? Amber Johnson? 

                                 AMBER

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)

                                 AMBER
                        Not interested. 

           Amber hangs up. She pushes the cart down the street.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                                (Jamaican accent)

           EXT. THE INFERNO - NIGHT

           A swanky night club. Amber, face beat, in a sexy red 
           dress, confidently struts past the long line. 

           A group of hot white 20-SOMETHINGS take selfies when they 
           notice her pass by. 
            "Assisted Living"

                        She’s like forty.

           Amber overhears them. She musters up some courage and 
           walks over to the young hot girls.

                                 AMBER
                        Was that for me?

                        Well you look older. You both do. Might 
                        wanna cut back on the cum shots and drink 
                        more water. Hydrate ya skin. 

           Feeling confident, Amber turns, ready to walk off when --

                        Whatever, grandma.

                        Angela Davis, give me strength.

           Amber turns back and starts -- dancing. She twerks, pops, 
           and drops it like it’s burning hot. She kills it. The 
           PEOPLE in line whoop and holler. Amber finally stops. 

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)

                        All of that, that’s thirty-three. 

           Amber strolls past the BOUNCER who high-fives her and 
           lets her into the club. 

           INT. THE INFERNO - NIGHT

           Music BLARES. The club is packed. Amber ENTERS and 
           collapses against the nearest wall.

           She grabs a drink out of the hand of a PASSERBY.

           HENCHMEN stand around as JAMIE (30s, intense, sweats 
           testosterone) pummels the shit out of some GUY. 

                                 JAMIE
                        I say ‘don’t touch the merchandise. Don’t 
                        touch the fucking merchandise.

           Jamie then looks up to see Amber’s blown up face on the 
           monitor. She’s staring into a camera. Jamie grins.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)

           A Henchman opens the door. Jamie straightens his bloody 
           shirt. Amber ENTERS. Excited, Jamie goes in for a hug.

                        that?

           Jamie points to the beaten-up guy. 

                                 JAMIE
                        His.

           Amber winces. Jamie SNAPS his fingers.

           PAM (30s, could be Amber’s twin) rushes over. She glares 
           at Amber as she hands Jamie a towel. Jamie wipes the 
           blood off his hands. He gives Amber a once over. She 
           adjusts her dress, uneasy. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re looking good. And you smell like

           Jamie chuckles as he steps in behind Amber. She goes 
           stiff. He begins massaging her shoulders.

           Amber can’t help, but get into the massage.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Ooo, that’s actually really good. I have 
                        been sleeping weird. Oh my gosh, yeah 
                        right there. 

           Amber’s cell phone RINGS. She looks at the caller. Then 
           ignores the call.  The massage continues.

                                 JAMIE
                                (sexy whisper)
                        Who was that?

                        Meadow Lane. This nursing home is up my 
                        ass about my Grandma.

                        Zora Neale Hurston, take the wheel.

           Amber pulls away.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        No, I don’t wanna have sex in your small 
                        ass car. 

                                 PAM
                        It’s that small.

           Amber looks at Pam. Pam just shrugs.

                                 JAMIE
                        Okay, no Bugatti. We can do it on my 
                        California King. 

                                 AMBER
                        We can’t do it on a bed, on a train, in a 
                        plane, on a boat, or a moat. 

           Jamie’s Henchmen snicker. Jamie shoots them a look. They 
           instantly stop laughing. Jamie pulls Amber aside. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Amber, it’s been months. How long are you 
                        gonna act like this? 

                                 AMBER
                        We’re not Ross and Rachel, we’re not on a 
                        break. We BROKE up.

                        And I’ve apologized a thousand times. Me 
                        fucking all those other girls was not 
                        that deep. What you and I have, that’s 
                        deep. Like the ocean.

           Amber rolls her eyes, this dumbass. She takes the TAG 
           Heuer watch out of her purse and hands it to Jamie. 

                                 AMBER
                        Here. It’s a TAG Heuer Connected Modular 
                        45 Full Diamond. 23 karats. It’s not the 
                        necklace, but it’s worth more. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Oh so it’s all business now?

                                 AMBER
                        It’s always been business with us. That’s 
                        how this whole thing started. I stole 
                        from you. You caught me. I’ve been 
                        working for you ever since. But with this 
                        watch, I’m all paid up.  

           Jamie looks at Amber for a moment. Then he goes to his 
           desk, puts the watch away then takes out a picture of a 
           jewel incrusted Golden Bird. He shows it to Amber. 

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Shiny. What is it?

                                 JAMIE
                        A chance to make some real money. It’s 
                        the Golden Bird. I was hired to lift it

                        It’s going down tomorrow night. I could 
                        use someone with your set of skills.

                        Skills? Really? 

           They turn to Pam. 

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                        Amber, what you do is more like a party 
                        trick.

                                 AMBER
                        Pam, what I do is an art.

                        What is your problem with me?

                        Well since you asked, I think you’re a

                        So, you in?

           Amber looks around the room - guns, drugs, stacks of 
           cash, the guy bleeding to death in the corner. She shakes 
           her head.

                                 AMBER
                        Nah. I’m out.

           Amber leaves. Jamie watches her go, hurt. Pam walks to 
           Jamie and places a comforting hand on his shoulder. He 
           shakes her off and walks away. Pam plays off the diss... 

                                 PAM
                        Yeah, of course. Everyone get back to 
                        work.

           EXT. KOREATOWN - NIGHT

           Amber walks up to her shitty apartment building.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Amber passes an apartment. The door is open as TOPHER 
           (20s, Amber’s neighbor) welcomes a group of FRIENDS. 
           Music pours out of he apartment.

                                 TOPHER
                        Get in here. Wine goes in the cooler. 
                        Charades is about to start.

           As they ENTER, Topher spots Amber. 

                                 TOPHER (CONT’D)
                        What? Music’s too loud?

                                 AMBER
                        No, it’s cool. It’s a party so volume is 
                        important...

                                 TOPHER
                        Yeah, game nights can get a little rowdy. 
                        We’ll try to keep it down.

           Amber nods, but doesn’t walk off. An awkward beat.

                                 TOPHER (CONT’D)
                        Come in.

           Amber brightens at the invitation. Then two more PARTY 
           GUESTS squeeze past her and enter the apartment. Topher 
           closes the door leaving Amber out. 

                                 AMBER
                        Yup, that makes more sense.

           Amber continues on to her front door, when --

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey!
            "Assisted Living"  
                                               Oyegun

           Amber turns, startled to see someone with the head of 
           SWAMP THING (a monster face with stringy tentacles) and 
           the body of a teenage girl. She JUMPS, raising a fist. 

                                 AMBER
                        Holy fucking shit!

                                 NELL
                        Amber, it’s me, Nell. 

                                 AMBER
                        I almost punched you in the face.

           Nell pulls her latex mask off revealing a very pretty 17-
           year old Black girl.

                                 NELL
                        Sorry. Didn’t mean to scare ya.

                                 AMBER
                        Then maybe don’t roll up on me looking 
                        like -- what is that supposed to be?

                                 AMBER
                        Why would you think I know that?

           Nell shrugs, sheepish. 

                                 NELL
                        It’s effects makeup for my Youtube 
                        Channel. Which no one watches. But I did 
                        double my subscribers. I went from one to 
                        two. 

                                 AMBER
                        Congrats.

           Amber unlocks her door. Nell looks at Topher’s apartment 
           as more people arrive.

                                 NELL
                        You going to Topher’s? 

                                 AMBER
                        I would, but I just came from a thing and 
                        I’ve got a ton of stuff to do.

                                 NELL

                                 AMBER
                        Super busy. You know. Raincheck?

           Before Nell can respond, Amber enters her apartment and 
           closes the door.

           INT. AMBER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The space is an eclectic mix of junk. There’s a dead 
           plant next to a stack of BILLS and OVERDUE NOTICES. 

           In a MONTAGE, we see Amber’s ‘busy’ night --

           -- Amber uses scissors to cut herself out of her spanx. 
           She changes into pajamas.

           -- Amber heats up some old Chinese food. Her fridge is 
           full of old Chinese food take out. 

           -- Amber watches Clueless on TV. It’s the scene where 
           Josh (Paul Rudd) kisses Cher (Alicia Silverstone) on the 
           staircase. Amber slurps her noodles as she cries over the 
           scene.

           -- Amber is sprawled out, sleeping on the couch.

           INT. AMBER’S APARTMENT - NEXT DAY

           A phone RINGS. Amber reaches for her cell phone and falls 
           off the couch as she answers the call.

                                 AMBER
                        Oww.

                                 AMBER

                        is harassment. I should get your name.

                                 NURSE
                        I told you. It’s Rhonda.

                        Okay then, Rrrohhnndaa, since you’re so 
                        freaking curious, I’m only Cicely’s 
                        emergency contact because my mom’s dead. 
                        I have neither seen nor spoken to my 
                        grandmother since I was twelve. 

           A beat of silence. Then:

                                 NURSE (V.O.)
                        Mrs. Johnson suffered a minor stroke. She 
                        was in the hospital, but has been re-
                        admitted to our facility. You have a 
                        pleasant day. 

           The nurse hangs up. Amber looks at the phone. Thinking. 
           The guilt sets in. She screams into her pillow. 

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - DAY

           OLD RESIDENTS and NURSES mill about. The place is drab. 
           The TV is always on the news or Matlock. 

           Amber ENTERS. She’s instantly overwhelmed by the sight of 
           old people walking and breathing. It’s all too much.

           MARTY (40s, creepy, a punchable face) reprimands FLORENCE  
           (70s, plump, friendly, a housewife).

                                 MARTY
                        Don’t think I didn’t see you go for a 
                        third pudding cup, Florence. I’ve got 
                        eyes in places you can’t imagine. 

           Florence drops the pudding. Marty notices Amber.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Can I help you?

           Amber reads his name tag. 

                                 AMBER
                        Yeah, Marty, is there like a sign in 
                        sheet or something?

                                 MARTY
                        Who are you here to see?

                                 AMBER
                        Cicely Johnson.

           Marty looks at her, curious. He walks to the front desk. 
           Amber follows.

                                 MARTY
                        Cicely’s never had a visitor before. 
                        What’s your name? 

                                 AMBER
                        Amber Johnson. She’s my grandmother. 

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - CICELY’S ROOM - DAY

           Amber and Marty ENTER. The room is clean. The TV is on 
           with the local news. 

           Cicely is in bed. Older, grayer, and more fragile than we 
           last saw her. The bed next to her is empty.

                                 AMBER
                        Is she --

                                 MARTY
                        Resting. I’ll give you a minute. 

           Marty leaves. Amber takes in Cicely. She’s never seen her 
           so small and helpless. 

           Amber notices a picture on her wall. 

           CLOSE ON PICTURE: Cicely, Savannah and Amber during 
           happier times. 

           Amber, perplexed, stares at this when her attention 
           suddenly turns to --

           A breaking news banner pops up on the TV. Headline: 
           Suspect in Golden Bird Robbery Identified.

                        was stolen from the Wells Center in 
                        Downtown Los Angeles.

           A grainy surveillance video comes up. A Black woman 
           appears to be walking out of a secure vault.

                                 AMBER
                        No fucking way. 

           Amber beelines for the door when she hears FOOTSTEPS 
           coming. Shit. 

           She panics. Goes to the window, but the latch is locked.  

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        This is such a fire hazard!

           Someone’s at the door now. Turning the knob. 

           Amber sees a lab coat on a chair. She throws it on. She 
           then pulls the curtain divider, separating Cicely’s side 
           of the room from the other --

           Just as the door opens and in walks, VICTOR GREEN (40s, 
           handsome, straight-laced, an adult eagle scout). He’s 
           carrying an empty cardboard box. He sees the divide. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Is someone there? Mrs. Johnson? It’s 
                        Victor Green, Octavia’s son.

           Amber (on the other side of the curtain divide) looks at 
           the name tag on her lab coat. It says: Dr. S. Williams. 

                                 AMBER
                                (British accent)
                        No, Mrs. Johnson is resting. I’m Dr. 
                        Williams... Serenaa Williams.

                                 VICTOR
                        Serena Williams?

                                 AMBER
                        With 2 A’s. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Oh. Is Mrs. Johnson okay? 

                                 AMBER
                        She will be. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Good. My mother really liked her. I came 
                        to grab the rest of her things. 

           Victor places the cardboard box on his mother’s empty 
           bed. He looks around, then sits. Getting emotional.

                                 VICTOR (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe she’s gone. 81 years. 
                        Then one day, poof. Gone. But I guess 
                        that’s enough, right? That’s enough time 
                        on earth?

                                 AMBER
                        It’s more than most people get.

                                 VICTOR
                        Yeah. But I should have come around more. 
                        I should have called more. I should have 
                        told her I loved her more.  But that’s 
                        what it’s like. You think about all the 
                        ‘should haves’ once the person is gone. 

           Amber looks at Cicely. A wave of emotion hitting her. 

                                 VICTOR (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. I’m talking too much. I’ve been 
                        doing that a lot. I just got divorced and 
                        my therapist said -- Nope. I’m stopping 
                        now. 

           Amber looks for a way out. But finds none. Victor packs 
           up a few books. Thinking out loud:

                                 VICTOR (CONT’D)
                        You know what, I’m gonna cover the fees 
                        for whoever moves into this bed. My 
                        mother would have liked that. Dr. 
                        Williams, what do you think --

           Amber can’t hide any longer. She has to go. She swings 
           the curtain open and without looking at Victor, books it 
           out of the room. 

                                 VICTOR (CONT’D)
                        Dr. Williams?

           But she’s gone. Victor, thrown for a loop, looks at the 
           door, then at a sleeping Cicely.

           Amber races down the hall. She ducks out through an 
           emergency exit door.

           INT. THE INFERNO - BASEMENT - DAY

           Henchmen load guns into bags. STACKS OF CASH flow through 
           a money counting machine. The Golden Bird (the height of 
           a cell phone, 7 inches tall) is on the table. 

           BANGING rattles the door. Jamie checks the monitor to see 
           a livid Amber. Jamie gestures for Pam to open it. Pam 
           does. Amber CHARGES at Jamie.

                                 AMBER
                        You son-of-a-bitch, you set me up and you 
                        used her. 

           Amber points to Pam. 

                                 PAM
                        Like I said your little party trick isn’t 
                        that hard. 

           Amber LUNGES at Pam. Jamie pulls her off. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Relax.

                                 AMBER
                        How could you do that to me?

                                 JAMIE
                        It’s business. 

           Amber is beside herself. Jamie looks at her, feeling a 
           pang of guilt. He grabs a stack of cash from the counting 
           machine. Hands it to Amber. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Your best option is to skip town. 

                                 AMBER
                        Fuck you. I don’t want your money. 

           Amber throws the cash in Jamie’s face. Then in a rage, 
           she kicks the counting machine over. Money goes flying.

                                 JAMIE
                        Are you out of your mind?

           Jamie SHOVES Amber aside. She tumbles back, knocking into 
           the table. Something falls beside her. 

           Jamie, his men and Pam scramble to collect the scattered 
           bills. 

           With everyone distracted, Amber looks to her side to see 
           what fell. It’s The Golden Bird. She thinks fast. She 
           grabs the bird, hides it in her coat, and slips out of 
           the room.

                                 PAM
                        She’s so fucking dramatic.

                        What?

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           POLICE CARS are outside. Amber darts across the street to 
           the alley behind her building.

           A HOMELESS GUY sleeps by his cart. Amber looks up at her 
           fire escape. The ladder is too high for her to reach. 

           She grabs the Homeless guy’s cart, climbs into it, uses 
           it to reach the ladder. Amber dangles there, kicking her 
           legs for momentum. She’s got no upper body strength. 

           The cart goes rolling down the alley, into the street and 
           out of sight. 

           Amber finally pulls herself to the fire escape. The 
           homeless guy wakes up. He looks around, but doesn’t see 
           his cart. 

                                 HOMELESS GUY

           Amber reaches the fifth floor outside Nell’s bedroom 
           window. She sees Nell and taps on the glass.

           Amber goes to the door, she opens it slightly. She 
           watches --

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NELL’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           DETECTIVE AUGUSTINA SPENCER (30s, killer instincts) hands 
           her business card to CLYDE (40s, perpetually put out). 

                                 DETECTIVE SPENCER
                        Give me a call me if you hear anything.

                                 CLYDE
                        I certainly will. I always knew Amber was 
                        a trouble maker. She’s late on her rent 
                        and I think she smokes marijuana. I know 
                        it’s legal, but it’s about character, you 
                        know. 

           Amber turns to Nell.

                                 AMBER
                        No offense, but your Dad is a fucking 
                        asshole. 

           Nell nods. Amber turns back to see Clyde and Detective 
           Spencer advance to the door. 

           Amber backs away. Clyde turns the handle, about to enter 
           the room when Nell shoves the door shut.    

                                 NELL

                        My face is all over the news. I can’t go

                        steal that Golden Bird. 

                                 NELL
                        I believe you.

                                (then, remembering)
                        Shit. Shit. Shit.

           Amber takes the Golden Bird out of her jacket. She’s 
           freaking out. Nell’s eyes widen.

                                 NELL
                        Wait, you just said you didn’t steal it.

                                 AMBER
                        I didn’t. Not the first time. That wasn’t 
                        me. But this time. Yes. I did steal it 
                        this time. The second time.

                                 NELL
                        WHY?!

                        I don’t know!

                        What do you mean you don’t know?

                                 AMBER
                        Stop yelling at me.
                                (then)
                        Fuck! Jamie’s gonna kill me. 

                                 NELL
                        Who’s Jamie?

                        The psychopath who set me up. 

           Amber sits, helpless. Nell watches her, sympathetic.

                                 NELL
                        Do you have anyone who can help. Any 
                        friends, family?

                                 AMBER
                        I don’t... I’m going to jail. I’m gonna 
                        have to get cornrows and learn how to 
                        fight. I’m so fucked.

           Amber just sits there for a moment. Then she looks around 
           the room, finally noticing the mad science lab. Plaster 
           molds, casts, mirrors, wigs, makeup, clay, etc. A nerd’s 
           paradise. 

           She stands. An idea is forming. She touches the masks 
           hanging on Nell’s closet. They feel like flesh. 

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        It feels so real. 

           A beat. Amber pulls Nell into a hug.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        C’mere, you beautiful Black girl magic

                                (re: mask)
                        You can make me one of these.

                        into an old lady?

           Nell stares, confused. 

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        I do have family. My grandmother is at 
                        Meadow Lane. We aren’t close. Not 
                        anymore. But she’s there. 

                                 NELL
                        Okay.

                                 AMBER
                        It’s better than hiding under your bed.

                                 NELL
                        You were gonna hide under my bed?

                                 AMBER
                        Can you do it? Can you make me an old 
                        lady?

                                 NELL

                                 AMBER

                        Okay, I can try.

           Off Nell’s uncertain expression, a MUSIC CUE takes us 
           into a makeover MONTAGE:

           -- Nell makes a mold cast of Amber’s head.

           -- Nell fits Amber with a new prosthetic face. 

                                 NELL (CONT’D)
                        It’s made out of foam latex, so try not 
                        to get it wet. 

                                 AMBER
                        That’s what she said.

           Nell makes a face. 

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        I know that was bad. I heard it when I 
                        said it.

           -- Amber tries on different wigs, teeth, contacts, etc.

           -- Nell opens her closet. There are hundreds of costumes 
           and body suits inside. Amber takes it in, stunned.

           -- Amber, in her disguise as a 71-year old, is dressed 
           like a librarian. Nell gives a thumbs up. Amber frowns. 

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        I look like the old lady in the opening 
                        credits of Fresh Prince. Nope. Next.

           -- Amber is now dressed in a Baby Phat track suit and 
           hoop earrings. She stares at herself, getting emotional. 

                                 NELL
                        Are you okay?

                                 AMBER
                        I’m just so beautiful. 

           Nell shakes her head. The transformation is complete.

           END MONTAGE.

           Nell and Amber (in her disguise) ENTER. Spry MALE

           The same MALE RESIDENT makes a lewd gesture. Amber 
           recoils.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Ewww. No, he did not just do the two-

                        Okay, okay. 

           They approach Marty at the front desk.  

                                 NELL
                        Hi, I’m Nell. We spoke on the phone. My

                        Well, aren’t you... vibrant. 

                                 AMBER
                        I’ve had a lot of work done. 

           Amber smiles. They shake hands and Marty studies her 
           face. She seems familiar to him somehow.

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - HALLWAY - DAY

           Marty carries Amber’s bags as Nell and Amber follow.

                        I’ll let you get settled and say your 
                        goodbyes.

           Marty leaves. Nell looks around the room. 

                                 NELL
                        What’s that smell?

                        I’m pretty sure it’s Elizabeth Taylor 
                        perfume and denture cream.

           Amber hands Nell a BURNER PHONE.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        My number is programmed in here. Call if

                                 NELL
                        I got it.

           Amber unpacks her things. 

                                 NELL (CONT’D)
                        Hey, so there’s this senior showcase 
                        coming up at my school. It’s like a big 
                        deal. All the seniors share our projects 
                        in front of everyone. I’m gonna show some 
                        of my effects makeup. It’d be cool if you 
                        came. 

                                 AMBER

           Nell looks out the window at the SENIORS milling about in 
           the open yard. She looks at Amber, uneasy. 

                                 NELL (CONT’D)
                        You sure this is a good idea? 

                                 AMBER
                        When Whoopie Goldberg needed to hide out 
                        from Harvey Keitel, they sent her to a 
                        convent. Think of Meadow Lane as my 
                        convent. Besides, they’re a bunch of old 
                        people. How bad could it be?

           Just then, Cicely ENTERS in all her poised elegance. She 
           coolly takes in Nell and Amber.

                                 NELL
                        Okay, bye grandma.

           Nell gives Amber a quick hug then bolts. 

                                 AMBER
                        Bye... sweetheart. 

           It’s just Cicely and Amber now. Amber stares at Cicely. 
           It’s been years since she’s seen her. An awkward beat. 

                                 CICELY
                        Why are you looking at me like that?

                                 AMBER
                        Sorry. I’m Doris Layne. It’s nice to meet 
                        you, Ci--

                                 CICELY
                        The woman who lived here before you, she 
                        and I had an understanding. 

                                 AMBER
                        Okay?

                                 CICELY
                        Keep your things on your side. I sleep 
                        promptly at 7. So that’s lights out at 
                        6:30. I wake up early for my walks. And I 
                        need things quiet. No TV, no loud 
                        talking, no music, you wanna hum, there’s 
                        the hallway. Do we have an understanding?

           Amber slowly nods, speechless. What has she gotten 
           herself into? 

           EXT. ABANDONED LONG BEACH SHIPPING YARD - NIGHT

           Jamie, his men and Pam wait as cars pull up creating a 
           semi-circle of black SUVs with tinted windows.

           Three ARMED MEN and one suave gentleman (the leader) exit 
           the SUVs and approach carrying BLACK DUFFEL BAGS.  

           Jamie stares at the duffel bags, salivating.

                                 JAMIE
                        Is it all there?

                        Yes. And the bird?

           Jamie SNAPS his fingers, expecting a henchman to come 
           forward with The Golden Bird, but no one moves. 

           Jamie SNAPS his fingers again. Nothing. The Leader raises 
           an eye brow. Jamie turns to his men, speaks discretely.

                                 JAMIE
                                (snaps fingers)
                        When I do that, stuff happens. In this 
                        instance, you give me the bird so I can 
                        give it to the nice man with the bags of 
                        money. Who has the bird?

           The Henchmen look at each other confused. Jamie turns 
           back to The Leader.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me, just one second.

           Jamie walks to his men and they huddle. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the fucking bird?

                                 HENCHMAN 1
                        I don’t have it. I thought he had it?

                                 HENCHMAN 2 
                        Don’t look at me. I don’t fucking have 
                        it. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Then who has it!?

                                 HENCHMAN 3
                        Last time I saw it was on the table next 
                        to the counting machine...

           It slowly dawns on Jamie. He takes a calming breath then 
           turns back to The Leader. A smile crosses his face.

                                 JAMIE
                        This is embarrassing. There’s been a bit 
                        of a mix-up.

                                 THE LEADER
                        You don’t have the bird?

                                 JAMIE
                        Oh I do. I have it. The Golden Bird is in 
                        my possession. For sure... But I can’t 
                        give it to you right this second --

           The Leader NODS to his men. They take the duffel bags of 
           money and return to the SUVs.

                                 THE LEADER
                        No bird means no money.

                                 JAMIE
                                (clenched teeth)
                        I’m very aware.

                                 THE LEADER
                        No bird also means you owe me money. 
                                (then)
                        Bring me the bird or two million. You 
                        have one week.

           The Leader gets into an SUV. The cars drive off. Jamie 
           turns to his men, fuming. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Find me Amber Johnson.

                                 PAM
                        Why?

                                 JAMIE
                        Because, Pam, she has my FUCKING bird!

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - CICELY’S ROOM - 
           EVENING

           Amber (as Doris) watches the news on TV. 

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        The search continues for the Golden Bird 
                        thief, Amber Johnson. A warrant has been 
                        issued for her arrest...  

           Cicely ENTERS. She sees what Amber is watching.

                                 CICELY
                        It’s 6:30, you mind turning that noise 
                        off? 

           Amber cuts off the TV. An uneasy beat. 

                                 AMBER
                        Amber Johnson. She’s your granddaughter?

           Cicely doesn’t answer. She walks over to her side of the 
           room where Amber’s shirt lays at the foot of her bed.  

                                 CICELY
                        Is this yours?

           Amber rushes to grab it. 

                                 AMBER
                        How’d that get there?

           Cicely turns off the light and kneels to do her prayers.  
           Amber is left sitting there in the dark. 

           Off this moment, we move through a SERIES OF SHOTS 
           establishing Amber’s new normal --

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - CICELY'S ROOM - EARLY 
           MORNING

           Amber sleeps when sunlight hits her face. She wakes up, 
           groggy, to see Cicely up and dressed. 

                                 CICELY

           Amber rolls over, covering her head with her pillow.

           Amber watches SENIORS dutifully take their pills. 

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - ACTIVITY ROOM - DAY

           SENIOR RESIDENTS play quiet board games. Amber dozes off. 
           It’s all so painfully dull.

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - TV ROOM - DAY

           Marty oversees. Amber and the SENIORS watch Cocoon. She 
           notices several are asleep. She can’t stand it here.

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           It’s late. The showers are empty. We SEE a prosthetic 
           body suit, a leathery face, and a wig on a bench.

           Then we FIND Amber, sans disguise and in a towel. She’s 
           on the burner phone.

                        We’ve watched Cocoon four times! Four 
                        fucking times! I’ve only been here for 
                        two days. I’m gonna find Ron Howard and 
                        kick his ass.

                        It can’t be that bad.

                                 AMBER
                        Did you not just hear me?

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NELL'S ROOM - INTERCUT

           Nell is on the phone. Amber continues ranting:

                                 AMBER
                        It’s worse. My Grandmother sucks. She’s 
                        so mean. And not the fun mean like ya 
                        sassy grandma. But mean like I wanna 
                        fight her. 

                                 NELL
                        Have you tried talking to her?

                                 AMBER
                        Oh talking? Great idea, Nell. Why didn’t 
                        I think of that?
                                (then)
                        Yeah, I tried talking. She shuts me down. 
                        I can’t believe I forgot she was like 
                        this. 

                                 NELL
                        You’re not giving her a chance.

                                 AMBER
                        You’re young so you don’t get it, but 
                        people are fucking disappointing. That’s 
                        just a fact of life. 
                                (then)
                        I have to get out of here.

                        The cops are still looking for you.

                        Good. Let them find me. In fact, come get 
                        this suit. I’m turning myself in. I’d

                        This is your hero’s journey. It’s hard, 
                        but you just gotta get through it. Plus 
                        if you leave now, you’ll be doing exactly 
                        what your grandma did to you.

           Amber puts the phone down and lets out a silent scream. 
           Then she takes a calming breath. Into the phone:

                                 AMBER
                        I have to go. 

           She hangs up. 

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - DAY

           Amber (as Doris) strolls into the main lobby to find a 
           swarm of LAPD OFFICERS waiting. She panics. Senior 
           residents gossip within earshot.

                                 SENIOR RESIDENT 1
                        What do you think she knows?

                        Maybe she helped her escape.

           Amber sidles up to them.

                                 AMBER
                        What’s going on? Somebody die?

                        No, that was yesterday.

                        She’s aiding and abetting a fugitive. Her 
                        niece came by last week. She’s wanted for 
                        murder.

                        It wasn’t murder. She stole some billion

                        Where is Cicely now?

                        Honestly, this is the most exciting thing 
                        that’s happened since our syphilis 
                        outbreak.

           The gossiping residents move along. Amber hides her face 
           from the cops as she races down the hallway.

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Amber inches close to the TV room. There’s a window on 
           the door, so she can see inside.

           INSIDE. Cicely sits across from Detective Spencer.

           Detective Spencer glances towards the door. Amber ducks 
           down and out of sight. She has to know what’s being said. 

           Amber looks around. The room next door is labelled: 
           OUTDOOR SPORTS EQUIPMENT. Amber tries the handle. It’s 
           unlocked. Amber ENTERS.

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - OUTDOOR SPORTS 
           EQUIPMENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Old camping and exercise equipment lay around. A stack of 
           rolled up inflatable life rafts are in a corner. 

           Amber sees an AIR VENT on the wall. It’s high up. She 
           arranges several boxes into a small tower. Then hoists 
           herself up. Craning her neck, she can hear. 

                                 DETECTIVE SPENCER (O.S.)
                        Is this her signature on the visitation

                        If you say it is, then I guess it is.

           As Amber listens, we MOVE through the vent, landing in --

                        Since she was a little girl. 

           Detective Spencer regards Cicely, who maintains her 
           composure.

           ON AMBER. 

           Amber leans in closer. The box tower shakes. She grips 
           the wall.

           BACK TO.

           Cicely composes herself. Then:

                        I let you say yours now you let me say 
                        mine. I saw the news. I know what you say 
                        my granddaughter did. But I can’t help 
                        you. I don’t know anything. Even if I 
                        did, that’s my family and I wouldn’t help 
                        you.

           Cicely sits back, politely defiant. Detective Spencer 
           considers this. She nods towards the officers. 

           ON AMBER. 

           Amber beams, proud. She throws her hands up.

                                 AMBER
                        Fuck yeah, Grandma!

           Detective Spencer and the officers pass the equipment 
           room. They stop, hearing the crash. After a second, they 
           continue on.

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - CICELY'S ROOM - 
           EVENING

           Cicely is up reading her Bible when Amber ENTERS. She 
           goes to her bed, but can’t stop smiling at Cicely. 

                                 CICELY
                                (suspicious)
                        What’s got you so tickled?

                                 AMBER
                        Nothing.

                                 CICELY
                        Mhmm.

                                 AMBER
                        It’s 6:30.

           Amber nods to the light. Cicely rolls her eyes, slightly 
           amused. She puts her Bible away and turns the light off. 
           They sit in the dark for a beat.

                                 CICELY
                        I can still hear you smiling.

                                 AMBER
                        Goodnight, Cicely.

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - CAFETERIA - DAY

           Amber (as Doris), in a blue sweater, scans the room 
           carrying a tray of food. 

           She spots a seat next to Florence (from earlier with the 
           pudding) who’s sitting with several sleepy, wheelchair 
           bound 90 year olds.

                                 AMBER

                        I know. I’ve seen you around. I love your 
                        jumpsuits. Wish I could pull off velvet.

                        You’re welcome to borrow it. You can wear

                        forsaken place where we all just sit and 
                        wait to die.  

           A beat. Florence bursts out laughing. Amber smiles.

                                 FLORENCE
                        I know it takes some getting used to. 
                        But, it’s not so bad around here once you 
                        know where you fit.

                                 AMBER
                        Fit?

                                 FLORENCE
                        Yeah, like your friends. In a place like 
                        this, you can’t get through it without 
                        your friends.

           Florence points to BETTY LAURENTS (70s, vivacious, think 
           Jane Fonda) sits with a group of chatty dolled up women.

                                 FLORENCE (CONT’D)
                        Those ladies with the lip stick and the 
                        eye shadow. They’re the --

                        I call them The Laurents. After Betty, 
                        the Marilyn Monroe bottle blonde, she’s 
                        Betty Laurents. She’s this hoity toity 
                        actress. She was in a revival of Cats on

                                 FLORENCE
                        And those guys.

           Florence gestures toward HARRY FOY (70s, a charming 
           Vietnam vet). He’s surrounded by some dashing older 
           gentlemen. A few horny dogs in the mix eye The Laurents.

                                 FLORENCE (CONT’D)
                        Those fellas are all widows. And very 
                        handsome. Especially the gentleman in 
                        fatigues. That’s Harry Foy. He fought in 
                        Vietnam. Don’t mention the word ‘war’ 
                        around him though.

                                 AMBER
                        A lot of trauma?

                                 FLORENCE
                        That and once he hears it, he won’t shut 
                        up about it.

           Amber chuckles. Then notices Cicely, a few tables over, 
           eating alone. 

                                 AMBER
                        What about her?

                                 FLORENCE
                        Cicely Johnson? I don’t know much about 
                        her. She mostly keeps to herself. 
                                (then)
                        Now if you don’t mind, that was a lot of 
                        gabbing. My lasagna is getting cold.

           Florence resumes eating her food. Amber watches Cicely. 
           She sees Harry approach.

           ON CICELY AND HARRY.

                                 HARRY
                        Hi Cicely.

           Seeing Harry, Cicely brightens. 

                                 CICELY
                        Hey Harry. 

                                 HARRY
                        Heard the law visited you yesterday. Did 
                        they arrest you for being too good 
                        looking?

           Cicely giggles. Harry smiles. Amber watches this 
           exchange, tickled. They’re flirting?

           Then Betty crosses over to them. She drapes her arms 
           territorially over Harry.

                        I’m stuffed. Maybe Cicely would like 
                        some.

           Betty looks at Cicely, surprised by her presence.

                                 BETTY
                        Oh, I didn’t notice you sitting there.

                                 CICELY
                        I’ve sat at the same table for three 
                        meals a day, everyday for years, Betty. 

                                 BETTY
                                (sweetly)
                        Well good for you. 

           Betty links arms with Harry as she leads him away. 

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        I’m dying to try my new swimsuit for 
                        class today. I can’t decide between 
                        bikini or g-string...

           Cicely watches them go. Her smile fades. She returns to 
           her food. Amber frowns, feeling sorry for her. She glares 
           at Betty. Then turns to Florence.

                                 AMBER
                        There’s a swim class?

                                 FLORENCE
                        Every Monday. And it’s mandatory. Marty’s 
                        a real stickler... you don’t want to get 
                        on his bad side. 

           Amber’s face falls. Florence misreads her terrified 
           expression.

                                 FLORENCE (CONT’D)
                        I know. Wearing a swim suit in public is 
                        my nightmare. Never quite got rid of my 
                        baby weight. I dreaded going to the 
                        beach. And lord knows my late husband 
                        didn’t make it any easier on me. But at a 
                        certain point you just gotta say, ‘screw 
                        it,’ right? What’s cellulite and a few 
                        hundred wrinkles? We all have it. 

           Florence giggles. But Amber is now panicking. She gathers 
           her tray and leaves the table.

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - CICELY’S ROOM - DAY

           Amber rushes in. She digs through her closet.

                        Swim suit. Did I even pack a swim suit?

           She grabs her burner phone and texts Nell.

           Nell text’s back. Text: I don’t know, can you? ;)

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - HALLWAY - DAY

           Amber (not in a swim suit) nervously walks to the pool. 
           She rounds a corner passing the Outdoor Sports Equipment 
           room. She gets an idea. 

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - POOL - DAY

           Marty leads the seniors in pool aerobics. We see Cicely, 
           Harry, Betty and Florence. 

           Amber ENTERS. She’s still wearing her normal clothes, but 
           she’s carrying something under her arms.

           The seniors and Marty stop what they’re doing and turn. 
           Amber casually moves to the edge of the pool. 

           She unfurls a life raft and begins pumping. Slowly and 
           patiently. The raft grows. The seniors watch Amber in 
           disbelief.

           Amber gets the giant life raft to size. She carefully 
           places it into the pool. Then awkwardly climbs inside.

           Using her hands, Amber paddles toward the group of 
           seniors. The boat smacks a few people in the head.

                                 AMBER
                        Excuse me. So sorry. Excuse me. Thanks.

           Marty stares at Amber as if she’s lost her mind. 

                                 MARTY
                        Go.

                                 MARTY
                        Now!

           The seniors, including Betty, Harry and Florence are 
           openly laughing now. Cicely tries to stifle a laugh. 

                                 AMBER
                        Okay. Well you gotta give me a minute to 
                        get this thing to -- 

           Amber tries to paddle, but struggles. Then she lays flat 
           on the raft and body surfs to the edge of the pool. She 
           accidentally knocks Betty in the face. 

                                 BETTY
                        Oww.

                        Lady, you saw me coming. 

           Cicely now looses it, laughing hysterically.

           Happy not to be in swim class, Amber strolls down the 
           hall when she hears:

                        Yes, it’s Serenaa Williams.

           Amber turns to see Victor with a bouquet of roses talking 
           to a NURSE who is searching through files. He’s gorgeous. 

                                 NURSE
                        Sorry, I’m new here. I don’t see that

                        Hey... you.

                                 VICTOR
                        Hi. I’m sorry have we met?

                                 AMBER
                        No. I’m Doris Layne. I believe you’re my 
                        benefactor.

                                 VICTOR
                        You’re the resident in my mother’s old 
                        room.

           Victor gives Amber a big hug. She wasn’t expecting that, 
           but she leans into him, inhaling his scent. 

                                 AMBER
                        Yes, hold me.

           They separate. 

                                 VICTOR
                        It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Victor 
                        Green. My mother would be so thrilled.

                                 AMBER

                        Excuse me?

                                 AMBER
                                (quickly, then re: flowers)
                        You’re here to see Dr. Williams?

                                 VICTOR
                        Uh, yes. Last time I was here she ran off 
                        pretty quickly. I wanted to make sure she 
                        was okay. She seemed nice, easy to talk 
                        to. And well, my mother taught me never 
                        to meet a lady empty handed. But I guess 
                        she’s not here. 
                                (then)
                        Sorry, I’m rambling. Why don’t you take 
                        these. 

           Victor hands the flowers to Amber. Victor turns to go. 
           Amber can’t help herself. She blurts out:

                                 AMBER
                        She’s working tomorrow.

           Victor turns back around.

                                 VICTOR
                        Okay. I’ll stop by. Thank you.

           A chipper Victor walks off. Amber watches him go. A 
           FEMALE RESIDENT also watching Victor leave, whistles. 

                                 FEMALE RESIDENT
                        Now that’s an ass. 

                                 AMBER
                        Back off, Ethel. That tenderoni’s mine. 

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Heading back to her room, Amber stumbles on Marty and 
           Florence. He’s holding her wrist, tightly. Florence looks 
           terrified. 

                                 MARTY
                        I’m not gonna repeat myself.

           Marty spots Amber. He lets go of Florence. She massages 
           her bruised wrist as she scurries past a concerned Amber.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)

                                 MARTY
                        That stunt you pulled today isn’t gonna 
                        fly here. You understand? We have rules. 
                        You break them, I enforce them. 
                                (then)
                        Now where are you supposed to be?

                        Get there.

           Marty walks off. Amber flips him the bird.

                        That white man blinks every time he 
                        presses the buzzer. I think he’s 
                        cheating.

                                 AMBER
                        Can’t trust a colonizer.

           Cicely smiles. There’s a thawing between them. 

                                 CICELY
                        That’s a nice sweater. 

                                 AMBER
                        Is that a compliment? Is Cicely Johnson 
                        actually warming up to me? 

                                 CICELY
                        What you did at the pool today was 
                        something else. Usually Marty forces us 
                        to do the breast stroke, the back stroke, 
                        all the strokes, but you got him so 
                        turned around that after you left, he 
                        just let us be. 

                                 AMBER
                        Glad I could be of service. 

           A beat. Amber looks at the framed picture of her and 
           Savannah. 

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Is that your family?

           Cicely looks at the picture. She smiles, sad. 

                                 CICELY
                        My beautiful girls. That’s my daughter, 
                        Savannah. And my grandbaby, Amber.

                                (sighs)
                        I haven’t seen her in many years, but she 
                        has a good heart. The lord will work it 
                        out...

           It’s too much to bare. Amber changes the subject. 

                                 AMBER
                        So Harry. He’s a cutie and a little 
                        flirt. I saw the way he was looking at 
                        you at lunch.

                        Harry has cataracts. He looks at everyone 
                        like that. 

           Amber laughs. Cicely laughs too. 

                                 CICELY (CONT’D)
                        Harry’s my friend. Besides Betty has her 
                        claws in him. He’s not interested in me.

                                 AMBER
                        But you’re interested in him.

                                 CICELY
                        I’m not going to make the first move.

                                 AMBER
                        Why the hell not? 

                                 CICELY
                        Cause if a man wants you, he’ll make it 
                        known. 

                                 AMBER
                        That’s not always true. You ever heard of 
                        “ghosting?”

                                 CICELY

                                 AMBER
                        Umm, yeah it’s an evil spirit that forces 
                        men to stop texting you back.

                                 CICELY
                        Young people kill me with that texting 
                        mess. It’s a phone. Why not just call?

                                 AMBER
                        The only people who actually wanna talk 
                        on the phone are the census bureau, 
                        collections, and people asking for 
                        donations to the local fire department. 

                                 CICELY
                        I miss the days when folks took their 
                        time. 

           Amber goes to turn off the light.

                                 AMBER
                        If you know what you want, why wait? 

                                 CICELY
                        Cause it’s romantic. When I was young, 
                        men would ask a lady out. You’d go 
                        dancing. Talk all night.

                        always used to taking things slow.

           Amber now inches toward the light.

                        get two teams up to give it a try.

           Then out of nowhere Betty SINGS, hitting a high-note 
           that’s so powerful, Susan CLAPS.

                        heard, I was on Broadway. Cats, Chicago, 
                        an understudy in West Side Story.

                        Any challengers?

           No one even bothers stepping forward. They’re all scared. 
           Betty winks at Harry. Amber sticks her finger in her 
           mouth, gagging. She turns to Cicely who noticed the wink 
           from Betty to Harry and looks sad. Amber gets an idea. 

                                 AMBER
                        You have to challenge her.

                        That’s Betty’s thing. I don’t want to 
                        embarrass myself.

                        Oh Doris, stop. 

           Amber checks the clock. It’s 3:30pm. Thirty minutes until 
           she has to meet Victor as Dr. Serenaa Williams. 

           But... she stands and raises Cicely’s hand anyway.

                        We’ll go. And we’re also singing “One

                        Anika and J-hud when she was thick.

           Harry CHEERS. Cicely, mortified, stands.

           Cicely and Amber walk to the front of the room. Betty and 
           her girls glare. It’s on. Kemi hands everyone a mic.

           The music comes on --

           Cicely is too shy to sing. Amber nudges her. 

                                 BETTY
                                (sings)
                        I have no doubt that I could love you, 
                        forever. The only trouble is, you really 
                        don't have the time.

           The crowd CHEERS. Amber sees she’s losing them.

                                 AMBER / BETTY

                        One night only. Let's not pretend to 
                        care.

           Cicely starts to back away, embarrassed. Harry stands 
           claps off beat, but into it. He smiles at Cicely. She 
           smiles back. Then steps forward as the beat drops and --

                                 CICELY
                                (singing loud as fuck)
                        One night only, one night only. Come on, 
                        big baby, come on. One night only. We 
                        only have 'til dawn.

           Betty, Amber, and everyone stares at Cicely, shocked. 

           The SENIORS stand and CHEER. Cicely and Amber are the 
           clear winners. Everyone dances. It’s joyous. 

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - ACTIVITY ROOM - LATER

           The residents congratulate Cicely and Amber on their win. 
           Amber anxiously keeps an eye on the clock. It’s 3:50pm. 

                                 AMBER
                                (to Cicely)
                        I’m feeling a little sick. I need to go 
                        back to the room. Can you cover for me?

           Before Cicely can respond, Betty approaches.

                                 BETTY
                        Cicely Johnson, where have you been 
                        hiding those pipes?

                                 CICELY
                                (stunned)
                        Oh, I’ve --

           Amber steps in to protect her.

                        here. Your fan club is over there.

           Betty stares, confused. Cicely places a hand on Amber.

                                 CICELY
                        Doris, it’s fine. 
                                (to Betty)
                        She’s only trying to defend me.

                                 BETTY
                        Defend you. From who? Me?

                                 CICELY
                        It’s because of Harry. But I will not 
                        disrespect a woman over some man. 

           A beat. Then Betty lets out a big laugh. 

                                 BETTY
                        You think I want Harry?

                                 AMBER / CICELY
                        Yeah, bitch. / You don’t?

                                 BETTY
                        No. God no. Harry’s just the only man in 
                        this place who doesn’t fall asleep every 
                        five minutes. He’s entertaining.  

                                 CICELY
                        Oh I thought you two were an item. I feel 
                        like such a fool.

                                 BETTY
                        Don’t. I did sleep with Harry. When I 
                        first moved in. Huge cock.  

           Cicely and Amber stare, mouths open. Then Cicely laughs. 
           Amber slinks out the door, letting the two women chat. 

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - CICELY’S ROOM - DAY

           Amber strips off her disguise, stuffs it deep in the back 
           of the closet. 

           She opens a suitcase revealing an array of wigs, 
           prosthetics and the white Doctor coat. She sees a box of 
           TAMPONS. Touches her stomach. She has cramps. She grabs 
           the box.

           Amber emerges as Dr. Serenaa Williams. She’s 
           unrecognizable in a curly wig, glasses and false nose.

           Amber spots Victor enter with  a pie. She grabs a folder. 
           Then walks over and ‘accidentally’ BUMPS into him. Her 
           folder falls along with his pie.

           *Note: every time Amber is Dr. Serenaa Williams, she  
           speaks with a British Accent. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Oh, I’m so sorry. Are you okay?

                        I’m the clumsy one. 

           Victor immediately recognizes her voice. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Dr. Williams? It’s me, Victor. Victor 
                        Green. We met a couple days ago in Mrs. 
                        Johnson’s room.

                                 AMBER
                        The over-sharer. I remember. What are you 
                        doing here?

                                 VICTOR
                        I actually came to see you. Mrs. Layne 
                        told me you were working today. I brought 
                        pie.

           They look at the pie, now smashed. Then laugh.

           A RESIDENT with a walker comes close to Amber, but she 
           doesn’t notice him. Too busy lost in Victor’s smile. 

                                 VICTOR (CONT’D)
                        I think someone wants your attention. 

                                 AMBER
                        You already have it.

                                 VICTOR
                        Not me. Him.

           Amber finally sees the resident. She jumps, startled.

                        pain in my leg is too much. Can you give

                        Please. I really want my walk.

                                 VICTOR
                        He sounds pretty bad. Why don’t I let you 
                        take care of him. 

           Amber looks around, desperate. She spots a wheelchair. 

                                 AMBER
                        Or we can take this gentleman on his walk 
                        now. How about that?

           Amber grabs the wheelchair. The old man sits.

                        This is great!

           They laugh. It trails off as Cicely spots Harry.

                        But she is strange.

           Cicely walks over to Harry. Betty watches her, smiling,

           ON CICELY AND HARRY.

                        Well if it isn’t Patti LaBelle.

           Cicely takes a bow. Then:

                        Harry, would you like to get a coffee

                        watching Do The Right Thing and Boys In

                        And I was this close to fancying you.

                        Oh I missed my chance?

                                 AMBER
                        Maybe.

           A smile between them. A spark.

                                 VICTOR
                        So what brought you here? From the UK. 

                                 AMBER
                        I was on the run from the law. 

           Victor laughs.

                        No, my life was falling apart. Figured I 
                        could use a change. 

           Victor smiles. Then he stops, takes out a bottle of 
           water. Open it, he’s about to drink --

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        He’s really out cold. Should we check for 
                        a pulse? 

           Victor laughs, spilling the water all over his chest. His 
           shirt sticks to his sculpted body. Amber drools.

           Amber pats his chest, “helping” him dry. She’s very 
           close. Inches from his face. Victor backs away.

                                 VICTOR

           Cicely and Harry BURST into the bedroom making out. 

                                 HARRY
                        I wasn’t expecting this at all.

                                 CICELY
                        Harry, I’m 81 years old. A really smart 
                        person told me if you know what you want, 
                        why wait? I know what I want and I don’t 
                        want to wait. 

           They resume kissing when Cicely backs Harry into her 
           closet. Something falls. Amber’s box of TAMPONS. Harry 
           and Cicley stop kissing. Harry picks up the box.

                                 HARRY
                        Is this yours?

                        I haven’t needed one of these since the

           Cicely takes the tampons from Harry. 

                                 CICELY
                        Probably belongs to one of the nurses. 

           Doubt settles on Cicely’s face. 

           EXT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - YARD - EVENING

           Victor and Amber sit on a bench beside the sleeping old 
           man in the wheelchair.

                                 VICTOR
                        I realized that most of the problems with 
                        my ex-wife stemmed from the fact that we 
                        didn’t really know each other. The next 
                        woman I sleep with, I want to really know 
                        her.

                                 AMBER
                                (shit)
                        Right. Yeah. That sounds swell.  

                                 VICTOR
                        You’re something else. Every time I tell 
                        a woman that I’m celibate she either 
                        calls me gay or tries to have sex with 
                        me. 

                                 AMBER

                                 VICTOR
                        But it does get hard.

                                 AMBER
                        So hard. 

           Victor and Amber are close. Tempting each other. Their 
           lips nearly touch. Amber backs away this time. 

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Let’s take it slow. Old school. I heard 
                        that’s romantic. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Old school. Okay. 

           Victor takes out a piece of paper and a pen. He writes 
           something down. Hands it to Amber. 

                                 VICTOR (CONT’D)
                        That’s my number. My name is Victor 
                        Green. I come with a lot of baggage. I

           Amber (still as Dr. Serenaa Williams) strolls down the 
           hall day-dreaming about Victor. Then she spots Marty. 

           She ducks into a corner. Marty walks up to the corner 
           then stops. He looks around before lighting a cigarette. 
           He blows the smoke. Amber is only a few inches away. She 
           holds her breath. After a moment, Marty continues on. 
           Amber lets out a small cough.

           A wide-eyed Cicely staring aghast at the Doris body suit

           Amber slowly takes off the lab coat, then her fake 
           eyebrows, nose, teeth, glasses, and wig. 

           Cicely stares, mouth open, stunned.

           Cicely goes to her dresser. She pulls out her Bible. 
           Opens it. Inside the pages are pictures of Amber, notes

                        I missed you too, Grandma.
                                (then)
                        You can’t tell anyone about me.  

                                 CICELY
                        Of course not. But can’t we fight this? 
                        You said you didn’t steal that Gold Bird. 
                        That crazy Jamie fella did. He’s the one 
                        who should be going to jail. 

                                 AMBER
                        I know Jamie. He’d kill me, kill you and 
                        kill everyone before that happens.

                                 CICELY
                        But we need to figure this out. You gotta 
                        clear your name so you can get your life 
                        back. You can’t do this Mrs. Doubtfire 
                        thing forever.  

           Amber hesitates. 

                                 AMBER
                        Until the cops and Jamie stop looking for 
                        me, I need to keep my cover. Promise, 
                        Grandma, promise this stays between us. 

                                 CICELY
                        Okay, I promise. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - AMBER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The place is a mess. Police tape is up. Jamie, Pam and 
           two Henchmen dig through Amber’s scattered things.

                                 HENCHMAN 1
                        I found a receipt. China Wok Palace.

                                 HENCHMAN 2
                        Here’s something. Oh it’s a receipt for 
                        Bamboo Chinese.

                                 HENCHMAN 3
                        Got a receipt too. Le Oriental King.
            "Assisted Living"

           Pam opens a closet, a mountain of CHINESE FOOD boxes fall 
           on her. 

                                 HENCHMAN 1
                        Shit if we don’t kill Amber, the MSG 
                        will. 

           Pam throws the boxes off, pissed.

                                 PAM
                        This is fucking stupid. There’s nothing 
                        here. Amber obviously took off. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Keep looking. We just need something to 
                        point us in her direction. Anything.

           Then the front door SWINGS open, in walks -- 

           Topher (Amber’s neighbor). He freeze when he sees Jamie 
           and his crew draw their guns on him. Topher, scared 
           shitless, drops to his knees. Hands up. 

                                 TOPHER
                        I knew this was a bad idea. My friends 
                        dared me to do this. Am I under arrest?

           Jamie looks to Pam and smiles.  They found something.

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - KITCHEN - DAY

           Amber (as Doris) discretely talks on the phone as she 
           searches for a place to hide. 

                                 AMBER
                        I didn’t tell her. She found out.

           INT. TYSON HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - INTERCUT

           Nell is on her burner phone as she eats her lunch by 
           herself. 

                                 NELL
                        But what does it mean? Do you have to 
                        leave now? Is your cover blown?

                                 AMBER
                        No. She’s my Grandma. This isn’t Narcos.

                        Shouldn’t you be at recess? Why’d you 
                        call? Did something happen to the bird? 

           Nell looks around the empty room.

                                 AMBER
                        Then what? I’m busy. It’s Monday. Which 
                        means swim class. Which means I gotta 
                        find someplace to be besides the pool.

                                 NELL
                        Okay, guess I’ll let you go then.

                        And don’t forget my showcase is on 
                        Wednesday at three.

           Amber spots a pantry. BINGO. Perfect spot to hide. 

                                 AMBER
                        Yea. Wednesday. Got it. I’ll even set a 
                        reminder. 

           Amber hangs up. Nell puts the phone away. She goes back 
           to eating her lunch alone.  

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - PANTRY - CONTINUOUS

           Amber ENTERS to find Florence, in her bathing suit, on 
           the floor with an open can of Pringles. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        Swim Class?

                                 AMBER
                        Yup.

                                 FLORENCE
                        Pringle?

                                 AMBER
                        Sure.

           Amber takes the can as she sits. Then she notices bruises 
           up and down Florence’s arm. Florence clocks what Amber’s 
           looking at. She covers her arm.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Did Marty do this to you?

           A beat. Florence says nothing. But Amber knows.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        That’s why you’re hiding. And the other 
                        night when I saw you two in hallway --

                        All my years of practice with my late 
                        husband, I still don’t know how to cover 
                        these up. 
                                (then)
                        This is my fourth assisted living 
                        facility in two years. My children are 
                        tired of dealing with me. I can’t 
                        complain. They’ll think it’s my fault.

           After a silent beat, Amber tosses the Pringles can and 
           charges out of the pantry. 

                                 FLORENCE (CONT’D)
                        Doris, Doris, where are you going?

                                 AMBER
                        Marty can’t get away with this. Guys like 
                        him can’t keep getting away with this.

           Florence chases after her.

                                 FLORENCE
                        Doris. Wait.

           Amber barrels down the hall. Harry, Cicely and Betty are 
           up ahead, in their swim clothes. They see Amber. Florence 
           runs behind her. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        Stop Doris. 

                                 CICELY
                        What’s going on?

                                 FLORENCE
                        She’s going to kill Marty.

           Harry, Cicely and Betty grab Amber. She fights them off.

                                 AMBER
                        Let go of me. 

           They wrestle her into an empty room. Florence follows.

                        Tell us what?

           Florence shrinks back. She can’t say it. 

                                 AMBER
                        Marty’s been hurting her. Look at her 
                        arm. That son of a bitch did that to her. 

           Harry, Cicely and Betty look at Florence. They’re 
           sympathetic, but not surprised.

                        out the morning nurse was taking his

                        In. 

           Amber frowns. She carefully enters the pool. Water seeps 
           into her saran wrap and clothes. This was a bad idea.

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - TV ROOM - DAY

           Our seniors are present, including Marty and Susan. Marty 
           is about to put Cocoon into the DVD player.

                                 MARTY
                        Who’s ready for Ron Howard’s masterpiece?

           Amber raises her hand. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Doris is.

                                 AMBER
                        Actually I have a question. Why does 
                        Marty get to decide the movie? 

                                 MARTY
                        Because there are twenty of you and this 
                        way there’s no drama about fairness.

                                 AMBER
                        I say we put it to a vote. 

                                 MARTY
                        No voting. I’ve already decided.

                                 SUSAN
                        Now, now. Let’s not dismiss a valid 
                        concern from one of our fine residents. 
                        I, personally, like the voting process. 
                        It’s very democratic.

                        All in favor of Cocoon?

           A few people raise their hands.

                        Now all in favor of Magic Mike?

           Everyone shoots their hands up. Amber grins. Marty looks 
           like he could kill her. Cicely looks at Amber, worried.

           Susan is almost out the door when Cicely stops her.

                        Mrs. Johnson, it’s late. Is everything

                        No. It’s my roommate, Doris. There’s 
                        something you need to know about her --

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Amber (as Doris) walks out of the bathroom. She rounds 
           the corner and runs right into --

           Marty smoking a cigarette. He stubs it out. 

                                 AMBER
                                (startled, to herself)

                                (then)
                        Marty, you scared me half to death.

                        Why are you awake? 

                                 AMBER
                        I had to use the bathroom.

                                 MARTY
                        There’s one in your room.

                                 AMBER

                        What the fuck is the matter with you?

                                 AMBER
                        Excuse me?  I am twice your age. You 
                        can’t talk to me like that.

                                 MARTY
                        You think I give a shit how old you are?

           Marty comes dangerously close to Amber. She backs away. 
           They are the only two in this empty hall. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Ever since you got here, you’ve been a 
                        pain in my ass. You don’t listen, you 
                        don’t do what you’re told, you don’t show 
                        me any goddamn respect.

           Marty SHOVES Amber against a wall. She falls. Marty 
           stands over her. He thinks he’s won. 

           Then: Amber stands and CLOCKS HIM ACROSS THE FACE. 

                                 AMBER
                                (Amber’s regular voice)
                        You got me all the way fucked up. I’m not 
                        Florence. And I ain’t scared of no 
                        Pathetic. Bitch. Made. Motherfuckah. 

           Marty’s shocked. He LUNGES at Amber when --

                                 SUSAN (O.S.)
                        Marty, what is the meaning of this?

           They turn to see Cicely and Susan. Amber dramatically 
           doubles over, crying.

                                 AMBER
                                (Doris voice)
                        No, please. No more Marty. No more. 

           Marty goes full deer in the headlight.

                                 MARTY
                        Susan -- Susan, it’s not what you think.

                                 SUSAN

                        do not condone this behavior. We’ll have 
                        this all sorted by morning. 

           Amber nods, still crying. Marty follows Susan off. Cicely 
           turns to Amber, grinning. They high-five.

                                (pointing to Cicely)
                        Then this badass over here turns the

           She makes a deer in headlights face. They all laugh.

                        I hope he burns in hell.

           The group reacts, surprised.

                        Well don’t hold back, Darling. Let it all

           The nurse looks confused. She pulls up files.

           STUDENTS stand with their showcase projects. Nell

           alien, human, and monster. 

           A STAGE HAND (17, rocking a headset proudly) comes by.

           stand over him. Pam is nearby. Nell SCREAMS and runs to

                        Sh, sh, sh. 

           She fights him off, but he’s too strong. He pins her 
           against the wall. He covers her mouth.

                        I just want to talk. If I let go, will

           Jamie lightly taps Nell on the nose with a “Boop.” He 
           then gestures for his men to leave.

                        I took a Lyft.

                                 JAMIE
                        Then take a Lyft back. 

           Jamie drives off, leaving Pam, pissed.

           Nell retrieves the Golden Bird from a hidden compartment 
           in her ceiling. She stuffs it in a brown paper bag and 
           then in her red backpack.

           She looks at her burner phone. No word from Amber. 
           Frustrated, Nell tosses the phone on her bed.

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Cicely and Harry walk off as Amber heads to her room. 

                                 CICELY
                        Night, Doris. Don’t wait up.

                                 AMBER
                        Okay, lovebirds. Make sure you wrap it 
                        up. I know what goes down around here.

           Cicely and Harry giggle as they go. Amber ENTERS --

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - CICELY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           She takes out her burner phone and the paper with 
           Victor’s number on it. She dials. 

           INT. VICTOR’S HOUSE - INTERCUT

           Victor pores over legal briefs. His cell phone RINGS. He 
           doesn’t recognize the number. He picks up.

                                 VICTOR
                        Hello?

                                 AMBER
                        You sound exhausted. Let me guess, you’re 
                        at home, drinking some expensive bottle 
                        of red. Or whiskey. You seem like a 
                        whiskey guy. And you’re watching Clueless 
                        on Amazon Prime. Am I close?

                        Okay, then. You’re at home, wanking off 
                        to some quality ebony porn. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Nope. 

                                 AMBER
                        Okay, well I’m all out of guesses then.  
                        But I’m hope your day was better than 
                        mine. I found out one of my nurses was 
                        stuffing a patient’s Percocet in her 
                        wallet. Can you believe that? 

           Victor is getting agitated. He knows she’s lying.  

                                 VICTOR
                        I came to Meadow Lane today. To see you.

                                 AMBER
                        Oh. You did? Why didn’t you say that? 
                        When? When did you come by? 

                                 VICTOR
                        Look, I don’t know what’s going on. But 
                        no one at Meadow Lane has ever heard of a 
                        Dr. Serenaa Williams. Except maybe that 
                        lady Doris. 

                                 AMBER
                        Victor --

                                 VICTOR
                        I’ve been honest with you, so whatever 
                        game you’re trying to play, I’m not 
                        interested. 

                                 AMBER
                        Victor, I can explain.

                                 VICTOR
                        Okay. Go ahead.

           Amber wasn’t expecting him to let her explain. She 
           doesn’t know what to say. A painful beat. 

                                 VICTOR (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. I figured as much.

           Victor hangs up. Amber stares at the phone, crushed. 

           Then she sees the reminder she set for Nell’s showcase. 
           Amber GROANS, realizing she missed it. She dials Nell.

           Nell is in bed. The burner phone RINGS. She sees it’s 
           Amber, hesitates then picks up. 

                                 NELL

                                 NELL
                        It was my senior showcase.

                        How’d it go?

                                 NELL
                        It sucked, but what do you care?

                                 AMBER
                        I care.

                                 NELL
                        No you don’t.

                        Jamie came to my house tonight. He hurt 
                        my dad and threatened to kill me if he 
                        found out I knew where you were. 

                                 AMBER
                        Fuck! Did you tell him anything?!

                                 NELL
                        No, I didn’t tell him anything because 
                        unlike you, I’m not a shitty person.
                                (then)
                        I thought maybe after I helped you, you’d 
                        start being nice to me. But you haven’t 
                        changed.

                                 AMBER

                        You lived down the hall from me for years 
                        and I never saw anyone go in and out of 
                        your apartment. Ever. When I asked you to 
                        hang out, you always said you had plans, 
                        but I knew you were lying. I figured you 
                        were lonely like me and maybe we could be

           Nell hangs up. Amber is devastated. 

           A beat. She looks around the room and begins packing. 

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - CICELY'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Cicely ENTERS to find Amber’s side of the room cleared. 
           She’s gone. Cicely panics.

           Cicely sneaks across the lawn. The main road is just up

           side of the road trying to get a signal on her burner 
           phone.

                        You were just gonna sneak off in the 
                        middle of the night without saying a 
                        thing?

                                 AMBER
                        I left you a note.

                        The cops are still looking for me. And 
                        I’ll probably end up getting you killed

           Amber puts her thumb up to hitchhike. Cicely swats her

                        I’m not letting you go. I did that once. 
                        I’m not doing it again.

                        can be Amber again.

                        Why? Why isn’t that an option?

                                 AMBER

                        Why not?

                                (blurts)
                        Because maybe I don’t want to be Amber 
                        anymore.

           Cicely stares at Amber at a loss. Amber tears up. 

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Why would I want to be Amber? She has 
                        nothing, except for a shitty apartment 
                        she can’t afford. She has no one. She 
                        fucks up every good thing in her life. 
                        All she does is let people down. Why 
                        would I want to be her?

           Cicely’s heart breaks. Amber turns and starts walking

           Cicely stops her.

                        You may not know this, but Amber is my 
                        favorite person in whole world. I was 
                        lost, I had given up on myself, but then 
                        Amber showed up and brought life back 
                        into me. She brought life back into that 
                        place. She saved Florence. She helped me 
                        find Harry --

                        That was all Doris.

                                 CICELY
                        Doris is not real. And neither is this 
                        Serenaa person. But Amber is real. And 
                        she is worth fighting for. She is worth 
                        saving. 
                                (then)
                        I failed your mother. That’s the truth. I 
                        failed Savannah. And seeing her everyday 
                        was a reminder of my failure. Instead of 
                        trying to work through that, I let you 
                        both go. I gave up. I can’t let you give 
                        up. If not for you, then do it for me. I 
                        need you, Amber. 

           A beat. Amber slowly nods.

                        Thank God for Harry.

                        If he lasted any longer in bed, I would 
                        have been gone before you found out. 

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - ACTIVITY ROOM - DAY

           Our seniors are gathered. Cicely sits next to Amber (as 
           Doris). Susan addresses the room.

                                 SUSAN
                        Family weekend is upon us!

           Everyone CHEERS! Except Amber. She’s deep in thought.

                        We received a record number of RSVP’s 
                        from your loved ones. That’s so exciting.

                        We’re pulling out all the stops. We have 
                        rides for the grandkids, snow cones, 
                        carnival games --

                                 BETTY
                        Will there be a kissing booth? I’ll need 
                        a three-hour block. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Betty, for goodness sake.

                                 BETTY
                        You owe us after that Marty disaster. How 
                        are we supposed to enjoy family weekend? 
                        There’s so much residual trauma. Think of 
                        our mental health, Susan. 

           Susan shifts, uneasy. She clears her throat.

                                 SUSAN
                        Well, Betty, you bring up a very good 
                        point. Points I will certainly take under 
                        advisement --

                                 BETTY
                        Kissing. Booth.

                                (chipper smile)
                        Of course. So on to important news --

           Amber raises her hand.

                                 AMBER
                        I vote we take a field trip to Tyson High 
                        School today.

                                 SUSAN
                        What? Why? That kind of excursion 
                        requires months of planning. It’s too 
                        short of a notice.

                                 AMBER
                        But we have an in. Right Phil? 

           Amber turns to Grandpa Phil (the Tyson drama student’s 
           grandpa). Phil nods. 

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        See. Let’s put it to a vote. Democratic 
                        and all that like you said. All in favor 
                        of taking a trip to Tyson High today.

           Everyone shoots their hands up. Amber grins. Susan looks 
           around the room. Then she throws up her hands, giving up. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Okay, the people have spoken.

           EXT. TYSON HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           The nursing home van is parked in the lot. Meadow Lane  
           Assisted Living Facility is embossed on the side. 

           Our group of seniors walk in. Betty notices Florence is 
           bright red. 

                                 BETTY
                        Florence, what’s the matter with your 
                        face? 

                                 FLORENCE
                        Sorry. Stress hives. I never liked high 
                        school. 

           Betty hands her a makeup compact. 

                                 BETTY
                        Get it together, love. 

           ON CICELY AND AMBER.

                                 AMBER
                        Can you cover for me?

                                 CICELY
                        Yes, but be careful, Amber.

           INT. TYSON HIGH SCHOOL - DRAMA CLASS - DAY

           A spotlight is on a stage. MR. STEWARD (40s, the drama 
           teacher) performs the last scene in Romeo and Juliet. 

                                 MR. STEWARD
                        O true apothecary! Thy drugs are quick. 
                        Thus with a kiss, I die. 

           He lurches forward, clutching his chest, then falls 
           dramatically. Lights come on. 

           REVERSE ON AUDIENCE. We see our student volunteers Kemi, 
           Brandon and Aj and our group of seniors, sans Amber, 
           watch in abject horror. 

                                 FLORENCE

                                 MR. STEWARD
                        And that’s a Shakespearean death. Granted 
                        if I’d known our friends from Meadow Lane 
                        were coming, I would have prepared 
                        something a bit more... lively.

                        Alright, partner up. 

           Our seniors partner with students and begin practicing 
           their deaths. 

           ON HARRY AND AJ.

                                 HARRY
                        I don’t get it. 

                                 AJ
                        Dude, it’s fun. 

                                 HARRY
                        Don’t call me dude. 

                                 AJ
                        It’s pretend. It’s not like war or 
                        anything.

           Harry’s eyes darken. Like a trigger has gone off. He 
           looks intensely at AJ.

                                 HARRY
                        You wanna know about war, kid? Ever see a 
                        grown man bleed out after a grenade blows 
                        his guts wide open? The smell is the 
                        first thing that hits ya...

           Aj stares, terrified... 

           INT. TYSON HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Amber roams the halls. She looks through the doors of 
           classes in session. 

           INT. TYSON HIGH SCHOOL - STUDY HALL - DAY

           A packed class. A mounted TV streams the school 
           newsletter on a loop. Nell is at a computer. Her red bag 
           is beside her. 

           She looks up, stunned to see Amber’s face in the doorway. 
           Amber waves her over. Nell shakes her head, ‘no.’ Amber 
           beckons her. Nell shoos her away. Deflated, Amber goes.

           INT. TYSON HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Amber walks back to the drama class when two STUDENTS 
           exit a room labelled, “Tyson Morning Show Production 
           Office.” Amber gets an idea, then ENTERS. 

           INT. TYSON HIGH SCHOOL - STUDY HALL - DAY

           MS. WALTERS, the study hall teacher, (30s) is distracted 
           with her Hinge Dating profile. 

           The TV on the wall changes to -- Nell. Sitting in front 
           of the camera on her YouTube channel.

                                 NELL (ON SCREEN)
                        Hey guys. Welcome to my channel. So today 
                        I’m gonna do one of my favorite 
                        transformations. Who loves Game Of 
                        Thrones?

           Nell slowly looks up. Color drains from her face. She’s 
           mortified. Everyone is watching.

                                 STUDENT 1
                        Why’s this on the school station?  

                                 STUDENT 2
                        Nell that’s you?

           Students snicker. Nell could die. 

           ON THE TV SCREEN. In a time lapse video, Nell goes from 
           fresh faced 17-year old to the Game Of Thrones character, 
           Night King. It’s quite remarkable to see. The video ends. 

                                 STUDENT 3
                        Well damn. 

                                 STUDENT 4
                        That bitch is talented.

                                 STUDENT 5
                        Nell, you can really do all that?

           Everyone turns to Nell, who can barely breathe. She 
           slowly nods. ALL the students take out their cell phones.

                                 STUDENT 3
                        That gets a follow.

           They start subscribing to her channel. Nell can’t believe 
           it. Then she sees Amber in the doorway again.

                                 NELL
                        Ms. Walters, can I go to the bathroom?

                        Take the pass... 

           INT. TYSON HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Nell steps into the hall to meet Amber.

                                 NELL
                        Are you crazy?

                                 AMBER
                        You’re mad? I fucked up again, didn’t I? 
                        I knew that was a huge swing. But the 
                        door to the production room was unlocked 
                        and the equipment was right there. I 
                        figured if people saw how good you are --

           Nell shows Amber her cell phone. Her YouTube channel is 
           on the screen. She has 300 new subscribers.

                                 NELL
                        Look what you did.

                                 AMBER
                        So you’re not mad? 

                                 NELL
                        No.

           Nell embraces Amber.  

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH (O.S.)
                        Nell Sampson. Just the student I was 
                        looking for. 

           Amber and Nell separate and turn to see PRINCIPAL SMITH 
           (40s, affable) walking with Detective Spencer. Nell and 
           Amber exchange a quick panicked look. 

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH (CONT’D)
                        Next time give the front office a heads 
                        up before playing one of your videos. 
                        Good stuff by the way. I’m a huge GOT 
                        fan. 
                                (to Amber)
                        And you are?

           Amber shakes Principal Smith’s hand.

                                 AMBER
                        Doris Layne. Nell’s Grandmother. 
                        Sweetheart, you didn’t tell me your 
                        principal was so handsome.

                        Because that would be a weird thing to 
                        say.

           Amber turns to shake Detective Spencer’s hand. 

                                 DETECTIVE SPENCER
                        Detective Spencer.

                                 AMBER
                        Firm handshake. 

           Amber smiles, doing her best sweet old lady impression. 
           Detective Spencer studies Amber’s face then turns to 
           Nell.

                                 DETECTIVE SPENCER
                        I spoke to your Dad. He said I could stop 
                        by. I have a few follow-up questions 
                        about Amber Johnson. But he didn’t 
                        mention his mother was visiting.

                                 AMBER
                        I’m not surprised. We’re not very close 
                        I’m afraid. It all happened last 
                        Thanksgiving. They always say don’t talk 
                        politics at the dinner table. Yet there 
                        we were arguing over Climate change. He 
                        called me a snowflake, I called him a 
                        cuck. We haven’t spoken since.

                                 DETECTIVE SPENCER
                        I’m sorry to hear that.

                                 AMBER
                        Me too. But I’m not visiting. I live at 
                        Meadow Lane Assisted Living facility. 
                        Lovely place. If you have a loved one you 
                        consider a burden, I recommend it. 

           The BELL RINGS. Doors swing open and students flood the 
           hall. Several acknowledge Nell with a wave or comment.

                                 PRINCIPAL SMITH
                        Detective, maybe it’s best you speak with 
                        Ms. Sampson after school.

                        That’s fine. 
                                (to Amber)
                        It was a pleasure Mrs. Layne. 
                                (then, to Nell)
                        Nice video. You’re very good.

                                 NELL

           Then Detective Spencer and Principal Smith walk off. 
           Amber turns to Nell, that was too close. 

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

           The senior home van is parked outside. Amber walks Nell 
           to the front of the building. Nell has the red backpack. 

           They pass the HOMELESS GUY with a new cart.

                                 NELL
                        Thanks for having them drop me off.

                                 AMBER
                        I’m kind of a big deal at Meadow Lane. 

                                 NELL
                        I still can’t believe you came to my 
                        school. What if you got caught? 

                                 AMBER
                        That would have really sucked. But I had 
                        to come. Nell, I’m sorry. I guess I was a 
                        jerk cause I didn’t realize how cool it’d 
                        be to have a Lord Of The Thrones loving 
                        teenager for a friend. 

                                 NELL
                        Okay, close enough.

                                 AMBER
                        But you’ve always been nice to me. Hell, 
                        you were freaking twelve years old trying 
                        to help me balance my budget so I could 
                        pay my rent on time. 

                                 NELL
                        I have been watching Suze Orman since I 
                        was six. 

           They share a laugh. Then Nell hugs Amber.

                                 AMBER
                        I’m gonna need the Golden Bird. I don’t 
                        know how yet, but I gotta fix this. I 
                        don’t want you in danger anymore.

           Nell nods, understanding. She opens her backpack and 
           hands Amber a brown paper bag with the Golden Bird.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        What the hell! You carry it to school?!

                                 NELL
                        Just today. After last night, I didn’t 
                        want to take any chances.

                                               Oyegun

           ACROSS THE STREET. 

           A parked car. Two of Jamie’s Henchmen watch Amber and 
           Nell hug. They clock Amber’s distinct blue sweater.  They 
           see Nell enter the building and Amber rejoin the seniors 
           in the van. It drives off. 

           INT. THE INFERNO - NIGHT

           Bottles POP. People PARTY. In the VIP section, Jamie sits 
           with The Leader (the guy who wants the Golden Bird). Pam 
           gives him a lazy lap dance. A brick of coke is on the 
           table. The Leader doesn’t look thrilled. 

                                 JAMIE
                        She’s not your speed? Pam, stop dancing.

           Pam stops dancing. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        You prefer guys? No judgement. I’m on the 
                        spectrum too. Pam, go get those guys over 
                        by the bar.

           Jamie points to some HOT GUYS. Annoyed, Pam mutters to 
           herself as she walks off. 

                                 THE LEADER
                        I want the bird. 

                                 JAMIE
                        You’ll get your bird.

                                 THE LEADER
                        Word on the street is Amber Johnson stole 
                        it right out from under you. People are 
                        saying you can’t deliver.

                                 JAMIE
                                (upset)
                        What people? Who’s saying that? They’re 
                        fucking wrong. Amber isn’t a problem. I 
                        can still deliver.

           The Leader stands. He looks around the club.

                                 THE LEADER
                        It’s a nice place you have here.
                                (then)
                        If I don’t get my bird, I’ll take my 
                        money and this club is mine.

           The Leader leaves. Jamie fumes. He snorts two lines of 
           cocaine. His eyes bug out. A few CLUB GOERS watch him.

                        What? What the fuck are you looking at?

           Then his two henchmen, who were outside Nell’s place, 
           approach. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        You better have good news. 

                                 HENCHMAN 1
                        We followed the girl. 

                                 JAMIE
                        And?

                                 HENCHMAN 2
                        She was with some old lady. 

                                 JAMIE
                        What old lady?

                                 HENCHMAN 2
                        Her Grandmother. She was with a bunch of 
                        old heads from -- what was it on the van?

                                 HENCHMAN 1
                        Meadow something.

                                 HENCHMAN 2
                        Yeah, Meadow something. Some kind of 
                        Meadow nursing home.

                                 JAMIE
                        Stop saying Meadow.

           Then it hits him.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Meadow Lane. Amber said her Grandmother 
                        is at Meadow Lane. 

           INT. LAPD - BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT

           Detective Spencer studies a Homeland-esque board filled 
           with pictures and names all connected to Amber. The 
           heading reads: Golden Bird Robbery.

           Detective Spencer draws a line between Nell, Cicely and 
           Amber. She then adds a new name: Doris Layne. 

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - CICELY'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Amber calls Victor on her burner phone.

                                (British accent)
                        Hey, Victor, I know you’re still...
                                (in her normal voice)
                        I’m really sorry about everything. You 
                        deserve someone amazing cause you’re 
                        pretty great. Anyway. I just thought I’d 
                        say that. Okay. Bye.

           Amber hangs up. She sighs, deflated, then looks up to see 
           Cicely smiling at her. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Nell sits in front of her camera on a tripod. The red 
           indicator light is on, recording. 

                                 NELL

           A COMMOTION outside. Nell looks toward her door.

                                 NELL (CONT’D)
                        Dad! I’m making a video.

           Then the door SWINGS open. Jamie, his guys and Pam BARGE 
           IN. Nell SCREAMS. She leaps off her bed, knocking over 
           her camera... but it’s still recording. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Where do you think you’re going?

           Jamie GRABS Nell and throws her down. She lands hard, 
           hitting her head. Pam reacts, stunned. 

                                 PAM
                        Jamie, for fuck’s sake, she’s a kid. 

           Jamie ignores Pam, focussing on Nell. 

                                 JAMIE
                        You lied to me.

           EXT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - YARD -  DAY

           A banner reading: Welcome, Families hangs over this 
           festive set-up of games and food. 

           About a hundred FAMILY MEMBERS mill about. Toddler-aged 
           KIDS ride on a large train set.  

           Susan, beaming, greets FAMILIES as they enter with leis.

                                 RANDOM GUY

                        the banner of Pacific-Islander. Have fun.  

           The guy takes the lei, confused.

           ANGLE ON.

           Florence shows her DAUGHTER and SON around.

                                 FLORENCE
                        And we do yoga over here. I’m not very

           Her kids laugh.

                        You look really good, mom. Happy.

           ANGLE ON.

           Betty is in the KISSING BOOTH. There’s a long line of 
           older gentlemen. And one TWENTY YEAR OLD. He winks at 
           Betty. Betty winks back, then reapplies lipstick. 

           INT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - CICELY'S ROOM - DAY

           Cicely rifles through her closet, tossing clothes. Amber 
           (as Doris) watches her.

                        I realized something this morning. This

           A car pulls up. Jamie’s two henchmen step out. They tuck 
           their guns away and casually stroll up to the entrance.

           Susan grins as she puts leis on both men. Scanning the 
           crowd, they spot Cicely in the blue sweater.

                                 HENCHMAN 2
                        Blue sweater, nine o’clock.

                        Uch, gross. You smell like Pickleback

           Amber then looks outside, she notices Cicely. 

           HER POV: Cicely searches the crowd when Jamie’s henchmen 
           step in behind her.

           Amber’s eyes narrow. Something is up. She heads outside.

                                 MARTY
                        Don’t walk away from me. I’m talking to 
                        you.

           Ignoring him, Amber continues.

           EXT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - YARD - CONTINUOUS

           The two men grab Cicely and force her into their parked 
           car. No one notices. Except for --

           Amber, panicked, picks up the pace.

                                 AMBER
                        Cicely. Cicely! No, no, no. 

           Amber pushes through the crowd, now running. Marty is on 
           her heels.

                                 MARTY
                        Get back here.

           Marty reaches for Amber’s bicep and YANKS. He RIPS off 
           her foam latex arm. 

           Marty SCREAMS. Latex flesh dangles in his hand. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        What -- what the hell!!

           Amber doesn’t notice because the parked car is driving 
           off. Detective Spencer steps onto the yard when she sees 
           Amber running. 

                                 DETECTIVE SPENCER
                        Doris? Doris Layne.

                                 AMBER
                        Someone stop that car! 

           The car speeds down the block. 
            "Assisted Living"  
                                               Oyegun

           Desperate, Amber sprints, but her body suit is too heavy. 
           She trips and falls HARD, tumbling across the grass.

           Everyone is looking now. Amber is face down on the dirt.

                                 FLORENCE
                        Doris?!

           Harry and Betty rush to help her. Amber staggers to her 
           feet. Everyone GASPS.

                                 AMBER
                                (frantic)
                        Don’t worry about me. They took Cicely. 
                        You guys, you gotta go after her. 

           No one moves. Then:

                                 LITTLE KID
                        What’s wrong with her face?

           REVERSE ON AMBER TO REVEAL: Amber’s prosthetic face is 
           half off. Her fake bust is caved in. Her wig dangles. 

           Amber looks at the horrified faces staring at her. Then 
           she sees Victor. 

                                 AMBER
                        Victor?

                                 VICTOR
                        Mrs. Layne?

           Amber is mortified. She takes a minute to steel herself. 
           Then she slips off her wig. She peels off the rest of her 
           latex face until it’s just plain old Amber. 

                                 AMBER
                                (to herself)
                        Help me, Maya Angelou.

           She turns to Betty, Florence and Harry who look deeply 
           disturbed.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        I’m not Doris Layne. My name is Amber 
                        Johnson. 

                                 MARTY
                        I knew it!

           People turn to see Marty holding a piece of Amber’s arm. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        At least I had a strong feeling. 
            "Assisted Living"  
                                               Oyegun

                                 VICTOR
                        You’re not Serenaa Williams?

                                 RANDOM PERSON
                        You thought she was Serena Williams? 

                                 AMBER
                        I’m so sorry, Victor. I didn’t mean to 
                        lie.

                                 VICTOR
                        You’re that woman from the news? The one 
                        who stole that bird thing. 

                                 AMBER
                        I didn’t steal anything. 

           Then Detective Spencer draws her weapon on Amber. PEOPLE 
           SCREAM. Parents shield their children’s eyes. 

                                 DETECTIVE SPENCER
                        Amber Johnson, you’re under arrest.

                          AMBER
                                             DETECTIVE SPENCER (CONT'D)
                                            You have the right to 
                                            remain silent --
           The person you want is 
           Jamie Bishop. He took my 
           Grandmother. 

                          AMBER
           You’re not listening --
                                             DETECTIVE SPENCER (CONT'D)
                                            Anything you say can and 
                                            will --

                                 AMBER
                        Fuck this. 

           Amber takes off running toward the street. 

           Detective Spencer sprints after her. She dives, tackling 
           Amber. BLAM! She forces Amber to the ground.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Ouch. Okay. Okay. Take it easy. 

           Victor watches this, horrified. He walks off. Amber sees 
           him go. Heartbroken, she finally stops struggling. 

           EXT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - YARD - LATER

           POLICE have arrived. Detective Spencer questions Susan 
           while OFFICERS keep the rest of the attendees calm. A COP 
           shoves Marty into the backseat of a car. 

           Amber (sans any disguise) is in another backseat. She’s 
           handcuffed as a COP stands guard. 
            "Assisted Living"  
                                               Oyegun

                                 AMBER
                                (yelling, upset)
                        Take me to jail, I don’t give a shit. 
                        Just go get my Grandmother. She’s 
                        probably chopped up into little pieces by 
                        now. Damn it. Why aren’t you listening to 
                        me, you freaking...

           OUTSIDE THE COP CAR. 

           All of a sudden, a SENIOR RESIDENT clutches his chest, 
           slowly spins dramatically and falls. 

           People GASP. A child SCREAMS. Police officers rush to the 
           resident.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Stay back. Give him some air.

           Amber watches this from inside the cop car.

           Then another SENIOR RESIDENT clutches their chest and 
           falls dramatically. 

           Then another and another and another. It’s like a domino 
           of old people performing Shakespearean deaths. 

           One OLD GUY turns to his adult SON.

                                 OLD GUY
                        You wanna put me here? This place is a 
                        death trap. 

           Children SCREAM. Police officers scramble. The cop 
           guarding Amber rushes to help. It’s a madhouse. Susan 
           tries not to panic. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Everyone remain calm. Please remain calm. 
                                (throws hands up, melting 
                                down)
                        Awww hell. 

           With all the commotion, Florence, Betty and Harry rush to 
           the cop car and Amber’s side. 

                                 BETTY
                        Psst. Psst.

                        Guys, what’s going on?

                                 HARRY
                        A diversion. Everyone’s fine.

                                 BETTY
                        We picked up a few things from that hack 
                        drama teacher. 

                                 AMBER
                        You’re rescuing me? Aren’t you guys mad 
                        at me for lying?

                                 FLORENCE
                        No. You’re family and so is Cicely. You 
                        guys need our help. 

           Amber nods, touched. Then she kicks into action. 

                                 AMBER
                        Get the door, I’m handcuffed. 

           Florence opens the backdoor. Amber hops out and slips out 
           of the handcuffs. Betty watches, impressed.

                                 BETTY
                        You’re gonna have to me show to do that.

                                 HARRY
                        Where’d they take Cicely?

                                 AMBER
                        To this club, Inferno.

                                 HARRY
                        I know where they keep the keys to the 
                        van.

                                 AMBER
                        I’ll meet you out back. I just have to 
                        grab something first. We’re gonna need it 
                        to trade.

           Harry, Florence and Betty head to the back of the 
           facility. Amber races into the home. 

           They slip through because Detective Spencer and the other 
           officers are distracted. The yard looks like a ground 
           zero disaster zone with ambulances, paramedics, and 
           wailing children clutching stuffed animals. 

           EXT. MEADOW LANE ASSISTED LIVING - DAY

           Harry, Florence and Betty pull up in the van. Harry is 
           driving. Amber climbs in with The Golden Bird in a brown 
           paper bag.  

                                 AMBER

           They are about to speed away when Victor runs in front of 
           the van. Betty sees how handsome he is. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        Who is that?

                        Victor?

           Amber opens the side of the van. Victor walks over. 

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        I thought you left.

                                 VICTOR
                        I couldn’t leave. I was just sitting in 
                        my car. I watched you pull off some crazy 
                        Big Momma’s House type shit, I think I 
                        forgot how to drive. 

                                 AMBER

                        Was anything you said real?

           Harry and Florence notice the cops up ahead.

                        Don’t rush them. They’re so cute.

                                (to Victor)
                        You asked me to tell you something no one 
                        else knows about me. Well one time I 
                        didn’t shower for a week. I wore my 
                        underwear inside out and I got a really 
                        bad yeast infection. Um, I’ve never 
                        watched A Different World, but I tell 
                        Black people I have. I don’t steal from 
                        people I think are nice. I masturbate a 
                        lot. Like obsessively. I think I might 
                        have a problem. 
                                (then)
                        I’m terrified of letting people in cause 
                        everything good in my life goes away. But 
                        I really wanna get better at it.

                        right now my Grandmother needs me. So are 
                        you getting in the van or not?

           A beat. Then Victor hops in the van.

                                 VICTOR
                        Since I’ve been celibate, I jerk off like 
                        three, four times a day. 

                                 AMBER
                        Aww, you get me. 

           Victor and Amber smile as the van takes off. 

           INT. THE INFERNO - BASEMENT - DAY

           Armed Henchmen stand guard. Clyde is knocked out cold. 
           Nell is tied up. Pam watches Jamie loom over Nell, 
           gesturing emphatically.

                                 JAMIE
                        So you put that stuff on her face and 
                        she’s old, just like that?

           Nell doesn’t answer. Jamie continues:

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Kids nowadays. You guys are fucking 
                        brilliant. 

           Nell looks over at her Dad.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        He’s fine. You’ll both be fine. When 
                        Amber gets here. We’ll do a trade. The 
                        both of you for the Golden Bird. Simple 
                        as that. 

                                 PAM
                                (re: camera monitor)
                        They’re here.

                                 JAMIE
                        Alright. Showtime. 

           The door opens and the two henchmen enter with a 
           frightened Cicely. Nell sees Cicely. Recognizes her.

           Jamie walks over to Cicely with opens arms, giddy.  

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Amber, baby, why would you --
                                (then, seeing her clearly)
                        Who the fuck is this?
            "Assisted Living"  
                                               Oyegun

                                 HENCHMAN 1
                        That’s Amber. She’s got that prostheses 
                        thing on her face like you said. 

                                 JAMIE
                        This is not Amber.

           Jamie tugs on Cicely’s face, pulling and poking at her 
           wrinkles and loose skin.

                                 CICELY
                        Ouch.  

                                 JAMIE
                        This isn’t a mask. This a fucking real 
                        old lady.

                                 CICELY
                        You don’t have to be rude about it. 

                                 JAMIE
                        You grabbed the wrong person. 

           Jamie swallows his rage. Then politely:

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        Ma’am, who the fuck are you?

                                 CICELY
                        Amber’s Grandmother. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Great. Now I have three useless people 
                        and no Amber, and no fucking Bird. 

           Then a cell phone RINGS. The henchmen check their 
           pockets. It’s not them. Jamie looks at Nell. She tries to 
           avoid his gaze. He sees her red backpack and grabs it. He 
           digs inside to find Nell’s burner phone. Amber is 
           calling. Jamie grins. He picks it up.

           INT./EXT.  ASSISTED LIVING VAN / STREET - INTERCUT

           Harry drives. Amber is on the phone. 

                                 AMBER
                        Nell, I need you and Clyde to get 
                        somewhere safe.

                                 JAMIE
                        It’s so good to hear your voice.

                                 AMBER
                                (stunned)
                        Jamie?
            "Assisted Living"  
                                               Oyegun

           Victor looks at Amber, worried.

                                 JAMIE
                        I hear you’re rocking a new look these 
                        days. Golden Girls shit.

                                 AMBER
                        What have you done to Nell? 

                                 JAMIE
                        Why don’t you come by and find out? Bring 
                        the Bird.

                                 AMBER
                        You better not hurt them --

           Jamie hangs up. Amber turns to Harry, Betty, Florence and 
           Victor.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        He has Nell and my Grandmother. And 
                        probably Clyde, who I’m less fond of. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Don’t worry. We’ll get them back. 

           Amber nods, encouraged. Then:

                                 HARRY
                                (re: rearview mirror)
                        You all might want to strap in.  

           They turn to see a FLEET OF POLICE CARS chasing after 
           them. Holy shit. 

                                 BETTY
                        I need a drink. Something stiff. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        I don’t want to die. 

                                 AMBER
                        No one’s gonna die. Harry, let’s see how 
                        fast this thing can go.

                                 HARRY
                        Everyone hang on. 

           Harry steps on the gas. He guns it.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           The van sails through busy traffic.  WOOP WOOP. Sirens. 
           Red and Blue light. Police cruisers barrel down. 
            "Assisted Living"  
                                               Oyegun

           INSIDE THE LEAD CRUISER. Detective Spencer is behind the 
           wheel. She grips it tight. Not relenting. 

           The van comes to an intersection. Harry makes a hard 
           right at the last second into a side street.

           Detective Spencer flies through the intersection. She 
           SPINS around into the side street, gaining on them. 

                                 FLORENCE
                        I think I’m gonna be sick.

                                 BETTY
                        Then turn your head over there.

           Then van speeds down the narrow street, JUMPING the curb 
           back onto a ONE WAY road.

           The van zig zags through opposing traffic. Cars break 
           fast or get out of the way. 

           Detective Spencer is right behind them. Swerving through 
           the lane.  She’s like a NASCAR driver behind wheel.

           A RED LIGHT up ahead. Harry steps on the GAS and plows 
           through the red light. He’s grinning, having the time of 
           his life. 

           Then Harry, Betty, Florence, Amber and Victor SCREAM as 
           the van goes in SLOW MOTION narrowly missing a 18-wheeler 
           truck. They land on the other side. Safe. 

           Detective Spencer, on the other hand, is cut off. She 
           stops. She pounds on her wheel, frustrated.  

           EXT. THE INFERNO - DAY

           The van is parked out back. Amber grabs the brown paper 
           bag with The Golden Bird. 

                                 AMBER
                        You guys stay here. If I’m not out in ten 
                        minutes --

                                 FLORENCE
                        You’re going in there by yourself? 

                                 AMBER
                        I have to. This is my mess, I gotta deal 
                        with it. 

                                 VICTOR
                        Not alone. You have us. Tell us how to 
                        help. 
            "Assisted Living"  
                                               Oyegun

           Amber looks at their eager faces. She has a team. She has 
           friends, a family. She’s not alone. Amber nods.

                                 AMBER
                        Okay. Harry, Betty... 

           Amber lays out instructions...

           INT. THE INFERNO - BASEMENT - DAY

           The door slides open and in steps -- Amber, Betty and 
           Harry. Jamie, his armed men, and Pam are waiting. Seeing 
           Amber, Pam scoffs. Jamie notices Harry and Betty. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Who the fuck are they? 

                                 AMBER
                        My crew. 

           Jamie and his henchmen bursts out laughing. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Wait. Time out. This? This is your crew? 
                        A couple of baby boomers? 

                                 AMBER
                        I’d rather ride with these geezers any 
                        day.
                                (to Betty and Harry)
                        Sorry for calling you geezers.

                                 HARRY
                        Stay focussed. 

                                 BETTY
                        I’ll take the apology.

                                 JAMIE
                        Amber, what is this? You steal from me. I 
                        kidnap your little friend and your 
                        Grandma. What’s going on?

                                 AMBER
                        You fucking set me up.

                                 JAMIE
                        You rejected my offer. That hurt.

                                 AMBER
                        You cheated on me. That hurt more!

                                 JAMIE
                        Okay, okay we can go back and forth about 
                        who hurt who, and who did what, and when 
                        and how --
            "Assisted Living"  
                                               Oyegun

           A COMMOTION breaks out in the backroom. 

           Jamie’s cronies ENTER with Nell, Cicely, Clyde and 
           Victor. Amber’s heart sinks.

                                 HENCHMAN 3
                                (re: Victor)
                        Found this one trying to sneak these 
                        three out. 

           Jamie looks at Victor then at Amber. He sees the worry on 
           her face which only confirms his suspicions.

                                 JAMIE
                        Are you serious? This guy? This square 
                        ass motherfucker? This is the guy you 
                        choose over me. After everything --

                                 PAM
                        SHUT UP!

           The air goes out of the room as all eyes fall on Pam. 

                                 PAM (CONT’D)
                                (over it)
                        All I ever hear is “Amber this” and 
                        “Amber that.” Well fuck Amber. She’s not 
                        even that cute. I don’t get it. 

                                 AMBER
                        Hey!

                                 PAM
                        Jamie, you have no idea the shit I do for 
                        you and still it always comes back to 
                        fucking Amber. Just kill her, take the 
                        bird and let’s get the fuck out of here.  

                                 JAMIE
                        Pam, we don’t have time for your 
                        meltdown. Okay. It’s never been you and 
                        it’s never gonna be you.

           Pam just stares at Jamie. His words land. A beat...

                                 AMBER
                        So, I don’t mean to interrupt, but --

           Then out of nowhere SIRENS BLARE!

                                 HENCHMAN 1
                        Cops!!

                                 BETTY
                        Dammit, Florence called too early.
            "Assisted Living"  
                                               Oyegun

           The henchmen draw their weapons. Amber, Betty, Harry, 
           Victor, Nell, and Clyde scatter. 

           Pam sneaks out of a side door while no one is looking. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Change of plans.

           Jamie pulls a gun and grabs hold of Cicely. Amber 
           SCREAMS. Jamie drags Cicely to the back room. The LAPD 
           SWAT team KICKS in the front entrance with guns drawn. In 
           an instant, the place is surrounded. 

           Jamie’s men OPEN FIRE. BULLETS FLY. BLOOD SPLATTERS. Cops 
           and Henchman get clipped. 

           Amber picks a gun off a dead body and heads toward the 
           back room. Nell watches her go when Clyde dives, pulling 
           her to safety. They join the others behind a barricade.  

                                 CLYDE
                        Nell, c’mon, let’s get out of here. 

                                 NELL
                        Dad, I can’t. Amber needs our help.

                                 VICTOR
                        She went through the back door.

                                 BETTY
                        Haven’t we done enough?

                                 HARRY
                        No one gets left behind. 

           Harry leads the way. Clyde begrudgingly follows, but 
           shields Nell. They dodge a flurry of gunfire as they head 
           toward the back door. 

           EXT. THE INFERNO - DAY

           SQUAD CARS and COPS surround the perimeter. Detective 
           Spencer charges after a LIEUTENANT. She’s pissed.

                                 DETECTIVE SPENCER
                        There are civilians in there. Cease fire.

                        Goddamn it. We only need Amber Johnson.

           Detective Spencer’s cell phone goes off. She checks it. 
           It’s an EMAIL with a video attachment sent from an 
           unknown account. Curious, Detective Spencer plays the 
           video. Her eyes widen.

           INT. THE INFERNO - BACK PATHWAY - DAY

           Jamie pulls Cicely down a dank hallway that leads to the 
           alley. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Pick up the pace.

                                 CICELY
                        This is as fast as I go.

           Jamie reaches the outside door. He’s about to open it 
           when --

                                 AMBER (O.S.)
                        Jamie, wait.

           Jamie and Cicely turn to see Amber. Her hands are raised. 
           The Golden Bird is in one hand and a gun is in the other. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Do something stupid and I’ll kill her. 
                        You know I will.

                                 AMBER
                        I know. Women and children mean nothing 
                        to you. But I do. 

           Jamie perks up, intrigued.

                                 JAMIE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 AMBER
                        A trade. My grandmother for the Bird and 
                        me. 

                                 CICELY
                        No, Amber. You don’t have to do this.

                                 AMBER
                        But I want to. 

                                 JAMIE
                        How do I know you’re not fucking with me?

           Amber puts the gun down, but it slips and GOES OFF. The 
           bullet hits the wall nearly clipping Jamie.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck?!
            "Assisted Living"  
                                               Oyegun

                                 AMBER
                        Sorry! Sorry! It slipped. I was trying to 
                        be cool and it slipped. My bad. 

           Amber raises her hands and walks towards him, slowly. 
           When she gets close, Jamie shoves Cicely aside. He takes 
           hold of the Golden Bird and Amber. 

           Amber and Jamie head out the back door just as Victor, 
           Betty, Harry, Clyde and Nell come down the hallway. They 
           see Cicely. Harry goes in for the hug.

                                 HARRY
                        You okay?

                                 CICELY
                        Yes. They went outside. 

           EXT. THE INFERNO - BACK ALLEY - DAY

           Jamie and Amber race to a parked car.

                                 JAMIE
                        Glad you finally came to your senses. 

                                 AMBER
                        It took me a while to realize that no one 
                        is ever going to love me the way you do. 

           Amber pulls Jamie in for a kiss. When they separate, 
           Amber has Jamie’s gun. She trains it on him. 

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        You fucked me, now it’s my turn. 

           Jamie raises his hands and backs away.

           Just then Cicely, Harry, Nell, Clyde, Betty, Victor and 
           Florence stumble into the alley. 

                                 CICELY
                        Amber, don’t.

                                 NELL
                        Roast that asshole.

           Clyde looks at Nell, surprised and worried. She shrugs.

                                 VICTOR
                        Give me the gun. 

                                 AMBER
                        Everyone stop talking. Let me think.

                                               Oyegun

                                 JAMIE
                        You’re a liar and a thief, but you’re not 
                        a killer. You’re not gonna shoot me. 

           Amber glares at Jamie. A tense beat. 

                                 BETTY
                        Well do something. 

           Amber FIRES toward Jamie. He jolts like he’s been shot, 
           but soon realizes he’s fine.

                                 JAMIE
                        You missed. You fucking shot me and you 
                        missed.

                                 AMBER
                        I didn’t miss. 

           Jamie turns to see Amber didn’t in fact miss. She shot 
           out his tire. He’s not going anywhere.

                                 JAMIE
                        You bitch!

           Jamie lunges for Amber when Detective Spencer and several 
           COPS descend on them, guns drawn. 

                                 DETECTIVE SPENCER 
                        On your knees. On your knees.

           Amber raises her hands and drops to her knees. She’s 
           expecting Detective Spencer to grab her, but instead 
           Detective Spencer goes for Jamie.

                                 DETECTIVE SPENCER (CONT’D)
                        On the ground. Now.

           Jamie gets on the ground. Detective Spencer handcuffs 
           him. She hands the Golden Bird to an OFFICER.

                                 JAMIE
                        I didn’t steal the Bird. You saw the 
                        surveillance tape. It was all her. 

                                 DETECTIVE SPENCER
                        Oh yeah?

           Detective Spencer takes out her cell phone. 

           ON THE VIDEO: The night Jamie kidnapped Nell. 

           Jamie, his men and Pam ENTER Nell’s room as she is 
           recording. Nell sees them and runs. 

                                 JAMIE (ON THE VIDEO)
                        Where do you think you’re going?

                                               Oyegun

           Jamie grabs her.  

                                 PAM (ON THE VIDEO)
                        Jamie, for fuck’s sake, she’s a kid. 

                                 JAMIE (ON THE VIDEO)
                        You lied to me.

           He KNOCKS Nell out. Then turns to his Henchman.

                                 JAMIE (ON THE VIDEO) 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        Take her and her punk ass Dad to Inferno. 
                        We can use them to get my bird back. Then 
                        we get paid.  

           Jamie then notices the recording light on Nell’s camera. 
           He walks over to it. He’s fully in frame.

                                 JAMIE  (ON THE VIDEO) 
                                 (CONT’D) 
                        What’s that light? Is this thing 
                        recording? Pam, take care of this. 

           The video cuts off.

           BACK TO SCENE. 

           Everyone stares, dumbfounded. 

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not saying a thing until I speak to 
                        my lawyer. 

                                 DETECTIVE SPENCER
                                (to another officer)
                        Read him his rights and get him out of 
                        here.

           An OFFICER takes hold of Jamie and leads him off. 

           Detective Spencer walks over to Amber who is still 
           kneeling with her hands up.

                                 AMBER
                        That took an unexpected turn. 

                                 DETECTIVE SPENCER
                        You’re free to go.

                                 AMBER
                        Are you sure? 

                                 DETECTIVE SPENCER
                        Yes.

                                 AMBER
                        I didn’t steal the bird, but I’m pretty 
                        sure I’ve committed a number of felonies 
                        these past two weeks. 

                                 DETECTIVE SPENCER
                        As far as I’m concerned, you’ve done 
                        nothing wrong. But if you me to arrest 
                        you --

                                 AMBER
                        Nope, nope. I’m good. 

           Amber hops to her feet.

                                 DETECTIVE SPENCER
                        You folks have a nice evening. 

                                 AMBER
                        No, you have a nice evening. 

           Detective Spencer and the other officers head to their 
           cars. Amber turns to her family and friends, ecstatic.

                                 CICELY
                        Baby girl, you did it. 

                                 AMBER
                        Holy shit.

                                 CICELY
                        Watch your language. 

           They gather around to embrace Amber. She pushes Clyde out 
           of the hug circle. 

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           A Lyft pulls up in front of Pam. She gets inside, tossing 
           something out the window. The car drives off.

           CLOSE ON ITEM: Detective Spencer’s business card. 

                                                             FADE OUT.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - WEEKS LATER - DAY

           Amber, Victor, Cicely and Harry watch Clueless in a 
           crowded cemetery. It’s the scene where Josh (Paul Rudd) 
           and Cher (Alicia Silverstone) kiss on the stairs. 

                                 AMBER
                                (as Cher)

           Amber notices Victor mouthing along too. She grins. 

                                 VICTOR
                                (as Josh)

           Victor pulls Amber in for a big kiss. When they separate, 
           Amber turns to see Cicely and Harry already making out.  

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Ewww, we’re the young ones. Stop doing 
                        that.

                                 CICELY
                        Don’t hate. 

           They all laugh. Amber gets up.  

                                 AMBER
                        I’ll be right back. 
                                (then to Victor)
                        Please make sure they keep their clothes 
                        on. 

           Amber walks to the drink stand. 

           ANGLE ON.

           Amber fills her cup with soda when a GUY steps in beside 
           her. She instantly notices his watch. It’s a TAG Heuer. 

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Is that a 23 karat TAG Heuer Connected 
                        Modular 45 Full Diamond?

                                 GUY
                        Yeah, how did you know? 

                                 AMBER
                        I’ve always wanted one.

           Off Amber’s mischievous smile, we...
