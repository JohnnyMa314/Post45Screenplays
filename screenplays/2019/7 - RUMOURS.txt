           OVER BLACK

           We hear snatches of pop hooks and blues riffs over layers of 
           static. 

                                                           FADE IN:

           INT. STEVIE/LINDSEY’S BEDROOMS - NIGHT - SPLITSCREEN

           (THE FOLLOWING TAKES PLACE IN SPLITSCREEN) 

           Two radio dials. Two hands, female and male, scanning for the 
           right tune. 

           They find exactly what they’re looking for at the exact same 
           time. 

           The haunted folk-pop of “California Dreamin’” by The Mamas 
           and the Papas rings out clear as a bell. 

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

           Left side of the screen, STEVIE NICKS (17), a sandy blonde 
           with apple-cheeks, gives herself a once over in the mirror 
           then smirks. For someone so young, that smirk is 
           extraordinarily self-possessed. Or, maybe, just possessed. 
           The truth lies somewhere in between, but she loves to keep 
           you guessing.

           Right side of the screen, LINDSEY BUCKINGHAM, (16), tight 
           curly mop of hair and intense eyes, does a shoulder roll in 
           his mirror, then exhales to relax himself. He’s wound tighter 
           than his guitar strings. That’s impressive, considering he 
           tunes it to perfection, at least twice a day.

           Left side: Stevie lip syncs along to the song with more 
           enthusiasm than accuracy, as she fastens a gold cross 
           necklace that comes to rest over her conservatively buttoned-
           up blouse. 

           Right side: Lindsey air guitars along with Flip Sloan’s 
           picking on the radio. His strumming is 110%-oh-my-God-is-this-
           all-he-ever-does faithful. 

           INT. STEVIE/LINDSEY’S LIVING ROOMS - MOMENTS LATER - 
           SPLITSCREEN

           Left side: Stevie bounds downstairs into the room, as her 
           parents, JESS (40) and BARBARA (38) stare mindlessly at a 
           broadcast of Hogan’s Heroes. 
                                 STEVIE
                        I’m going to Young Life.

                                 BARBARA
                           (without looking up)
                        Young Life?

                                 STEVIE
                        The gathering in the church 
                        basement. Be back by 11!

                                 JESS
                           (also not looking)

           Stevie’s out the door, pretending not to have heard.

           Right side: Lindsey creeps down the stairs to find his 
           parents, MORRIS (47) and RUTH (45) distracted. His mother is 
           on the phone chattering on about some country club nonsense, 
           while his father joylessly reads The Carpetbaggers. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I’m going out. 

           Morris shrugs, Ruth gives him nothing. 

           Lindsey goes to the front door, passing by shelves displaying 
           trophy after trophy all with the name: “GREG BUCKINGHAM” 

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - MOMENTS LATER - SPLITSCREEN

           Right side: Lindsey grabs a leather jacket out of the bushes 
           that line his porch. He drapes himself in the icon of 
           borrowed cool, then untucks his shirt. His confidence is 
           almost enough to make these choices work. He continues on 
           towards First Presbyterian. 

           Left side: Stevie struts along the sidewalk with a purpose 
           towards ROBIN SNYDER (17). Robin is a ride or die, seven days 
           a week, talk til the sun comes up kind of best friend.

           Robin, whose wavy auburn locks go all the way down her back, 
           sits at the end of her driveway facing away from Stevie. She 
           fiddles with something in her lap.

           Stevie tip-toes up behind and jumps on her. 

           The two scream and laugh together for a moment. Robin holds 
           up her project, a crescent moon necklace. 
           Stevie yelps with glee. She slips the cross off her neck and 
           into her pocket, replacing it with her new jewelry. She 
           undoes a couple buttons for good measure.

           EXT. FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER - SPLITSCREEN

           Left side: Stevie and Robin walk and chat and giggle, as they 
           approach the steps of First Presbyterian. 

           Right side: Lindsey broods his way to the steps from the 
           other side. 

           INT. FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER- SPLITSCREEN

           Lindsey brushes by the easy-breezy Stevie and Robin, through 
           the large front doors, just as John Phillips belts out the 
           line, “Stopped into a church...” 

           Finally, the invisible barrier between them disappears and 
           they are all together in the same space for the first time.

           SUPERTITLE: PALO ALTO, 1965

           INT. FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           “California Dreamin’” becomes diegetic down here. An anemic 
           folkie performs his less than stellar rendition to score the 
           evening of teenage ennui.

           Stevie, Robin, and Lindsey gravitate towards the music.

           The anemic folkie finishes his cover, and the semi-circle of 
           youth that’s formed around him applaud with gusto. 

           Lindsey puffs out his chest ready to take the spotlight, when 
           Robin pushes Stevie towards the center of the group.

           Lindsey backs off, his window closed. 

           Stevie looks out at the crowd.

                                 STEVIE
                        Now what?

                                 ROBIN
                        How about the one you wrote?

                                 STEVIE
                           (to the crowd)
                        I swear I didn’t put her up to 
                        this.
           Stevie cradles the “Fisher Price My First Guitar” and plucks 
           the cheap plastic strings. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        This one’s called, “I’ve Loved and 
                        I’ve Lost, and I’m Sad, but Not 
                        Blue.” 

           Stevie sings and plays her original. Belying her fresh-faced 
           All-American look, Stevie’s singing voice is husky and more 
           than a little raw. There’s an appealing vulnerability to it, 
           an “X” factor that would beguile anyone. 

           Her guitar playing, however, leaves something to be desired. 
           She keeps stopping and starting to find her place. 

           All of the kids in the room are along for the ride and enjoy 
           the composition. That is except for Lindsey, who’s nearly 
           coming out of his skin watching her fumble about. 

           Unable to stand this “atrocity” any longer, Lindsey jumps 
           from the crowd and takes the guitar out of Stevie’s hands mid-
           line. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I’m sorry. Here, start over, I have 
                        some ideas.

           Lindsey starts again, and, somehow, he’s already committed 
           Stevie’s melody to memory. His style of play is all the more 
           remarkable considering he’s done away with the pick, instead 
           plucking the strings with his fingernails.  

           Stevie, shaking off her confusion, brings the vocals back in 
           strong. The song really gains momentum amongst the gathering. 
           Suddenly:

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                           (no longer playing)
                        Did you just change perspective? 

           The loose gathering disperses at the sudden lack of music.  

                                 STEVIE
                        What? 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Lyrically, you went from “I” to 
                        “they,” first person to third. That 
                        doesn’t make any sense. 

           Stevie looks him up and down: Who does this guy think he is?
                                 STEVIE
                        Bob Dylan does it all the time. 

           Lindsey cocks his head to one side, then leans in, close. His 
           steely greys nearly look through Stevie for about a second 
           and a half.

                                 LINDSEY
                           (softening)
                        You want to be Bob Dylan?

           Stevie’s mouth curls into a smile.

                                 STEVIE
                        Someday, yeah.

                                 LINDSEY
                           (coy)
                        Then learn to play guitar. 

           Lindsey swaggers away, instrument in hand. 

           Robin comes to her friend’s side. 

                                 ROBIN
                        What an asshole. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (dreamily)
                        Yeah...

           Stevie, mesmerized, follows Lindsey to the other side of the 
           room. He’s taken up a post in the corner, noodling on the 
           guitar for no one but himself. 

           Making the leap, Stevie reaches out her hand. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I’m Stevie. 

           Lindsey continues playing. He meets her gaze.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Lindsey. 

           The ice having been broken, we PRELAP the mystical jangle of 
           an Ovation Balladeer. 

                                 STEVIE (PRELAP)
                        This is a new song...
           INT. JUNGLE JIM’S - STAGE - NIGHT

           SUPERTITLE: EAST HOLLYWOOD, 1974

           We’ve come a long way from First Presbyterian’s basement to a 
           gen-you-ine performance venue.

           Buckingham Nicks, as the duo are now known, play the hell out 
           of an early, ragged version of “Rhiannon.” It’s longer and 
           sparser than the cut diamond of a pop single we’ll come to 
           know and love. 

           Their chemistry onstage would be apparent to any audience 
           member, if there were any. Unfortunately, only the club’s 
           staff and HARRY FISHKIN (34), their total square of an A&R 
           guy, witness the rocking performance. He doesn’t look 
           pleased.

           INT. JUNGLE JIM’S - BAR - LATER

           Stevie and Lindsey flank a beleaguered Harry at the bar. 

                                 HARRY
                        Polydor sent me here to see how you 
                        guys draw, and this was... Not 
                        encouraging. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        The promoter fucked us. We were 
                        promised a Saturday slot.

                                 STEVIE
                        You know L.A. crowds are a bummer. 
                        We just sold out the Municipal 
                        Auditorium in Mobile. That’s 5,000 
                        seats. That’s the Palladium. 

                                 HARRY
                        The Palladium is in Hollywood. 
                        People have options in Hollywood. I 
                        didn’t even know that many people 
                        lived in Alabama. 
                           (beat)
                        Maybe you should sign with a label 
                        down there.

                                 STEVIE
                           (irritated)
                        Fans are fans. Just because you 
                        can’t see that--
                                 HARRY
                        Instead of interrupting me, how 
                        about listening to someone that 
                        knows what they’re talking about? 

                                 STEVIE
                        How about--

                                 HARRY
                        For a couple nobodies, you got a 
                        lotta-- 

           Lindsey, without a moment’s hesitation, grabs Harry’s beer 
           and rockets it over the bar, smashing it into the top shelf. 
           He misses Harry’s head by inches.  

                                 LINDSEY
                        Fuck off, Harry.

           Lindsey then takes Stevie by the arm, along with a bottle of 
           Johnnie Walker Black, and ushers them all out of the venue 
           posthaste. 

           Amidst the chaos, Harry has the presence of mind to 
           retaliate.

                                 HARRY
                           (after them)
                        You two losers are fucking 
                        finished! You hear me?

           Another successful show under their belts. 

           EXT. WORST APARTMENT BUILDING IN ALL OF NOHO - LATER

           Lindsey and Stevie walk back to their humble abode, an 
           eyesore of a building that will be condemned sooner rather 
           than later. 

           INT. WORST APARTMENT BUILDING IN ALL OF NOHO - HALLWAY - 
           MOMENTS LATER

           The pair lurch down the dilapidated hall towards their unit, 
           when:

                                 CRAPPY LANDLORD (O.S.)
                        Well, if it isn’t Mr. Silver Spoon-
                        Paper Plate. Rent’s past due.

           Taking up the entirety of his door frame, their CRAPPY 
           LANDLORD (50s) wears nothing but an offensively named article 
           of clothing akin to a tank top and boxer shorts.
                                 LINDSEY
                        It’s in the mail. 

                                 CRAPPY LANDLORD
                        No, it’s already bounced. 

           On that, Lindsey clumsily stumbles into the apartment. 

           Stevie takes a crumbled wad of bills from her purse and hands 
           it to the expectant property manager. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (whisper)
                        I’ll have the rest by the end of 
                        the week. 

           She scurries off into the shared dwelling that she pays for. 

           INT. THE WORST STUDIO APARTMENT IN NOHO - MOMENTS LATER

           Lindsey’s melted into their curbside rescue mattress in the 
           middle of the living room floor, which is also the kitchen, 
           which is also the bedroom. 

           Beyond the mattress, the only homey touches are some 
           handcrafted paper flowers, a vintage ceramic lamp, and an 
           abundance of vinyl scattered around haphazardly. 

           If there’s an organizational system to this, it’s certainly 
           unclear.

                                 STEVIE
                        You can’t keep passing bad checks. 

           Stevie grabs the bottle from Lindsey, and takes a slug. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I thought I had Christmas money 
                        left. Must’ve blown it all on the 
                        carburetor. We need a car. 

                                 STEVIE
                        I’m not arguing that with you. Just 
                        less thinking, more knowing. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Well, I know we’re done at Polydor.

                                 STEVIE
                        And whose fault is that? Another 
                        bridge burned.
                                 LINDSEY
                        Harry’s an asshole. 

                                 STEVIE
                        It’s the music business, they’re 
                        all assholes. But he was our 
                        asshole. 
                           (beat; disappointed)
                        Now we don’t even have him.

                                 LINDSEY
                        We still have Keith. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Keith brought us to Polydor. Keith 
                        let us stay with him when we were 
                        “between apartments.” Keith cut the 
                        album. Keith is the one who 
                        convinced them to come out tonight 
                        when it bombed. What’s left to 
                        give? His liver? 

           Lindsey reaches for the scotch back from Stevie, who pulls it 
           away. He reaches into his pocket and lights a joint, instead. 

           After a hit:

                                 LINDSEY
                        What else was I supposed to do?

                                 STEVIE
                        You weren’t supposed to do 
                        anything. Like, two more minutes, 
                        that’s all I needed. If I could’ve 
                        convinced him that Alabama wasn’t a 
                        fluke, that the South gets us, we’d 
                        be touring Dixieland from now until 
                        our next LP. Then guess who’s gonna 
                        be lined up to buy it?

           Lindsey grasps at straws. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        OK, it was an... Overreaction. But, 
                        maybe, it’s like you say about 
                        Venus in, um, trans--

                                 STEVIE
                        Nope, no. That’s my excuse for you, 
                        you don’t get to use it on me. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I was trying to make a point.
                                 STEVIE
                        Whatever point you’re trying to 
                        make, sweetie, you’ve made it. How 
                        many times do you have to bang the 
                        same note before you realize it 
                        doesn’t work?

           Lindsey is about rebut her claim before his eyes moisten. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Christ, why do you even put up with 
                        me?

           Stevie cuddles up to him on the mattress, running her fingers 
           through his thick mane. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Because right now you fight so hard 
                        for so little, I know that when 
                        there’s something worth fighting 
                        for, and there will be, there’s no 
                        one I’d rather be fighting with. 

           She rests her head on his chest and closes her eyes. 
           Lindsey’s remain wide open. 

           INT. THE WORST STUDIO APARTMENT IN NOHO - MORNING

           Crack of dawn. Stevie’s up, fresh-faced in her waitress 
           uniform with matching apron. The High Priestess of Rock from 
           the previous night looks very... Ordinary. 

           She leans to kiss a still snoozing Lindsey on the forehead. 
           As if in a fairy tale, he awakens, gently. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        How’re you able to get ready so 
                        early without waking me up?

                                 STEVIE
                        Practice. 

           Stevie’s about to leave when she turns and taps her watch. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        Remember, five o’clock. Don’t 
                        forget. Love you.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Love you back.
                           (beat)
                        Hey, about last night...
           Stevie hasn’t got the time. She blows him a kiss out the 
           door.

           Lindsey wipes the sleep out of his eyes and goes to the 
           window. He watches Stevie catch the bus in seconds flat. 

           Some mail slides under the door. Lindsey flips through a 
           stack of overdue bills, each of which hit the trash.

           Lastly, a colorful postcard crows, “GREETINGS FROM PALO 
           ALTO!” He turns it over, then stuffs it in his pocket. 

           INT. THE COPPER PENNY - DAY

           The Copper Penny, Stevie’s place of employment, is an 
           overcrowded, understaffed coffee shop sitting on the corner 
           of Sunset and Gower.

           Stevie approaches a decimated table in need of tidying up.

           Releasing a heavy sigh, she makes eye contact with her 
           reflection in the window. There’s no smirk to be had. 

           Stevie grabs a disused napkin and jots down some lyrics.

                                 ASSHOLE MANAGER (O.S.)
                        Nicks, chop chop, you got tables!

           Stevie tucks the napkin away for herself, and chop chops.

           EXT. SOUND CITY - PARKING LOT - LATER

           Lindsey pulls up to a nondescript building in a nondescript 
           strip mall in a nondescript part of Van Nuys. The only 
           distinguishing marker is a big, bold sign on the front 
           reading: “SOUND CITY”

           Lindsey parks his rusted-out, hand-me-down Beamer, and heads 
           inside, a man on a mission. 

           INT. SOUND CITY - STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

           If the exterior was a let down of design, the interior decor 
           is somehow even less significant. Hello, beige walls and 
           linoleum floors!

           KEITH OLSEN (30) listens to the latest mix of a track at the 
           boards, using big-ass professional AKG K140 headphones. Keith 
           looks less like a rock producer and more like the kid on the 
           back of a cereal box. 
           Lindsey comes up from behind, and stealthily pulls one can 
           aside. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        HEY, KEITH!

           Keith jumps back, sending the headphones flying off his head 
           altogether. He turns off the tape machine. 

                                 KEITH
                        What the...
                           (gathering himself)
                        I heard you and Harry had a bit of 
                        a run in. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (sheepish)
                        I got a little passionate. 

                                 KEITH
                        You’re a “little passionate” when 
                        you have hit singles, a swimming 
                        pool, and an art collection. People 
                        who’ve made it get “a little 
                        passionate.” What you did last 
                        night was throw a temper tantrum.

                                 LINDSEY
                        You’ve talked to Harry before, you 
                        know what he’s like, I mean, c’mon, 
                        you know, he’s...

                                 KEITH
                        Doing his job?

                                 LINDSEY
                        His job’s getting in the way of 
                        business ‘cause when we take our 
                        new demo out--

                                 KEITH
                        OK, I’ll bite: When did you and 
                        Stevie record a new demo?

                                 LINDSEY
                        That’s where you come in. 

           Keith rolls his eyes so hard they almost hit the floor. 

                                 KEITH
                        Jesus, Linds, another favor? I 
                        thought letting y’all stay at my 
                        place gratis put me in the clear. 
                                 LINDSEY
                        It did until you evicted us. Look, 
                        we can’t pay... Now, but--

                                 KEITH
                        Hock your guitar. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        How am I supposed to earn without 
                        it? 

                                 KEITH
                        How’re you earning with it? Push 
                        comes to shove, I could use someone 
                        around here to clean up. Swing by a 
                        couple times a week, line your 
                        pockets.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Do I look like a fucking janitor?

                                 KEITH
                        Not yet.

           Keith turns back to his work, but Lindsey’s not done.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Let’s continue this over lunch and--

                                 KEITH
                        Lunch? I ate hours ago.

           Lindsey looks to the clock on the wall: It’s 4:30. He’s 
           forgotten to remember. Like a bolt, he’s gone.

           INT. VOLARE’S ITALIAN - DINING ROOM - LATER

           After 75 minutes of bang your head against the dashboard 
           traffic, Lindsey has finally arrived. 

           Lindsey, now wearing an oversized sports coat, takes his seat 
           at the table. 

           Waiting for him is a perturbed Stevie in her Sunday Best. 
           Also, in attendance are his parents, Ruth and Morris, and his 
           older brother GREG (29). Greg has the kind of natural 
           charisma you want to be around, which is great if it didn’t 
           mean having to stand in his shadow.

           All of them have half-eaten entrees in front of them and one 
           extra for their tardy guest. 
           They greet this crazy kid with a mixture of concern and 
           disappointment. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I know I’m late. I know you’re 
                        concerned, disappointed. I know 
                        Greg is here. Hi, Greg. And Stevie 
                        did remind me, so don’t blame her. 

                                 MORRIS
                        No one... Blamed her.

           Lindsey looks over to Stevie. Silence.

                                 GREG
                           (re: the sports coat)
                        Nice threads. 

           Greg pulls at the shoulders of the jacket to demonstrate the 
           poor fit on his little brother. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Well, yeah, Giovanni insisted. It’s 
                        this, or I could leave?

                                 RUTH
                        Please, Linds, eat up. I insist.

           He doesn’t mind if he does and eats like he hasn’t in months. 
           The free food is interrupted by an AUTOGRAPH SEEKER (40s). 

                                 AUTOGRAPH SEEKER 
                        I was waiting for a free moment, 
                        but... Could you?

           She thrusts a pen and receipt paper towards, not the would-be 
           superstars, but Greg. He politely acquiesces.

                                 AUTOGRAPH SEEKER (CONT’D)
                        Your performance in the Mexico City 
                        Games was top-notch.

                                 GREG
                        What about the guy who beat me?

                                 AUTOGRAPH SEEKER
                           (flustered)
                        Second in the world is still a 
                        champion in my book. 

           Greg sends her on her way. He turns to see a slightly 
           embarrassed Lindsey.
                                 GREG
                        Hey, you’ll get used to that.
                           (beat)
                        Speaking of, try not to be late 
                        when you meet with Philip. It’s a 
                        big ask. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Who?

                                 STEVIE
                           (covering)
                        Thank you so much. I’ll make sure 
                        that we’re on time. Early, 15 
                        minutes, at least. 

           The server drops off the check. Morris examines the cost, 
           then sighs.  

                                 MORRIS
                        I’ve always dreamed of being out at 
                        a nice restaurant, like this one, 
                        enjoying a lovely meal with my 
                        family. Good food, good wine, good 
                        company. But when it came time to 
                        pay the bill, my son would stop me. 
                        He would say, “No, Dad, I got it.” 
                        And that would be the day that I 
                        knew my work as a father was 
                        finished. 

           Morris ruminates on such a fantasy. Lindsey’s not having it.

                                 LINDSEY
                        You heard the man, Greg. Get your 
                        wallet. 

           INT. BEAMER - MOVING - LATER

           Like most struggling artists, Lindsey and Stevie are left 
           emotionally drained after a visit with family. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (breaking the ice)
                        Who’s Philip?

                                 STEVIE
                        Philip Webb. From Capitol Records. 
                        That your brother knows from 
                        Stanford. 
                                 LINDSEY
                           (searching his memory)
                        Philip? Philip? Phil? Phil! Greg 
                        said everyone in the dorm took 
                        turns peeing in his shampoo bottle. 
                        Pisshead Phil?

                                 STEVIE
                        Eww... He didn’t tell me that. Just 
                        that his first act went gold. We’re 
                        meeting with him on Friday. 

           As Stevie talks, Lindsey scans the radio. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        Are you even listening?

                                 LINDSEY
                        I can multi-task. 

           He lands on “One of These Nights” by the Eagles, the nadir of 
           soulless corporate sound, loudly groans, and changes the 
           station again.

                                 STEVIE
                        Why’d you do that? I like that 
                        song. 

           This time he hits “Search and Destroy” by the Stooges, the 
           fountainhead of alternative, grins, and settles back in to 
           driving.  

                                 LINDSEY
                        Of course, you “like” it. 
                        Everyone’s supposed to “like” it. 
                        It’s not country, it’s not rock, 
                        it’s not even pop. The Eagles are 
                        product. Product that’s distributed 
                        to retailers to turn a profit, so 
                        they can afford champagne in the 
                        limo on the way to their private 
                        jet they take to the next arena 
                        filled with people who “like” it. 
                        Saying you “like” a song is 
                        basically saying, you “heard” a 
                        song. So, fuck “like.” 

                                 STEVIE
                           (coy)
                        Now when you finish saying that to 
                        the mirror, how does the Rolling 
                        Stone reporter react? Do they just 
                        pass out? Overwhelmed by your 
                        integrity?
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)
                           (beat; realizing)
                        These guys aren’t even together 
                        anymore. And don’t pretend you 
                        wouldn’t want some champagne in a 
                        limo to the private jet on the way 
                        to an arena filled with people who 
                        like our music... Because that 
                        means they’ve heard our music. 
                        Isn’t that the goal?

           Instead of marinating on these points, Lindsey chooses to 
           deflect. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (giving her the postcard)
                        Robin’s coming to town. 

                                 STEVIE
                        You’re reading my mail? 

                                 LINDSEY
                        It’s a postcard. 

                                 STEVIE
                        She’s here on Friday. 

           Lindsey nods. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                           (pointed)
                        That’s when we’re meeting with 
                        Philip. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I learned about the Pisshead thing 
                        at the same time you learned about 
                        the Robin thing. Let’s not get mad 
                        and call it even.

           Stevie would smack him if he didn’t have a point. 

                                 STEVIE
                        We’ll make it work. 
                           (beat)
                        I’ll make it work. 

           EXT. CAPITOL RECORDS BUILDING - DAY

           The iconic Capitol Records Tower glimmers in the L.A. sun. 
           INT. CAPITOL RECORDS BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

           Lindsey and Stevie stroll around the lobby, waiting for THE  
           Philip Webb. This is as presentable as they’ve looked since 
           First Presbyterian. Stevie’s brushed her hair and Lindsey’s 
           trimmed his beard. 

           They marvel at the legendary roster of artists’ photos up on 
           the wall. First passing The Beatles, next The Beach Boys, 
           then lastly a blank space. 

           Stevie finger frames the emptiness. 

                                 STEVIE
                        “Buckingham Nicks.” 

           Lindsey smiles, he moves their record from under his arm, so 
           he can drape it around her. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        Mr. Webb will see you now. 

           INT. CAPITOL RECORDS BUILDING - PHILIP’S OFFICE - MOMENTS 
           LATER

           Stevie and Lindsey enter the office of a power broker’s wet 
           dream. It’s clean, contemporary, and classy. 

           Behind the mahogany desk sits PHILIP WEBB (30), looking slick 
           as hell. A master of the universe in training. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Have a seat anywhere.

           Stevie and Lindsey pick the most obvious option, the two 
           seats facing Philip. 

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                        How is Greg? Still polishing that 
                        Gold Medal? Let me tell you, your 
                        brother’s an American hero. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Actually, he--

                                 PHILIP
                        So, you two have been doing this 
                        music thing since high school? 
                        Sweethearts?

           Stevie gladly dives into their story.
                                 STEVIE
                        Don’t get me wrong, I thought he 
                        was just darling. But, like, he was 
                        a year younger than me. Now we’re 
                        the same age, but at the time... He 
                        was in this group, “The Fritz 
                        Rabyne Memorial Band.” 

                                 LINDSEY
                        “Fritz” for short.

                                 STEVIE
                        Their lead singer, Jody, was going 
                        off to college, so Lindsey asked me 
                        to join up.

                                 LINDSEY
                        I knew she had pipes. She just 
                        needed a little backup.

                                 STEVIE
                        Me and four boys in a smelly garage 
                        trying to sound like Jefferson 
                        Airplane six hours a day. Linds, he 
                        was so sweet, he made this rule 
                        that no in the band could date me. 
                        It could interfere with the, uh... 
                        Whatchimicallit?

                                 LINDSEY
                        Chemistry. 

                                 PHILIP
                        What happened to the other three? 

                                 LINDSEY
                        We did an industry showcase down 
                        here. The label was into us, but 
                        only us. 

                                 STEVIE
                        As luck should have it, we were 
                        ready to be a duo, and the rule 
                        about not dating became...

                                 LINDSEY
                        Moot. 

                                 STEVIE
                        I knew it would work once I found 
                        out he was a Libra. Like, since I’m 
                        a Gemini. 

           Philip nods, actively listening.
                                 PHILIP
                        Great, great. I think I get what 
                        you’re all about. 

           Philip goes to the turntable and out comes “Spiders & Snakes” 
           by Jim Stafford. Its lobotomized take on Credence Clearwater 
           Revival blares at a deafening volume.

                                 PHILIP (CONT’D)
                           (yelling to be heard)
                        I have a mandate for stuff like 
                        this. Could you do stuff like this? 

                                 STEVIE
                           (yelling to be heard)
                        Maybe.

           Lindsey, ever the diplomat, silently gets up and swaps out 
           the 45 for their LP. 

           “Crying in the Night” by Buckingham Nicks fills the room. 
           Philip shakes his head at the sophisticated, silky tones. He 
           shuts it off before it can really get cooking. 

                                 PHILIP
                        It sounds like the Eagles, and, I 
                        don’t think I have to tell you, 
                        there’s only room for one Eagles. 

           Lindsey clenches his jaw, seething with rage. Stevie, having 
           seen this movie before, gently picks up their album and 
           interlocks her arm with Lindsey’s. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Philip, let us sleep on it. 

                                 PHILIP
                        Absolutely! If you ever want to 
                        make some real scratch, I’m here. 

           Stevie’s almost got Lindsey out the door when:

                                 LINDSEY
                        Silver.

           Philip’s face twists, not understanding the guitarist.

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        Greg won a Silver Medal.

                                 PHILIP
                        Sorry, that’s right, you’re right.
                                 LINDSEY
                        And now he sells insurance. Some 
                        fucking hero. 

           Lindsey slams the door behind them. 

           INT. BEAMER - MOVING - LATER

           Lindsey and Stevie put Capitol Records in the rear-view 
           mirror, as they head towards Silver Lake. “Desperado” by the 
           Eagles is on the radio. Lindsey slams his fist down on the 
           dash, shutting it off.

                                 STEVIE
                        I like that song, too.

                                 LINDSEY
                        We’re not the Eagles.

           Stevie shrugs and looks away. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Greg didn’t have to do this for us.

                                 LINDSEY
                        I didn’t ask him to, I didn’t ask 
                        him for anything!

                                 STEVIE
                           (firmly)
                        I did. 

           Stevie has the final word.

           EXT. SILVER LAKE FLEA - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           The beat up Beamer bangs a right into the parking lot of the 
           Silver Lake Flea. This is when Silverlake was actually 
           bohemian, not $3,200-a-month-for-a-studio bohemian. 

           Waiting for them is Stevie’s Rock of Gibraltar, Robin Snyder, 
           and, who’s the hunk standing next to her? It’s only her new 
           man, KIM ANDERSON (28).  

           Stevie bounds out of the car to embrace her bestie. Lindsey 
           remains seated. 

                                 ROBIN
                           (into the car)
                        Hey, Linds, this is Kim--
           Lindsey gives the very definition of a halfhearted wave and 
           peels out of the parking lot. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT’D)
                           (finishing the thought)
                        He’s into music, too.
                           (beat)
                        So, how was Capitol? 

           Stevie gives her a look. That look. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT’D)
                           (to Kim)
                        I promised you another boy to play 
                        with, but looks like he’s run off. 

                                 KIM
                        Don’t worry, I can entertain 
                        myself. 

           Robin and Kim do a little PDA before he leaves the gals to 
           themselves. 

           INT. SILVER LAKE FLEA - STALLS - MOMENTS LATER

           Stevie and Robin walk among the wares, while they catch up. 

                                 ROBIN
                        You had a meeting with a major 
                        label a week after getting dropped 
                        by a major label. It’s a matter of 
                        time. 

                                 STEVIE
                        It’s a matter of time when you’re 
                        18. It’s a matter of time when 
                        you’re 22. I’m 26. I’m over 
                        hearing, “It’s a matter of time.”   

                                 ROBIN
                        So is this, like... Are you giving 
                        up?

                                 STEVIE
                        No, actually...
                           (going into her pocket)
                        How’s this look? 

           Robin takes the napkin from earlier and reads. We see what 
           she sees: “Afraid of change? Built life around you/As the 
           landslide comes down”

           Robin looks up at Stevie from the lyrics. 
                                 ROBIN
                        Is everything OK? With you and 
                        Lindsey? 

                                 STEVIE
                        Oh, don’t give me that. You know I 
                        write in character. 

                                 ROBIN
                        What’s this character? A girl in a 
                        bad relationship, who’s “over a 
                        matter of time?”

           Stevie can only shake her head. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT’D)
                        I know “You’re So Vain” is about 
                        Warren Beatty being a jerk, as much 
                        as I know this is about you being 
                        mad at Lindsey. 

           Stevie, looking for a way out, grabs a black lace shawl off a 
           rack. She drapes it over herself and twirls. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Enough of that. How does this look? 

           Robin can’t help but be charmed by this display. 

                                 ROBIN
                        All you had to say was you didn’t 
                        want to talk about it. 

           The two friends laugh away the heavy. 

           INT. SOUND CITY - STUDIO - LATER

           Lindsey pokes his head back in the studio, tail firmly 
           between his legs. Keith couldn’t be less excited to see him.

                                 LINDSEY
                        You still need someone to, uh...

                                 KEITH
                        Well, look who decided to grow up. 

           INT. THE WORST STUDIO APARTMENT IN NOHO - NIGHT

           Stevie and Lindsey, both uniformed, arrive home from an 
           honest day’s work. 
                                 LINDSEY
                           (yawning)
                        You’re right about Mondays, they 
                        give you a lot of time to think. 

           Lindsey goes over to the mattress and picks up his guitar. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (back turned to Lindsey)
                        Oooh, what do you got?

           She riffles through her apron and digs out little scraps of 
           paper. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        You ready?

           Stevie turns back to find Lindsey passed out, complete with 
           guitar resting in his lap.

           She moves to jostle him awake, but thinks better of it.

           INT. BEAMER - PARKED - NIGHT

           Stevie sits alone in the car, listening to Top 40 radio and 
           smoldering. This is the catharsis she allows herself. 

                                 CASEY KASEM (V.O.)
                           (on radio)
                        ...And now coming in at #3, and 
                        climbing every week, “Spiders & 
                        Snakes” by Jim Stafford.

           As the hillbilly hootenanny hums, Stevie is transported back 
           to Capitol. A look of determination comes across her face.

           INT. WORST APARTMENT BUILDING IN ALL OF NOHO - HALLWAY - 
           NIGHT

           Stevie knocks on a door at the end of the hall. Their crappy 
           landlord answers.

                                 STEVIE
                        I need to borrow your phone.

           The landlord reluctantly allows her inside.

           EXT. WORST APARTMENT BUILDING IN ALL OF NOHO - MORNING

           The morning sun dapples the stained and cracked concrete of 
           the worst apartment building in all of NoHo.
           INT. THE WORST STUDIO APARTMENT IN NOHO  - CONTINUOUS

           Lindsey is asleep on the mattress, unmoved since last night.

           SLAM! SLAM! SLAM!

                                 CRAPPY LANDLORD (O.S.)
                        Buckingham, I know you’re in there!

           Lindsey shoots upright. He ambles to the door in a 
           disoriented state and opens it. 

           Their crappy landlord stands there, irritated.

                                 CRAPPY LANDLORD (CONT’D)
                        Do I look like a secretary to you? 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (confused)
                        What?

                                 CRAPPY LANDLORD
                        Does it look like I fetch your 
                        coffee and take your messages? 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (more confused)
                        What?

                                 CRAPPY LANDLORD
                        Messages like, “I’m fancy pants 
                        Philip from fancy pants records and 
                        I’m glad you reconsidered my fancy 
                        pants deal.”

                                 LINDSEY
                           (the most confused)
                        What?

                                 CRAPPY LANDLORD
                        I don’t know, ask your lady.

           The wheels in Lindsey’s head begin to turn.

           PRELAP: A slightly muted “After the Gold Rush” by Neil Young.

           INT. SOUND CITY - HALLWAY - DAY

           Lindsey, broom in hand, peers through the porthole window of 
           the studio door. He spies Keith trying to woo over a 
           potential client with Neil Young’s Canadian/Southern/Martian 
           folk. It’s even more muffled through the door. 
           The potential client is MICK FLEETWOOD (27), a Groovy Gandalf 
           with a mischievous glint in his eye, who doesn’t appear to be 
           enjoying this music one bit. 

           Mick says something to the effect of, “I don’t enjoy this 
           music one bit.” 

           Keith says something like, “Hold on, I’ll be right back.” 

           Lindsey clocks Keith walking briskly towards him and 
           sidesteps out of the way of the door to avoid his distracted 
           boss.

           Seizing his opportunity, Lindsey gathers himself and makes 
           his way into the studio. 

           INT. SOUND CITY - STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           Lindsey enters and pretends to clean. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Don’t mind me. Just tidying up.

           Mick continues not minding him. 

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        You’re Mick Fleetwood, right? The 
                        drummer?

           Mick nods, uninterested. 

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        Ya’ know, I have a 45 of 
                        “Albatross.” 

           That got him.

                                 MICK
                        Thanks, mate. Keeps me out of the 
                        poor house that one. Hendrix told 
                        me that he ripped off the licks in 
                        “Purple Haze” from us. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Cool... Wait, didn’t “Purple Haze” 
                        come out first? 

                                 MICK
                           (Caught)
                        Oh, maybe, but... But Mac had been 
                        doing it on the road for a stretch. 
                        He knew. Jimi told me himself. 
           Lindsey continues on his mission, a lie agreed upon. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Mind if I put on some tunes? The 
                        acoustics in here are killer.

                                 MICK
                        Please, that’s why I came to 
                        Hollywood, after all. 

           Lindsey moves over to the wall of records and snags 
           Buckingham Nicks with laser precision. 

           He cues up “Frozen Love,” an epic ode to the duo’s leather & 
           lace harmony, and goes back to “dusting.” 

           Thirty seconds in, Mick jumps to his feet. 

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                        Who’s this? 

           It registers in this moment that Mick’s very tall. So tall he 
           could grab Lindsey by the ankles and dangle him three feet 
           above the floor. Mick’s used to his lanky body, while a 
           slightly cowering Lindsey is not. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        It’s, uh, me. 

                                 MICK
                        It’s bloody fantastic! 
                           (beat)
                        What else ya got?

           Lindsey picks up a Gibson Les Paul and rips off every 
           scorching lick he’s mastered and some he hasn’t. Mick, 
           transfixed, oooh’s and aaah’s.

           INT. SOUND CITY - STUDIO - LATER

           The “meeting” between Lindsey and Mick continues. The boys 
           are getting on like a house on fire. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        The most underrated guitar player 
                        of all time is Johnny Lee Hooker. 

                                 MICK
                        Oh my God! Did you walk inside my 
                        brain and take that idea from me? 
                        Because I’ve been saying that for 
                        years. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MICK (CONT'D)
                           (beat)
                        You know what? You’re in the band.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Wait, what? I’m in a band. I mean, 
                        we could open for you.

                                 MICK
                        We need a guitarist to lay down 
                        some tracks and I’m looking at him. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        What about Stevie? 

                                 MICK
                        Who? 

                                 LINDSEY
                        My singer, my girlfriend.

           Lindsey grabs the album sleeve from the board and hands it to 
           Mick. The cover of Buckingham Nicks’ eponymous album includes 
           a risque photo of Lindsey and Stevie in the buff. 

           Mick thinks it over, looking back and forth between Lindsey 
           in front of him there in the studio and Stevie’s topless 
           photo on the album cover. Back and forth. Back. And forth.

                                 MICK
                           (shaking it off)
                        Look, I can hire you, lickity 
                        split. Two people? A singer? That’s 
                        a big decision. I’ll have to run it 
                        by the rest of my band, and I can’t 
                        guarantee you anything with them. 
                        So... What do you want to do? 

           The ball is firmly in Lindsey’s court. 

           INT. THE COPPER PENNY - LATER

           Lindsey enters. He spots Stevie, as she’s pouring coffee into 
           the mug of a customer.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Hey, Stevie, we need to talk...

           Stevie’s caught off guard by both his serious tone.

                                 STEVIE
                        Oh, yeah, sure. 
                           (to Asshole Manager)
                        I’m taking my ten!
                                 ASSHOLE MANAGER (O.S.)
                        You already took it!

                                 LINDSEY
                           (to Asshole Manager)
                        She can have mine! It’s important. 

           They tuck themselves into a secluded nook.

                                 STEVIE
                        Is everything OK? 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Um... An opportunity came up and I 
                        think it might be... I got an offer 
                        today, an offer to join Fleetwood 
                        Mac as their lead guitarist.
                           (beat)
                        And I accepted. 

           Stevie’s crestfallen, but does her best to hide it.

                                 STEVIE
                        What does this mean for us?

                                 LINDSEY
                        It’ll probably be the end of 
                        Buckingham Nicks.
                           (beat; smirks)
                        Because I only agreed on the 
                        condition that we join together. 
                        What do you say?

           Stevie’s on Cloud 9, completely relieved.

                                 STEVIE
                        Yes, of course!
                           (coming down)
                        Fleetwood who?

           INT. THE WORST STUDIO APARTMENT IN NOHO - LATER

           Lindsey and Stevie crowd around their record player to hear 
           the Fleetwood Mac single, “Albatross.” Former guitarist Peter 
           Green strums some brilliant blues chords for getting blazed. 
           By Stevie’s estimation that’s all it’s good for. 

                                 STEVIE
                        This is terrible. There’s no 
                        vocals.  
                                 LINDSEY
                        That’s why they need you. Trust me, 
                        Hendrix loved this. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (disgusted)
                        Hendrix liked the Monkees.

           Stevie inspects the record sleeve. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        1968? What’ve they been doing? I 
                        can’t believe you signed us up for 
                        this. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        We still need to meet the whole 
                        band, first. It’s one dinner. It’s 
                        not like it’s a big commitment. 

           INT. EL CARMEN MEXICAN RESTAURANT - BAR - NIGHT

           Lindsey and Stevie scan the dining room for the other members 
           of their party. It takes two seconds to clock the raucous 
           British musicians among the other straight laced patrons. 

           Mick, he of majestic beard and scarves, towers over his 
           compatriots CHRISTINE MCVIE (31) and JOHN MCVIE (29). 

           Christine has a regal air to her, appearing equally adept at 
           both breeding corgis and sending people to the hangman.

           John is drunk, and he intends to stay that way for the rest 
           of the movie.

           Stevie makes eye contact with Lindsey, as if to say, “We have 
           one last chance to back out.” 

                                 MICK
                        Lindsey, over here!

           Nope. Too late. 

           Mick’s waving them over, spilling his “El Perfecto” Margarita 
           as he does. No matter, he gets the bartender’s attention and 
           gestures for three more.  

           Stevie and Lindsey join the rest of the group at the bar. 

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                        Stevie, you look lovely.
           Mick bends down for a friendly peck on the cheek that’s a bit 
           too friendly. 

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                        This is John McVie, he and I form 
                        the rhythm section, as well as our 
                        namesake. Tell ‘em how we met.

                                 JOHN
                           (slurred)
                        Uh, we were over at a spot. Mick 
                        wanted to start a band, so, yeah, 
                        we did.

                                 MICK
                        Couldn’t have said it better 
                        myself. And this fetching creature 
                        is John’s missus and our 
                        keyboardist hyphen singer, 
                        Christine. 

           Christine offers a limp wrist by way of introduction. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (making a connection)
                        I’m a singer, too!

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Charming.
                           (beat)
                        I like your necklace. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Thank you! My friend Ro--

           GGGGRRRRRRR! The bartender’s blender drowns out Stevie’s 
           response. She waits for it to finish. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        My friend Robin made--

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I wasn’t that interested. I just 
                        “like” it.

           The Margaritas hit the bar, Mick distributes them. 

                                 MICK
                        Let the dinner commence. 

           The group is seated in a corner booth. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Shouldn’t we wait for your manager? 
                                 MICK
                           (shit eating grin)
                        You’re looking at him! 

           CHIPS AND GUAC

           Everyone enjoys the appetizer. Mick’s midway through his 
           explanation of why he’s their new manager. 

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                        ...We took the guy to court, we had 
                        to, he was touring a band under 
                        false pretenses. “Mr. Davis, you’re 
                        out there with a fake Fleetwood 
                        Mac. That’s fraudulent!” How could 
                        we trust anyone after that?

           FLAMING FAJITAS

           The group digs in on some fried peppers and skirt steak. 

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                        ...It’s a mystery to us. You think 
                        it’d be easy to keep a guitarist. 
                        There are enough of them out of 
                        work. Right, Lindsey? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Peter left such a big shoes to 
                        fill. That poor little Jew, his 
                        mind went...

                                 JOHN
                           (slurred)
                        Fucking mad, that one. 

                                 MICK
                        Of course, you know, then Bob got 
                        seduced by that cult. Children of 
                        God, was it? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        No, you’re all confused now. Bob 
                        made a cuckold out of you. Jeremy 
                        was the one who found a “higher 
                        calling.” 

                                 MICK
                        Right, I thought it was Danny I 
                        found boffing Jenny, my wife. I’ll 
                        be honest, fidelity was never a 
                        pillar of our union. My... Tusk has 
                        a mind of its own. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        Danny announced his exit by 
                        smashing his face against a brick 
                        wall, then heckled us from the 
                        wings when we decided to go on 
                        anyway... 

           FLAN AND COFFEE

           Lindsey and Stevie pick at their desserts. They look as if 
           they’ve aged ten years in an evening. 

                                 MICK
                        ...We’ve got one record left on our 
                        deal with Warner’s and we figure we 
                        oughtta make it count. And your 
                        sound, I think it’s exactly the 
                        shot in the arm we’ve been looking 
                        for.
                           (beat)
                        I’m sorry, we’ve been jabbering all 
                        night, and I know next to nothing 
                        about you. How’d you get started?

           Stevie and Lindsey look at each other: “How do we follow 
           that?”

                                 STEVIE
                        Boring, normal story. Met as 
                        teenagers, started playing music, 
                        and became a couple, eventually. 
                        That’s all of it. Nothing fancy.

                                 MICK
                        Love it, to the point. So, what do 
                        you say? 

           After the briefest of hesitations:

                                 LINDSEY
                        When do we start?

           Stevie can’t believe her ears. Before she knows it, everyone 
           is shaking hands and hugging. 

                                 MICK
                        Alright, we’ll see you Monday. 

           EXT. EL CARMEN MEXICAN RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           The three elder members of Fleetwood Mac have gone their own 
           way, leaving the two newest ones behind for their postgame 
           analysis. 
                                 STEVIE
                        You just agreed to that? We didn’t 
                        talk contracts, we didn’t talk 
                        money, we don’t even know when 
                        we’re meeting on Monday.

                                 LINDSEY
                        We’ll hammer it out. Trust me, 
                        there’s no way they know either. I 
                        mean, would you rather do novelties 
                        for Philip?

                                 STEVIE
                        It’s better than ending up cursed. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Big deal, they’ve have some lineup 
                        changes. So have the Stones.

                                 STEVIE
                        I don’t think it matters who’s in 
                        the band. Obviously...

                                 LINDSEY
                        It’s one album. A tour, if that 
                        does alright. It’s not like we 
                        agreed to work with them for the 
                        rest of our lives. 

                                 STEVIE
                        We’re supposed to be a team. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        We are. But the longer we play, the 
                        harder it is to win. We need a new 
                        game plan. Otherwise, I’m scrubbing 
                        floors and you’re pouring coffee. 
                        We’re better than that. You’re 
                        better than that.

           Suddenly, the sky opens up and the couple is caught in the 
           rain.

                                 STEVIE
                        And now it’s raining. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Feels right, doesn’t it?

           A smile creeps up on Stevie. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Since I’ve been with you, every 
                        chance has been our last chance. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)
                        Is this a last chance, or a last 
                        last chance? 

           Lindsey’s about to answer when:

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        Nevermind.

           She pulls him in for a kiss in the downpour. 

                                 STEVIE (PRELAP) (CONT’D)
                           (singing)
                        “I took my love, I took it down...” 

           INT. SOUND CITY - STUDIO - DAY

           The newest lineup of Fleetwood Mac has assembled to listen to 
           Stevie bring the lyric napkin to life. You’ll know it as 
           “Landslide.” Even in its nascent form it’s as haunting as it 
           remains today. As always, Lindsey accompanies her on guitar. 

           Stevie winds down the performance without a finish. 

                                 STEVIE
                        It would kinda go on like that... I 
                        could try to, um... What do you 
                        think so far?

           The Brits look among themselves to see who should talk first. 
           Mick takes the lead. 

                                 MICK
                           (delicate)
                        It’s a little slow for a single. 
                        It’s alright, we’ll come back to 
                        it. Ya’ know, Da Vinci didn’t paint 
                        the Mona Lisa overnight? Or, did 
                        Michelangelo do his... Ceiling, 
                        also, overnight? 

           No one’s quite sure how rhetorical this question’s supposed 
           to be.

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                        Chris, what was the thing you were 
                        working on? That you showed me? Do 
                        that. 

           Christine, stationed behind her keyboard, plunks out some 
           notes that are identifiable to modern ears as, “Say You Love 
           Me,” then abruptly quits. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        It’s something that moves and 
                        grooves. No lyrics, thus far. But 
                        I’ll put “love” in there somewhere. 
                        People love “love.” 

                                 STEVIE
                        That’s cynical. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        That’s pop music. 

           Lindsey “yes and’s” Christine’s point-of-view. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I like what you’ve got there. Off 
                        the top of my head, we should have 
                        a boss bassline going--

                                 JOHN
                           (slurred)
                        Oy, the band you’re in is Fleetwood 
                        Mac. I’m the Mac. I play the bass. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (testy)
                        Sorry, did I step on your 
                        suggestion? Your idea?

           Mick and Stevie, almost simultaneously, go get their mans and 
           cool everything down. 

                                 MICK
                        No use torturing the music out of 
                        us. We can afford to give ourselves 
                        a couple... Eh, one extra day on 
                        this thing.
                           (game plan)
                        You’ll bring some more material, 
                        we’ll bring some more material, 
                        we’ll all put it together.

           Before Stevie and Lindsey have a chance to raise a hand in 
           protest, Mick has fished a Heineken out of a waiting cooler, 
           cracked it open, and exited stage left. 

           INT. THE WORST STUDIO APARTMENT IN NOHO - LATER

           Stevie lays defeated on the mattress, as Lindsey paces about 
           their cramped space. 

                                 STEVIE
                        I told you they wouldn’t like it.
                                 LINDSEY
                        That’s one person’s opinion.

                                 STEVIE
                        It was three.  

                                 LINDSEY
                        Tomorrow we’ll show them something 
                        different. We’ll show them why they 
                        need us.

                                 STEVIE
                        You want to write something brand 
                        new? Tonight? 

                                 LINDSEY
                        It only has to be new to them. Take 
                        “Monday Morning.” Or “Rhiannon.”

                                 STEVIE
                        “Rhiannon” is even longer and 
                        slower than “Landslide.” 

                                 LINDSEY
                        It doesn’t have to be...

           Lindsey files through their vinyl collection. With surprising 
           ease, out comes a copy of Pet Sounds by The Beach Boys. 

           He searches for “God Only Knows” along the grooves. A 
           melancholy pocket orchestra emanates from the player. 

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        Brian Wilson packs an entire 
                        lifetime in under three minutes, 
                        and he knew it had to be under 
                        three minutes, or it wouldn’t be on 
                        the radio. 

                                 STEVIE
                        It wasn’t on the radio. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Neither are our songs.

           Stevie gets up and paces around the room in tandem with 
           Lindsey. They think, think, think... 

           Finally:

                                 STEVIE
                        “A woman taken by the wind.” 
                        “Rhiannon” moves like the wind. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)
                        We need to move like the wind. Up 
                        the tempo.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Yeah, we can definitely do that.
                           (beat)
                        We could, also, bring in “Monday 
                        Morning.” It already zips by pretty 
                        fast. Less changes. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (one track mind)
                        And the whole bridge, all that 
                        noodling, let’s yank it. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Hold on, that’s what Mick was into 
                        in the first place.

                                 STEVIE
                        So? We’re already in. Besides, you 
                        said he wanted to move in a 
                        different direction. Less guitar 
                        would be different.
                           (noticing)
                        Hey, we’ve been talking longer than 
                        the Beach Boys have been 
                        harmonizing. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (thunder stolen)
                        Yeah, that was my... Hand me the... 
                        Let’s yank that bridge. 

           INT. SOUND CITY - STUDIO - DAY

           Everyone’s back for day two. Stevie’s at the keyboard making 
           last second changes in her notebook. The other members wait 
           on bated breath for what she has prepared.  

           Suddenly, Stevie, one-handed, bangs out the opening chords to 
           “Rhiannon”. She’s about to open her mouth to sing when...

           INT. SOUND CITY - BOARD - DAY

           Keith sits in command of the board, flanked by the band, 
           listening. You can see the months of work in the bags under 
           their eyes and the blisters on their fingers. 

                                 FLEETWOOD MAC (V.O.)
                           (from the speakers)
                        “Rhiaaaaannnoooonnn...”
           Keith stops the tape.

                                 KEITH
                        It sounds like solid fucking gold. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        One man’s opinion. 

                                 KEITH
                        Look, the album’s wrapped, you need 
                        this mix for the radio. You tour in 
                        two weeks. Do you want people at 
                        the gigs or not? 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Sorry, I thought you were our 
                        engineer, not our promoter.
                           (beat)
                        Guys, one more take, one more take 
                        on the vocals. We can do it right 
                        now.

           The sound in the room drops out for a beat. 

                                 MICK
                        The vocals? The vocals are the 
                        song. You know how many shoeboxes 
                        of blow we needed to get 
                        “Albatross” on the air in LA? The 
                        vocals are the blow.

                                 LINDSEY
                        When we repeat the chorus, Stevie 
                        comes off sharp on “stay.” Are we 
                        alright with that?

                                 MICK
                        Those are the moments that give it 
                        personality. Those stay with 
                        people. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Yeah, that’s what will stay with 
                        people, Stevie blowing the note. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (firmly)
                        Let’s talk in the hallway.

           Stevie ushers him out.
           INT. SOUND CITY - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Stevie backs Lindsey into a corner.

                                 LINDSEY
                        This is the creative process. I 
                        need to be able to speak my mind. 
                        You know it’s not personal.

                                 STEVIE
                        Yep, yup, mmhmm, for sure. Here’s 
                        another part of the creative 
                        process: Being cool. Nobody wants 
                        to work with someone who doesn’t 
                        play nice. I thought we were in 
                        this together.

                                 LINDSEY
                        We are in this together. That’s why 
                        I’m doing it. We need this to be as 
                        clean as possible. Think about 
                        “Monday Morning.” It’s so crisp, 
                        you can’t even tell how crisp it 
                        is. It’s invisible. I’m not saying 
                        it should be the single--

                                 STEVIE
                        Neither is anyone else. 

           Lindsey simmers a bit. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        We got the chance to do what we do, 
                        our way. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (heart of the matter)
                        But what if no one cares? 

                                 STEVIE
                        Then everything stays exactly the 
                        same. We’re still in this together.

           Stevie gestures for them to rejoin the room.

           INT. SOUND CITY - STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           Lindsey and Stevie re-enter the studio. A more solemn room is 
           waiting for them. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        What’s going on?
           Keith’s holding the phone, his face somber. 

                                 KEITH
                        You’re going to want to take this.

           Keith extends the receiver for Lindsey, who accepts it with 
           trepidation. 

           INT. BEAMER - DAY

           Lindsey and Stevie have returned back to Palo Alto to the 
           church they met in all those years ago. Draped in black, they 
           sit in silence.

                                 LINDSEY
                        You remember the time my dad 
                        stumbled onto us toking in the 
                        garage? He said he’d rather we be 
                        necking.

                                 STEVIE
                           (choked up)
                        I do, but, maybe, not one for the 
                        eulogy. 
                           (beat)
                        Oh, that reminds me.

           She digs into her purse and pulls out a bag of joints.

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        I rolled these for you. 

           Lindsey accepts them and nods, numbly. 

           They go to join the other mourners. 

           INT. FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           They find Robin and Kim already waiting for them. Robin 
           embraces Stevie. She turns to Lindsey.  

                                 ROBIN
                        Linds, there are no words. 

           Lindsey nods. He seems to agree. 

           From the first row, we hear Ruth’s loud wailing. Lindsey, 
           silently, excuses himself to be with her. 

           We move up to the front, where Lindsey puts an arm around his 
           grieving mother. It doesn’t seem to soothe her. 
                                 GREG (O.S.)
                        Nice of you to wear a fitting suit. 

           Lindsey, tears in his eyes, gets up to embrace Greg. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 GREG
                        Shh... Shh... It’s OK.
                           (beat)
                        Let’s give Mom some space. 

           The brothers adjourn to a more private area. 

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        She’s been like this since it 
                        happened.  

                                 LINDSEY
                        Shit... I just realized I’ll never 
                        be able to buy Dad dinner. 

           The boys share a well-needed, cleansing laugh. 

                                 GREG
                        Trust me, it wasn’t all it was 
                        cracked up to be.

           They have to stifle their chuckling, at this point. 

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        After talking with Philip, it 
                        didn’t seem like there was a chance 
                        of that happening any time soon. 

           A line has been crossed, they both know it. 

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean that... I want you to 
                        do well. That’s all. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Uh-huh. 

           Lindsey begins to walk away. 

                                 GREG
                        Come back, I’m sorry. 

           Lindsey, almost at the exit, walks by Stevie. 
                                 STEVIE
                           (concerned)
                        Where’re you going? 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I’m... This is a lot, and you need 
                        me fresh for the tour, right?
                           (beat)
                        I just need some air. Fresh air. 

           EXT. FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           Lindsey goes to light one of the joints Stevie gave him, but 
           his hands won’t stop shaking, preventing his release. 

           He throws everything to the ground, crumples down after them, 
           sobbing uncontrollably.

           INT. EL PASO COUNTY COLISEUM - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           The sardine can of a green room is crammed full. The band 
           each individually prepares in their own way to kick off the 
           tour. 

           Per usual, John’s drunk and working on getting drunker. 

           Stevie, sharing a couch with Christine, pours over her 
           lyrics. Christine, the old pro, is a level of relaxed that 
           would make the Buddha envious.

                                 STEVIE
                           (anxious)
                        We’re getting play here, huh?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        So they say. 

                                 STEVIE
                        I don’t want you to think I’m, 
                        like, freaking out or anything. 
                        It’s just we’ve never played a 
                        venue this big... And full. Except, 
                        maybe, Mobile, but, ya’ know, 
                        that’s not El Paso. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Sweetheart, I have just the thing 
                        for your jitters. 

           Christine removes her necklace, on the end of which is a 
           small vial of cocaine. She portions the contents onto her 
           fingernail and moves it towards Stevie. 
                                 STEVIE
                        This’ll help me perform?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Sure. 

           Stevie does the bump, and there’s an instant pep in her step. 

           Off in a corner, Lindsey focuses on tuning his guitar like a 
           bomb tech cutting wires. 

           Mick saunters over to the guitarist with a pair of Heinekens. 

                                 MICK
                        One of these is for you. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (without looking up)
                        No thanks. 

           Mick doesn’t mind drinking them both. He pulls up a stool. 

                                 MICK
                        Have I ever told you about my 
                        father?
                           (diving in)
                        He was in the Royal Air Force. 
                        Force of nature. Larger than--

                                 LINDSEY
                        I get what you’re trying to do, 
                        and... Let’s focus on the gig. 

                                 MICK
                        I guess I wanted to say we 
                        appreciate you soldiering on. 

           Lindsey nods and goes back to his tuning. 

           As Mick leaves:

                                 LINDSEY
                        Thanks.

           It’s a small move, but one in the right direction. 

           INT. EL PASO COUNTY COLISEUM - STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Big room, bright lights, rumbling crowd. This is it. The 
           moment they’ve been working towards. The band takes their 
           places. Stevie, front and center, stands at her mic.
                                 STEVIE
                           (to crowd)
                        Hello, El Paso...

           The zeal of their response overwhelms Stevie. We’re not in 
           Jungle Jim’s anymore. 

           She stands still, not sure what to do next. 

           Lindsey peels off the opening riff to “Rhiannon.” 

                                 CROWD
                           (in unison)
                        AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!

                                 STEVIE
                           (to crowd)
                        This is a song about an old Welsh 
                        witch. 

           Stevie, still nervous, starts off shaky. As the song builds, 
           the crowd recognizes it and sings along. The alleged air play 
           has paid off. Stevie’s vocals gain confidence.

           When the time comes, Lindsey rips off a towering guitar solo 
           where the bridge had been. It more than makes up for the 
           quiet radio mix. It takes the concertgoers and, frankly, the 
           rest of the band by surprise.

           Stevie, however, recognizes it instantly. Perhaps fueled by 
           the powder, she twirls wildly around the stage, whipping her 
           shawl like a matador’s cape.

           The audience loses their collective mind at the sight of her 
           spontaneous dance. Lindsey sees all too clearly the source of 
           the fans excitement. He downshifts back into the song proper. 

           Mick, Christine, and John pick up on the cue, and lead Stevie 
           to a rousing finish. 

           This version of Fleetwood Mac can really fucking cook.

           TOUR MONTAGE: 

           We catch snippets of shows from every mid-major market across 
           the United States, as the Fleetwood Mac tour bus rolls along 
           an overlaid map, Raiders of the Lost Ark-style. 

           Each show grows in size and intensity. Beyond the music, we 
           see the fun and games of life on the road e.g. hotel room 
           trashings, groupie indulgences, and the drugs, oh, the drugs.
           Over the montage, we hear “Monday Morning” for the first 
           time. The rhythm section is driving and strong, and it really 
           does zip by. But, at the end of the day, it’s no “Rhiannon”.

           END SUCCESSFUL TOUR MONTAGE

           INT. BUFFALO NEW CENTURY THEATRE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Stevie’s as far away from the action as the telephone cord 
           will allow, as she reads from a newspaper clipping. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (into phone; reading)
                        “Nicks, whose black wardrobe puts 
                        her in league with the occult...” 
                        Can you believe that shit? Did they 
                        ever consider black is slimming? 
                           (beat)
                        I know, Alice Cooper’s “putting on 
                        a show,” but I’m the chick in the 
                        band who worships Satan.
                           (beat)
                        Other than that, everything’s been 
                        amazing, but I want you to know, 
                        I’m so heartbroken I can’t be 
                        there. They just keep adding on 
                        more dates. 

           INTERCUT:

           INT. FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Robin, in her flowing wedding gown, cradles the phone to her 
           ear, as she waits for her ceremony to begin. She’s surrounded 
           by bridesmaids, who file out one by one, as the conversation 
           continues. 

                                 ROBIN
                        It’s OK, you’re living your 
                        dream... How’s Lindsey handling all 
                        this? 

                                 STEVIE
                           (finishing a bump)
                        Who? Oh, I mean, yeah, um... 

           Stevie looks over her shoulder to see Lindsey in a screaming 
           match with lighting director CURRY GRANT (30). 

                                 CURRY
                        How hard is it give me the solo 
                        cues before the gig?
                                 LINDSEY
                        Do you have any fucking idea what I 
                        do...?

           Back to the call.

                                 STEVIE
                        He’s doing great. 

                                 ROBIN
                        I’m just so happy for you guys. 

           An organ bellows out the opening notes of “Here Comes the 
           Bride.” 

                                 ROBIN (CONT’D)
                        That’s my cue. I gotta go. Love 
                        you.

                                 STEVIE
                        OK, love you!

           They both hang up and take their respective stages. 

                                 STEVIE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                           (to crowd)
                        Hello, Buffalo! This is a song 
                        about... 

           She’s drowned out in the crowd’s exultations, as the band, 
           full throttle, kicks into “Rhiannon.” 

           PRELAP: The radio edit of “Rhiannon” coming through tinny 
           speakers... 

           EXT. BUS DEPOT - PARKING LOT - DAY

           The Fleetwood Mac tour bus pulls up to its final destination 
           after having successfully criss-crossed the continental 48.

           Crew members offload equipment with precision, while the band 
           members amble out, hungover-dly. 

                                 MICK
                        All’s well, that ends well, but 
                        it’s not over yet. 

           Mick pulls out a creased copy of Billboard from his back 
           pocket. 

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                        Another week in the Hot 100, 
                        another check to cash. 
                                 LINDSEY
                        Cool, so, we get back in the studio 
                        next week?

                                 STEVIE
                        Yeah, I have some lyrics to finesse 
                        with everyone--

                                 MICK
                        Whoa, there, easy! When I was your 
                        age, we were on album seven in year 
                        five. Look at this face... 
                           (beat)
                        It’s nothing to aspire to. Go live 
                        a little life, do something worth 
                        writing about. When was the last 
                        time you had dinner, just the two 
                        of you?

           Stevie and Lindsey look to one another, uncertain.

           INT. VOLARE'S ITALIAN - DINING ROOM - LATER

           Stevie and Lindsey have ordered for themselves quite a feast. 

                                 STEVIE
                        It’s just occurred to me that I’m 
                        not very hungry. 

           Stevie portions out a bump on the tip of her silver dessert 
           spoon. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        That’s happening more frequently. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (wiping her nose)
                        Sorry, I’m a little tired. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        About those lyrics you-- 

                                 STEVIE
                        Mick is right. We need to be us for 
                        a minute. 

           Some time passes, as the two pick at their food.

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s like “Rhiannon.” That was 
                        divinely inspired. You can’t go 
                        looking for that sort of thing. 
                                 LINDSEY
                        What are you talking about? I was 
                        there when we wrote it, and I 
                        didn’t forget when we re-wrote it. 
                           (beat)
                        So, let’s be clear, “Rhiannon” 
                        isn’t inspired, it’s popular. Tie-
                        dye was popular. Hell, Nixon was 
                        popular. And we put in the work to 
                        make it popular. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Why would you say that? That’s such 
                        an asshole thing to say. 

           Lindsey’s taken aback by Stevie’s directness. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I don’t like you giving the credit 
                        up to gods and ghosts, OK? We all 
                        worked on it, but it’s your song. 
                        You deserve it.

                                 STEVIE
                        That’s what this is about?
                           (beat)
                        You’re jealous? 

           Before Lindsey gets the chance to retort, an ANXIOUS FAN 
           (20s) approaches the table. 

                                 ANXIOUS FAN
                        Lindsey! Are you Lindsey 
                        Buckingham? From Fleetwood Mac? 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (annoyed)
                        Yeah, what?

                                 ANXIOUS FAN
                        Not you... Her. 

           The confusion stuns Lindsey for a moment. Stevie takes 
           control.

                                 STEVIE
                        Yes, yes I am. 

                                 ANXIOUS FAN
                        I knew it. Oh my God. Lindsey, you 
                        have the best voice. So raw, so 
                        real. I can’t get it out of my 
                        head.

                                 ANXIOUS FAN (CONT'D)
                        I saw a photo of you in Creem with 
                        your black... Wait, is that... 
                        It... The one? 

           With every compliment, Stevie nods along, basking in the 
           glory of it all. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Thank you so much. I have to admit 
                        that I couldn’t have done it 
                        without the great Stevie Nicks. 
                        He’s so good on the guitar, his ear 
                        for melody is unmatched. 
                           (dripping with sarcasm)
                        Is that what he wanted to hear?

           The actual Lindsey gets up from the table. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        “Lindsey,” you got the bill? 

           Lindsey stomps away, leaving behind a smug as a bug Stevie. 

           EXT. HYATT HOUSE - POOL - NIGHT

           That night, at the Hyatt House’s pool, there’s a real rock 
           ‘n’ roll rager happening. Here are just a few of the 
           attendees: The Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, what’s left of The 
           Doors, Harry Nilsson, plus a rumor of Led Zeppelin showing 
           up. 

           Stevie, on a lounge chair, sips Prosecco and hoovers nose 
           candy. Robin, at her side, participating only in the former.    

                                 STEVIE
                        Can you believe he did that? 

                                 ROBIN
                        Um, yeah, I can. 

                                 STEVIE
                        It’s just, like, why is he... He 
                        should know. Everyone thinks he’s 
                        good, already. What’s his deal? 

           Christine, the unofficial hostess of this soiree, saunters 
           over between the ladies.  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        My two cents...

                                 STEVIE
                        I didn’t ask. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                           (ignoring)
                        When I was in the crowd and John 
                        was onstage, everything was golden. 
                        The moment he asked me to join them 
                        up there, we had problems. Being in 
                        a band with someone is difficult. 
                        Being in a relationship is even 
                        more difficult. Being in both? 
                        Impossible. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Wait, are you quitting the--

                                 CHRISTINE
                        No, darling, I’m getting a divorce. 
                        Which means...

           Christine spots an attractive and eligible scenester across 
           the pool and makes her move. 

           As quickly as Christine has left, Harry, that bastard from 
           Polydor, comes up behind them. 

                                 HARRY
                        Did I hear something about 
                        quitting? 

                                 STEVIE
                        For fuck’s sake...

           Stevie turns to face the voice. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        Harry! What’re you...? I wouldn’t 
                        expect to see you at a place like 
                        this. 

                                 HARRY
                        I got a lotta friends from work.

           Harry waves at Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant, who 
           despite clearly seeing him, doesn’t reciprocate the gesture. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Can I tell you a story? I was 
                        driving to the office awhile back, 
                        in my brand new car. I never buy 
                        new cars, against my religion, but 
                        my son, he’s only four, has this 
                        poster up on his wall. Pontiac 
                        Firebird, cherry red, beautiful and 
                        he thinks it’s the coolest car in 
                        the--
                                 STEVIE
                        Point, point. 

                                 HARRY
                        I’m driving along, in my Firebird, 
                        and what should come on the radio 
                        but “Rhiiaaaannon.” I nearly 
                        crashed my beloved, new Firebird. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Shocked? 

                                 HARRY
                        Angry. I wanted to kill myself. If 
                        I had heard that, I never would’ve 
                        let you walk. I always knew Nicks 
                        was the talent. When you’re done 
                        being “the chick in that band,” 
                        call me. 

           Harry leaves Stevie with his business card and goes off to 
           get snubbed by other beautiful people. 

           Stevie makes quick use of the card by portioning out a line 
           with it. 

                                 ROBIN
                        He might have a point. 

                                 STEVIE
                        I’m not going solo. Jesus Christ, I 
                        live with Lindsey. He can be... 
                        Challenging, but the good times 
                        always outweigh the bad.

                                 ROBIN
                        What was the last “good” moment you 
                        guys shared? 

           Stevie thinks for a second. 

                                 STEVIE
                        I know it, I know exactly what it 
                        is, it was the night we decided to 
                        join Mac.
                           (beat; wistful)
                        We had our backs against a cliff, 
                        nowhere else to go, and we decided, 
                        together, this was our destiny. We 
                        were out on the street, and we 
                        shared this kiss. It was like a 
                        first kiss, last kiss, it was, 
                        like, the only kiss anyone ever 
                        had.

                                 STEVIE (CONT'D)
                        Then it started to rain and, Robin, 
                        we stood there in it, holding each 
                        other.

           Robin polishes off her champagne flute. 

                                 ROBIN
                        So, the last time you were happy 
                        was getting wet, over a year ago?

           Stevie shakes this off, her eyes moving around the party, as 
           if she’s, literally, looking for justification. 

           Instead, she finds eye contact with Eagles drummer DON HENLEY 
           (29), who looks a little like Lindsey, if you inflated him in 
           all the right places. No justification to be found there. 

           INT. TOWER RECORDS - DAY

           Lindsey dances through the aisles of Tower Records, 
           obsessively filling a cart with the gaps in his record 
           collection. He’s found his happy place.

           A STARSTRUCK SHOPGIRL (20s) has finally worked up the courage 
           to approach him.

                                 STARSTRUCK SHOPGIRL
                        Are you finding everything alright, 
                        uh, Mr. Buckingham? 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I heard there was a special UK 
                        pressing of “My Generation” where 
                        Roger actually says, “fuck.” Do you 
                        have that?

                                 STARSTRUCK SHOPGIRL
                        I’m not sure... I’ll check!

           The shopgirl scurries off. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (after her)
                        And when you find it, can you blast 
                        that over the sound system? I want 
                        to hear it, loud.

                                 STARSTRUCK SHOPGIRL
                        Right away!

           Lindsey smiles to himself. What a way to live...
                                 MICK (O.S.)
                        Linds! I thought that was you!

           Lindsey turns to see Mick bounding towards him in long 
           strides. “Pleased” is not how we’d describe Lindsey’s 
           reaction.

                                 LINDSEY
                        What’re you doing here?

                                 MICK
                        Same as you, staying on the cutting 
                        edge. 

           Mick brandishes a copy of ABBA’s eponymous 1975 album.

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                        What’ve you sniffed out?

           Mick starts digging through Lindsey’s selections. 

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                           (circumspect)
                        Captain Beefheart? New York Dolls? 
                        #1 Record by Big Star? #1 where? 
                        Timbuktu? 

           The rebellious opening notes of “My Generation” explode over 
           the store’s loud speakers. 

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                           (re: the song; yelling)
                        That’s what I’m talking about!

                                 LINDSEY
                        This has been fun, but...

           Lindsey, leaving his purchases behind, heads for the exit. 
           Mick follows. 

                                 MICK
                        How about we hit the town tonight? 
                        You, me, Stevie, and whatever fox 
                        that I entrap in my snare. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (not turning back)
                        We’re busy. 

                                 MICK
                        Wait, Linds! 

           Mick catches Lindsey right before the doors. 
                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                        I have news for you!

                                 LINDSEY
                           (whipping around)
                        What?

                                 MICK
                        We’re going to start recording the 
                        follow-up. Sooner than anticipated, 
                        I know. I wanted to tell you 
                        tonight, over drinks. Celebrate, 
                        properly. 
                           (beat)
                        I thought about it and no time like 
                        the present to capitalize on our 
                        resounding success. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (incredulous)
                        Uh-huh, Warner Brothers called?

                                 MICK
                        And they’re desperate for us! They 
                        even finagled the most gorgeous 
                        studio in all of California. It’s 
                        up in Sausalito, so a little taste 
                        of home for you and Stevie. We’ll 
                        commence next week. 

           Mick stands at the ready for his due praise. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Fine. 

           Lindsey, without another word, departs, leaving Mick, for the 
           first time, speechless. 

           INT. WORST APARTMENT BUILDING IN ALL OF NOHO - NIGHT

           Lindsey packs up some changes of underwear, a leather jacket, 
           and his Gibson Les Paul for a trip that could span months. 

           He hears an engine idling outside the window. Peering down to 
           the street, he spies Stevie riding shotgun in Don Henley’s 
           1976 Revenge Orange Corvette Stingray. 

           She hops out with nothing more than a wave and heads to the 
           apartment. 

           Lindsey watches Don watch Stevie go. 
           After a moment, the drummer peels out in a cloud of dust, as 
           the door to their hovel opens. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Hey, you’re still up. 
                           (re: suitcase)
                        Are you going somewhere? 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Maybe I should ask where you’re 
                        coming from. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Oh, just a party. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Any mutual friends? 

                                 STEVIE
                        Like, the usual suspects, 
                        Christine, Robin... Oh! Harry was 
                        there on his hands and knees--

                                 LINDSEY
                        That’s exactly the kind of car I 
                        thought Don Henley would drive. 

           Stevie scoffs.

                                 STEVIE
                        Get over yourself. Our place was on 
                        Don’s way home to Laurel Canyon. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        That’s 20 minutes south of us. 

                                 STEVIE
                        If something was happening, it 
                        would be happening, and since 
                        nothing is happening, fucking trust 
                        me. 

           Lindsey shakes off Stevie’s repetitive defense. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I’m just your second hand news, I 
                        guess. 

                                 STEVIE
                        No one has taken your place, 
                        alright? So, are you leaving me or 
                        what?
                                 LINDSEY
                        I ran into Mick. We’re recording in 
                        Sausalito. Label wants it 
                        yesterday. 

                                 STEVIE
                        This is... A good thing. The start 
                        of something new. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Exactly what we need. 

           Neither seem entirely convinced by this exchange.

           PRELAP: 1965’s “Love Hurts” by the Everly Brothers plays on 
           the radio.

           INT. BEAMER - MOVING - DAY

           We’re in the car with Stevie and Lindsey on the drive North. 
           The country twang on the radio is a lotta bit on the nose, 
           which escapes neither person.

           Stevie hits another preset button. Cue Nazareth’s 1975 cover 
           of the same song. 

           Stevie gives up completely and turns off the radio. 

           Beat.

                                 LINDSEY
                        I like that song.

           Stevie rolls her eyes.

           EXT. THE RECORD PLANT - PARKING LOT - LATER

           Their beat up Beamer pulls into the lot of the Record Plant. 
           It couldn’t be anymore the antithesis of Sound City in Van 
           Nuys. 

           Its rustic exterior blends it into the surrounding majestic 
           Redwoods, ensuring a secluded spot for maximum productivity. 

           Waiting for them, lounging on the hood of his new highlighter 
           yellow Ferrari, is their fearless manager/drummer, Mick. 

           Stevie and Lindsey get out of the car to gawk. 

                                 MICK
                        They don’t do this colour off the 
                        line. Special request.
                                 STEVIE
                        It’s...

                                 CHRISTINE (O.S.)
                        Ridiculous.

           Christine has arrived in her reasonably luxurious Jaguar 
           complete with her new boy toy, Curry Grant, the roadie from 
           Lindsey’s screaming match back in Buffalo. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT’D)
                        If you insist on parking that 
                        eyesore here, I insist we find a 
                        tarp to cover it. You think I’m 
                        joking, I am not joking. I. Will. 
                        Walk.

           John arrives last, thankfully dropped off by a cab. He 
           surveys his bandmates, taking special note of Christine’s new 
           lover and Mick’s auto-atrocity. John puts his head between 
           his knees and vomits.

           A rousing start to a new venture!

           INT. THE RECORD PLANT - STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

           Luxurious doesn’t begin to describe the swank interior. White 
           linen draped from the ceiling, sunburst patterns across the 
           wall, top of the line gear. It’s like a musician’s Narnia.

           The band is immediately drawn to the ornate display of grub, 
           booze, and drugs at the room’s center. Mick plucks a card 
           from a bottle of Dom Perignon and reads.

                                 MICK
                        It’s from the label. The numbers 
                        have come in: Fleetwood Mac has 
                        sold over 3 million copies and 
                        counting. Do you know what this 
                        means?

                                 STEVIE
                        That we’ve made them boatloads of 
                        money, but instead of a bonus we’re 
                        getting caviar and coke?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Cynical.

                                 STEVIE
                        Pop music.
                                 LINDSEY
                        Let’s go.

           Lindsey picks up a Turner Model 1, rips off a decorative bow, 
           then rips into a new melody. It sounds like a more muscular 
           descendent of “Monday Morning.”

           The group seems to dig it. Like, really dig it. Maybe the 
           Everly Brothers and McVie’s puke weren’t the omens they 
           appeared.

                                 MICK 
                        Yes! Lyrics?

           Lindsey pulls out a shred of paper from his back pocket.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Yeah, they’re a little undercooked, 
                        but let’s run ‘em.

           Lindsey kicks back into his guitar and talk sings a few 
           choice lines to the group. 

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                           (accompanying his playing)
                        “I know there’s nothing to say/ 
                        Someone has taken my place/ When 
                        times get rough/ I’ve been tossed 
                        enough/ La di da filler filler/I’m 
                        just second hand news/I’m just 
                        second hand news yeah...”

           Stevie and the rest of the group look on in disbelief. How 
           autobiographical is this? 

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                           (unbothered)
                        Actually, on the “times get rough,” 
                        that’d be a great place for some 
                        backing. Stevie? 

           Stevie unable to stop this slow motion car wreck crosses and 
           stands behind her man. 

           They run through the same section, Stevie adding her vocal 
           flourishes through gritted teeth. 

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        Little too much, little too much. 
                        It really needs to be more 
                        complementary. 

            Mick steps in to the relief of everyone. 
                                 MICK
                        Let’s not get too in the weeds on 
                        vocals just yet. I want a crack at 
                        this. What do you have in mind for 
                        this ol’ geezer? 

           Lindsey, not realizing the damage he’s done, picks up Mick’s 
           ball and runs with it. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I think this cries out for 
                        something we haven’t done before. 
                        Like... 

           Lindsey grabs a Naugahyde seat and begins to slap it. It 
           gives off a unique reverberation.

           Mick, happy to have averted disaster for now, begins to 
           explore the benefits of non-traditional sound.

           Stevie, the spotlight off, touches her face, which has gone 
           red with humiliation and rage. She picks up a velvet baggie 
           of booger sugar, and leaves the session, unnoticed.

           INT. THE RECORD PLANT - SLY STONE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Stevie has retired to the black velvet womb. Between generous 
           inhalations of snow, she’s hard at work on... Something. 

           Christine wanders in, as curious as us. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        The girl at reception told me Sly 
                        Stone had this built as a 
                        “conversation pit.” 

                                 STEVIE
                           (not looking up)
                        Uh-huh. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I was wondering if you could help 
                        me with a bit of a predicament. 
                        I’ve written this number about my 
                        new lover. Fireworks in the sack 
                        and such.
                           (beat)
                        It just occurred to me that that 
                        might be a bit awkward... For John. 
                        How do you think he would feel? For 
                        instance, how would you feel, if 
                        you were in his position?
                                 STEVIE
                        I don’t know. In Lindsey’s number, 
                        apparently I’m fucking around. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Oh, you know, thank God.

           Stevie continues scribbling down her response. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT’D)
                           (re: Stevie’s writing)
                        I’m looking forward to it. 

           Christine departs, smirking to herself. 

           INT. THE RECORD PLANT - STUDIO - EVENING

           A few days have passed, and the other members of Fleetwood 
           Mac continue to collaborate.

           Christine is at a Steinway baby grand, playing.

                                 CHRISTINE
                           (singing)
                        “Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s 
                        gone...”
                           (back to talking)
                        It’s a good hook, yeah, but I’m not 
                        sure where it’s going.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Well, don’t stop, it’ll--

                                 STEVIE (O.S.)
                           (raspy)
                        Get there.

           Everyone stops and stares at the disheveled Stevie, dark 
           circles under her eyes, wearing the same clothes from before. 

           She moves over to the piano, and indelicately scoots 
           Christine off the bench.

                                 MICK
                        Stevie, how long have you been--

           Stevie gestures for silence. With one hand she starts 
           tickling the ivories. A leisurely, seductive piece emerges.
                                 STEVIE
                           (singing)
                        “Now there you go again, you 
                        say/You want your freedom/Well who 
                        am I to keep you down...”

           The lyrics are pointed and everyone in the room knows exactly 
           who they’re pointed towards. Their target hears them loud and 
           clear. Stevie continues into the chorus.

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                           (singing)
                        “Thunder only happens when it's 
                        raining/Players only love you when 
                        they're playing/Say women they will 
                        come and they will go/When the rain 
                        washes you clean, you'll know, 
                        you'll know...”

           Stevie finishes her performance.

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        So, how was it?

           Before she can receive a reply...

           CLANG!

           Stevie passes out cold, di-rectly onto the keys.

           Worried, everyone scrambles to Stevie’s aid.

           INT. SAUSALITO CONDO - MORNING

           Stevie stirs in her and Lindsey’s bed. Opposite her is a 
           fully dressed and wide-awake Lindsey.

                                 STEVIE
                        What time is it?

                                 LINDSEY
                        Tuesday.

           Stevie gives him a sarcastic laugh. Lindsey, not wasting 
           anytime, dives in head first.

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        Why did you do that?

                                 STEVIE
                        Seemed like airing our dirty 
                        laundry was on the table. At least 
                        I didn’t quote us directly.  
                                 LINDSEY
                        It’s just like you to assume those 
                        lyrics were about you. I was 
                        writing as a character. This guy 
                        thinks his partner has moved on, 
                        doesn’t need him anymore. Maybe, 
                        maybe he thinks his girl is 
                        ungrateful for everything he’s done 
                        for her.

           Two can play at this game.

                                 STEVIE
                        Right... My character knows that 
                        her man is there for her on his 
                        terms, and his terms alone. She 
                        knows he’s only ever looked out for 
                        himself, that he would’ve abandoned 
                        her the moment he had his chance.

           Lindsey jumps up, livid.

                                 LINDSEY
                        “Had his chance?” Guess what? They 
                        didn't even want you in the first 
                        place. I could’ve left you. I 
                        should've...

                                 STEVIE
                           (tearing up)
                        Sometimes I wish you had.

                                 LINDSEY
                        I know you called Pisshead. You 
                        wanted to settle!

                                 STEVIE
                        What choice did you give me? I 
                        didn’t need to read the tea leaves 
                        to see my future. Fifty, wiping 
                        down tables, saying, “Oh, I almost 
                        made it once, but I have my 
                        principles.” 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Why didn’t you believe in me? 

                                 STEVIE
                        I always believed in you, I didn’t 
                        believe in us!
                                 LINDSEY
                        Fuck it... You know what? I'm done. 
                        Pack up this shit, you take the 
                        car. 

                                 STEVIE
                        I'm not going anywhere.

           Lindsey realizes that if she’s willing to stay that there’s 
           nothing he can do. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        FINE!

           Lindsey storms out, slamming the door behind him.

           INT. THE RECORD PLANT - STUDIO - NIGHT

           The pulsating rhythm track to “The Chain” pounds under Stevie 
           and Lindsey’s still simmering anger, as they stand shoulder-
           to-shoulder, ready to record their vocals. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (singing)
                        “And if you don’t love me now... 
                        You will never love me again...”

                                 STEVIE
                           (singing)
                        “I can still hear you saying, you 
                        would never break the chain.” 

           Musical break. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (to Stevie)
                        You’re jumping your cue. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (to Lindsey)
                        Fuck off, you’re earl--

           Lindsey goes back into the bridge, Stevie backs him up with 
           more intensity. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (to the booth)
                        Cut the fucking tape. We need to go 
                        again. 

           Lindsey throws his headphones down, storming out, full-stop.
           Stevie goes to the rest of the waiting group. John is passed 
           out on the couch. Next to him Christine buries her nose in a 
           copy of Delta of Venus. Only Mick was left rapt by the 
           fireworks.

                                 STEVIE
                        Third session this week. Do we all 
                        have to be here for this shit? It’s 
                        2 AM. How about he lays the rest of 
                        his stuff down in L.A.? Spare us.

                                 MICK
                        Not with results like these. 

           Stevie helps herself to a neatly placed rail of cocaine off 
           the craft table, next to an extravagant breakfast spread.

                                 STEVIE
                        If I don’t have to do backup on it, 
                        then I don’t want to be here. You 
                        can tell him that for me. 

                                 MICK
                        As you wish. 

           Mick excuses himself outside.

           EXT. THE RECORD PLANT - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Mick finds a smoldering Lindsey leaning against the wall, 
           puffing on a joint.

           Mick holds his hand out for it, Lindsey obliges. 

           After a long drag:

                                 MICK
                           (exhaling)
                        I really dug that take. 

           Lindsey shrugs. Mick approaches the message with kid gloves. 

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                        So... Do you think it’s possible we 
                        don’t necessarily have to have all 
                        of us in the same booth? All the 
                        time? Maybe, and this is just a 
                        thought, we transition into 
                        something Stevie doesn’t... Sing 
                        on, huh? 

           Lindsey takes a hit.
                                 LINDSEY
                        I’ll see what I can do. 

           INT. THE RECORD PLANT - STUDIO - NIGHT

           With the music playing in his headphones, Lindsey screams 
           some choice lyrics from “Go Your Own Way,” with more ferocity 
           than a junk yard dog.

                                 LINDSEY
                        “Loving you/ Isn’t the right thing 
                        to do/ How can I ever change things 
                        that I feel/ Tell me why/ 
                        Everything turned around/ Packing 
                        up/ Shacking up is all you want to 
                        do/ You can go your own way/ Go 
                        your own way...”

           Mick watches on from the board, perhaps, having done more 
           harm than good. 

           INT. THE SNYDER/ANDERSON RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Stevie, visiting her friend’s happy home, brings some of her 
           fury, as her bestie looks on with a cup of tea at her kitchen 
           table. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Fuck him, fuck that song, fuck 
                        those lyrics, fuck everything about 
                        him. “Packing up, shacking up? It’s 
                        all I want to do.” It’s been seven 
                        years, did I miss the proposal? 

                                 ROBIN
                           (calmly)
                        You know what you have to do now.

                                 STEVIE
                        What’s that? Hit him with our car?

                                 ROBIN
                        Write. 

           Stevie’s smelling what Robin’s cooking.

           INT. THE RECORD PLANT - STUDIO - NIGHT

           Stevie’s at the mic, lyric sheet out in front of her. We hear 
           the music bed of twinkling keys. It’s sad, it’s sweet, and 
           it’s building... 
                                 STEVIE
                           (singing)
                        “You could be my silver springs...”

           INT. EL CARMEN MEXICAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Lindsey sits alone in a corner booth, fidgeting as he waits 
           for his bandmates. Christine approaches first. She surveys 
           the empty table.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I’d apologize for my tardiness, but 
                        it appears I’m still the most 
                        punctual. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        John’s at the bar. 

           Just then, Mick wanders in, a lady on each arm. He struts 
           over having expected a party, not a meeting.

                                 MICK
                        Don’t worry, Linds, I brought 
                        enough to share with the whole 
                        class.

                                 LINDSEY
                           (to the ladies; motioning 
                            to John)
                        Why don’t you go keep that guy over 
                        there company? 

           The ladies take the hint and go to chat up a soused John. 

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        I’d have had them send him over, 
                        but what’s the point?

           Christine looks through Lindsey. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Are we waiting for Stevie? 

                                 LINDSEY
                        We’ve been mixing this thing for 
                        months, had to delay the fucking 
                        tour, nearly wore out the tape on 
                        the master... And it’s still too 
                        long. So, as the adults in the 
                        room, we have to make tough calls, 
                        we need tough love. Off the top of 
                        my head, “Silver Springs.” That’s 
                        six and a half minutes right there. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        Tough love? That’s no love at all, 
                        in that song or in your opinion. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Fine, we can lose “Songbird.”

                                 CHRISTINE
                           (eyes narrowing)
                        Why not one of yours?

                                 LINDSEY
                        ‘Cause mine fit on the radio. Feel 
                        free to jump in any time, Mick. 

                                 MICK
                        I’d like to hear Stevie’s thoughts 
                        on this matter. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        We already know what she thinks. 
                        So... You have her thoughts, my 
                        thoughts, John doesn’t have any 
                        thoughts, which leaves you two. 
                           (beat)
                        “Silver Springs” or “Songbird?”

           The moment hangs in the air. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                           (to Mick)
                        Do you want to tell her?

           INT. STEVIE’S ROCK STAR MANSION - NIGHT

           Stevie wasted no time applying her new found wealth to her 
           spacious digs. Every piece of New Age tat fills the place, 
           wall-to-wall. Crystals, burning incense, abstract art. Oddly, 
           however, it lacks traditional furniture. 

           With no place to take a seat, Stevie bawls like mad, face 
           down on her oriental rug. Mick crouches beside her, doing his 
           damndest to comfort his heartbroken singer. 

                                 MICK
                        It’s going to be the B-side on the 
                        first single. Cross my heart. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (wailing)
                        We already voted on singles. It’ll 
                        be behind “Go Your Own Waaaay.” 
                                 MICK
                        Doesn’t have to be. It could be... 
                        I mean, that really is putting our 
                        best foot forward. 

           Stevie lets out another sustained cry, before swallowing 
           hard, and collecting her feelings. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (calmly)
                        I’m never talking to him again... I 
                        can’t. I just can’t. 

           Mick considers fighting this demand, but, instead, simply 
           pats her on the back. 

           INT. CHATEAU MARMONT - ROOM 64 - NIGHT

           The swanky, Norman-style two-bedroom suite perched on top of 
           the capital of show business includes a wraparound terrace to 
           house the record release party for Fleetwood Mac’s hotly 
           anticipated follow-up album Rumours. 

           The imagined glitz of an evening like this is dampened by the 
           heavy industry presence. For the accounting department, this 
           is quite a thrill. For the performers, it’s a little tame. 

           In one corner, Lindsey rants and raves to boy wonder reporter 
           CAMERON CROWE (20).

                                 LINDSEY
                        ...So, saying you “like” a song is 
                        basically saying, you “heard” a 
                        song. So, fuck, “like.”

           It should be noted that Cameron doesn’t pass out, overwhelmed 
           by Lindsey’s integrity. 

                                 CAMERON
                        Cool.
                           (beat)
                        I’ve heard rumors that you and 
                        Stevie were only communicating via 
                        song through the recording process. 
                        Any truth to that? 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Rumors are just that. They fly all 
                        around you, especially when you’re 
                        on top. That’s why I decided to 
                        call the album, “Rumours.” 
                                 CAMERON
                        Alright... 
                           (reading from his notes)
                        Fact or rumor: You bounced Stevie’s 
                        most damning song “Silver Springs” 
                        from the album in favor of you’re 
                        own work?

           Lindsey nods. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (faking a “Eureka” moment)
                        Oooh, you just reminded me why... 
                        We call you the fucking enemy. 

           Cameron’s been iced out. Thankfully, Christine’s walking by. 

                                 CAMERON
                           (calling after her)
                        Christine, can I get a quote?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        “I have nothing to declare but my 
                        genius.” 

                                 CAMERON
                           (trying to play along)
                        Haha, Wilde, I get that.
                           (back to business)
                        Uh, but, seriously, was it hard 
                        working everyday with your ex-
                        husband? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Not at all, darling.

                                 CAMERON
                        But a song like, “You Make Loving 
                        Fun,” is about your affair with 
                        your last tour’s lighting director. 
                        That couldn’t have been easy for 
                        John, could it? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Well, that song is about our dog. 

                                 CAMERON
                        He didn’t believe that, did he?

           Christine makes a sweeping gesture over to John, who is 
           balancing no fewer than three mixed drinks while trying to 
           sip a fourth. 

           Cameron goes to continue his line of questioning with John. 
                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        Hi, John, Cameron Crowe, Rolling 
                        Stone. “You Make Loving Fun--”

                                 JOHN
                           (slurred)
                        The one about Chris fucking our 
                        lighting guy? 

                                 CAMERON
                        Yeah... Do you think all the 
                        tension surrounding the band helped 
                        with the creative alchemy? 

                                 JOHN
                           (slurred)
                        It wasn’t alchemy. Alchemy is a 
                        wizard turning rocks to gold. This 
                        was pressure. Pressure on each of 
                        us, pressure on all of us together, 
                        pressure from Warner Brothers, 
                        pressure from the fans, pressure to 
                        somehow get better. This was the 
                        kind of pressure that makes coal 
                        into diamonds.  

           Cameron furiously scribbles down the first usable material of 
           the evening. 

           John tries to take a peak at the forming story, spilling 
           every last drop of his drinks onto the pages in the process. 

           Before Cameron even has a chance to react, a long arm ropes 
           him over to an open bar. Mick is all too happy to contribute 
           to Fleetwood Mac’s public narrative.

                                 MICK
                        I would’ve thought it was past your 
                        bed time, son, but as long as I 
                        have you here, what do you want to 
                        ask me? 

                                 CAMERON
                        OK... Even though your wife isn’t a 
                        member of the band, did your 
                        ongoing divorce proceedings inform 
                        your creative output? 

                                 MICK
                           (on message)
                        This is the best thing we’ve ever 
                        done. It’ll obviously be hard to 
                        top the last one, but if anyone can 
                        do it, it’s us. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MICK (CONT'D)
                           (beat; intense)
                        Off the record, Jenny and I have 
                        been separated for years, and it’s 
                        never affected my work. There was 
                        no emotional fallout from our 
                        divorce, merely a financial 
                        fleecing. However, reconciliation 
                        is on the table. Actually, that 
                        last bit is on the record. Put that 
                        in the article. 

                                 CAMERON
                        I think it would lack context...

           Mick has ended this impromptu interview by walking off to 
           harangue some other lucky member of the press. 

           That’s when Cameron spots her, Stevie. She’s off by herself 
           on the terrace, looking over the City of Angels. He sidles up 
           next to her. 

           Before Cameron gets a chance to ask anything: 

                                 STEVIE
                           (rote)
                        Yes, it was hard working with 
                        Lindsey after we broke up, but 
                        we’ve always had a hard time 
                        working together. We’re 
                        perfectionists, after all. 

                                 CAMERON
                        How’d you--? 

                                 STEVIE
                        Because it’s the only thing anyone 
                        has asked me about for six months. 
                        Like, I heard a story about how I 
                        went after him with a meat cleaver? 
                        It’s weird hearing stories about 
                        yourself. All these rumors out 
                        there, it’s why I thought it’d be a 
                        good title. Mick added the “u” for 
                        “glamour.” 

                                 CAMERON
                        Do you think--? 

                                 STEVIE
                           (perking up)
                        We’ve already been number one. It’s 
                        all downhill from here. 

           Stevie smiles, content with this single certainty in life. 
           HEAD-SPLITTINGLY AWESOME MONTAGE: 

           Fleetwood Mac goes out to support Rumours. The tour kicks off 
           with modest luxuries and good-sized domestic venues. We’re 
           talking town-cars-to-the-Santa-Barbara-Amphitheater level 
           success. 

           Then something starts to happen. Every date is overbooked, 
           every crowd leveled, every song a fucking platinum-plated 
           mega-hit. 

           Each band member, never together unless onstage, enjoys the 
           triumph in their own way. 

           John never has to worry about last call, let alone picking up 
           the tab.

           Mick makes gaudier and gaudier material purchases, from 
           raffish jewelry to ill-considered real estate.

           Christine becomes a lady about town, renting out the hottest 
           art galleries for private tours and strutting down the red 
           carpet at the biggest movie premieres. 

           Stevie indulges in a little bit of everyone’s vices: 
           Drinking, shopping, and carousing, she takes them all to the 
           limit. All this while almost single-handedly keeping 
           Colombia’s economy booming. 

           Only Lindsey seems stymied by the runaway success. He spends 
           his days smoking weed, “re-decorating” hotel rooms, and 
           practicing finger plucking among the wreckage.

           Just when you think the tour is winding down, they learn the 
           album continues to be a monster, still top of the charts. How 
           many weeks in a row is that? We’ve lost count. Another 
           million units out the door. Every third record sold has Mick 
           and Stevie on the cover. 

           It’s a world wide phenomenon. More dates have been added: 
           Toronto, London, Paris, West Berlin, Tokyo, Sydney, Rio. Town 
           cars become limos, first class seats become private jets, 
           four-star suites become five-star penthouses.

           It’s exhilarating, intoxicating, dizzying, exhausting. It’s 
           everything you’d want from a rock ‘n’ roll rocket ride. 

           END LIFE FORCE DRAINING MONTAGE
           INT. LIMOUSINE - PASSENGERS - NIGHT

           John flips through the issue of Rolling Stone with their 
           cover story. The photo doesn’t betray all of the fighting and 
           bitterness that went into it. 

           The radio blares, “Go Your Own Way,” while John sips a drink.

           Stevie’s had enough. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Ugh, is there anything else on the 
                        dial? 

           This time it lands on “Don’t Stop.”  

           Robin, now firmly entrenched in the entourage, dances along. 

           Mick, joyous, wants to push the band’s luck. 

                                 MICK
                        Let’s see if we can go three for 
                        three!

           He gets his wish: “You Make Loving Fun.” 

           Christine fiddles with a bottle of champagne. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I’ll never get used to hearing 
                        this. Do you mind? 

           Another change, “Dreams.”

           Lindsey sits, trying to focus. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Enough! Change the station or turn 
                        it off. 

           As desired Fleetwood Mac is off the radio. They’ve been 
           replaced by the Eagles hit “Life in the Fast Lane.”  

           Lindsey chucks a handful of ice from his drink through the 
           partition. 

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        OFF!

           It’s at this moment, the screen splits five (5!) ways and we 
           realize the band members are not together, but, in fact, 
           separately riding in five equally ostentatious limousines.
           EXT. AIRSTRIP - CONTINUOUS

           The quintet arrives at the airstrip where a private jet idles 
           on the tarmac to take them to New York City. Stevie and 
           Lindsey board without even looking at each other.

           EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           The Garden. The Mecca. The very pinnacle of superstardom. 

           The marquee: “Fleetwood Mac -- Sold Out” 

           INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - STEVIE’S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

           The amenities have improved since El Paso. Most eye catching 
           is the dozen plus bouquets of pink roses that fill the 
           private dressing room.

           Stevie looks into a lighted mirror, as Robin feathers her 
           hair. Before her is a silver platter with neat little white 
           lines atop it.

                                 ROBIN
                        Kim wants us to start trying, but 
                        if I’m on the road...

           Lindsey, cradling a nearly empty bottle of Johnnie Walker 
           Blue, barges in, unexpectedly. 

           Stevie sees him through the mirror and picks up the plate to 
           snort some aggression. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        “Never Going Back” is on the 
                        setlist. When we played it in 
                        Boston, you sulked the whole time. 
                        It was distracting to me and the 
                        fans, so how about you just wait in 
                        the wings tonight? 

                                 STEVIE
                        Robin, could you tell Lindsey that 
                        he’s mistaken? It was Miami when he 
                        bumped “Gold Dust Woman,” so he 
                        could jerk off in front of 20,000 
                        people. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I do my job during “Dreams” every--
                                 ROBIN
                        Not that it matters, I don’t think 
                        we’ve even done “Gold Dust Woman” 
                        since the first time through 
                        Chicago. 

                        LINDSEY
                                                      STEVIE
                (to Robin)
           Shut up.
                                             (to Robin)
                                           Robin, don’t...

           Beat. 

                                                  STEVIE (CONT'D)
                        LINDSEY
           Not everything is an attack!
                                           Don’t talk to her that way!

           Robin leaves before being further caught in the fray. 

           We PRELAP the deafening roar of the crowd.

           INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - STAGE - NIGHT

           The band runs through the numbers like a well oiled machine, 
           firing on all cylinders at every turn. 

           They wind down out of one hit and get ready to wind up into 
           another. 

           Stevie puts herself front and center. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (to the crowd)
                        This is a song about an Old Welsh 
                        witch. 

           There’s not a soul in the building who doesn’t know what that 
           means, and there’s only one who isn’t excited. He just 
           happens to be onstage. 

           What seemed so spontaneous and new at the beginning, now 
           feels stale and rote. The notes and words are the same, but 
           what do they even mean? 

           It comes to the point when Stevie covers herself in lace and 
           twirls about the stage. The audience is rapt by the her 
           performance, when Lindsey takes this attention personally.

           Encouraged by Johnnie, Lindsey decides to imitate his former 
           flame by throwing his leather jacket up over his head and 
           spinning. 

           His silly impression of Stevie’s dancing causes uproarious 
           laughter in scattered sections of the crowd. A confused 
           Stevie turns to see Lindsey’s continued mocking of her moves. 
           She does her best to finish the song strongly, but her 
           confidence is shaken. 

           The band unplugs from their instruments to take a break. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                           (to the crowd)
                        We’ll be right back, New York.

           Stevie takes the opportunity to get right in Lindsey’s face 
           about his behavior, as they all file off. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                           (livid)
                        What the fuck was that? 

           Lindsey ignores her as he walks off stage, but Stevie gets in 
           his way.

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        You heard me, what the--

           Lindsey brushes past her harder than either expected, 
           knocking her into Mick’s drum kit.

           INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Stevie picks herself up and pursues Lindsey into the bowels 
           of MSG.

           All Hell breaks loose. We don’t hear everything being said, 
           but it’s clear Stevie and Lindsey scream at one another 
           louder than they ever have. 

           Christine, not knowing what to do, splashes the pair with a 
           full glass of water. John looks on, befuddled. 

           Robin, having gained understanding of what happened, grabs a 
           pair of scissors and waves them wildly at Lindsey. 

           Finally, Mick uses his long limbs to keep everyone apart.

                                 MICK
                        I know you’re both a little 
                        passionate right now, but we have a 
                        gig to finish! Probably the biggest 
                        we are ever going to play! I 
                        have... We all have worked too hard 
                        to piss this away on a lovers’ 
                        quarrel. Finish the show and then 
                        kill each other. Deal?
           Somehow the lanky Brit’s screaming has cooled everyone down. 
           They all silently agree to soldier on.  

           INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The band retakes their places. Stevie’s front and center.

                                 STEVIE
                           (to the crowd)
                        Here’s one you may not know. 
                           (beat)
                        “Silver Springs.”

           Before there’s even a moment to protest, Christine goes into 
           the opening piano notes. Pretty standard so far, it shares 
           some DNA with “Dreams.” Lindsey, ever the professional, plays 
           his part. 

           Then things take a turn, literally. Stevie positions herself 
           to an audience of one. As music builds, so does her 
           intensity.

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                           (raw nerve)
                        “Time casts a spell on you, but you 
                        won't forget me/I know I could have 
                        loved you, but you would not let 
                        me/I'll follow you down til' the 
                        sound of my voice will haunt 
                        you/You'll never get away from the 
                        sound of the woman that loves 
                        you/I'll follow you down til' the 
                        sound of my voice will haunt 
                        you/Was I just a fool?” 

           Stevie repeats these lyrics over and over again, as if they 
           were an incantation. She certainly has the crowd under her 
           spell. 

           With each repetition, Lindsey feels the lyrics more deeply 
           and clearly. He’s frozen in place, with nothing to do, but 
           strum his chords and stare at his shoes. 

           The number draws to a close, inviting a tsunami of adulation 
           from the fans. Never has Fleetwood Mac killed harder.

           The war is far from over, but Stevie won this battle. No 
           contest. 
           INT. THE PLAZA HOTEL - MICK’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Mick, packs of ice affixed to each joint, keeps the phone 
           delicately balanced between his shoulder and ear.  

                                 MICK
                           (into phone)
                        I got this lovely spot up in Malibu 
                        for you and the girls.
                           (beat)
                        If there ever was a time to come 
                        out, this would be it. We’re as big 
                        as we can possibly be.

           KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                           (into phone)
                        Let’s table it then. Talk soon. 

           Mick hangs up the phone and answers the door. 

           It’s Stevie, sheepishly waiting for him. 

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Stevie, is everything alright? 

           Stevie doesn’t respond. 

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                        The Presidential Suite? They 
                        painted it pink, right? Did they 
                        put a baby grand in there for you, 
                        in case you got the urge? I’ll call 
                        the front desk, if there’s anything 
                        amiss. 

                                 STEVIE
                        It’s fine, but it’s... Lonely. 

           We know where the rest of this evening is headed. 

           EXT. THE BOWERY - NIGHT

           Lindsey roams the New York City streets looking for some 
           action, and he knows where to find it. 

           INT. CBGB - LATER

           Lindsey’s found his way inside the soon-to-be infamous punk 
           club. This place is the front line against what he 
           represents. It’s rude, it’s unpolished, it’s authentic. 
           Spiky-haired kids straight out of central casting pogo along 
           with the beat and hock loogies onto “The Only Band That 
           Matters.” 

           The Clash thrash their way through “Bored of the USA,” 
           slathered in saliva. 

           Lindsey’s eyes go wide with the possibilities.

           INT. THE PLAZA HOTEL - MICK'S ROOM - MORNING

           Mick and Stevie remain snuggled up in bed, after a wild night 
           of misplaced passion. She rests her head on his chest, as she 
           paints his nails a Barbie shade of pink. 

                                 STEVIE
                        You’re going to look so fab when 
                        I’m done. 

           SLAM! SLAM! SLAM! SLAM! SLAM!

           The pounding startles the lovers. 

                                 MICK
                           (shouting)
                        One minute!

           Mick throws a robe over himself and opens the door with the 
           chain still in place. It’s Lindsey, jittery as hell. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Mick, I need... 
                           (re: Mick’s nails)
                        What’s this? 

                                 MICK
                        Oh, you know, the road makes you 
                        crazy. Boring out here.

                                 LINDSEY
                        That’s it. Boring. Bored. I’m so 
                        fucking bored. We’ve repeated 
                        ourselves so much I can’t remember 
                        if we’re in Boston or Miami. 

                                 MICK
                           (serious)
                        Uh, Manhattan. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        That’s not the point. Here’s the 
                        point, we need a new direction. 
                                 MICK
                        Have you slept? 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Fleetwood Mac is a prison that 
                        we’ve building ourselves in brick 
                        by brick for the past two years. If 
                        we don’t break out, I’m gonna die. 
                        There’s a whole new scene out there 
                        and we need to get at it, or we’ll 
                        be dinosaurs. You know what 
                        happened to the dinosaurs, right? 

           ACHOO! Stevie’s sneezed from under the covers. 

           Lindsey tries to peak around the corner, Mick blocks his way.

                                 MICK
                           (panicked)
                        I get it! Evolve or die. Look, 
                        we’ve made changes before. Blues to 
                        pop and, now, whatever you’re 
                        talking about. I’m in, 100%. We’ll 
                        follow your lead for the next one. 
                        Whatever you want. Cross my heart. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I don’t care what the rest of the 
                        group says, you’re a good guy. 
                        Straight shooter. 

                                 MICK
                        Cheers...

           Mick shuts Lindsey out and breathes a sigh of relief.

           Stevie breaches for air from underneath the covers. Though 
           the immediate crisis has been averted, she doesn’t look 
           thrilled about a potentially looming one.  

                                 DAVID CROSBY (PRELAP)
                           (archival)
                        “And the winner is... Rumours, 
                        Fleetwood Mac.” 

           PRELAP: A cheesy orchestral version of “Don’t Stop” that you 
           never knew you wanted swells, barely drowning out the 
           industry’s ovations. 
           INT. THE SHRINE AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Winners and losers from the 20th Annual Grammy Awards mingle, 
           trying to find the best afterparty with the best 
           “refreshments.” 

           Lindsey and Christine stand on line, waiting as their 
           trophies are engraved.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        The only problem with winning all 
                        these things is running out of 
                        places to put them.

                                 LINDSEY
                           (sarcastic)
                        Fierce competition, too. The worst 
                        band in the world, a fake jazz duo, 
                        and the soundtrack for a children’s 
                        film starring a dog man with a 
                        bandolier.

           Beat.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        They’re called “Wookies.”

           Lindsey receives his freshly personalized bronze Gramophone 
           and hustles out of the venue. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT’D)
                           (calling after him)
                        Pull your socks up, rock star!

           We shift focus to another corner of the room where Stevie 
           fidgets with her accolade, contented. She’s waiting for 
           someone to arrive to continue the celebration. 

           Stevie spots Mick, and her face lights up. Just as quickly, 
           it falls when she notices his otherworldly ex-model wife, 
           JENNY BOYD (30), draped all over him.

           Mick advances, cautiously. 

                                 MICK
                        Stevie, I don’t believe you’ve met 
                        the missus. Came straight away from 
                        the airport.
                           (to his wife)
                        Jenny, this is Stevie. 

                                 JENNY
                        Oh, I love your necklace. 
           Stevie meets Don Henley’s gaze across the room. She’s made up 
           her mind. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (distracted)
                        Mmmhmm... What was your name again? 
                        Loud in here. 

                                 JENNY
                        It was Jenn--

                                 STEVIE
                        Lovely meeting you.

           Stevie walks away, that chapter closed behind her. She makes 
           a beeline for the drummer of the worst band in the world. 

           Don looks her up and down.

                                 DON
                        Hey there, Witchy Wom--

                                 STEVIE
                           (re: her trophy)
                        I’ll show you mine, if you show me 
                        yours. 

           INT. THE SHRINE AUDITORIUM - MEN’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Stevie and Don stumble backwards into the restroom, making 
           out vigorously. The only other occupant is our old pal, John. 

           He’s stands, drunkenly, at the urinal, his prize in one hand, 
           a nearly finished bottle of Veuve Clicquot in the other, and 
           his Grammy balanced on the top porcelain.  

                                 JOHN
                           (slurred)
                        Hi, Stevie... This is the men’s 
                        room, innit? 

           Stevie and Don, without noticing, adjourn to and make use of 
           an empty stall. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        What a night... 

           INT. VOLARE'S ITALIAN - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Once again, we find a gathering of Buckinghams at Volare’s, 
           this time just Lindsey and Greg. 
           At this level of fame, the restaurant staff is well passed 
           the point of caring about Lindsey’s leather jacket.

           They are joined by a third uninvited guest, a SINCERE FAN 
           (30s), who’s in the middle of their spiel. 

                                 SINCERE FAN
                        ...I wanted you to know Rumours got 
                        me through one of the worst 
                        breakups of my life. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (flippant)
                        Well, that makes one of us. 

           The Sincere Fan wanders away from the table, Lindsey and Greg 
           try to go back to the meal. 

                                 GREG
                        You think you’re used to it yet?

                                 LINDSEY
                        Used to what? People talking to me 
                        like they know me? 

                                 GREG
                        They do, in a way.

           Greg trails off after noticing they’ve been joined by an 
           UNAWARE FAN (20s).

                                 UNAWARE FAN
                        Hi, can I have your autograph? 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (without looking)
                        No. 

                                 UNAWARE FAN
                        Why not? 

           Lindsey ramps up to 11. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        What do you mean “why not?” I’m 
                        having dinner with my family. 

           The Unaware Fan lingers. 

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck off, OK?

           Finally, the Unaware Fan is made aware and leaves. 
                                 GREG
                        You could’ve signed something. I 
                        wouldn’t have minded. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        So, I can do 50 more before I 
                        leave? Besides, they got something 
                        better than autograph. That’s a 
                        story. 

           Suddenly, a CREEPY FAN (40s) materializes on Lindsey’s other 
           side. 

                                 CREEPY FAN
                        My fried dared me to get a lock of 
                        hair. I’ll do anything for it. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (to a waiter)
                        Can we get a doggy bag? 

           Lindsey gets up from the table and unceremoniously throws 
           down a wad of cash on the table. 

           EXT. LINDSEY’S ROCK STAR MANSION - NIGHT

           Lindsey and Greg pull the old Beamer in front of Lindsey’s 
           new digs. From the outside, it looks almost exactly like 
           Stevie’s.

           INT. LINDSEY'S ROCK STAR MANSION - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Lindsey erupts through the door. Greg’s behind, food in hand. 

           The interior, in contrast to Stevie’s house, is nearly empty. 
           He’s merely transported the contents of their small, shitty 
           apartment into this large, shitty McMansion. 

           The rundown mattress and his record collection barely fill up 
           the living room, let alone the house. 

           Lindsey goes over to the record player and drops the needle 
           on “Pretty Vacant” by the Sex Pistols. The guttural snarl 
           clobbers the floorboards at seismic levels. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (yelling over the music)
                        I have a speaker wired to this in 
                        every room! I can listen to 
                        anything I want, wherever I want! 
                                 GREG
                           (yelling to match)
                        Boss! Can you control the volume? 

           Lindsey turns it off. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        That was on “1.”
                           (beat)
                        Oh, I have a rain room. Check this 
                        out...

           Lindsey runs off through an adjoining door, Greg doesn’t 
           follow. 

           From the living room, Greg hears a CLICK of a switch and 
           silence, then another CLICK. Lindsey reemerges. 

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t put water in it, but when 
                        there is, I can have a thunderstorm 
                        in my house whenever I want.

                                 GREG
                        Wow, Graceland doesn’t even have 
                        that. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Exactly what the real estate agent 
                        told me. It was a little corny, but 
                        that’s their job, right?  
                           (beat)
                        C’mon, let me show the real reason 
                        I bought this place. 

           Lindsey takes off down the hallway. Greg comes along this 
           time. Before he can reach the final destination, Greg’s 
           distracted by a large box in an otherwise barren room. 

           Greg riffles through it: Gold and platinum records for 
           Fleetwood Mac and Rumours, tour posters, concert t-shirts, 
           AMAs, Grammys. Greg goes to examine one of the accolades more 
           closely. 

           Lindsey, realizing Greg left him behind, storms in and tries 
           to wrestle his achievements back into the cardboard. 

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do that, they were in a box 
                        for a reason. 
                                 GREG
                        If you don’t want these, Mom would 
                        love them. She can put them up next 
                        to--

                                 LINDSEY
                        The Silver Medal. 

           Greg reflects on the statement.

                                 GREG
                        You know, it was only two minutes 
                        and thirteen seconds? Two minutes 
                        and thirteen seconds that defined 
                        my life. Everyone can tell me every 
                        little thing about that time. How 
                        it looked, where they were when it 
                        happened, what it meant to them.
                           (beat)
                        But only I experienced it. I chose 
                        to enjoy it. I still do.

           Lindsey deflects. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Did you want to see the studio 
                        or...? 

           Greg puts the Grammy back with its kin.

                                 GREG
                        Um, yeah, sure.

           Greg walks out first, Lindsey lingers, looking at his box of 
           trophies. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (calling after Greg)
                        Make yourself at home. I’ll be 
                        right there. 

           Lindsey fishes out the “Album of the Year” Grammy and eyes 
           some empty shelves. He places it, alone, on the highest of 
           the pair.  

           He contemplates it becoming a permanent fixture there for an 
           anxious beat. Can he accept the praise and glory of being 
           “Grammy Winner Lindsey Buckingham?”

           He takes it off the top shelf and moves it to a lower one.

           Baby steps.
           EXT. ADMIRAL 35 YACHT - DECK - DAY

           We’ve finally arrived: the Ninth Circle of Rock Decadence. 
           Jordan Belfort wishes his yacht parties were this fucking 
           insane. Luckily, Stevie and Don, the gracious co-hosts of 
           this shindig, have pulled the whole thing off with aplomb. 

           Stevie runs a noticeably out of place Robin and Kim through a 
           guided tour of the 118 foot Italian behemoth. 

                                 STEVIE
                        ...Today’s crew all signed non-
                        disclosures, so feel free to let 
                        your hair down.

           Stevie grabs two flutes of champagne off a passing serving 
           tray and hands them off to her guests. 

           Robin, discreetly, passes her’s along to Kim. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        She - Don says all boats are girls - 
                        sleeps eight, three engines for a 
                        cruising speed of 25 knots, and 
                        measures in at exactly one 
                        hundred... And something feet. 
                        Elton was eyeing this thing, and 
                        when Don heard, he had to have it. 
                        Now “Piano Man” has to take a 
                        dinghy out on the marina. 

                                 ROBIN
                        Isn’t that Billy Joel? 

                                 STEVIE
                        Same difference. 

           They move along the bow, where among the exposed flesh and 
           recreational drugs, Mick makes a tidy home. Jenny, on the 
           other hand, seems less pleased by the shenanigans. 

                                 MICK
                        Stevie! Swinging soiree. Pray tell, 
                        where’s ol’ Linds? 

                                 STEVIE
                        Who? 

           Everyone’s distracted by a bout of particularly loud 
           seasickness, off-screen. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                           (re: the ill)
                        John, next time aim for the ocean. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s a big and blue, you can’t miss 
                        it, babe. 

           Don descends from the bridge of the super-vessel to join the 
           group, one hand behind his back. 

                                 DON
                        Thar she blows...
                           (pointing)
                        And here. 

           He ropes his lover into one of those kisses that’s a little 
           too long and a lot too public. 

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Surprise. 

           Don reveals a gold chain necklace, on the end of which 
           dangles a glass vial filled with the winking white stuff. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Oh my God, you are a lifesaver. 

           She delicately tamps out a bump onto the white gold spoon 
           wrapped around her finger in the shape of a ring. 

           Stevie offers the vial to Robin, who gently refuses. Don 
           takes over. 

                                 DON
                        C’mon, Stevie said you guys were 
                        cool. 

                                 KIM
                           (uncomfortable smile)
                        We’re, uh, not that cool. 

           Suddenly, Stevie’s nose springs a leak. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Damn, rusty pipes. 
                           (holding her nose)
                        You’re being really bad guests 
                        right now. 

           Robin digs out and hands Stevie a hankie.

                                 ROBIN
                        Can we talk? 

                                 STEVIE
                        We’ve been talking. 
                                 ROBIN
                        You’ve been talking. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (stopped cold)
                        OK, let’s go below deck. 

           INT. ADMIRAL 35 YACHT - BELOW DECK - MOMENTS LATER

           Much more quiet down below, where Christine canoodles with 
           Beach Boys drummer DENNIS WILSON (34). 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I would gladly have Brian eating 
                        carrots with his toes over our guy. 

                                 DENNIS
                        Alright, no take backs.

           Stevie and Robin enter. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Can we get some privacy? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        That’s what we were in search of. 
                           (leading Dennis out)
                        There are three other cabins just 
                        like this, darling.

           Christine and Dennis go in search of further privacy. 

                                 STEVIE
                        What couldn’t you say in the sun? 

                                 ROBIN
                           (sighs)
                        I’m pregnant. 

           Stevie yelps with joy. 

                                 STEVIE
                        I’m gonna be an aunt! You’re gonna 
                        be a mom! Is it a boy or a girl? 

                                 ROBIN
                        We don’t know yet.

                                 STEVIE
                        I have the cutest pink shawl--
                                 ROBIN
                           (bluntly)
                        And I have cancer. 

           Stevie’s joy implodes. 

                                 ROBIN (CONT’D)
                        Dr. Herbers said there’s no easy 
                        way to tell someone that and he’s 
                        right.
                           (beat)
                        He’s recommending that I terminate 
                        the pregnancy before starting 
                        treatment.

                                 STEVIE
                        We’ll get you a different doctor. 
                        The most expensive doctors, the 
                        best. I don’t know where you found 
                        this quack--

                                 ROBIN
                        This isn’t even the second opinion 
                        and no amount of money will change 
                        it. 
                           (beat)
                        I’m having this baby. It’s very 
                        likely one or both of us will not 
                        survive. 
                           (beat)
                        Stevie, I need you to promise me, 
                        if I don’t, that you take care of 
                        my baby. Can you do that? 

           Stevie tries to imagine the unimaginable. The very thought 
           leaves her hollow.

           INT. LINDSEY'S ROCK STAR MANSION - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Lindsey, blasting the manic “Psycho Killer” by the Talking 
           Heads, stands in his shower, armed with nail scissors and 
           hydroperoxide. Methodically, as the water runs, he clips off 
           every last curl and dyes the remaining strands an unnatural 
           shade of blonde.

           INT. LINDSEY’S ROCK STAR MANSION - BATHROOM - LATER

           Lindsey tapes a dime-store “dingle” microphone about half a 
           foot off the tiled floor of his commode. 

           He then assumes the push-up position facing the mic, and 
           shouts:
                                 LINDSEY
                        “Counting on my fingers/Counting on 
                        my toes!”

           Lindsey yells this phrase with different intonations over and 
           over and over...

           INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - POLO LOUNGE - DAY

           Mick dines with a trio of women, who all do their best to nod 
           and laugh along at the right parts of his stories. 

                                 MICK
                        ...With the wife gone, you have a 
                        lot of time to think about your 
                        career. Am I where I want to be? 
                        Must you change or die? Do people 
                        really just want to hear the hits? 
                        This next Fleetwood Mac album and 
                        tour will be a departure from our 
                        most recent sound. With that in 
                        mind, I’ve been empowered by the 
                        other members of the band to 
                        audition...
                           (gesturing to the women)
                        Dancers. The more skilled, 
                        flexible, and... Lovely, the 
                        better.

           Suddenly, from across the restaurant, an ELEGANT WAITER (60s) 
           emerges from a side room carrying a silver platter topped 
           with a silver-plated telephone. 

                                 ELEGANT WAITER
                        Mr. Fleetwood, there’s a Mr. 
                        Buckingham on the line for you. 

                                 MICK
                           (to the waiter)
                        Ah, thank you.
                           (To the ladies)
                        It’s Lindsey.

           All three of the aspiring dancers perk up. 

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                           (into phone)
                        Linds, old boy, how are you? 

           Without a greeting, Lindsey presses play on the fruits of his 
           labor. What blares through the receiver will later be titled 
           “The Ledge,” and it’s a pulsating, furious song that almost 
           dares you to try and sing along, but would never let you. 
           Mick let’s the assault on his eardrums finish.

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                           (into phone; taken aback)
                        Yes. A great demo. It’ll really... 
                        Shine once we get in the studio. 
                        Want me to get everyone together 
                        for harmonies and such?

                                 LINDSEY (V.O.)
                           (on the phone)
                        What do you mean? It’s done. 

           CLICK. DIAL TONE.

           Mick’s left alone with the dancers.

                                 MICK
                           (into phone; faking it)
                        OK, yes. Next week it is, then. 
                        Cheers. 

           INT. STEVIE'S ROCK STAR MANSION - BATHROOM - DAY

           Stevie stands in a bathroom so over-decorated with artisan 
           hand soaps and frilly towels that Martha Stewart would never 
           stop gagging.

           She looks down the barrel of a home pregnancy test vial. It 
           reads positive, as does her expression. 

           INT. STEVIE'S ROCK STAR MANSION - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           The kitchen takes design cues from the rest of the house. 

           Don reads the sports page and sips from a cup of joe. 

           Stevie lingers in the doorway watching him. Her face goes to 
           neutral, as she approaches and silently places the test in 
           front of her lover. 

           After a pregnant pause:

                                 DON
                           (smiling)
                        Of course, I’ll take care of it. 

           Relief washes over Stevie. 

                                 STEVIE
                        I would hope so. It’s yours, 
                        obviously. 
           Don laughs. 

                                 DON
                        Hell, I’ll even drive you to the 
                        clinic. 

           Stevie’s face falls.

           INT. CEDARS SINAI HOSPITAL - ROBIN’S ROOM - DAY

           Robin, her pregnancy showing, rests in a hospital bed. Kim, 
           at his wife’s side, pats her forehead with a washcloth. 

           Stevie sits in the corner, writing in a notebook. 

           It’s been a week since things took a turn for the worse, and 
           Stevie’s been here for every second of it. Every inch of the 
           room is covered in flowers and other homey touches. 

                                 KIM
                        I’m going to get some coffee. 
                        Stevie?

           Stevie, who hasn’t slept, shakes him off. Kim goes on his 
           way. 

                                 ROBIN
                           (weakly)
                        It’s not contagious, ya’ know. 

           Stevie can’t help but chuckle. She puts down her notebook and 
           delicately crawls into bed with her friend. 

                                 STEVIE
                        I’m sorry, I work too much. 

                                 ROBIN
                        You working has nothing to do with 
                        where I am. So, save your “sorry.” 

           Stevie puts her hand on the growing child. 

                                 STEVIE
                        I always thought when we were young 
                        that we’d have kids together. 

                                 ROBIN
                        I don’t remember you once 
                        mentioning kids, or even a husband. 

                                 STEVIE
                        That’s why I said, “thought.” 
           The friends smile at that. 

                                 ROBIN
                           (playing along)
                        We’d have to pretend to hate each 
                        other, so they’d want to be 
                        friends. We’d sneak out to see each 
                        other late at night, after we put 
                        them to bed. Even fantasizing about 
                        it, I can’t keep my lies straight. 

                                 STEVIE
                        You’re going to be a great mom. 

                                 ROBIN
                        You will, too. 

           That one gives Stevie a lump in her throat. She swallows it.  

                                 STEVIE
                        Have you thought of a name? 

                                 ROBIN
                        If it’s a boy, we like “Matthew.” 
                        For a girl, “Sara.” 

                                 STEVIE
                        I like “Sara.” 

           PRELAP: Orchestration, at once both jagged and lush, 
           percolates under the scene. 

                                 STEVIE (PRELAP) (CONT’D)
                           (singing)
                        “Wait a minute baby/Stay with me 
                        awhile...”

           INT. LINDSEY'S ROCK STAR MANSION - STUDIO - NIGHT

           Stevie softly weaves her way through another one of her 
           trademark ballads from behind the glass of Lindsey’s home 
           studio.

           Her vocals are more raw than they’ve ever been. Between the 
           copious amounts of cocaine and life on the road, any last 
           vestiges of prettiness has been stripped away from the sound. 

           Stevie, after wringing ever last bit of emotion from her 
           voice, wraps up the performance, absolutely drained. 

           We reveal Lindsey, at the controls, blankly staring ahead.

           There’s a tense beat.
           Lindsey starts to rewind the tape.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Again.

                                 STEVIE
                        Oh, fuck off... 
                           (under her breath)
                        I should’ve saved this for my solo 
                        record. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Well, you didn’t. Again.

           Stevie braces herself to execute a peerless performance... 
           Again.

           INT. LINDSEY’S ROCK STAR MANSION - STUDIO - NIGHT

           The basement recording space is now occupied by Christine. 
           She impatiently hangs around as Lindsey tunes the dials at 
           the board with utmost care.

           At last, Lindsey hits play.

                                 CHRISTINE (V.O.)
                           (on tape; singing)
                        “All it took was a special look/And 
                        I felt I knew you before...”

           Lindsey abruptly hits stop.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Yeah?

           Christine opens her mouth to respond to the non-question, 
           when:

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna turn all the knobs 180 
                        degrees, see what happens.

           Christine shakes her head, and walks out.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        When you’re done having a wank, you 
                        know how to reach me...

           Lindsey nods, not fully absorbing Christine’s disgruntlement.
           INT. LINDSEY’S ROCK STAR MANSION - STUDIO - LATER

           Christine is out, Mick is in. The drummer sits across from 
           Lindsey, hearing the noise of wet meat being slapped.

           Lindsey rides the volume, still playing with the overall 
           atmosphere.

                                 MICK
                        We’re listening to pork chops?

                                 LINDSEY
                        Veal.

                                 MICK
                        And what was wrong with my snare 
                        fills?

                                 LINDSEY
                        Nothing, that’s the problem. Think 
                        about the chair on “Second Hand 
                        News.” Multiply it by fifty. Huh? 

           Mick fiddles with a sparkling gold chain around his neck, 
           implicitly refusing to answer the guitarist-cum-producer.

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        Hand me the cartridge that says, 
                        “’Kleenex’ Box.”

           Mick searches for the next ridiculous overdub.

           INT. LINDSEY’S ROCK STAR MANSION - STUDIO - LATER

           John plucks his bass like the old pro he’s always been. 
           Despite all of the inebriated tomfoolery we’ve seen from him, 
           the man can fucking lay down a line.

           But Lindsey isn’t having it.

           Silently he takes the instrument from John’s hands, and 
           starts to play in an intentionally more amateurish fashion.

           John no longer has the will to verbally protest, marches 
           away, wordlessly. 

           INT. DODGER STADIUM - FIELD - DAY

           Stevie, Christine, Mick, and a cardboard cutout of John watch 
           from the stands with shock and awe at the spectacle before 
           them.
           Down on the field, Lindsey directs the fully uniformed 
           University of Southern California Trojan Marching Band from 
           atop a ladder as they bleat out the thunderous cacophony that 
           is his opus “Tusk.”

           The whole scene recalls those photographs of Francis Ford 
           Coppola on the set of Apocalypse Now, without all that 
           mooring to any semblance of sanity.

           PRELAP: The studio mix of “Tusk” combines everything that 
           came before it: The exhausted vocals, experimental tuning, 
           non-traditional instruments, endless overdubs. It’s many 
           things, but boring is not one of them.

           INT. WARNER BROTHERS - MO OSTIN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Sitting at his desk, a bespectacled MO OSTIN (52) stares 
           bewildered at the tape machine as it spits out the 
           intentionally abrasive pop ditty. 

           Lindsey leans against the back wall of the label head’s 
           office. Every accolade Lindsey found fit to hide away is 
           proudly displayed here, most prominent of all a framed 
           Platinum Album awarded for Rumours. 

           As the song ends it becomes obvious Mo’s not angry, just 
           disappointed. 

                                 MO OSTIN
                        Tusk?

                                 LINDSEY
                        It’s what Mick calls his cock. 

                                 MO OSTIN 
                           (sarcastic)
                        I’m sure last year’s Homecoming 
                        Queen will love that... 
                           (beat)
                        Where do I begin? $1.4 MILLION? On 
                        this? What do you have to say for 
                        yourself, Buckingham?

                                 LINDSEY
                        What’d you want? Rumours II?

                                 MO OSTIN
                        Exactly! We’re gonna have to sell 
                        this, this... Thing at twice the 
                        normal price to even hope to break 
                        even...
           As Mo continues to pontificate on the mess they’re in, 
           Lindsey catches his reflection in the Platinum Album. The 
           plaque reads, “...presented for the sale of 10 Million...” 
           Well, his instincts have been right before.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Take it, or leave it.

           Lindsey rolls out with less swagger than his parting shot 
           would suggest. 

           EXT. HYATT HOUSE - POOL - NIGHT

           Another poolside party at the infamous Hyatt House...

           Once a laid back SoCal cool spot has become a wired frat boy 
           hang. Attendees like David Lee Roth and John Belushi no doubt 
           enabled that transition. 

           Floating above the beer-swilling jackanapes is Stevie, 
           splayed like a deranged Roman empress across a chaise lounge. 

           Sunglasses, black velvet shawl, and “donut” residue on her 
           upper lip, Stevie looks like she’s far beyond this idea of 
           fun. Even Christine couldn’t be bothered to attend. 

           Stevie turns to an empty chair where Robin once sat alongside 
           her. 

           She’s alone.

           EXT. TOWER RECORDS - DAY

           A line extends out of the store and wraps around the block. 
           Something very big is happening. 

           Lindsey walks up, smiling smugly to himself. Mo had no idea 
           what he was talking about after all. 

           He pushes his way to the entrance, but is stopped by an 
           AGGRAVATED CUSTOMER (20s).

                                 AGGRAVATED CUSTOMER
                        Hey, no cutting!

                                 LINDSEY
                           (pointing to his face)
                        I don’t think anyone will mind. 
                                 AGGRAVATED CUSTOMER
                        Christopher Cross is leaving at 
                        four o’clock, and I am not missing 
                        him! I camped out for this!

           Lindsey inspects the line more closely and sees that every 
           single person queued up is carrying a copy of Christopher 
           Cross’s pink flamingo emblazoned debut.  

           Put off, Lindsey runs his fingers through his hair and is 
           reminded of his desired anonymity. 

           INT. TOWER RECORDS - CONTINUOUS

           Lindsey advances passed the line’s loud protests until he 
           stumbles into the discount bin.

           It’s populated by rack after rack of Fleetwood Mac’s latest, 
           Tusk. Each unit is plastered with a bright orange sticker: 
           “OVERSTOCK”

           Lindsey picks up a copy of their double LP; a life’s work 
           pressed, packaged, and promoted for your listening pleasure.

           It’s heavier than he thought it’d be.

           INT. MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM - STAGE - NIGHT

           Fleetwood Mac has stopped in Mobile to limply back Tusk. A 
           mere six years ago, Buckingham Nicks had this place sold out. 
           Tonight it’s at just over half capacity. 

           Their ramshackle performance of the eponymous “Tusk” proves 
           definitively that it lives best as a studio track. 

           Trying to salvage the gig, Lindsey does his best Joe Strummer 
           imitation, which is exactly that: An imitation. He looks 
           about as punk as Mister Rogers. 

           Stevie, on the other hand, lives the line, “Don’t say that 
           you love me!” with every fibre of her being. 

           Tusk is Lindsey’s passion, but it’s Stevie’s reality. 

           The crowd, who made “Rhiannon” a smash, who bought ten 
           million copies of Rumours and counting, seems... Bored. Some 
           walk out, not even waiting to see if their former favorite 
           band is going to play the hits. 
           INT. MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM - LINDSEY’S DRESSING ROOM - LATER

           Lindsey, a sentient ball of rage, takes his Turner Model 1 
           and splinters it against the wall, taking a chunk of concrete 
           out of it for good measure. Where was this on stage? 

           INT. MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM - STEVIE’S DRESSING ROOM - LATER

           Stevie snorts a line that appears to go the length of the 
           vanity. 

           KNOCK! KNOCK! 

                                 STEVIE
                        I’m busy, what?

                                 CONCERNED ROADIE (O.S.)
                        There’s a call for you.

           INT. CEDARS SINAI HOSPITAL - ROBIN’S ROOM - DAY

           Stevie bursts through the door, tears flowing down her face, 
           to find the room Robin once occupied empty. 

           All that’s left is a neatly made bed. 

           INT. CEDARS SINAI HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Stevie cautiously approaches Kim, who intently watches over 
           an incubator containing his prematurely born infant. 

           His eyes are red and swollen, no tears left to cry. He 
           welcomes Stevie with an arm around her shoulder. 

                                 KIM
                        This is Matthew. 

           Stevie breaks down on Kim’s shoulder. He holds her, tenderly.

           INT. FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - DAY

           Stevie and Kim hold the same pose, now draped in clothes of 
           mourning. 

           They stand before Robin’s open casket. 

           A once vital and dynamic person has taken on the appearance 
           of a well-crafted porcelain doll. 

           Stevie can’t bear to look. 
           INT. LINDSEY'S ROCK STAR MANSION - RAIN ROOM - DAY

           Little droplets of “rain” pitter-patter against the invisible 
           glass ceiling of Lindsey’s vaunted rain room, causing, as his 
           realtor promised, the sensation of an indoor storm.

           Lindsey himself lies in a near catatonic state on the floor, 
           staring upwards. It looks like he hasn’t washed or shaved in 
           days, possibly longer. 

           He listens to “God Only Knows” for the God-only-knows-how-
           many-th time.

                                 THE BEACH BOYS (V.O.)
                           (via the speaker; singing)
                        “If you should ever leave me/Though 
                        life would still go on believe 
                        me/The world could show nothing to 
                        me/So what good would living do 
                        me/God only knows what I'd be 
                        without you...”

           These lines repeat ad nauseam at full volume, in every room 
           of the house, the result of the worn out vinyl. 

           RING! RING! RING!

           In the distance a phone beckons to be answered. 

           Lindsey doesn’t care. He just continues to stare off.

           INT. THE SNYDER/ANDERSON RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Stevie, phone to her ear, sits at a familiar table in a place 
           that once represented an oasis from the Rumours sessions.

           Today it carries a distinctly different weight, as she’s off 
           alone, while loved ones aimlessly mill about Robin’s wake. 

           There’s a faint BEEP and the prompt to leave a message. 

           The one time she needs him, and he’s not there. 

           Stevie slams down the receiver, disgusted.

           INT. LINDSEY’S ROCK STAR MANSION - STUDIO - LATER

           A still unkempt Lindsey opens the door to his home studio. 

           He plucks his Turner Model 1 from its cradle, and begins to 
           strum. Basic stuff at first, chord progressions and the like. 
           Soon a melody emerges. Unfortunately, it’s a familiar melody. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (singing; sarcastic)
                        “I’m just second hand news/Yeah...”

           Lindsey freezes, then tries a different riff.

           No dice. He’s stumbled into “Don’t Stop.” 

           Lindsey does exactly that, gingerly placing the guitar down, 
           and pacing the space.

           This goes on for a beat too long.

           Suddenly, inspiration having struck, Lindsey grabs his 
           instrument lays into a new song.

           Or so he thought. It quickly becomes apparent that he’s 
           “written” “Go Your Own Way.” Lindsey improvises new lyrics.

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                           (singing)
                        “I’m in trouble/I’m in so much 
                        fucking trouble...”

           INT. SOUND CITY - STUDIO - NIGHT

           Stevie looks like she hasn’t slept for a week the past three 
           days. Even by her own regularly petite standards, her body is 
           noticeably wan.  

           Tonight she’s in the studio with the shaggy blonde TOM PETTY 
           (31) working on the vocals of their new song. 

           The track is dark, sinister, intriguing, but something is 
           just slightly off. 

                                 TOM PETTY
                           (singing)
                        “...That's the game, well what am I 
                        supposed to do/I didn't know what I 
                        was getting into...”

           Stevie senses this and motions to the booth. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Stop, stop, this isn’t working. 

           Stevie turns to Tom. 
                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        I need to sing the lead. If a woman 
                        is in the power position, it’s so 
                        much sexier. 

                                 TOM PETTY
                        Hey, it’s your face on the cover...

                                 JIMMY
                           (from the booth)
                        Let’s reset for that. Pick up 
                        tomorrow. 

           Assistants rush in and out to cater to the talents’ needs. 
           Among the flurry of activity, Harry slinks in to steal a 
           moment from Stevie, a stack of paperwork and pen in tow. 

                                 HARRY
                        Warm up the fingers, I put an “X” 
                        next to each place you need to 
                        initial. 

                                 STEVIE
                        More?

                                 HARRY
                        When you start your own label, you 
                        sign everything. I offered to do 
                        some of this, but--

                                 STEVIE
                        I know, I insisted.

           Stevie makes her mark on page after page when an assistant 
           comes in holding a glass bottle of Evian water and a compact 
           mirror with two neatly laid rails of cocaine. She accepts the 
           boost, irked by its tardy arrival. 

           After vacuuming up the first line, Stevie tips the straw in 
           Tom’s direction. He waves her off, and she dutifully takes 
           his portion. 

                                 JIMMY
                           (from the booth; joking)
                        You keep that up, Stevie, and we’ll 
                        have to blow it up your ass. 

           Stevie laughs sarcastically, but the following response is a 
           little too real. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Jimmy, why don’t you fuck off, huh? 
                        Maybe, if I had a real producer in 
                        there, we’d be able to go tonight. 
                                 HARRY
                        Nicks, we’re all trying our best. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Oh, that’s cute. Put it on a 
                        poster, hang it up right over 
                        there. That way when we fail and 
                        feel like shit, we can all look at 
                        it and remember, “Jimmy tried his 
                        best.”  

           Tom stealthily tries to get out of the warpath. He can’t 
           escape Stevie’s radar. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        Tom, you leave, and I get Jackson 
                        Browne in here by sun up. 
                           (to the booth)
                        Reset. I’m taking five. We go when 
                        I get back. 

           An irate Stevie leaves. Everyone scrambles to hit their newly 
           assigned deadline.

           EXT. SOUND CITY - PARKING LOT - LATER

           Stevie, in search of fresh air, is hit with a puff of smoke. 
           The YOUNG INTERN (18) nearly drops her cigarette in shock.

                                 YOUNG INTERN
                        Oh my God, Ms. Nicks, I’m so sorry.

           Stevie waves off the apology.

                                 STEVIE
                        Can I bum one of those?

                                 YOUNG INTERN
                           (excited)
                        Absolutely!

           The intern hands over one of her Virginia Slims to Stevie and 
           lights it.

                                 YOUNG INTERN (CONT’D)
                        Isn’t that, like, bad for your 
                        voice?

                                 STEVIE
                           (exhaling)
                        This is the least of it.

           A beat.
                                 YOUNG INTERN
                           (can’t help it)
                        “Dreams” is my favorite song of all 
                        time. It made me want to, ya’ know, 
                        be in music.

                                 STEVIE
                        Mmm... How old are you? 

                                 YOUNG INTERN

                                 STEVIE
                        When I was 18, I joined my first 
                        band.

                                 YOUNG INTERN
                        Fleetwood Mac?

                                 STEVIE
                        No, it was a band that isn’t a band 
                        anymore. Then I was in a duo that 
                        isn’t a duo anymore. Then I was in 
                        Fleetwood Mac.

                                 YOUNG INTERN
                        And now you’re on your own.

                                 STEVIE
                        That’s right. You nailed it. I’m 
                        all alone. Just me. Everyone wants 
                        a piece, and there’s only so much 
                        to go around, and what am I gonna 
                        do when there’s nothing left? 
                           (takes a drag)
                        Robin would know what to do. Robin 
                        always knew what to do.

           The young intern wasn’t expecting something so confessional 
           from her idol. She tries her best to comfort her.

                                 YOUNG INTERN
                        You should talk to Robin, then.

           Stevie begins to well up. She tries her damndest to hide it, 
           but it’s no use.

                                 YOUNG INTERN (CONT’D)
                        Is it something I said?

           Stevie finishes her smoke and snuffs it out. She goes back 
           inside without another word.
           The intern remains, mortified, but still not understanding 
           the depths of her faux pas. 

           INT. SOUND CITY - STUDIO - LATER

           Stevie, having dried her eyes, comes back into her domain. 

           Everyone stands at the ready.

           Harry gingerly approaches the talent. 

                                 HARRY
                        Stevie, we’re locked and loaded in 
                        here, but do mind if I steal a 
                        minute of your time?

           Harry pulls Stevie aside and out of earshot. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        First off, no hard feelings about 
                        earlier. Everyone gets it.

                                 STEVIE
                        I know. 

           Harry becomes even more gentle.

                                 HARRY
                        We’ve all been through these 
                        things, and it’s a lot of... 
                        Pressure. It’s a pressure cooker. 
                        And sometimes you need help letting 
                        a little steam out. 

           Harry goes to his jacket pocket, and retrieves a little 
           orange pill bottle. 

           Stevie inspects the gift: “KLONOPIN”  

           She tucks it away for safe keeping.

           Turning away from Harry, Stevie addresses the room. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Alright, let’s go from the top. 

           EXT. MICK’S MALIBU SPREAD - DAY

           Lindsey drives his trusty Beamer up the long driveway to 
           Mick’s beach house, which is somehow more ostentatious than 
           Stevie and Lindsey’s combined. 
           Repo men drag, push, and pull expensive pieces of tat off the 
           property one-by-one. 

           A bug-eyed Mick bargains with a tow truck driver, who’s 
           hooked up the now slightly used highlighter yellow Ferrari to 
           his rig.

                                 MICK
                        Don’t use the truck, mate. Let me 
                        give you the keys and it can leave 
                        with dignity. 

           Lindsey strolls up to the unfolding scene with a six pack of 
           Heineken. Mick’s startled by his bandmate’s sudden seeming 
           materialization. 

                                 MICK (CONT’D)
                        Oy, Linds, you look like shit. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Nice to see you, too. Is this a bad 
                        time? 

                                 MICK
                        No worse than any other. What’s on 
                        your mind?

                                 LINDSEY
                        I wanted to know if you would want 
                        to, uh, hang?

                                 MICK
                           (quick as a flash)
                        In the studio? 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Or just watch some TV. 

           Lindsey spots a big screen television led out by workers. 

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        Or talk or... Something. 

                                 MICK
                        I’m gonna level with you: Between 
                        the two of us, I’m having what 
                        professionals would call, “cash 
                        flow issues.” So, maybe, it’s time 
                        for Fleetwood Mac to jump in, two 
                        feet first, on the next album.  

           Lindsey wasn’t prepared for this conversation, whatsoever. He 
           grasps at straws.
                                 LINDSEY
                        I dunno, I heard Stevie’s working 
                        on a solo thing. Too busy to--

                                 MICK
                        Doesn’t have to be everybody... 
                        Lineup changes happen. We could be 
                        Fleetwood Buckingham. Or Buckingham 
                        Fleetwood? Whatever. Knowing you, 
                        you must be busy churning out songs 
                        left, right, and center.

           Lindsey looks his drummer/manager up and down. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Yeah, actually, I should get back 
                        to that. I’ll call you. I’ll be in 
                        touch. Soon. Very soon. Here...

           Lindsey passes Mick the sixer.

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        A gift. Condolences.  

           Lindsey hops in his car, and speeds away.

           We couldn’t begin to tell you which of the rockers is more 
           desperate.

           INT. STEVIE'S ROCK STAR MANSION - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Stevie is still wired from a big day at the studio. She 
           obsessively clicks the channel changer, cycling through every 
           available television broadcast. Sleep alludes her.

           A glass of Cab Franc on the nightstand has done nothing to 
           take the edge off. 

           Suddenly, Stevie remembers. She digs out the Klonopin from a 
           drawer.

                                 STEVIE
                        Bottoms up.

           She pops a few and chases it with her vino. 

           Stevie lies back and waits for the pills to take effect.

           EXT. BUCKINGHAM RESIDENCE - PORCH - DAY

           Lindsey, bag slung over his shoulder, has returned to his 
           childhood home. 
           Big breath. He rings the bell. 

           Lindsey shifts his weight back and forth. 

           Finally, the door opens. Ruth Buckingham seems as surprised 
           to see him as Mick, if slightly warmer to the idea. 

           INT. BUCKINGHAM RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Lindsey sits across from his mother for the first time in a 
           long time. 

           There’s a comfortable silence between them, as they sip on 
           coffees. Over Lindsey’s shoulder is Greg’s daunting shrine 
           from his adolescence. 

           Now next to it are an assortment of framed memorabilia 
           ranging Fleetwood Mac’s career, including their Rolling Stone 
           cover, the ad for their first show in San Francisco, and the 
           single of “Go Your Own Way.” 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I, uh, I brought you something. 

           Lindsey digs through his bag and retrieves his Grammy. Some 
           of the luster has worn off some in the ensuing years, but the 
           accomplishment it stands for remains impressive as ever.

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        Album of the Year. For Rumours.

                                 RUTH
                        That’s so nice. We saw it on 
                        television. 

           Ruth accepts it, and goes over to the wall, imagining where 
           the award would look best. Lindsey joins her. 

                                 RUTH (CONT’D)
                        We always had this spot picked out 
                        for you. Just waiting for you to 
                        fill it up. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        But what if I never filled it up? 

                                 RUTH
                           (sidestepping)
                        You did. That’s all that matters. 
                           (beat; re: the cover)
                        Stevie’s so cute here. How is she?

           Lindsey’s already exasperated by the maternal needling. 
                                 LINDSEY
                        Mom, honestly, I don’t know. We 
                        broke up a while ago.

           Ruth can’t help but laugh a little.

                                 RUTH
                        Oh, I know. Everyone knows.
                           (re: Rolling Stone)
                        I did skim this before framing it.
                           (beat)
                        She’s probably your oldest friend 
                        in the world. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        She got everything she ever wanted. 

           Ruth turns to look at her son. 

                                 RUTH
                        And what was that?

           Smart guy doesn’t have an answer. 

           INT. CEDARS SINAI HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Stevie, motionless, strapped to a gurney, is careened down 
           the corridor to the ER. 

           The team of medics that surround her bark jargon to one 
           another, wipe vomit from the corners of her mouth, and apply 
           an oxygen mask over her face. 

           All Stevie can do is fight to keep her eyes open. It’s a 
           losing battle, as she slips into unconsciousness...

           INT. CEDARS SINAI HOSPITAL - STEVIE’S ROOM - DAY

           Stevie awakens to find herself in a private hospital room. 
           There are no flowers, no cards, no well wishes. 

           It’s clinical in every sense of the word. 

                                 HARRY (O.S.)
                        We thought we lost you.

           Stevie turns to see her only visitor during this stay. Harry 
           sits by her side, a newspaper folded in his lap. 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                           (re: the paper)
                        You know what’s in here?
           Stevie buries her head in her hands, afraid to look.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Nothing. As far as the staff is 
                        concerned, this room is empty. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (slurred)
                        What’d you do?

                                 HARRY
                        Let’s just say our budget’s gonna 
                        be a little tighter. 

           Stevie, even in this state, understands the implication.

                                 STEVIE
                           (slurred)
                        When can I get back in the studio? 

           Harry reaches an encouraging hand out and rubs her shoulder, 
           uncertain. 

           INT. BUCKINGHAM RESIDENCE - LINDSEY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lindsey wanders around his childhood room, clutching the 45 
           of “Go Your Own Way.”

           He scans the unchanged walls. Everything is still there. A 
           poster of The Beatles’ Revolver album. Next to that is the 
           cover of The Beach Boys’ Pet Sounds. Finally, a framed photo 
           of Lindsey and Stevie at age 18, if a day. 

           In the picture, he cradles a guitar, while Stevie lays her 
           head on his chest, smiling. The relationship, when it was 
           taken, may have been platonic, but there’s obviously a lot of 
           love between these two.  

           Lindsey turns away, catching his reflection in the mirror. 
           It’s same mirror he looked into before meeting Stevie for the 
           first time.

           The exhausted man staring back at him couldn’t be any further 
           removed from that fresh-faced kid. What happened?

           Lindsey frees the vinyl pressing of “Go Your Own Way,” from 
           its sleeve, blows some dust off, and delicately places it on 
           his “Bugs Bunny” turntable. 

           The needle drops: 
                                 LINDSEY (V.O.)
                           (singing)
                        “Loving you isn’t the right thing 
                        to do...”

           The blatant cruelty directed at Stevie in that opening line 
           stings Lindsey now, as much as it was intended to sting her 
           then. 

           Lindsey can’t bear it. He flips to the B-side. 

                                 STEVIE (V.O.)
                           (singing)
                        “You could be my silver spring...”

           Suddenly, Lindsey’s hearing this song, which he’s heard 
           countless times, as if it’s brand new. 

           It’s sad, it’s sweet, and, ultimately, it’s hopeful. This 
           isn’t the screed of a woman scorned, but instead the lament 
           of the heartbroken. 

           Lindsey sees clearly what he’s done, and now what he has to 
           do.

           INT. SOUND CITY/SFO TERMINAL - DAY - SPLITSCREEN

           (THE FOLLOWING, ONCE AGAIN, TAKES PLACE IN SPLITSCREEN)

           Left side of the screen: Stevie is no longer surrounded by an 
           army of hired guns. It’s just her and the work ahead. She 
           turns on the tape machine. It winds through her electric new 
           track, “Edge of Seventeen.”

           Right side of the screen: Lindsey rushes through the San 
           Fransisco International Airport terminal. He makes his flight 
           just as they’re closing the gate. The board reads: “Los 
           Angeles, CA”

           INT./EXT. - SOUND CITY/LAX PARKING LOT - DAY - SPLITSCREEN

           Left side of the screen: Stevie seems to have taken up full 
           time residence. A mattress has been dragged into the middle 
           of the floor, and the only source of light is from a vintage 
           ceramic lamp. She adds the finishing touches by fashioning a 
           garden’s worth of paper flowers. 

           Right side of the screen: Lindsey runs up and down the aisles 
           of the parking lot, searching in vain for his trusty Beamer. 
           Finally, it’s revealed to him. Lindsey hops in and hauls ass.
           INT. SOUND CITY/BEAMER - DAY - SPLITSCREEN

           Left side of the screen: Stevie sits at the board, headphones 
           on, pouring over every detail of the final mix of Bella Dona. 
           She scribbles notes with maniacal fervor. 

           Right side of the screen: Lindsey, as he drives, rehearses 
           how it’s all going to go down. We hear choice words, like, 
           “together,” “competition,” and “fighting.” 

           INT. SOUND CITY - STUDIO - DAY

           Stevie’s side of the splitscreen expands out to encompass the 
           whole frame. It reveals the studio door behind her. 

           Lindsey enters through that door, quietly. Though Stevie 
           wouldn’t have noticed if he announced his entrance by 
           blasting a shotgun overhead. 

           He approaches her and carefully pulls off one headphone. 

                                 LINDSEY
                           (whispering)
                        Hey, Stevie. 

           Stevie keeps her cool better than Keith ever did. 

                                 STEVIE
                        How did you get in here, asshole?

                                 LINDSEY
                        I used to work here, remember? I 
                        used to be Lindsey Buckingham.

           Stevie laughs sarcastically. She turns to face him, removing 
           her headphones in the process. 

           It’s the first time either party has seen each other in a 
           little over a year. Both think the other looks awful, though 
           neither says anything. 

                                 STEVIE
                        What do you want? I’m busy. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        It seems like for a long time, we 
                        saw each other all the time. Then, 
                        all of a sudden, not at all.
                           (beat)
                        So, my mom wanted to know how you 
                        were. 
                                 STEVIE
                           (easing up)
                        You can tell her that I’m working a 
                        lot, but I’m almost finished and 
                        things will go back to normal. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Trust me, it’s not that easy. 

                                 STEVIE
                        I’m not you.

                                 LINDSEY
                        I wouldn’t dare accuse someone of 
                        that. 

           Stevie turns back to continue her micro-management. 

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go for a walk. 

                                 STEVIE
                        That’s OK.

                                 LINDSEY
                        I’m not asking. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (turning back)
                        It’s going to be one of those 
                        visits?

                                 LINDSEY
                        That’s up to you. 

           EXT. STREETS OF VAN NUYS - DAY

           It’s a hard cut from the dimly-lit mausoleum of a studio to 
           the blazing Valley sun above the mundane suburban stretch.

           On stage, their ever present leather jacket and black shawl 
           scream, “Rock star! Temperamental genius! Artist!” Out here, 
           they look more than a little silly, as they walk in silence 
           for a beat or two. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        It’s almost done? 

                                 STEVIE
                        Yeah, and I didn’t need your help. 
                        Isn’t that something? 

           Lindsey lets that barb pierce him.
                                 LINDSEY
                        I don’t want to be in competition 
                        with you anymore. You won. 

           Stevie shrugs. 

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                        But--

                                 STEVIE
                        Here it comes. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        You have to admit we were good 
                        together. 

                                 STEVIE
                        That was never a question. I just 
                        wish it was a little easier.

           The two consider unpacking that more, but can’t. Instead:

                                 LINDSEY
                        Mick wants to get back at it. 

                                 STEVIE
                        I’m over working with my exes. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        “Exes?” You and Mick?

                                 STEVIE
                           (”duh”)
                        No, me and Christine. 

           Lindsey laughs.

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                           (shifting back)
                        We broke up. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        And?

                                 STEVIE
                        Like the band. It’s done. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        No, we broke up. That was the 
                        breakup. The band is waiting. If 
                        you want to end it, then be fair, 
                        and end it. 
                                 STEVIE
                        Why would I want to put myself 
                        through that again? Why would you?

                                 LINDSEY
                        Bands fight, they all do. 
                           (beat)
                        But when there’s something worth 
                        fighting for, there’s no one I’d 
                        rather be fighting with. 

           The sentiment surprises and overwhelms them. 

           So much so, it takes a moment to realize they’ve stopped 
           walking. They look around, finding themselves on the lawn of 
           a Korean Baptist church. 

                                 LINDSEY (CONT’D)
                           (re: the church)
                        You wanna go in? 

                                 STEVIE
                        Why?

           They both can’t help but smile. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I don’t know.

           PRELAP: Lindsey’s Ovation Balladeer bubbles up. It’s in a 
           style that’s almost jazz, drawing inspiration from Django 
           Reinhardt.

           INT. CHÂTEAU D'HÉROUVILLE - STUDIO - DAY

           SUPERTITLE: SIX MONTHS LATER

           On the outskirts of Paris, things are as they always were. 

           Stevie and Lindsey, both looking healthier since we last left 
           them, sit on the floor of the studio, hard at play. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Yes, exactly. It needs to sound 
                        like gypsy guitar. Something you’d 
                        hear sitting around the fire. 

           Stevie scratches out lyric after lyric in her notebook. She 
           chews at the end of her pencil. 

           Mick, Christine, and John bop around, waiting for direction, 
           paying no mind to the creative process.
                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                           (pitching)
                        “Back to the floor that I love/To a 
                        room with some lace and paper 
                        flowers/Back to the gypsy that I 
                        was...” 
                           (beat)
                        OK, then, what?

           Lindsey nods along. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Is the “gypsy” you?

                                 STEVIE
                           (scoffs)
                        I’m writing in character. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        That’s fine, but this character 
                        sounds a lot like you, so it all 
                        comes down to you...

                                 STEVIE
                        That’s not bad.

           Stevie puts lead to paper. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        You had the thing about lightning. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Yeah?

                                 LINDSEY
                           (singing)
                        “It lights up the night/And you see 
                        your gypsy...”

                                 STEVIE
                        Did you just change perspective?

           Lindsey replays the moment in his mind. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Stevie Nicks does it all the time. 

           Stevie gives him a wry smirk.

                                 STEVIE
                        You want to be Stevie Nicks? Keep 
                        playing guitar. 

           Lindsey smirks in return. 
                                 LINDSEY
                        Let my fingers rest. 

           Lindsey puts down his guitar, and makes his way to a radio. 
           He scans the dial for any signs of life. 

           Through the static, the iconic opening chords of “Rhiannon” 
           come through. 

           He rolls his eyes, and is about to change it when:

                                 STEVIE
                        No! Keep it on. 

           Lindsey does as he’s told. 

                                 STEVIE (CONT’D)
                        Can you believe how excited we were 
                        when this got play in El Paso? 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Yeah, and now seven years later, 
                        it’s on the airwaves in France. 
                           (beat; distracted)
                        Still, I always hated this mix. 

                                 STEVIE
                        Oh, give it a rest. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        Should’ve kept the bridge. The 
                        bridge is why it always kills 
                        harder on the road. 

                                 STEVIE
                           (re: the luxurious studio)
                        I think it worked out fine. 

           There’s a tense beat as each consider their next words 
           carefully.

                        LINDSEY
                                                  STEVIE (CONT'D)
           “Tusk” charted higher...
                                           “Rhiannon” didn’t cost...

           We PULL back on another patented Stevie and Lindsey quarrel. 

           Playing and fighting.

           Fighting and playing. 

           From Palo Alto to Paris, this is how they’ll always be...

                                                          FADE OUT.
