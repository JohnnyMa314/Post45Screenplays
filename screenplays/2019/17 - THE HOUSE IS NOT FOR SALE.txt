           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           The house isn’t huge. It’s not a manor. It’s residential. 
           Families are supposed to live here. It has a porch. It’s made 
           of wood. It has character. It’s meant to be a home.

           A “For Sale” sign sticks out of the front yard. On top of it 
           another sign reads, “Open House Today! Crestfall Real Estate”

           KATHY, 60s, a business professional, pops her head in frame 
           and speaks directly to the camera.

                                 KATHY
                        Welcome to The Kaufman House. So 
                        glad you could join us.

           Margo extends her arm to the house and a NEWLYWED COUPLE - 
           JACK and DEBBIE, 30s, Debbie is very pregnant - walk into 
           frame and up to the house.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Kathy opens the front door and Jack and Debbie enter. They 
           take a look around. A modest staircase leads to a 2nd floor.

                                 JACK
                        Wow. This sure is something.

                                 KATHY
                        It’s exquisite, isn’t it? It is a 
                        fixer-upper but I like to focus on 
                        the “upper” part because of how 
                        good it makes you feel. Let’s check 
                        out the living room.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Kathy leads Jack and Debbie to the next room. The house is 
           fully furnished with white sheets over each furniture item.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Kathy, how old is this house?

                                 KATHY
                        It was built sometime during the 
                        1860s in the midst of the 
                        Reconstruction Era.

                                 KATHY (CONT'D)
                        At that time, the country was 
                        rapidly getting back on its feet 
                        after the end of the Civil War and 
                        houses all over the country started 
                        cropping up fast to capitalize on 
                        the newfound necessity of 
                        residences. 

                                 JACK
                        I love the natural light in this 
                        room.

                                 KATHY
                        Wait ‘til you see the kitchen.

           INT. KITCHEN - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Debbie checks out the oven and garbage disposal while Jack 
           sits in the breakfast nook.

                                 KATHY
                        The architect was a man named 
                        Jershua Kaufman who was more well 
                        known in the community as a 
                        carpenter than an architect.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Is that why the house is made of 
                        wood? I noticed that. Or was that 
                        common at the time?

                                 KATHY
                        Not that common, but it’s one of 
                        the most unique qualities of house.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE

           Jack and Debbie follow Kathy up the stairs. Jack helps Debbie 
           steady herself because of her pregnant belly.

                                 KATHY
                        Jershua Kaufman became the 
                        architect because a client of his 
                        named Reginald Balkwhitt was such a 
                        fan of his work that he wanted 
                        Kaufman to build his home for his 
                        family as well.
           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Debbie looks out the window. Jack looks in the walk-in closet 
           and then comes out to test the mattress.

                                 KATHY
                        This would be Kaufman’s last work. 
                        The pressure to get the house done 
                        in time before Balkwhitt returned 
                        from the recently finished war 
                        eventually got to him and he passed 
                        away mere days after completing the 
                        house.

                                 JACK
                        How sad.

                                 DEBBIE
                        But poetic in some way too.

           INT. HALLWAY - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Kathy heads back to the staircase. Jack comes out of the 
           bathroom. Debbie passes by a large floor to ceiling MIRROR in 
           the middle of the hallway and looks at her belly.

                                 JACK
                        At least the running water works. 
                        You’d be surprised how many places 
                        we’ve looked at where that’s been 
                        an issue.

           Debbie stops at a closed door. She turns the door knob but 
           the door doesn’t open.

                                 DEBBIE
                             (to Kathy)
                        What’s in here?

                                 KATHY
                             (slightly nervous)
                        Oh that’s just an extra storage 
                        room. Very spacious. But the lock 
                        is a little finicky so we’ll have 
                        someone come out and take care of 
                        that. Part of the charm of a fixer-
                        upper, am I right? 

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Kathy leads Jack and Debbie back onto the front porch.
                                 JACK
                        Well, I think the place is great. 
                        Feels very much what we’re looking 
                        for.

                                 DEBBIE
                        It’s so great that the place is 
                        already fully furnished.

                                 JACK
                        And the price is to die for.

                                 KATHY
                        I’m so glad to hear that.

                                 DEBBIE
                        We’ll take it.

                                 KATHY
                             (relieved)
                        Oh wonderful!

           Kathy pulls out a set of keys and some papers from her bag 
           and hands them to Debbie.

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                        Here’s a set of keys for you if 
                        you’d like to go ahead and stay the 
                        night tonight as well as some 
                        initial things to sign. I’ll bring 
                        over the rest of the paperwork in 
                        the morning. Congratulations. 

           Jack puts his arm around Debbie.

                                 JACK
                        Thank you for all your help, Kathy.

                                 KATHY
                        Please, I should be the one 
                        thanking you. See you in the 
                        morning.

           INT. KATHY’S CAR - DAY

           Kathy gets into her car and lets out a sigh of relief.

                                 KATHY
                        Oh thank god...

           She looks out the window and waves to Jack and Debbie but the 
           expression on her face is a pained one. She drives away.
           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Night has fallen. A light shines from a 2nd floor window.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jack changes into his pajamas while Debbie, in her nightgown, 
           rubs lotion on her hands.

                                 DEBBIE
                        I still like “Daphne.”

                                 JACK
                        It’s too “Scooby-Doo.”

                                 DEBBIE
                        Oh come on. You wanted to name her 
                        “Angelica.”

                                 JACK
                        What’s wrong with “Angelica”?

                                 DEBBIE
                        There’s only one “Angelica” and 
                        it’s that brat from “Rugrats.” No 
                        way.

                                 JACK
                        Wow, I can’t believe you forgot the 
                        other and arguably better 
                        “Angelica.”

                                 DEBBIE
                        Oh and who is that?

                                 JACK
                             (singing)
                        Angelica! Eliza! And Peggy!

           Jack nuzzles his face into Debbie’s neck and they laugh and 
           collapse into the bed. 

                                 DEBBIE
                        All right, all right. You got me.

                                 JACK
                        You’re damn right I do.

           They kiss. They love each other.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        I was actually thinking... maybe we 
                        should name her after your mom?
                                 DEBBIE
                        “Blair?”

                                 JACK
                        Yeah, since she’ll never get to 
                        meet her Grandma... this way she 
                        gets to keep a part of her with her 
                        always.

                                 DEBBIE
                             (touched)
                        You’re wonderful.

           BANG.

           A loud noise from the hallway startles Jack and Debbie.

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        What was that?

                                 JACK
                        I don’t know... stay here.

           Jack gets out of the bed and leaves the room.

           INT. HALLWAY - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jack exits the bedroom and looks down the hallway. Nothing 
           looks out of the ordinary. He looks over the railing to the 
           first floor. Also normal looking.

           Jack almost goes back into the bedroom when something catches 
           his eye. The locked door to the storage room IS WIDE OPEN.

                                 DEBBIE (O.S.)
                        Jack, what is it?

                                 JACK
                        That door that was locked before 
                        must’ve swung open somehow. I’m 
                        just gonna go close it and be right 
                        back.

                                 DEBBIE (O.S.)
                        Oh weird. Okay. Make sure it’s shut 
                        tight.

           Jack heads down the hallway and reaches the door. He’s about 
           the close it when--

                                 WHISPERED VOICE
                        Jack...
           Jack looks up, spooked. There’s no one around. 

                                 WHISPERED VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Jack...

           The voice appears to be coming from inside the storage room. 
           Jack takes a cautious step inside.

           INT. STORAGE ROOM - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jack enters the room, which is completely empty and extremely 
           long. Nothing is in the white room except on the opposite 
           wall is ANOTHER DOOR - and it’s blood red.

                                 WHISPERED VOICE
                        ...you piece of shit...

           The voice came from the far end of the long room. Jack looks 
           over, but it’s too dark to see if there’s anything there.

                                 JACK
                        Hello?

           Jack heads down the room to the other end. As he walks THE 
           RED DOOR MOVES DOWN THE WALL AS WELL - AS IF IT’S FOLLOWING 
           HIM AS HE WALKS. Jack doesn’t notice.

                                 WHISPERED VOICE
                        You’re not ready to be a father. 
                        You can’t support a child. You’re 
                        going to end up just as shitty as 
                        your old man. Or worse.

                                 JACK
                        Who the hell are you and what are 
                        you doing in my house?

                                 WHISPERED VOICE
                        Jack...

           The door to the room SLAMS SHUT. Jack whips his head around 
           and sees that the Red Door has followed him.

                                 JACK
                        What the hell?

           The Red Door then BURSTS OPEN and a BLINDING LIGHT and LOUD 
           SHRIEKS emanate out of it, startling Jack.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        OH MY GOD!!

            A FLOOD OF BLOOD explodes from the Red Door, drowning Jack.
           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Debbie hears Jack scream. She gets out of the bed.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Jack?

           INT. HALLWAY - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Debbie makes her way down the hallway towards the now closed 
           storage room door. She moves as quickly as she can, but she’s 
           pregnant and holds onto the railing to help her.

                                 DEBBIE
                        Jack? Is everything all right? I’m 
                        coming.

           Debbie passes the large mirror but stops and looks at it.

           In the mirror she sees herself, but with a GIGANTIC GASH IN 
           HER STOMACH dripping blood and she’s holding her BLOODY BABY 
           still attached to her with the UMBILICAL CORD. 

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god...

           Mirror Debbie cocks her head and then THROWS THE BLOODY BABY 
           at real Debbie. The Bloody Baby comes OUT OF THE MIRROR, 
           directly to Debbie’s face, and lets out a SCREAM!

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        NO!!

           Debbie startles backwards and trips over the railing and 
           FALLS OVER THE EDGE AND SLAMS INTO THE FLOOR BELOW, 
           immediately dying.

           The storage room door flies open and the red blood flows out 
           and down the stairs.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jack’s dead (and red) body floats down the stairs until it 
           reaches the bottom... right by Debbie’s dead body.

                                 WHISPERED VOICE
                        Jack... Debbie...

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - MORNING

           The next day, Kathy parks in front of the house.
                                 KATHY
                        Everything looks okay...

           She heads up to the front door and is about to open it when 
           IT OPENS ITSELF. Kathy closes her eyes, about to cry.

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                        Shit...

           The door swings open and Kathy sees the dead bodies of Jack 
           and Debbie in front of her on the floor. Kathy is crushed. 
           She looks up into the house.

                                 KATHY (CONT’D)
                        God damn you. GOD DAMN YOU.

           EXT. LAKE PETER PAN - DAY

           A crystal clear lake with a sign that reads “Lake Peter Pan - 
           Where You Never Have to Grow Up” next to it.

           Kathy sits in her car, looking out at the lake. She looks 
           beaten down, as if she just stopped crying.

           She reaches over to the clicker for the power windows and 
           rolls her window down. She takes a long, deep breath in of 
           the fresh air. It’s satisfying.

           Kathy then rolls down the passenger side window. And then 
           both of the back windows. All the windows down.

           Then she starts the car and slowly drives TOWARDS THE LAKE. 
           The car gets to the edge of the lake and then continues to 
           drive forward until the car is completely submerged.

                                      CUT TO TITLE: 
                                 THE HOUSE IS NOT FOR SALE

           INT. GALLIGAN BERINGER REAL ESTATE - DAY

           JAMIE, a 33-year-old nail biter, looks over to ANNETTE, 29, 
           wearing a cardigan she knit herself.

                                 ANNETTE
                        The way they do this is so ass-
                        backwards. It’s like the Hunger 
                        Games.
                                 JAMIE
                        Isn’t it supposed to be equal 
                        opportunity and whatnot?

                                 ANNETTE
                        They say that but the deck is 
                        stacked. Always is. Behind closed 
                        door politics. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Shit.

                                 ANNETTE
                        As long as I don’t get the 
                        Rainfield apartment...

                                 JAMIE
                        Don’t say that! You’re gonna jinx 
                        it and make me get it instead.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Oh is that how it works? Where’s 
                        Don? Lemme say it near him so he 
                        gets Rainfield.

                                 JAMIE
                        Didn’t know that you felt that 
                        strongly about him. 

                                 ANNETTE
                             (coy)
                        Couldn’t possibly know what you’re 
                        talking about.

           Jamie spots DON, 30 and perfect, walking towards them.

                                 JAMIE
                        Alert alert.

                                 DON
                        Female comrades - how’re we feeling 
                        about the Battle Royale day?

                                 JAMIE
                        As prepared as one can be. I 
                        believe Annette has some more 
                        specific feelings on the matter 
                        though.

                                 DON
                        Oh really? Care to share, Annette?
                                 ANNETTE
                        I... uh... I just hope that... we 
                        all do our best today.

           Don and Jamie share a look with each other - Really?

                                 DON
                        Your insightfulness never fails to 
                        impress, Annette.

           MRS. BURNHOFFER, 60s & your mother’s neighbor, comes out with 
           her fellow top agents and a bowl in her hand.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        Today is an exciting day here at 
                        Galligan Beringer Real Estate. It’s 
                        our annual Prove-Yourself-Promotion 
                        Day. At the end of today, one of 
                        you Junior Associates will join the 
                        ranks of us and finally be known as 
                        a Senior Agent.

                                 ANNETTE
                             (whispering to herself)
                        Senior Agent...

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        The rules are simple - here in the 
                        bowl are a dozen of our toughest 
                        unfilled listings. You will pull 
                        one out and then have the rest of 
                        today to close - or get as close as 
                        you can to closing - on that 
                        property. Whoever completes this 
                        gargantuan task the best - not 
                        necessarily the first, though 
                        swiftness will be taken into 
                        consideration - will be promoted by 
                        day’s end. So let’s get this party 
                        started, shall we? Don - you’re up 
                        first.

           Don heads up to the bowl and reaches in.

                                 ANNETTE
                             (under her breath)
                        Rainfield... Rainfield... 
                        Rainfield...

                                 JAMIE
                        What are you saying?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Nothing.
           Don reads his listing.

                                 DON
                        Haverford Avenue.

                                 JAMIE
                        Of course.

                                 ANNETTE
                        My dead gerbil could sell the 
                        Haverford property.

                                 DON
                        Good luck to all my friends!

           Annette and Jamie force smiles and wave as Don leaves.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        Jamie.

           Jamie goes to the bowl. Annette thinks for a second and then--

                                 ANNETTE
                             (under her breath)
                        Rainfield... Rainfield...

           Jamie pulls out her listing.

                                 JAMIE
                        Wild Plum Drive.

           Jamie smiles at Annette, who can barely muster one back.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        Annette.

           Annette gets up, swirls her hand in the bowl, picks a 
           listing, and looks at it. Her eyebrows raise.

           EXT. RAINFIELD APARTMENTS - DAY

           Annette parks her car outside of Rainfield Apartments, which 
           is a total dump. She walks to the “Apartment for Rent” sign 
           and places an “Open House Today” sign on top of it.

           INT. RAINFIELD UNIT - DAY

           Annette unlocks the door to the apartment and finds it’s also 
           a dump. The ceiling leaks, spots on the walls, the florescent 
           light flashes, there’s a pile of dirt in the kitchen.
                                 ANNETTE
                        Great.

           She gets to work cleaning the place. Annette takes out a 
           bottle of white nail polish and uses it to fill in the spots 
           on the walls.

           She unplugs the florescent light but it continues to flash 
           somehow. Unsure what to do, she looks around and then decides 
           to stick the cord into the ceiling hole where it’s leaking.

           There’s a brief SHORT CIRCUIT and everything goes dark for a 
           moment but then the light turns on and stays on. And the leak 
           is stopped now. Annette looks proud.

           She goes to the kitchen to tackle the pile of dirt. But 
           there’s a KNOCK on the door.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           Annette goes to the door and finds a YOUNG MAN & WOMAN. 
           Before she opens the door, Annette tightens her belt by two 
           loop holes to try and make herself look skinnier.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                        Hi, we’re here to look at the 
                        apartment?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Yes! Come on in. I’m Annette Swip 
                        from Galligan Beringer Real Estate. 
                        So nice to meet y’all. 

           BEGIN MONTAGE

           We see MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE come look at the apartment and 
           Annette shows them around.

           -With the YOUNG MAN & WOMAN

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        It’s one bed, one bath. Plenty of 
                        space for two.

           -With an OLD MAN

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)

           -With an OLD WOMAN with a dog
                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)

           -With a WOMAN with a baby

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        The whole place is getting 
                        reupholstered tomorrow. We do the 
                        upkeep ourselves because we want 
                        our residents to have the best 
                        property possible.

           -With a MIDDLE AGED GAY COUPLE

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        And it’s actually the cheapest unit 
                        in the building, which is a 
                        sensational deal--

                                 GAY MAN
                        Excuse me? Is that a pile of dirt?

           QUICK CUTS OF ALL THE POSSIBLE TENANTS

                                 WOMAN WITH BABY
                        Is that a pile of dirt?

                                 OLD WOMAN WITH DOG
                        Is that dirt?

                                 OLD MAN
                        Is that a mound of dirt?

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Is that a pile of dirt?

           Annette looks nervous.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Yes, um, don’t know how that got 
                        here but we are working on getting 
                        it cleaned up right away.

           QUICK CUTS OF THE POSSIBLE TENANTS SLAMMING THE FRONT DOOR--

           --all except for the Old Man.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Does the mound of dirt come with 
                        the place?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Well--
                                 OLD MAN
                        Because if so, I’ll take it.

           Annette looks perplexed but rolls with it.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Here are some forms to fill out.

           INT. GALLIGAN BERINGER REAL ESTATE - NIGHT

           Annette walks in at the end of the day to find the office 
           empty. She finds a file stacker that says “Prove-Yourself 
           Closed Properties.” It’s empty. Annette places her file down.

                                 ANNETTE
                        The first one... Am I the first 
                        one...? I did it. I DID IT!

           Annette bursts into a dance-like-no-one-is-watching dance. A 
           voice behind her clear its throat. Annette freezes and turns 
           around to see Jamie.

                                 JAMIE
                        Hey, been wondering where you were. 
                        Come join us in the back.

                                 ANNETTE
                        “Us”?

           INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           Jamie and Annette enter a back room that’s in full party 
           mode. All employees drinking and music playing. They enter 
           just as Mrs. Burnhoffer heads to the front.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        Ladies and gentlemen, in the 23 
                        years of Galligan Beringer Real 
                        Estate and our 8 years of doing 
                        Prove-Yourself-Promotions, today 
                        set a record for the fastest and 
                        most lucrative closure we’ve ever 
                        had here. So would like to welcome 
                        to the front, for the first time as 
                        a Senior Agent, Don Hutton.

           Annette’s heart sinks as everyone else claps and Don takes to 
           the front of the room.

                                 DON
                        Well, I couldn’t have done it 
                        without my competitors. 
           As everyone laughs, Annette heads out of the room.

           INT. GALLIGAN BERINGER REAL ESTATE - NIGHT

           Annette grabs an empty box and begins clearing out her desk. 
           She also loosens her belt to a more comfortable position. She 
           sees the tightness has left a dark welt on her skin.

                                 DON
                        Hey there, champ.

           Annette turns around to see Don behind her.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Don! What’re you... I mean, 
                        congratulations. 

                                 DON
                        Thanks. Y’know, I couldn’t have 
                        done it without my competitors.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Yeah, I heard that. Well, I hope 
                        being a Senior Agent is everything 
                        I’d dreamed... I mean you’d dreamed 
                        it’d be. 

                                 DON
                        Well that’s what I wanted to talk 
                        to you about, Annette. Look, I’ve 
                        been watching you. Closely. And I 
                        think you’ve got the kind of 
                        potential that just needs the right 
                        outlet for you to really soar. So 
                        that’s why, with my new title and 
                        power, I’d like to give you an 
                        opportunity to really come into 
                        your own.

           Annette sets her box down, hopefully.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Oh yeah?

                                 DON
                        Yeah - as my assistant.

           Annette’s eye twitches in resentment.
                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Look, another couple years working 
                        closely one-on-one, allowing me to 
                        mentor you in this business in 
                        between you pick up my dry cleaning 
                        and coffee, I think would really do 
                        you some good. So think about it, 
                        will ya? This is quite the chance 
                        I’m offering you. Think about it!

           Don pats Annette on the shoulder and leaves the room.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Don’t scream, Swip. Don’t scream...

           Annette can’t help it and works herself up about to scream, 
           but then THE SOUND CUTS OUT--

                                 MAN WHISPER
                        Annette.

           Annette looks up at the sound of her name.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        Annette.

           Annette turns around and sees Mrs. Burnhoffer holding her 
           completed file report.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER (CONT’D)
                        Come into my office, let’s talk 
                        about this.

           Annette shakes it off. Must’ve misheard a man’s voice.

           INT. MRS. BURNHOFFER’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Annette sits across from Mrs. Burnhoffer.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        So you rented the Rainfield unit?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Yes ma’am.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        Do you know how long we’ve been 
                        trying to get someone in there?

                                 ANNETTE
                        For as long as I’ve been working 
                        here, Mrs. Burnhoffer.
                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        Which has been how long?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Two years and eight months.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        Hmmm. How long has Don been working 
                        here again?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Ten months, ma’am.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        Mmhmm. So today’s been a bit of a 
                        disappointment for you then.

           Annette struggles to find the right thing to say. She finally 
           stammers out:

                                 ANNETTE
                        I’m happy for Don.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        Annette, I’ve been watching you--

                                 ANNETTE
                        Oh my god please don’t ask me to be 
                        your assistant because no I won’t.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        Not what I was going to ask.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Sorry. A little PTSD there.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        Y’know you’re the only other person 
                        who closed on a property today.

                                 ANNETTE
                        I was?

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        Uh-huh. And, again, not an easy 
                        one.
                             (beat)
                        Don’s going to make a fine Senior 
                        Agent. But let me tell you 
                        something that nobody else knows - 
                        Cheryl’s retiring at the end of the 
                        year. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER (CONT'D)
                        So we’re going to have another 
                        Senior Agent position open in the 
                        near future. And I think you’d be a 
                        shoe-in for that job--

                                 ANNETTE
                        Really?

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        If--

                                 ANNETTE
                        If?

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        If you pulled off one more 
                        “impossible” properties like 
                        Rainfield. If I turn in two reports 
                        like this to our hiring committee, 
                        there’d be no denying you’re the 
                        right person for the job.

                                 ANNETTE
                             (processing)
                        One more... “impossible” 
                        property... Okay. What do you have 
                        in mind?

           Mrs. Burnhoffer smiles and opens a drawer and grabs a file.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        Ever heard of Chimerical, Kansas?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Actually, yes. It’s about two hours 
                        North of my hometown of Woodsmith.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        You’re from Kansas? Explains a lot.

           Mrs. Burnhoffer slides the new file over to Annette.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER (CONT’D)
                        We have a sister branch out there - 
                        Crestfall Real Estate - that has a 
                        property that’s been on the market 
                        for a long while and the agent in 
                        charge of it recently passed away 
                        unexpectedly. So they’ve asked for 
                        our help. 

           Annette opens the file and sees a picture of The Kaufman 
           House.
                                 ANNETTE
                        A house? You want me to go sell a 
                        house in Kansas?

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        Think you’re up for it? 

                                 ANNETTE
                        And if I sell this “impossible” 
                        property in Kansas?

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        Then one of these--

           Mrs. Burnhoffer taps the “Senior Agent” name tag on her desk.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER (CONT’D)
                        --will be waiting for you when you 
                        get back.

           Annette smiles. She looks back down at the picture of the 
           Kaufman House. She stares at it. 

           It almost looks as if there’s a FIGURE STANDING IN THE SECOND 
           FLOOR WINDOW.

           Annette squints at the Figure until THE FIGURE WAVES AT HER.

           Annette JUMPS and snaps the file shut.

           INT. ANNETTE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Rain falls. Annette sleeps. The file on The Kaufman House 
           lies open on her desk. The picture of the house on top.

           In the picture, The Figure walks back into the window. Then 
           TWO MORE FIGURES APPEAR IN OTHER WINDOWS IN THE PICTURE.

           Thunder rolls. Annette readjusts in bed. From behind her, A 
           VERY REAL ROTTING HAND EMERGES FROM THE PICTURE, CLAWING AT 
           THE AIR.

           Lightning strikes outside. The flash of light in the sky 
           briefly lights up the bedroom and in that moment we see THE 
           THREE FIGURES STANDING OVER ANNETTE’S BED.

           They vanish just as quickly as they appeared, in the shine of 
           a bolt of lightning.
           EXT. KANSAS AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Raining. Annette, suitcase in hand, looks down at her phone, 
           her Uber says it’s “Arriving.” A Mini-Cooper pulls up and 
           HONKS. That’s her ride. Annette gets in.

           INT. ROXXY’S CAR - NIGHT

           Annette gets in. The car drives off. Roxxy is driving.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Thanks so much.

                                 ROXXY
                        Y’know, I was just about to clock 
                        out for the night, but then when I 
                        saw it was you I was picking up, I 
                        knew I had to come.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Sorry do I know you?

                                 ROXXY
                        Whaddya talkin’ about? ‘Course you 
                        know me.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Sorry, the multiple facial 
                        piercings might be throwing me off.

                                 ROXXY
                        It’s Roxxy Harris! We dissected 
                        fetal pigs together at Ferris 
                        Woodsmith Academy!

                                 ANNETTE
                             (has no fucking idea who 
                              this is)
                        Oh yeah! Hi! 

                                 ROXXY
                        So crazy seeing you. I don’t think 
                        I’ve seen you since Kurt Driver 
                        publicly rejected you at senior 
                        prom for Holly Brightman.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Wow thanks for bringing that gold 
                        star moment of my past up.

                                 ROXXY
                        Y’know he’s engaged to Holly now?
                                 ANNETTE
                        Yes, I have Facebook.

                                 ROXXY
                        Crazy how that shit happens, man.

                                 ANNETTE
                             (desperate to change the 
                              subject)
                        So... you’re an Uber driver?

                                 ROXXY
                        I’m a Renaissance woman, Annette. 
                        No one job can hold me down. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        And you still live in Woodsmith? 11 
                        years after high school.

                                 ROXXY
                        Hell nah. I got out of there.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Oh good for you.

                                 ROXXY
                        Moved up to Chimerical. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        ...two hours North of Woodsmith.

                                 ROXXY
                        Yeah man, just had to get out for a 
                        change of scenery. Y’know? I’m 
                        Roxxy Harris! No one town can hold 
                        me down.

                                 ANNETTE
                        I can imagine.

                                 ROXXY
                        But you, dude. Tell me about LA.

                                 ANNETTE
                        You remembered I moved to LA?

                                 ROXXY
                        Dude, no one gets out of this 
                        place, so you remember the ones 
                        that do.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Well I... 
                             (she makes a decision)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANNETTE (CONT'D)
                        I’m a Senior Agent at Galligan 
                        Beringer Real Estate, which is one 
                        of the top agencies in Beverly 
                        Hills.

                                 ROXXY
                        No shit!

                                 ANNETTE
                        Yeah! But it sounds like a much 
                        bigger deal than it actually is.

                                 ROXXY
                        Well it sounds dope as shit. Have 
                        you sold houses to anyone famous?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Umm... yeah. Happens all the time. 
                        No big deal. I found Tea Leoni a 
                        new place in Malibu. I helped Zach 
                        Braff land this gorgeous penthouse 
                        in Downtown. I very recently closed 
                        on a new condo for Margo Martindale 
                        and she was so appreciative that 
                        she treated me to a manicure 
                        afterwards. A queen.

                                 ROXXY
                        In-freakin’-credible, man. Gotta 
                        say, your life sounds seriously 
                        legit, even if you have put on a 
                        few pounds since high school.

                                 ANNETTE
                        I’m sorry, what?

           Roxxy’s phone BEEPS.

                                 ROXXY
                        Oh shit, new Pool pick-up. One sec.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Wait, is this an Uber Pool?

                                 ROXXY
                        I always drive Uber Pool. Better 
                        tip money. Lemme just pull over 
                        here--

           The car pulls over. Roxxy rolls down the window to see who 
           she’s picking up. Her eyebrows raise in delight.
                                 ROXXY (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit! No way!

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. ROXXY’S CAR - LATER

           Annette sits crammed in the back with a Man and a Woman.

                                 ROXXY
                        Kurt Driver and Holly Brightman! 
                        What are the odds, man? We were 
                        just talking about you!

                                 HOLLY
                             (to Kurt)
                        I can’t believe you clicked on Uber 
                        Pool.

                                 KURT
                             (to Holly)
                        It was an accident!

                                 ROXXY
                        Do you know who is sitting in the 
                        backseat with you?

                                 KURT
                        Yes, hi Annette.

           Annette, still thrown off by Roxxy’s weight comment, 
           desperately fidgets with her sweater to try and make herself 
           more presentable. She finally puts her purse over her tummy.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Hi Kurt. Hi Holly.

                                 HOLLY
                        I didn’t say hi to you.

                                 KURT
                             (to Annette)
                        You look... nice.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Than--

                                 ROXXY
                        Holly, you look good, girl. Damn. 
                        Who loses weight after high school? 
                        I guess Holly Brightman does.
                                 HOLLY
                        Why thank you, Roxxy. I do a daily 
                        regime of powdered ani-oxidants 
                        which I...

           Annette closes her eyes and starts MUTTERING to herself to 
           drown out the conversation. The sound muffles and then CUTS 
           OUT as she focuses on her own voice. 

           And then--

                                 WOMAN WHIPSER
                        Annette...

           Annette’s eyes snap open. Still no sound. But she definitely 
           heard a female voice that sounds from beyond the grave.

                                 WOMAN WHIPSER (CONT’D)
                        ANNETTE...

           Annette looks up and the SOUND comes rushing back. She sees 
           everyone in the car staring at her.

                                 ROXXY
                        Annette, I was just telling these 
                        two lovers about your bougie-ass A-
                        lister job.

                                 KURT
                        You sell homes to famous people?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Oh... well, I--

                                 ROXXY
                        She just got Zach Braff a 
                        penthouse.

                                 HOLLY
                        Oh? I didn’t know Zach was moving. 
                        He hasn’t texted me about it.

           Annette GULPS.

                                 ANNETTE
                        You know Zach Braff?

                                 KURT
                        Holly’s in public relations. Social 
                        media consulting. Mostly for local 
                        business owners but she has a 
                        couple more prominent clients.
                                 ROXXY
                        Sounds like you and Holly aren’t 
                        too dissimilar, huh Annette?

           An awkward beat of silence.

                                 KURT
                        So, why’re you in town?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Oh I’m here to sell a house up in 
                        Chimerical.

                                 ROXXY
                        Oh no shit! That’s where I live 
                        now!

                                 ANNETTE
                        Yes, I remember, Roxxy.

                                 KURT
                        That’s super cool, Annette. I’m 
                        really happy to hear you’re doing 
                        so well.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Thanks.

           The car pulls over.

                                 ROXXY
                        Lovebirds, this is your stop.

                                 HOLLY
                        Thank god.

           Holly and Kurt get out of the car.

                                 KURT
                        Nice to see you both again.

                                 ROXXY
                        Hell yeah, dude!

                                 ANNETTE
                        Bye.

           Kurt shuts the door. A beat passes.

                                 ROXXY
                        Well thank god that wasn’t awkward.
           EXT. DAYS INN - NIGHT

           Annette gets out of Roxxy’s car.

                                 ROXXY
                        Thanks for riding! We should hang 
                        out sometime while you’re in town!

                                 ANNETTE
                        For sure! Thanks again!

           Annette shuts the car door and Roxxy drives off.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Get yourself a rental car, Swip.

           EXT. CRESTFALL REAL ESTATE - DAY

           The next day - Annette walks up to a small house that’s been 
           repurposed to be an office. A sign reads “Crestfall Real 
           Estate” out front. 

           Annette checks a piece of paper - it’s the right address. The 
           house is pretty crummy looking though. She goes up to the 
           front door and finds it unlocked.

           INT. CRESTFALL REAL ESTATE - DAY

           Annette finds the entire house has no walls and is completely 
           open air. Sitting at a desk is ILSA, 60s, a dead-ringer for 
           Ms. Burnhoffer, slurping a Cup of Noodles.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Ms. Burnhoffer?

                                 ILSA
                        Huh?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Oh, I’m sorry, I thought you were 
                        someone else. 

                                 ILSA
                        Nope. I’m just me. What can I do 
                        for you, sweetcheeks? If you’re 
                        here about the Congress Street 
                        property, you’re too late. Closed 
                        this morning.

           Annette pulls out the file from her purse.
                                 ANNETTE
                        No, I’m Annette Swip, I’m from 
                        Galligan Beringer, and I’m here 
                        about The Kaufman House.

           Ilsa cuts her slurping short and stares at Annette.

                                 ILSA
                        Oh. I was expecting someone a 
                        little more... polished.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Ma’am, I assure you, I am extremely 
                        eager to--

                                 ILSA
                        Now you listen to me, Ms. Switch.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Swip.

                                 ILSA
                        I’ve lost more good people on this 
                        property than I care to admit.

                        If you know what’s good for you, 
                        you’ll just go back to wherever you 
                        came from and hope that you never 
                        hear the words “Kaufman House” 
                        again in your life.

                                 ANNETTE
                        I’m not sure I understand what 
                        you’re saying.

                                 ILSA
                        I’m saying if you want to keep on 
                        living, you should leave.

           Annette and Ilsa stare at each other.

                                 ANNETTE
                        And what if I want to sell the 
                        house?

           Ilsa pulls out a ring of keys and holds them on her index 
           finger at Annette.

                        Then it’s your funeral.
           Annette cautiously walks over to Ilsa. She attempts to take 
           the keys but Ilsa grabs her hand.

                        Let go of me.

           Ilsa and Annette struggle over the keys for a moment until 
           Ilsa finally lets go, giving Annette the keys. Annette 
           hurries out of the house.

           INT. ANNETTE’S RENTAL CAR - DAY

           Annette drives.

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Annette gets out of the Mini Cooper and looks upon The 
           Kaufman House for the first time. She pulls the file from her 
           bag and looks at the picture of the house.

           No people in the windows in the picture.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Think you’re up for it, Swip?

           Annette cracks her knuckles.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Yep.

           She approaches the house. She gets to the front door and puts 
           the key in the lock and opens the door.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Annette walks in, taking it all in for the first time.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Wow.

           She runs her hands over the staircase railing, feeling the 
           wood. She takes a step towards the living room and hears a 
           SQUEAK from beneath her feet. A loose board in the floor.
           Annette takes out a pad and a pen and writes.

                        “Front Room - squeaky floorboard.” 
                        M’kay, let’s see what else you’ve 
                        got in store for me.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Annette takes the white sheets off of each furniture item and 
           makes a note of each one and if there’s any damage to them. 
           She then puts the sheets back on each item.

           INT. KITCHEN - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Annette checks the fridge, the stove, everything. Then she 
           hears a slight WHOOSH from behind her.

           She turns around and sees through the doorway that one of the 
           white sheets has FALLEN OFF one a chair in the living room.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Huh.

           She goes back and puts it back on.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Annette goes up the staircase.

           INT. HALLWAY - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Annette makes her way down the hallway and stops at the 
           mirror. She gets real close to it and inspects it for cracks.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Wow, you’re in really good shape.

           She steps back and looks at herself in the mirror. She 
           doesn’t like what she sees.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Annette checks the bed. Its springs CREAK. She writes.

                                 ANNETTE
                        “Call Tempurpedic.”
           INT. HALLWAY - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Annette gets to the door to the storage room and it won’t 
           open. She tries to strong-arm the door open but it won’t 
           budge. She puts the keys into the lock but they won’t turn.

                                 ANNETTE
                        “Get locksmith.” Okay, enough to 
                        get started.

           Annette starts down the stairs when THE DOOR TO THE STORAGE 
           ROOM OPENS, ITS HINGES SQUEAKING. Annette turns around to see 
           the door open.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        What the...?

           She slowly makes her way back up the stairs and inches 
           towards the door. As she gets closer she starts to hear 
           VOICES, seemingly coming from the room.

           The VOICES are HUSHED so she can’t make out what they’re 
           saying or even if they’re actually voices at all.

           Annette reaches out for the door but right before she touches 
           it - THE DOOR SLAMS SHUT ON ITS OWN, scaring Annette.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ!

           She tries the doorknob again but the door is locked.

                        Okay... “Get locksmith first.”

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Annette runs down the stairs and gets to the front door but 
           stops. She turns and looks through the doorway to see ALL THE 
           WHITE SHEETS IN THE LIVING ROOM ARE OFF THE FURNITURE.

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Annette walks out of the house and dials her cell phone.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Hi, is this Gloria? Hi Gloria! This 
                        is Annette Swip. Yes, little

                        Listen, was wondering if I could 
                        call in a favor.
           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY - LATER

           The next day. A lot of activity going on in the house.

           A large Tempurpedic mattress makes its way through the front 
           door being carried by two MOVING MEN.

           Annette, with her hair up in a bandana, comes up to them.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Okay boys, that goes up the stairs 
                        and into the last room on your 
                        left. And you’re gonna move that 
                        old creaky one out of here too?

                                 MOVING MAN #1

                        Thank you kindly.

           The Moving Men take the mattress up the stairs as Annette 
           moves into...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           An UPHOLSTER looks over the sofa.

                                 ANNETTE
                        What do you think?

                                 UPHOLSTER
                        The material is the genuine 
                        article. Same century as the house 
                        itself. Great condition. Obviously 
                        there’s some aging, but nothing 
                        that I can’t handle today.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Okay, you do that, but let me know 
                        if it’s gonna end up being a bigger 
                        job ASAP because this place being 
                        fully furnished is one of its key 
                        selling points. I need all of them 
                        here for the open house tomorrow.

                        Copy that.

           Annette slides into...
           INT. KITCHEN - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Some REMODELERS are in the midst of replacing the old sink 
           with a new stainless steel one. Some others are finding the 
           right place for a kitchen island in the middle of the room.

                                 ANNETTE
                        I think the island should be 
                        centered in between the fridge and 
                        the sink, don’t you think? Can you 
                        measure out that distance on the 
                        floor please? Thank you.

           Annette scurries out of the kitchen...

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Annette bounds up the stairs, having to make way for the 
           Moving Men coming down with the old mattress.

                                 ANNETTE

           INT. HALLWAY - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Annette gets to the top of the stairs to find GLORIA, 60s, a 
           locksmith, on her knees in front of storage room door.

                                 ANNETTE
                        So, any luck?

                                 GLORIA
                        Can’t believe I’m having as tough a 
                        time with this son of a bitch as I 
                        am. Never met a lock I couldn’t 
                        crack.

                                 ANNETTE
                        That’s why I called you. But there 
                        comes a day when all of us must 
                        come face-to-face with our mortal 
                        limits.
                                 GLORIA
                        I’ve even tried to make an 
                        impression of the lock so I could 
                        just make you a new key, but every 
                        time I put one of my molds in, this 
                        happens.

           Gloria pulls up several molding sticks, all of which look 
           brand new.

                                 ANNETTE
                        They look unused to me, Gloria.

                                 GLORIA
                        Exactly! I slide them in and then 
                        they slide right out without a dent 
                        on them. It’s like the lock is 
                        completely smooth inside. I’m plum 
                        out of ideas here, Annette. Sorry 
                        to disappoint you.

           Annette steps back and looks at the door.

                                 ANNETTE
                        What if we took the door off by its

                        Yeah. Why not? I can say we’re 
                        getting a new door made - which I 
                        will do - one with a working lock. 
                        And then that way people can take a 
                        look at the space.

           Gloria DRILLS and SOCKETS and WRENCHES the hinges of the 
           storage room door until the whole thing comes off.

           INT. STORAGE ROOM - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Annette walks inside the storage room to find it completely 
           empty, except for the RED DOOR on the far wall.
                                 ANNETTE
                        Gloria! Have another lock for ya.

           Annette walks up to the Red Door, Gloria behind her. Annette 
           tries the doorknob, but it doesn’t move. 

                                 GLORIA
                        It doesn’t have a lock, see?

           Annette looks and sure enough, no lock for a key.

                        Where does this door even go?

           Annette looks out one of the windows next to the door and 
           sees that on the other side of the wall is just the outdoors.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Why would there be a door here with 
                        no place to go?

                        be a part of the wall. See?

           Gloria points to the frame of the door to see that the door 
           is built into the wall.

                        Almost as if they ran out of wood 
                        and just used this door to fill in 
                        the hole. Great. A patch-up job. 
                        Should have just left the room 
                        locked. Okay, I can swing this. 
                        It’s... an added quirk. 

           The camera starts moving in on Annette’s face for an ECU.

                        house. 

           The camera pulls back to reveal Annette in a professional 
           outfit and hair and makeup completely on. Thus revealing that 
           we’re...
           INT. STORAGE ROOM - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NEXT DAY

           ...in the midst of the Open House on the next day.

           SEVERAL DIFFERENT PEOPLE stand in the room with Annette, 
           listening to her. Annette turns around and looks at them.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Anyone interested in seeing the 
                        bathrooms?

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Annette holds the door open for People leaving. She passes 
           them brochures as they leave.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Okay, thank you for coming! Call 
                        me, my information and all the info 
                        on the house is in here. We’re 
                        having another Open House tomorrow 
                        so come back if you have any other 
                        questions! Also we’re having the 
                        kitchen painted red tomorrow 
                        morning which I think will really 
                        bring that room together, so come 
                        back if you want to see that too! 
                        Okay, thanks!

           Everyone has left and Annette closes the door behind her. She 
           collapses to the floor, exhausted. 

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Not a single bit of interest. Way 
                        to go, Swip.
                             (beat)
                        At least they liked the macaroons.

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette walks out of the house and past the For Sale sign 
           that has an “Open House Today!” sign on top of it.

           Her phone rings. Caller ID says “MOM.” Annette doesn’t know 
           if she wants to pick it up. But finally she does.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Hi Mom.
                                 BETTY
                             (on phone)
                        Why didn’t you tell me you were in 
                        town???

           EXT. FIRST CHURCH OF WOODSMITH - DAY

           Annette stands outside the modest red-brick building. The 
           marquee outside says, “Today’s Sermon: How to Combat Shame - 
           Senior Minister Rev. Juniper Swip.”

           INT. FIRST CHURCH OF WOODSMITH - SANCTUARY - DAY

           Annette enters and sees her mom, BETTY, waving at her from a 
           pew. Annette heads over and sits next to her. They hug.

                                 BETTY
                        My big girl. Can’t believe you 
                        didn’t tell me you were in town.

                                 ANNETTE
                        I’m not in town. I’m in Chimerical. 

                                 BETTY
                        Semantics. You should have told me.

                                 ANNETTE
                        I was going to call. Just been 
                        busy. I’m here for work.

                                 BETTY
                        Hush now. Your sister’s coming up.

           Out walks WINSTON HUXSMITH in pastor robes. He has a half 
           shaved head and thick rimmed glasses. He has a banjo.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Who is that?

                                 BETTY
                        Oh that’s the new communications 
                        pastor, Reverend Huxsmith. 

           Winston plays a dumb song on the banjo welcoming people to 
           church and introducing Juniper. It’s really silly but Annette 
           can’t help but be charmed by it.

           Then out walks JUNIPER in robes and she takes the pulpit.
                                 JUNIPER
                        One of the most powerful tools in 
                        the devil’s arsenal is the power of 
                        shame and he empowers all of his 
                        henchmen to use it in cunning ways. 
                        Most of my experience with shame 
                        has come in the form of Instagram - 
                        #blessed.

           That gets some chuckles from the congregation. Annette rolls 
           her eyes.

           INT. FIRST CHURCH OF WOODSMITH - ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

           A post-service lunch buffet. The Ministers mill around and 
           greet folks as people put macaroni salad and pigs in a 
           blanket on Styrofoam plates.

           Annette shovels some fruit salad into her mouth as a Group of 
           OLD PEOPLE come up to her.

                                 OLD PERSON 1
                        Annette! Haven’t seen you in about 
                        10 years or so.

                                 ANNETTE
                        About right.

                                 OLD PERSON 2
                        Your mother’s been telling us about 
                        all the great thing you’ve been 
                        doing.

                                 ANNETTE
                             (genuinely confused)
                        She has?

                                 OLD PERSON 3
                        Yes. Out in Los Angeles and selling 
                        mansions to the rich and famous.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Well--

                                 OLD PERSON 4
                        She said that HGTV is interested in 
                        giving you your own show. Pretty 
                        snazzy sounding.

                                 ANNETTE
                        She said wha--?
                                 OLD PERSON 5
                        I was so impressed when she said 
                        you’re going to go to London to 
                        help the Royal Family find a new 
                        palace.

                                 ANNETTE
                        I’m sorry, wha--?

                                 OLD PERSON 6
                        And that you have an acre of your 
                        own land up on Mullholland Drive. 
                        How impressive. Such a fabulous 
                        life you’re living. 

           The room starts to SPIN a little bit. Annette is overwhelmed.

                                 ANNETTE
                        I’m not-- I’m sorry, where is my--?

           THE SOUND CUTS OUT.

                                 CHILD WHISPER
                        Mommy...

           Annette GASPS. That’s not her voice. She looks around. 
           EVERYONE IN THE ROOM IS FROZEN EXCEPT FOR HER.

                                 CHILD WHISPER (CONT’D)
                        MOMMY...

           Annette breathes heavy. What’s happening? Who is that voice?

                                 CHILD WHISPER (CONT’D)
                        MOMMY! MOMMY! MOMMY!

           Betty puts her arm around Annette - snapping us back into 
           reality.

                                 BETTY
                        I’m right here, sweetheart.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Mom?

                                 BETTY
                             (to the Old People)
                        We’re all just so proud of her. Now 
                        excuse us, she hasn’t seen her 
                        sister yet.

                                 OLD PERSON 1
                        Whom we’re also proud of!
                                 BETTY
                        Of course!

           Betty walks Annette away.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Mom, what the hell? Why did you 
                        tell those people all those things 
                        about me?

                                 BETTY
                        What things?

                                 ANNETTE
                        That I have an acre of my own land? 
                        That I’m going to have my own TV 
                        show? That I’m going to help out 
                        the Royal Family?

                                 BETTY
                        Oh well, I’m just helping out your 
                        image.

                                 ANNETTE
                        My image?

                                 BETTY
                        Yes! It’s important to project 
                        success at all times, despite what 
                        one has actually achieved. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        So lie?

                                 BETTY
                        Sweetie, I haven’t done anything 
                        that I haven’t seen you do 
                        yourself.

                                 ANNETTE
                        But it’s different when you do it.

           They reach Juniper and she hugs Annette.

                                 JUNIPER
                        Hi sis.

                                 BETTY
                        Your older sister was just berating 
                        me for elaborating on her successes 
                        to the folks around town.
                                 JUNIPER
                        Oh you mean like the HGTV show? 
                        That one’s my favorite.

                                 ANNETTE
                        You’re in favor of this?

                                 JUNIPER
                        Well, can you blame her? I’m 5 
                        years younger than you... I already 
                        have my own congregation... I’m the 
                        youngest senior minister in the 
                        history of the state of Kansas... I 
                        can understand if Mom wants to come 
                        off as if her kids are on equal 
                        footing.

                                 ANNETTE
                        What a charming thing to say, 
                        pastor. Can’t wait to hear that 
                        lesson in your next sermon.

           Annette begins to walk off.

                                 BETTY
                        Annette!

                                 ANNETTE
                        You want to be on equal footing? 
                        Well why don’t you start with 
                        getting yours out of your ass?

           Annette storms off. As she does, she bumps into Winston, 
           spilling his plate of Waldorf salad onto his shirt. 

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                             (not looking back)
                        Sorry.

                                 WINSTON
                        S’all good!

           INT. ANNETTE’S RENTAL CAR - DAY

           Annette cries and drives. She tries to keep it together.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Pull it together, Swip.
                             (beat)
                        Screw ‘em.

           Annette reaches for her belt and tightens it again.
           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Annette’s rental flies by a sign that reads “Chimerical - 95 
           miles away.”

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - DAY

           Annette goes all over town and tapes up FOR SALE signs with a 
           picture of the house on telephone poles, mailboxes, bike 
           racks, store fronts, and any and everything in between.

           She goes door-to-door and stuffs info brochures into people’s 
           personal mailboxes.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Annette opens the front door at the start of another Open 
           House. The turnout is less than stellar and Annette notices.

           EXT. CHIMERICAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           Annette stands outside the front doors of the elementary 
           school just as school is letting out and hands brochures out 
           to KIDS running by.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Hey kids - tell your parents that 
                        if they’re looking for a new house 
                        to call me. Yeah, you want a new 
                        room? One with lots of space? Take 
                        this home to your mom and dad and 
                        tell them Ms. Annette Swip gave 
                        this to you and they should call 
                        me. 

           A TEACHER comes up to Annette.

                                 TEACHER
                        Ma’am, are you soliciting here on 
                        school grounds?

                                 ANNETTE
                        No, I’m just... waiting for my kid. 
                        Where is little Pinky?

                                 TEACHER
                        And who is “Pinky’s” teacher?

           Annette thinks for a moment.
                                 ANNETTE
                             (holding out a brochure)
                        Not looking to move now, are you?

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Above the For Sale sign is the “Open House Today!” sign. 
           Above that sign is another one that says “Free Beer!”

           INT. LIVING ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           More PEOPLE mill about the house, but it’s still not a great 
           turnout. Every single person there has a beer in their hands, 
           meaning the quality of people is different than before. 

           A LARGE MAN, in a too small shirt, comes up to Annette.

                                 LARGE MAN
                        ‘Scuse me, miss, but the place is 
                        fully furnished right?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Yes! That’s correct.

                                 LARGE MAN
                        Well, could me and wife test the 
                        place out tonight?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Test...?

                                 LARGE MAN
                        Yeah, give you some collateral, and 
                        we sleep here this evening and see 
                        if we like the place. If we like 
                        tonight, we’ll buy it tomorrow.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Um, well, it would have to be 
                        significant collateral--

           The Large Man tosses her a set of car keys.

                                 LARGE MAN
                        The truck’s out front.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Oh, okay. Let me just get some 
                        things for you to sign.
           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette hands the keys to the house to the Large Man and his 
           LARGE WIFE.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Have a great night!

           The front door shuts.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Hope this goes well for ya.

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NEXT DAY

           Annette pulls up in the Mini Cooper and finds the Large Man 
           and Large Wife sitting on the front steps with blankets 
           wrapped around themselves. Annette gets out of the car.

                                 ANNETTE
                        What happened? Did the heating go 
                        out?

                                 LARGE MAN
                        Uh... no... we just... uh... we 
                        decided we weren’t interested after 
                        all and didn’t want to mess any of 
                        your things up. Isn’t that right, 
                        honey?

           The Large Man looks over at his Large Wife who has a look of 
           terror on her face and then lets out a bloodcurling SCREAM.

                                 LARGE WIFE
                        AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!

                                 LARGE MAN
                        We’ll be going now.

           The Large Man exchanges the house keys for the truck keys and 
           he and his wife (still screaming) take off.

                                 ANNETTE
                        What in the world?

           INT. KOOL KAT KAFE - DAY

           Annette stands in line at a coffee shop. When she gets to the 
           front she finds that the barista is none other than Roxxy.
                                 ROXXY
                        Well well well. How goes selling 
                        condos to the rich and famous? Is 
                        Sigourney Weaver one of your 
                        tenants now?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Oh it’s you. You’re also a barista?

                                 ROXXY
                        Yeah, so?

                                 ANNETTE
                        You’re almost 40.

                                 ROXXY
                        At least I don’t look it. What can 
                        I make you?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Iced Carmel Latte.

                                 ROXXY
                        Ew! Disgusting. Coming right up.

           Roxxy starts to make the drink.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Are you just being a bitch to me 
                        because I didn’t remember you from 
                        high school?

                                 ROXXY
                        I’m this way with everyone.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Look, while you’re making that, can 
                        I put some of these up on your 
                        bulletin boards?

           Annette holds up some flyers about the house.

                                 ROXXY
                        What are they?

                                 ANNETTE
                        They’re just information flyers 
                        about the house I’m selling. Trying 
                        to branch out some for potential 
                        tenants. 

                                 ROXXY
                        Oh, has it not been as easy as your 
                        A-list clientele back in LA? 
                                 ANNETTE
                        You have no idea.

                                 ROXXY
                        What house are you selling? I know 
                        all the hot spots around here. I 
                        can tell you what you’re doing 
                        wrong.

           Annette hands Roxxy one of the flyers.

                                 ANNETTE
                        It’s the old Kaufman House out on--

                                 ROXXY
                        BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

                                 ANNETTE
                        What’s so funny? 

                                 ROXXY
                        You’re selling the Coffin House??

                                 ANNETTE
                        The what? No, the Kaufman--

                                 ROXXY
                        Coffin. C-O-F-F-I-N House. Oh dude, 
                        no wonder you’re having a such a 
                        shit time. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        I’m not sure I get what you’re 
                        saying.

                                 ROXXY
                        That house is haunted, dude.

           Annette looks at Roxxy with skepticism.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Can I just get my coffee, please? I 
                        don’t have time for this--

                                 ROXXY
                        Weird shit’s happened at the house 
                        right? 

                                 ANNETTE
                        No.

                                 ROXXY
                        Things that can’t be explained?
                                 ANNETTE
                        No.

                                 ROXXY
                        Stuff’s moving through walls?

                                 ANNETTE
                        No! No! Nothing like that. I don’t 
                        appreciate you teasing me like 
                        this.

                                 ROXXY
                        I’m not teasing you, Annette. I’m 
                        warning you. That place is haunted 
                        as shit.

           Annette, about to lose it, glares at Roxxy.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Give me. My goddamn. Coffee.

           Roxxy hands her the drink and Annette storms out.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to hang any flyers in 
                        your stupid coffee shop anyway!

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DUSK

           Annette stands in front of the house, staring it down.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Hah. “Haunted.” Yeah right.
                             (beat)
                        Yeah, the only reason you can’t 
                        sell this place is because you’re a 
                        shitty realtor.

           Annette rolls her eyes at herself.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Well, we’re going to find out for 
                        sure if this house is haunted or 
                        not.

           Annette walks up to the front door and goes inside.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette walks into the house and looks around.
                                 ANNETTE
                        Hello?

           No response.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Any spooks or spirits here?

           Nothing. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette walks through the living room and lifts up the white 
           sheets on the furniture and finds nothing.

           Annette walks off into the kitchen. As her back turns, one of 
           the sheets LIFTS UP INTO THE AIR into the typical “ghost” 
           shape. The sheet doesn’t move, but it stares at Annette.

           INT. KITCHEN - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette looks in the fridge and under the sink for anything. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        Are you a hungry ghost? Hiding out 
                        in here for a midnight snack?

           As she leaves the kitchen, through the doorway in the living 
           room we see the sheet still staring and with it is ANOTHER 
           SHEET floating and staring.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette walks out of the kitchen and heads to the staircase. 
           As she passes by this room’s doorway to the living room we 
           see A THIRD SHEET is floating and staring with the others.

           Annette walks up a few steps but stops. Did she see the 
           sheets out of the corner of her eye?

           She turns her head slowly to the living room and SHRIEKS as 
           she sees the three sheets floating. Annette slips on the 
           stairs and trips down the few that she walked up.

           She lands on her head and then sits up, rubbing her eyes. 
           Annette looks back to the living room to see that the sheets 
           are back on the furniture. Not floating. Nothing spooky.
                                 ANNETTE
                        What the hell? Your eyes are 
                        playing tricks on you. Don’t be 
                        such a dummy.

           Annette shakes herself off and heads back up the stairs.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette walks into the bedroom and immediately becomes weary 
           of the sheets on the bed. 

           INT. HALLWAY - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette throws the sheets to the floor below.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE

           Annette sits on the bare bed. She looks at her waist and sees 
           the dark welt that her tight belt has left on her skin.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Gonna be fine. Just gonna get some 
                        sleep, without a blanket, and prove 
                        that the house is totally normal. 
                        And then tomorrow I’m gonna sell 
                        it.

                                 WHISPERED VOICE
                        Yeah right.

                                 ANNETTE
                        No, I am. Tomorrow I am going to 
                        get up and I am going to sell this 
                        sucker because it’s what I’m good 
                        at.

                                 WHISPERED VOICE
                        You’re not good at anything, 
                        Annette. Especially not this.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Shut up. You’re not helping.

                                 WHISPERED VOICE
                        All you’ll ever be is the girl 
                        everyone compares themselves to in 
                        order to feel better about their 
                        lives. That’s all you’ll amount to, 
                        Annette.
                                 ANNETTE
                        Ughhhh I have to stop being so hard 
                        on myself.

                                 WHISPERED VOICE
                        You’ll never amount to anything, 
                        Annette.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Wait... “Annette”? I don’t call 
                        myself that. I only call myself...
                             (realizing)
                        ...Swip.

           Annette looks up in horror. Who was she talking to?

                                 WHISPERED VOICE
                        ...Annette...

           THE LIGHTS GO OUT.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Oh shit. No no no.

           Annette gets up and runs out of the room.

           INT. HALLWAY - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette comes out and sees A BRIGHT LIGHT bursting out of the 
           Storage Room. Annette runs in that direction, passing by the 
           mirror, but--

           THREE ROTTING ARMS EMERGE FROM THE MIRROR - GRABBING ANNETTE.

           Annette SCREAMS as she struggles to break free from the arms, 
           but the arms latch on to her - one around her legs, one 
           around her waist, one around her mouth - and pull her so her 
           back is directly up against the mirror.

                                 MAN WHISPER
                        You aren’t good enough.

                                 WOMAN WHISPER
                        You aren’t pretty enough.

                                 CHILD WHISPER
                        Mama? MAMA!

           Annette looks around and sees TWO FIGURES STANDING IN THE 
           DOORWAY OF THE STORAGE ROOM. Can’t see their faces, backlit 
           by the bright light.
           One of the Figures holds onto a BABY CARRIAGE. We can hear 
           THE BABY CRYING INSIDE.

           The Two Figures turn their heads slowly to look directly at 
           Annette. As they do so, A GIGANTIC FIRE arises at the bottom 
           of the staircase. Annette struggles to get free but can’t.

           The Figure holding the Baby Carriage, still staring at 
           Annette, lets go of the carriage, sending it DOWN THE STAIRS - 
           TOWARDS THE ROARING FLAME.

           The Baby CRIES harder and harder.

                                 CHILD WHISPER (CONT’D)
                        MAMA?

           Annette pulls to get free but MORE ARMS EMERGE from the 
           mirror to hold her back.

                                 CHILD WHISPER (CONT’D)
                        MAMA!!!!

           The carriage gets to the bottom stair and gets engulfed in 
           the fire. The Baby lets out a SHRILL YELL OF TERROR.

           Annette strains one last time to break free but a final arm 
           emerges - covering her eyes.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Annette slowly opens her eyes. She finds herself curled up on 
           the sheets from the bed she threw down. Her vision is hazy 
           and she can’t quite tell what’s around her.

           She sits up and rubs her eyes and then GASPS - she is 
           completely surrounded by FLOATING SHEETS. Everywhere she 
           looks there’s one and they’re ALL STARING AT HER.

                                 ANNETTE
                        What do you want?? WHAT DO YOU 
                        WANT??

           And then, all together, the sheets all float down to the 
           ground. Annette looks around the house all covered in white 
           sheets.
           INT. KANSAS CITY AIRPORT - DAY

           Annette rushes through the terminal with a haphazardly packed 
           suitcase. As she does, she BUMPS into someone else only to 
           find it’s...

                                 KURT
                        Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to-- 
                        Annette?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Kurt? Oh my god. What are you doing 
                        here?

                                 KURT
                        Oh, uh, Holly and I are on our way 
                        to the Bahamas for a little R&R 
                        with my PTO. What are you doing? 
                        Heading back to LA already?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Yeah, had to get back, last minute 
                        work emergency. 

                                 KURT
                        Sorry to hear that. Hope 
                        everything’s okay.

                                 ANNETTE
                        It is, I just... can’t be here 
                        anymore.

                                 KURT
                        Y’know, just wanted to say how 
                        impressed I am with all that you’ve 
                        accomplished.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Really?

                                 KURT
                        Yeah, all about you selling condos 
                        to celebrities and elbow-rubbing 
                        with the social media stars. I love 
                        it. You’ve really proven everyone 
                        wrong who said you couldn’t do it.

                                 ANNETTE
                        People were saying that about me?

           Holly walks up.
                                 HOLLY
                        Kurt, they’ve started boarding for 
                        our flight. Hi Annette, feeling 
                        better?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Hi Holly.

                                 KURT
                        Well, we gotta take off. Great 
                        seeing you again, chum. And again, 
                        way to stick it to those naysayers.

           Kurt and Holly walk off. Annette looks at her ticket. She 
           thinks and we hear the past voice of Ms. Burnhoffer.

                                 MS. BURNHOFFER (O.S.)
                        If you can go sell this house, no 
                        matter the cost, then you can come 
                        back here and just might find one 
                        of these offices with your name on 
                        it.

                                 ANNETTE
                        It’s what you’ve always wanted, 
                        Swip. You just gonna let the 
                        afterlife stop you from living your 
                        present life?

           Annette looks back on Kurt and Holly walking away.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Or are you going to be the girl 
                        they always said you’d be?

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette kicks open the front door of the house and marches 
           inside.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Someone is going to move into this 
                        house! Whether you like it or not!

           A FLOOD OF BLOOD BURSTS OUT OF THE STORAGE ROOM AND DRENCHES 
           ANNETTE - COVERING HER IN A THICK LAYER OF WARM, STICKY BLOOD

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Cool. Thanks for that.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NEXT DAY

           Annette shows a THIRTYSOMETHING MAN & WOMAN around the house.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Fully furnished. Brand new 
                        mattress. Freshly painted. Great 
                        neighborhood. Bargain price. 

                                 THIRTYSOMETHING WOMAN
                        We’ll take it.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Great.

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

           Annette comes up to the front door to find the 
           Thirtysomething Woman rushing the Man out of the house. The 
           Man is completely covered in nasty looking CUTS.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Is everything all right?

                                 THIRTYSOMETHING WOMAN
                        GET AWAY FROM US!

                                 ANNETTE
                        What happened?

           INT. KITCHEN - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - FLASHBACK

           The night before, the Thirtysomething Man gets a drink of 
           water from the kitchen sink when the DRAWERS ALL OPEN AT 
           ONCE. One of them knocks the Man to the floor.

           He looks up and sees ALL THE KNIVES RISE FROM THE DRAWERS, 
           sharp side pointing to the ceiling. They rise and rise until 
           they almost touch the ceiling.

           And then they quickly all flip, SHARP SIDE FACING THE MAN, 
           and DROP FAST TOWARDS HIM AS HE SCREAMS.

           INT. HALLWAY - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

           Annette shows a group of four FRAT BROS around the house.

                                 ANNETTE
                        There’s two rooms, so enough space 
                        for all four of you bunk. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANNETTE (CONT'D)
                        And the price, already a steal, but 
                        split four ways, it’s basically 
                        criminal.

                                 FRAT BRO 1
                        Hell yeah, we’re in.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Excellent.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NEXT DAY

           Annette walks in the next day and sees Frat Bro 1 sitting in 
           the living room, covered in blood, holding a SHOTGUN. 

           Sitting upright on each piece of furniture are the HEADLESS 
           BODIES OF THE OTHER THREE FRAT BROS - THEIR HEADS BLOWN OFF.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Oh my god. What the hell happened 
                        here?

                                 FRAT BRO 1
                        The voices... The voices told me to 
                        do it... They said they were making 
                        fun of me... They said they were 
                        ALL BETTER THAN ME!!

           Frat Bro 1 SCREAMS and turns the shotgun on himself and BLOWS 
           HIS OWN HEAD OFF. His blood splashes on Annette, who is 
           shocked but looks surprisingly calm.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Time to get the hose.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NEXT DAY

           Annette shows a FAMILY with TWO YOUNG KIDS around.

                                 ANNETTE
                        It has so much character. And it’s 
                        a great place for kids.

                                 DAD
                        When can we move in?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Immediately!
           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

           Annette walks up to the front door and finds a note on the 
           door. She opens the note and it simply reads: “FUCK YOU” with 
           the house key inside.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Hmmm... I wonder...

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - FLASHBACK

           The night before. The whole Family stands in the Front Room 
           as the YOUNGEST KID is raised into the air by unseen forces. 
           Lightning flashes in the room and wind blows in the house.

                                 MOM
                        NO! TAKE ME INSTEAD!

                                 YOUNGEST KID
                             (Demonic Voice)
                        WE DON’T WANT YOU, BITCH.

           The Youngest Kid then lets out a SPEW OF ACIDIC VOMIT that 
           covers the Dad, Mom, and OLDER KID - burning them.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NEXT DAY

           Annette opens the door to find an EXTENDED FAMILY, at least 8 
           people, standing on the porch. Annette nervously smiles.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Please come in.

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

           Annette pulls up in her car and gets out with her mouth agog.

           On the front yard is the DISMEMBERED BODY PARTS of the entire 
           Extended Family arranged in such a way that they spell out - 
           “FOR SALE.”

           Annette looks up at the house and a low, bellowing LAUGH 
           emanates from within. Annette pulls out her phone.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Okay, time for some reinforcements.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:
           INT. KOOL KAT KAFE - DAY

           Annette and Roxxy sit awkwardly across from each other. A 
           long silent beat passes between them.

                                 ANNETTE
                        So you were right about the hous--

                                 ROXXY
                        I TOLD YOU!

                                 ANNETTE
                        Chill.

                                 ROXXY
                        That’s the Coffin House, man. 
                        Anyone who’s lived here for as long 
                        as I have knows that shit is 
                        haunted.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Why do you keep calling it the 
                        “Coffin” House?

                                 ROXXY
                        Well, that guy who built the house, 
                        Jershua Kaufman? The story goes he 
                        ran out of material before the 
                        house was finished, so he had to 
                        find other means...

           Roxxy waits to see if Annette catches on. She doesn’t.

                                 ANNETTE
                        What? 

                                 ROXXY
                        Do you get what I’m saying? “Other 
                        means.” “Coffin house.” The math 
                        ain’t hard.

                                 ANNETTE
                        You’re saying he used wood from 
                        coffins to complete the house?

                                 ROXXY
                        Yep. Dug ‘em right up from the 
                        ground and built them into the 
                        house. It’s free wood, right there 
                        in the dirt.
                                 ANNETTE
                        What does the story say about what 
                        he did with the bodies in the 
                        coffins he dug up?

                                 ROXXY
                             (smirks)
                        Never found.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Well, that’s all well and good but 
                        none of that helps me with what 
                        I’ve come to talk to you about.

                                 ROXXY
                        Which is?

                                 ANNETTE
                        I need to sell this house. I don’t 
                        care about coffins or bodies or 
                        ghosts or any of it. I just need to 
                        get this house off my hands and 
                        into the hands of someone who’s 
                        going to live through their first 
                        night as a homeowner.

                                 ROXXY
                        So... what do you need my help 
                        with?

                                 ANNETTE
                        I... Well, I don’t exactly know. I 
                        just figured since you’re the one 
                        who knows so much about this place 
                        that you’d be able to help somehow. 
                        Though I realize now I don’t know 
                        what that “how” is.

                                 ROXXY
                        Cool, well, good talk.

           Roxxy gets up to leave.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Wait, please, I have no one else to 
                        talk to about this.

                                 ROXXY
                        I’ve got coffee to make, dude.
                                 ANNETTE
                        Just tell me how you think I can 
                        keep these ghosts at bay long 
                        enough so I can sell the house to 
                        some normal people.

                                 ROXXY
                        Well that’s your problem right 
                        there - trying to sell a house with 
                        ghosts to “normal” people.

                                 ANNETTE
                        What do you mean?

                                 ROXXY
                        Dude, do you know how many people 
                        would literally kill to live in a 
                        haunted house?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Wait, really? Like who?

           INT. KOOL KAT KAFE - BACK ROOM - DAY

           Roxxy boots up an old dial-up Windows 2000 computer. Annette 
           sits beside her.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Y’know, I can just use my phone. 
                        It’s faster--

                                 ROXXY
                        This is tougher for the government 
                        to trace. Now, we want to look for 
                        people who label themselves as 
                        Ghost Hunters or Paranormal 
                        Enthusiasts - y’know, crazy people. 

           Roxxy types a couple of things in and some names pop up. She 
           hits print and out pops the names and pictures out of an old 
           printer nearby.

                                 ROXXY (CONT’D)
                        Go grab those and add them to your 
                        list.

                                 ANNETTE
                        My list of what?

                                 ROXXY
                        People to reach out to to sell your 
                        house. Duh.
           Annette grabs the print outs.

                                 ANNETTE
                        This is so archaic. 

                                 ROXXY
                        But we don’t just want enthusiasts, 
                        we want obsessives. People who live 
                        and breathe scary shit and horror 
                        movies. Let’s look for people 
                        who’ve literally named their kid 
                        Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees.

                                 ANNETTE
                        People like that don’t exist--

           The printer comes to life and more pages come out.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Are you kidding me?

                                 ROXXY
                        Looks like your clientele list just 
                        got a lot longer.

                                 ANNETTE
                        So I’m just supposed to reach out 
                        to these people and be like, “Hey! 
                        You are clinically insane, would 
                        you like to come buy a real haunted 
                        house?”

                                 ROXXY
                        Um, yeah. Doesn’t seem that hard.

                                 ANNETTE
                        No, we’ve got to entice them to 
                        come somehow otherwise it just 
                        feels like a scam. 

                                 ROXXY
                        “Entice” - what does that mean?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Means like... we have to have 
                        like... 

           Annette looks over and sees the TV in the cafe playing a 
           rerun of America’s Got Talent.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        ...a contest!

                        A what?

           QUICK SHOTS:

           -Annette writing a bunch of letters

                        A contest. A once in a lifetime 
                        experience to spend the night in a 
                        real live haunted house...

           INT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette and Roxxy walk around the house and place SMALL 
           HIDDEN CAMERAS in every nook and cranny. 

                                 ANNETTE (V.O.)
                        ...and if you have the ability to 
                        survive all the way through the 
                        night, then you will win.

           Roxxy moves a book on a shelf in order to put a camera up. 
           But before she can move the book back - THE BOOK MOVES ITSELF 
           BACK IN PLACE. Roxxy looks equally terrified and stoked. 

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NEXT NIGHT

           Annette stands on the porch and looks out on a group of 
           people standing in front of her.

           LINK - 40s, a Don Knotts type. DORY - 50s, a Roseanne type. 
           PENELOPE - 20s, a Veruca Salt type. NED - 30s, a Jason Mewes 
           type.

                        What do we win?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Why the house, of course.

                        50% off. I still gotta make a 
                        commission to live, folks. But 
                        that’s the deal. You were all 
                        brought here because your

                        own a chain of paranormal bookshops 
                        in the Pacific Northwest and are 
                        said to be something of an expert 
                        in your field. Dory, you’re a 
                        successful ghost hunter from the 
                        tri-state area with your own highly 
                        regarded professional practice. 
                        Ned, you are an avid horror movie 
                        marathon film festival attendee and 
                        named your child Michael Myers - 
                        not after the Canadian comedian but 
                        after The Shape himself. And 
                        Penelope, you’re the world famous 
                        “Girl with No Fear” - a chemical 
                        imbalance in your brain caused you 
                        to live your life without being 
                        afraid of anything.

                                 PENELOPE
                        That is correct.

                                 DORY
                        Well then you obviously haven’t 
                        seen me naked.

                                 ANNETTE
                        So, now that we’ve gotten the 
                        intros out of the way...

           Annette opens the door to the house and the four people head 
           inside. Annette stands in the doorway.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        All you have to do is survive until 
                        dawn and then this house is yours. 
                        Make yourselves at home.

           Annette shuts the door and locks it. She then runs down the 
           driveway to a WHITE VAN parked out front. She opens the side 
           door and gets in.

           INT. WHITE VAN - NIGHT

           Roxxy sits in the van eating a bag of Cheetos. Annette sits 
           next to her. All around them are monitors each hooked up to 
           the cameras they placed around the house.
                                 ROXXY
                        Cheeto?

           INT. WHITE VAN - LATER

           Annette struggles to keep her eyes open as Roxxy SNORES. 
           Nothing is happening on the monitors.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Why is nothing happening?

           INT. WHITE VAN - LATER

           Annette’s asleep now while Roxxy dips Ho-Hos into a tub of 
           Cool Whip.

                                 ANNETTE
                        All quiet on the spooky front.

           INT. WHITE VAN - LATER

           Annette and Roxxy are both asleep now. One of Roxxy’s SNORES 
           awakens Annette who looks at the monitors. She sees something 
           and wakes Roxxy.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Roxxy. Roxxy!

                                 ROXXY
                        What?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Look.

           *NOTE: THIS ENTIRE SEQUENCE PLAYS OUT ON THE MONITORS IN THE 
           WHITE VAN. WE NEVER GO INSIDE THE HOUSE DURING THIS.*

           On the monitor, they see Ned standing on top of the second 
           floor bannister completely still. He just stands there.

                                 ROXXY
                        What’s he doing?

           Then Ned calmly steps off the bannister and falls to the 
           ground of the first floor below. He lands HARD, breaking his 
           neck and killing himself instantly.

                                 ROXXY (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god oh my god oh my god.
                                 ANNETTE
                        I had a feeling he was going to do 
                        that.

           Annette grabs a piece of paper with all of the contestants 
           names on it and scratches off “Ned.”

           On the monitor, the rest of the group hurries into the front 
           room to see Ned’s dead body.

                        the competition. Something I 
                        wouldn’t know anything about.

                                 LINK
                        Oh hush up, Penelope. This was not 
                        voluntary. This was brought upon by 
                        some otherworldly force.

                                 DORY
                        Yes, I sense a presence. Something 
                        is here. We are not alone.

                                 LINK
                        Wait, do you hear that?

                                 DORY
                        I do! Do you?

                                 PENELOPE
                        Who’s whispering?

           Annette looks at Roxxy.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Do you hear anything? 

                                 ROXXY
                        No. Just them. Did they say 
                        someone’s whispering?

                                 ANNETTE
                             (casually)
                        The house does that.
           The group on the monitors start to go crazy.

                                 LINK
                        Stop saying that! I’m not a loser!

                                 DORY
                        You’re the fat one!

                                 PENELOPE
                        I am NOT afraid of being afraid. 
                        How dare you--

           At that moment, Penelope starts to choke and RISES IN THE AIR 
           - almost as if someone giant has her by the throat.

                                 ROXXY
                        Holy shit!

           Link runs to Penelope to grab her back down but the RUG on 
           the ground starts to GROW and SPREAD all over his body, 
           covering up completely and suffocating him.

           Annette crosses off “Link” from her list.

           Dory runs over to try and grab Penelope.

                                 DORY
                        I gotchu you little runt.

           All of the sudden a pair of CHAIRS from the living room fly 
           through the air and pin Dory’s arms up against a wall.

                                 DORY (CONT’D)
                        Hey! That’s not fair! I’m just 
                        trying to--

           A THICK, HEAVY BOOKSHELF suddenly bursts from the living 
           room, heading straight for Dory and SLAMS into her, 
           completely flattening her and spraying her blood on the wall.

           Annette crosses “Dory” off the list. 

                                 ROXXY
                        Do you feel weird about the fact 
                        that you just keep murdering a 
                        bunch of people with this place?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Just gotta sell the house.

           The bright light from the Storage Room shines out upon the 
           floating Penelope.
                                 PENELOPE
                        Stop saying that!

                                 ROXXY
                        I wish we could hear who she’s 
                        talking to.

                                 PENELOPE
                        I’m not scared! I’m not afraid! I’m 
                        not!

           All of the sudden, a loud low bellowing voice comes over the 
           speakers of the van.

                                 VOICE
                        You should be.

           Annette and Roxxy both SCREAM as does Penelope on the 
           monitor. As Penelope screams, she melts, a la Toht at the end 
           of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, until she’s mush on the floor.

           The light goes out. It’s all over. Annette and Roxxy have a 
           beat where the look at each other.

                                 ROXXY
                        I think it’s time that maybe we 
                        call in a little professional help.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Oh yeah? Like who.

                                 ROXXY
                        I know some people.

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Annette and Roxxy stand side-by-side as a car pulls up the 
           driveway. It parks and out of the car comes... DR. ELISE 
           RAINIER (aka Lin Shaye from the INSIDIOUS movies). 

                                 ROXXY
                        Dr. Rainier.

                                 DR. ELISE RAINIER
                        Please, call me Elise.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Well, Elise, she’s all yours.

                                 DR. ELISE RAINIER
                        Thank you. I’ve got a strong 
                        feeling about this one.
           Elise pulls out a lamp on a handle and heads inside.

                                 ANNETTE
                             (to Roxxy)
                        Why does she need a lamp? It’s 
                        daytime.

                                 ROXXY
                        It’s part of her process.

           Elise goes inside and shuts the door behind her. Almost 
           immediately, LOUD NOISES AND FLASHES OF LIGHT COME OUT OF THE 
           HOUSE. The door opens again and Elise walks calmly out.

                                 ROXXY (CONT’D)
                        Well?

           Elise turns to look to Annette and Roxxy and we see that HALF 
           OF HER BODY HAS BEEN BURNED OFF from the waist up.

                                 DR. ELISE RAINIER
                        I think maybe you should call 
                        someone else.

           Elise then crumbles to the ground. Annette looks at Roxxy.

                                 ROXXY
                        I know some more people.

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - LATER

           The front door BURSTS open and out comes JOHN CONSTANTINE 
           (aka Keanu Reeves - not Matt Ryan) firing a large flame 
           thrower into the house.

                                 JOHN CONSTANTINE
                        Don’t worry ladies. Everything’s 
                        under control.

                                 ROXXY
                        Thank you, Mr. Constantine!

           Suddenly ROTTING HANDS emerge from the porch and grab 
           Constantine, ripping him to shreds and dragging him below.

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - LATER

           ERIN GILBERT, ABBY YATES, JILLIAN HOLTZMANN, AND PATTY TOLAN 
           (aka Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKninnon, and 
           Leslie Jones from GHOSTBUSTERS) all run out of the house with 
           their proton packs and jumpsuits completely covered in blood.
                                 ERIN GILBERT
                        Who you gonna call?

                                 JILLIAN HOLTZMANN
                        Someone else.

                                 ABBY YATES
                        Definitely not us.

                                 PATTY TOLAN
                        Damn straight not us!

           They run off leaving Annette and Roxxy behind.

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - LATER

           Annette and Roxxy great DR. JAMES HARVEY AND KAT HARVEY (aka 
           Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci from CASPER).

                                 ANNETTE
                        Dr. Harvey, thank you so much for 
                        coming at the last minute.

                                 DR. JAMES HARVEY
                        Oh it’s my pleasure. This kind of 
                        thing happens all the time.

           Roxxy shakes Kat’s hand.

                                 ROXXY
                        Kat, you are so cool. I love your 
                        style. I feel like you’re the kind 
                        of girl I always wanted to grow up 
                        to be when I was a kid. 

                                 KAT HARVEY
                        Um, thank you?

                                 ROXXY
                        We should hang out. Swap digits. 
                        After all this “ghost” stuff of 
                        course.

                                 KAT HARVEY
                        For sure.

                                 DR. JAMES HARVEY
                        So, can we just go in?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Please.

           The Harveys make their way up the porch.
                                 KAT HARVEY
                        Oh and is there anyone... friendly 
                        in there?

           Annette and Roxxy look at her confused.

                                 KAT HARVEY (CONT’D)
                        That’s just the kind of thing we 
                        like to know upfront.

                                 ROXXY
                        I can assure you that there’s 
                        absolutely nothing friendly at all 
                        inside.

                                 KAT HARVEY
                        Great.

           The Harveys go inside. A few quiet moments go by. Annette and 
           Roxxy look at each other surprised.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Sounds okay.

                                 ROXXY
                        These guys are pros. Should’ve 
                        called them first.

           Then one loud solid THUD is heard from inside. A second 
           later, out float cartoony CGI ghosts of The Harveys.

                                 DR. JAMES HARVEY (GHOST)
                        Well pumpkin, I think that’ll do it 
                        for us.

                                 KAT HARVEY (GHOST)
                        Yeah, but at least we know someone 
                        who’ll take us in. 

                                 DR. JAMES HARVEY (GHOST)
                        We sure do. To Whipstaff!

                                 KAT HARVEY (GHOST)
                        To Whipstaff!

           The Harvey ghosts take off through the air.

                                 DR. JAMES HARVEY (GHOST)
                        Sorry we couldn’t help you out 
                        more, ladies!

           And they’re gone. Annette looks at Roxxy.
                                 ANNETTE
                        Well, anyone else scheduled to 
                        come?

                                 ROXXY
                        Just one, but I think I’ll tell him 
                        it’s not worth it.

           FROM THE STREET

           A car pulls up in front of the Kaufman House. The car windows 
           rolls down to reveal FATHER MERRIN (aka Max von Sydow from 
           THE EXORCIST). He takes one look at the house.

                                 FATHER MERRIN
                        Nope.

           The window rolls back up and the car drives off.

           INT. ANNETTE’S RENTAL CAR - NIGHT

           Annette and Roxxy pull up to Roxxy’s apartment. Annette turns 
           the car off and the two of them just sit in silence.

                                 ROXXY
                        I’ve seen so many dead bodies over 
                        the past few days I feel like a 
                        mortician. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        It’s strange how quickly you get 
                        used to it.

                                 ROXXY
                        You know you sound like a 
                        psychopath, right?

                                 ANNETTE
                             (ignoring her)
                        Maybe we need someone less high-
                        profile. Someone who isn’t in such 
                        high demand that they can commit to 
                        taking the time to figuring out the 
                        best way to take these ghosts out.

                                 ROXXY
                        You mean like a priest or 
                        something?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Yeah... or something.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:
           INT. FIRST CHURCH OF CHIMERICAL - SANCTUARY - DAY

           A full congregation for Sunday 11am service. Winstn stands at 
           the front of the sanctuary with his banjo and a large group 
           of Children in front of him. He sings.

                                 WINSTON
                             (singing)
                        Jesus texted me on my cell phone
                        He said “LOL”
                        And if we know that means he “Loves 
                        Ourselves a Lot”
                        Then that means we won’t go to Hell

           Annette sits in a pew with the her mother. Annette claps, but 
           she’s the only one. Betty stops Annette.

                             (whispering)
                        There’s no clapping in church.

                                 ANNETTE
                             (whispering)
                        Sorry.

           INT. FIRST CHURCH OF CHIMERICAL - ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

           Another post-service lunch buffet. The Ministers mill around 
           and greet folks as people put macaroni salad and pigs in a 
           blanket on Styrofoam plates. 

           Annette walks up to Winston.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Reverend Huxsmith?

                                 WINSTON
                        I don’t believe we’ve met?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Sort of. I spilled Waldorf salad on 
                        you last week? I’m Annette Swip, 
                        Juniper’s sister?

                                 WINSTON
                        Oh of course! The one from Beverly 
                        Hills, right?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Just LA proper. No need to get all 
                        fancy with the 90210.
                                 WINSTON
                        Y’know I’m from the West Coast too? 
                        Just plopped down here from 
                        Portland a couple of weeks ago. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        You don’t say.

           INT. FIRST CHURCH OF CHIMERICAL - ASSEMBLY HALL - LATER

           Everyone else has left. Annette and Winston sit at a plastic 
           table pretty close to each other.

                                 WINSTON
                        So Juniper was telling me you’re 
                        like this rock star realtor. That’s 
                        so boss. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        Yeah, well...

           Annette thinks, bites her lip, and makes a decision.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        If I’m being totally honest here, 
                        Winston, I... I can’t believe I’m 
                        about to tell you this. I don’t 
                        tell anyone this.

           Winston puts his hand on Annette’s.

                                 WINSTON
                        Hey, you can tell me anything.

                                 ANNETTE
                        I know. I can feel that.
                             (beat)
                        Okay, well, I’m not actually a big 
                        time realtor. I’m just an Associate 
                        at the company, which is basically 
                        just a glorified assistant but 
                        minus any glory. And it’s 
                        embarrassing to admit that I’m 
                        pushing 40 and still have to get 
                        someone’s coffee in order to keep 
                        the lights on in my shitty studio 
                        apartment. Oh my god, I’m so sorry 
                        I didn’t mean to curse in front of 
                        you and in church. 
                                 WINSTON
                        Hey hey - fuck it. Don’t worry 
                        about it. It takes more than that 
                        to get sent down below.

                                 ANNETTE
                        You mean like not texting Jesus 
                        back?

           Winston and Annette have a good laugh about that.

                                 WINSTON
                        Thank you for telling me. And I 
                        want you to know that I don’t think 
                        you should be ashamed about what 
                        you do. Everyone’s path is 
                        different and just because your 
                        path isn’t the one you imagined it 
                        would be once upon a time doesn’t 
                        mean it’s the wrong path. Maybe you 
                        can’t change the scenery around you 
                        but you can change the way you look 
                        at it.

           Now it’s Annette’s turn to place her hand on Winston’s.

                                 ANNETTE
                        You wanna get out of here?

                                 WINSTON
                        Sure. Where are we going?

                                 ANNETTE
                        There’s something I want to show 
                        you.

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DUSK

           Annette and Winston walk up to the house.

                                 WINSTON
                        Wow. Look at this place.

           Winston sees the “For Sale” sign in the lawn.

                                 WINSTON (CONT’D)
                        Wait, is this the house you’re here 
                        to sell?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Damn straight. Welcome to the 
                        Kaufman House.
           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Winston takes the whole house in.

                                 WINSTON
                        I love the vibe here. Rustic. 
                        Authentic. I can’t believe it’s 
                        still on the market.

                                 ANNETTE
                        If you’re interested, I can make 
                        you a deal.

                                 WINSTON
                        Ha! You’d be terrified to see what 
                        a small time minister pulls in 
                        annually.

                                 ANNETTE
                        C’mon, let’s go upstairs.

           Annette starts up the stairs. Winston follows.

           INT. HALLWAY - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette walks past the mirror to go into the bedroom. As 
           Winston walks by the mirror, his reflection is nothing but a 
           SKELETON. Winston stops in his tracks and turns back to look.

           His reflection now looks normal. Winston takes his glasses 
           off and looks at them.

                                 WINSTON
                        Time to actually get a prescription 
                        in these.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette sits on the bed with her legs crossed.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Am I being too forward, Reverend?

           Annette uncrosses and re-crosses her legs. Winston slowly 
           walks to her.

                                 WINSTON
                        “Your navel is perfectly formed 
                        like a goblet filled with mixed 
                        wine. Between your thighs lies a 
                        mound of wheat bordered with 
                        lilies. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WINSTON (CONT'D)
                        Your breasts are like two fawns, 
                        twin fawns of a gazelle... May your 
                        kisses be as exciting as the best 
                        wine, flowing gently over my lips 
                        and teeth.”

           Annette and Winston are now mere inches apart.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Who knew a man of the cloth knew 
                        such dirty limericks? 

                                 WINSTON
                        That ain’t limericks, babe. That’s 
                        Song of Songs, chapter 7. That’s 
                        straight up Old Testament shit.

           They kiss hard and fall into the bed under the sheets. They 
           roll around for awhile without a care in the world but each 
           other. It’s nice.

           AND THEN THE SHEET OF THE BED RISES INTO THE GHOST SHAPE.

           Annette and Winston are unaware as they continue to toss and 
           turn underneath the Ghost.

           Winston rolls on top of Annette and she opens her eyes and 
           sees the Ghost. She’s not afraid though. The Ghost cocks its 
           head as if it’s trying to understand Annette’s disposition. 

           Annette nods at the Ghost and rolls over to get on top of 
           Winston. As she rolls, the Ghost dissipates, becoming only a 
           sheet again. Winston notices nothing. Annette’s disappointed.

           The wall behind the bed RIPPLES and then the SHAPE OF A HAND 
           pushes out from behind the wall, almost as if it’s trying to 
           caress something. Annette sees this and nods approvingly.

           Then each wall around them begins RIPPLING and HANDS PUSH OUT 
           of all those walls as well, grasping for the bed.

           Winston gets on top again. From underneath the sheets, A 
           ROTTING ARM comes up and scratches down Winston’s back. 
           Winston jolts up and looks at Annette.

                                 WINSTON (CONT’D)
                        Oooo, your nails feel good when 
                        they dig into my back.

                                 ANNETTE
                        When my--?

           Annette looks behind Winston and sees the Rotting Arm - it 
           waves at Annette. Annette smirks.
                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Oh yeah, baby.

           They get back into it and as they get worked up, MORE AND 
           MORE ROTTING ARMS EMERGE FROM THE BED - COVERING WINSTON. One 
           even puts its finger in Winston’s mouth and he sucks on it.

                                 WINSTON
                        Oh baby, I feel you everywhere.

           Winston opens his eyes to look at Annette but instead sees A 
           ROTTING CORPSE WITH MAGGOTS IN ITS TEETH underneath him.

                                 WINSTON (CONT’D)
                        AAAHHHHHAHHHHHH!

           Winston falls back into the bed but the bed is now A SWARM OF 
           ROTTING ARMS which Winston can’t escape from.

                                 WINSTON (CONT’D)
                        Annette! Help!

           The sheet from the bed rises up above Winston into the Ghost 
           shape and looks down on him.

                                 WINSTON (CONT’D)
                        Holy mother of god!

           The Ghost starts slowly descending towards Winston and right 
           before it reaches him - Annette grabs Winston’s arm and pulls 
           him away.

           INT. HALLWAY - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette closes the door behind her and looks over at Winston 
           who is shaking from shock.

                                 WINSTON
                        What in the hell is going on?

                                 ANNETTE
                        This house is haunted and I knew 
                        you wouldn’t believe me if I just 
                        told you so I needed to show 
                        instead. And now I need to ask you 
                        for your help, Winston, because 
                        these ghosts are getting in the way 
                        of me selling this house and 
                        selling this house is the only 
                        thing standing in the way of the 
                        rest of my life.
                                 WINSTON
                        What could you possibly need my 
                        help with?

                                 ANNETTE
                        I need you to perform an exorcism, 
                        Reverend. 

           THUNDER ROLLS OUTSIDE. A LIGHTNING STRIKE SHINES THROUGH. 

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - LATER

           Rain pours outside. Annette sits on the ground surrounded by 
           candles. Winston, with a book in his hand, walks around her 
           with a piece of chalk - drawing a circle around them.

                                 WINSTON
                        When they made me Minister of 
                        Communications, I didn’t know that 
                        meant communicating with the dead.

                                 ANNETTE
                        What are you doing?

                                 WINSTON
                        Internal church library has an 
                        array of books we don’t give access 
                        to the general public, including a 
                        whole section on religious dealings 
                        with the supernatural.

           Winston completes the circle, goes to his bag, and pulls out 
           a small container. He opens it and dips his finger in it. 

                                 WINSTON (CONT’D)
                        These are ashes I got from my 
                        friend at the crematorium. Should 
                        keep us safe. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        Should?

           Winston marks Annette’s forehead with ashes in the shape of a 
           cross. He does the same to himself.

                                 WINSTON
                        Well, it’s not like I’ve ever done 
                        this before.

           Winston pulls out a pocket knife.

                                 WINSTON (CONT’D)
                        I need your palm.
                                 ANNETTE
                        Haven’t we exchanged enough bodily 
                        fluids for one night?

                                 WINSTON
                        We just both need to give a drop.

           Annette holds out her palm. Winston gives it a little cut and 
           squeezes a drop of blood onto the floor - right in the middle 
           of the circle. He follows suit. Two drops on the floor.

           Winston sits across from Annette and turns a page.

                                 WINSTON (CONT’D)
                        Okay, I’ve got a spiel here to read 
                        out but it starts with us calling 
                        out the spirits’ names.

           Winston looks at Annette. She doesn’t say anything.

                                 WINSTON (CONT’D)
                        So what are their names?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Um, I don’t know.

                                 WINSTON
                        What do you mean? You’ve been 
                        trying to sell this house for weeks 
                        and you haven’t looked into who 
                        exactly is haunting it?

                                 ANNETTE
                        You obviously don’t know the stress 
                        of giving an open house.

                                 WINSTON
                        Okay... we’ll just have to 
                        improvise then. Here we go.

           THUNDER CLAPS OUTSIDE.

                                 WINSTON (CONT’D)
                        Oh... spirits! We call out to you 
                        to present yourselves to us here in 
                        this mortal plane. You who have 
                        passed on and yet have cheated your 
                        final resting place to remain here 
                        amongst us. We call out to you 
                        spirits to make yourselves known 
                        here and now.

           Nothing happens.
                                 ANNETTE
                        What’s supposed to happen?

                                 WINSTON
                        Well according to the book, they’re 
                        supposed to appear at this point 
                        and then I keep going.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Does it say anything about what 
                        you’re supposed to do if they don’t 
                        show up?

                                 WINSTON
                        No, this is a holy text of 
                        exorcism, Annette, not a Choose-
                        Your-Own-Adventure book. Maybe if I 
                        just start over... Oh spirits!

           BANG. The door to the Storage Room clamors open, scaring 
           Annette and Winston. Then a soft repetitive THUD is heard.

                                 WINSTON (CONT’D)
                        What’s that noise?

           Annette and Winston look over to the staircase to see that 
           the thud is coming from something rolling down the stairs. 

           The something finally reaches the bottom of the stairs and 
           they see that it’s a VERY CREEPY LOOKING DOLL. Winston starts 
           to get up.

                                 WINSTON (CONT’D)
                        What the--

           Annette stops Winston.

                                 ANNETTE
                        I may not know much about this 
                        stuff, but I know that creepy ass 
                        dolls are a no-no. Ignore it. 
                        They’ve made contact. Keep going.

           Winston sits back down and turns a page in his book.

                                 WINSTON
                        Spirits, we are not your enemy. We 
                        are here to listen, to help you 
                        move on on your own terms. But if 
                        necessary, we will banish--

                                 DOLL
                        Mama.
           Annette and Winston whip their heads over to the Doll. The 
           Doll’s HEAD SLOWLY TURNS to look at them.

                                 DOLL (CONT’D)
                        Mama.

                                 WINSTON
                        Jesus Christ!

                                 ANNETTE
                        Keep going.

                                 WINSTON
                        If necessary we will banish you in 
                        the name of the Father to the 
                        darkest corners of Hell.

           All of the candles go out - plunging them into darkness.

           The lightning outside does a dance, flashing over and over 
           again. In each flash of light, we see a DIFFERENT FIGURE 
           sitting between Annette and Winston on the floor.

           The lightning stops. Annette strikes a match and lights one 
           of the candles. As the room starts to illuminate, we see that 
           TWO FIGURES ARE STILL SITTING NEXT TO THEM.

           One figure is a FACELESS MAN and the other is a FACELESS 
           WOMAN. The Doll rests in the middle of them all now. Winston 
           is shaking and sweating bullets.

                                 ANNETTE
                        You have to keep going.

                                 WINSTON
                        I... c-c-can’t. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        Winston. I believe in you.

           Winston gulps and shakily brings the book back up.

                                 WINSTON
                        Spirits--

                                 DOLL
                        Mama.

           Winston drops the book and covers his eyes.

                                 DOLL (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you love me, Mama?

           The Doll’s head turns a 180 and looks at Annette.
                                 DOLL (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you love me?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Winston! C’mon man!

           The Faceless Man reaches out and picks up the book himself. 
           Annette watches in terror. His bony fingers turn a page. A 
           voice emanates from him. 

                                 MAN WHISPER
                        Spirits, we condemn your souls. We 
                        command them. We sentence you to 
                        leave this place.

           The front windows start rattling. The Faceless Man hands the 
           book to the Faceless Woman.

                                 WOMAN WHISPER
                        You were never meant to be here. 
                        The word of God surrounds and 
                        propels you to remain in the 
                        afterlife. 

           The windows rattle harder. The Faceless Man and Woman begin 
           to LAUGH. They laugh harder and harder until they’re both 
           downright CACKLING.  

                                 DOLL
                        Mama! Mama! Mama!

           The Doll keeps screaming. The Faceless people continue to 
           laugh. The windows keep rattling. Winston can’t take it.

                                 WINSTON
                        Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

                        MAN WHISPER
                                                      WOMAN WHISPER
           Condemn.
                                              Condemn.

           At that moment, the two windows rattle OFF THEIR HINGES and 
           FLY THROUGH THE AIR directly towards the necks of Annette and 
           Winston. Annette ducks just in time but looks up to see--

           The sharp pane of glass slice through Winston’s neck, sending 
           HIS HEAD FLIPPING in the air, THE OMEN style, and eventually 
           landing directly in Annette’s lap.

           Annette looks down at the decapitated head in her lap and 
           stands up and SCREAMS.

                                 ANNETTE
                        THAT’S IT! I’VE HAD IT WITH YOU 
                        PIECES OF SHIT. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANNETTE (CONT'D)
                        KILLING EVERYONE AND MAKING ME 
                        CLEAN UP AFTER YOUR SHIT. NEVER 
                        ONCE CUTTING ME A BREAK. I HOPE 
                        YOU’RE READY. NO MORE OUTSOURCING 
                        THE PROBLEM. I’M GONNA TAKE CARE OF 
                        YOU MYSELF. BETTER SAY YOUR 
                        PRAYERS, GHOSTS, BECAUSE YOU AIN’T 
                        SEEN NOTHING YET.

           The Faceless people and the Doll stare blankly at Annette.

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette runs out into the rain and opens the trunk of her 
           car. Inside is a grocery bag with two bottles of LIQUOR. She 
           grabs them both and heads back inside.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette reenters the house - the Faceless people and the Doll 
           still where she left them. Annette runs ALL OVER THE HOUSE 
           spraying as much of the booze as she can everywhere.

           After she’s done, she grabs one of the candles from the 
           center of the room and LIGHTS THE LIQUOR ON FIRE. 

           FIRE SPREADS THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE. Curtains, furniture, 
           counter tops, the staircase, the floors - everything aflame.

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette bursts outside and watches as the flame spreads to 
           the exterior of the house. The fire raging an epic war on the 
           rain pouring down upon it, but the fire is stronger.

           Finally, the entire house is ENGULFED IN FLAMES.

           Annette, with a crazed grin, lifts up the For Sale sign and 
           throws it into the fire. 

           As the walls of the house burn down, there in fire, 
           unscathed, stand The Faceless People and, instead of the 
           Doll, a FACELESS LITTLE GIRL. Annette stares at them.

                                 ANNETTE
                        WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW WITH NO 
                        HOUSE TO HAUNT? HUH?

           The Faceless People and Annette stare at each other as the 
           fire rages on into the night.
           INT. ANNETTE’S RENTAL CAR - DAY

           Annette startles awake, having passed out in the backseat of 
           her car. Another bottle of booze (half-empty) in her hand. 
           She groans and then suddenly puts her hand to her mouth.

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Annette opens the car door and THROWS UP on the ground.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Oh god...

           She pulls herself together and then looks up and HORROR FILLS 
           HER EYES...

           Yep, you guessed it.

           THE KAUFMAN HOUSE IS IN FRONT OF HER. Unburnt, unhurt, 
           completely together, as if nothing ever happened.

           Annette stumbles out of the car, her foot lands right in her 
           puke but she doesn’t notice.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        No... NO! NO!

           Annette runs up to the house and runs her hands across the 
           wood to make sure it’s real.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        This can’t be happening. This can’t-

           Annette opens the front door.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - DAY

           Annette looks around the house - everything is perfect. The 
           camera swirls around her as she breaks down.

                                 MAN WHISPER
                        Well, well Annette...

                                 WOMAN WHISPER
                        Surprise, surprise Annette...

                                 MAN WHISPER
                        You didn’t have what it takes to 
                        get rid of us...

                                 WOMAN WHISPER
                        Just as expected...
                                 MAN WHISPER
                        Do you have what it takes to do 
                        anything, Annette...?

                                 WOMAN WHISPER
                        Can’t you even accomplish the 
                        simplest of things...?

                                 MAN WHISPER
                        Or are you always going to end up 
                        being second best...?

                                 WOMAN WHISPER
                        Third best...?

                                 MAN WHISPER
                        Not even in the top ten...

                                 WOMAN WHISPER
                        Stop convincing yourself you were 
                        meant for great things...

                                 MAN WHISPER
                        When it’s so obvious that you 
                        weren’t...

                                 WOMAN WHISPER
                        You’ve always come up short in your 
                        accomplishments...

                                 MAN WHISPER
                        And you forever will...

                                 WOMAN WHISPER
                        You will accomplish nothing...

                                 MAN WHISPER
                        Nothing...

                                 WOMAN WHISPER
                        NOTHING

                                 MAN WHISPER
                        NOTHING

                                 WOMAN WHISPER
                        YOU ARE NOTHING

                                 MAN WHISPER
                        WORTHLESS

           The Whispers begin to LAUGH as Annette crumbles to the floor.
                                 CHILD WHISPER
                        You’re nothing.

           Annette lets out a CRY OF AGONY as she weeps on the ground.

           QUICK CUTS:

           -Annette throwing her clothes in her suitcase

           -Annette sitting on an airplane

           -Annette back in her apartment in LA

           -Annette walking into her office

           -Ms. Burnhoffer looking pissed/disappointed and pointing 
           Annette back to her associate cubicle

           -Annette, defeated, taking her place at her cubicle

           -Days go by and by and by

           -Annette stays at her desk, doing her bullshit work. The only 
           work she’s good enough to do.

           -Annette watches Don shaking hands with clients in the 
           office. Everyone patting him on the back. Him being 
           everything that Annette wants to be.

           -She eats shitty TV dinners alone

           -She tries on a dress at a store, but can’t get it up over 
           her thighs

           -She tosses and turns while she sleeps

           INT. GALLIGAN BERINGER REAL ESTATE - DAY

           Annette enters for another day, looking terrible. She sits at 
           her desk and pulls an old sandwich out from underneath her 
           because she sat on it.

                                 MS. BURNHOFFER
                        Swip! Get in here.

           INT. MS. BURNHOFFER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Annette sits across from Ms. Burnhoffer.

                                 MS. BURNHOFFER
                        Well first off, you look like ass.
                                 ANNETTE
                             (blankly)
                        Thanks. Never felt better.

                                 MS. BURNHOFFER
                        And trust me, I don’t want to do 
                        this, you don’t deserve it. But I 
                        need you to run the first 20 
                        minutes of the open house at the 
                        Sternfeld Property.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Why? I thought Carlos was running 
                        that one.

                                 MS. BURNHOFFER
                        Carlos just called and said his 
                        doctor’s appointment is running 
                        long because there’s more foot 
                        fungus than they were expecting. 
                        He’ll be there, but not right at 
                        10am, so I just need you to open 
                        the house up and stand guard until 
                        Carlos gets there on the slight off-
                        chance someone shows up right at 
                        opening. Nobody ever does, but 
                        still, need someone there. And that 
                        someone’s gonna be you. Now go.

           INT. STERNFELD PROPERTY - DAY

           Annette unlocks the front door and looks at the modest home. 
           It’s nice, but small. Made for a married couple or bachelor, 
           not a family. 

           She sets up a table with pamphlets and puts out some 
           refreshments as well. Annette sits at the table and flips 
           through her phone, munching on a cookie.

           A KNOCK on the door startles her. There at the front door 
           stands ALYSIA, 30s, a meek looking woman.

                                 ALYSIA
                        Hi, sorry, is this the... Sternfeld-

                                 ANNETTE
                        Sternfeld Property? Yes, come in. 
                        Hi, I’m Annette.

                                 ALYSIA
                        Alysia.

           They shake hands.
                                 ANNETTE
                        It’s nice to meet you. Um, what 
                        brings you in today?

                                 ALYSIA
                        I, uh, well, I need a new place to 
                        live.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Amazing. Can I ask, is there 
                        something wrong with your current 
                        residence that we can make sure is 
                        right with this property?

                                 ALYSIA
                        Yes. My roommate.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Well, I can promise you that your 
                        roommate definitely isn’t here.

                                 ALYSIA
                        Good, she’s a monster.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Shall we start in the kitchen then?

                                 ALYSIA
                        Actually, I just have a question 
                        real quick.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Of course.

                                 ALYSIA
                        How flexible is the price? Because, 
                        to be honest, if I’m now going to 
                        be paying for a place on my own, 
                        the price is going to be a sticking 
                        point for me. I think even if I had 
                        a roommate still, the price here 
                        would be tough. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        Well what is your price range?

                                 ALYSIA
                        Like if you knocked a zero off the 
                        end of the price, then maybe I 
                        could possibly consider it.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Oh, wow, well...
           Annette looks at Alysia who almost has tears in her eyes.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Your roommate situation is that 
                        bad, huh?

                                 ALYSIA
                        Like I said, she’s a monster.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Oh darlin’, trust me, you don’t 
                        know what a monster really is. Have 
                        you tried talking to her?

                                 ALYSIA
                        She won’t listen. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        Maybe you just have to change how 
                        you’re talking to her.

                                 ALYSIA
                        What do you mean?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Well, maybe don’t try talking to 
                        her like she’s a monster. Try 
                        talking to her just like she’s 
                        another human being. Everyone 
                        responds to actually being treated 
                        like they’re a real person. 

                                 ALYSIA
                        She doesn’t talk to me like that.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Doesn’t matter. If you set the 
                        tone, she’ll respond accordingly. 
                        Trust me, just talk to her like 
                        she’s alive and she’ll listen.

           Wait a second... That spark something in Annette’s mind. She 
           hears the echoes of something Winston said to her:

                                 WINSTON (O.S.)
                        You’ve been trying to sell this 
                        house for weeks and you haven’t 
                        looked into who exactly is haunting 
                        it?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Oh shit... Sorry, I have to go.

           Annette grabs her things and heads for the door.
                                 ALYSIA
                        Go? Go where?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Kansas.

           EXT. STERNFELD PROPERTY - DAY

           Annette runs out the door to see CARLOS, 40s, getting out of 
           his car with one shoe and one flip flop on (foot fungus, 
           remember?)

                                 ANNETTE
                        Carlos, the girl in there is ready 
                        to buy as long as you knock a zero 
                        off the price. Give her deal, 
                        she’ll be a good tenant. Thanks!

           Annette gets into her car leaving Carlos behind, confused.

           EXT. KOOL KAT KAFE - DAWN

           Roxxy gets out of her car with a ring of keys in her hand to 
           open up the coffee shop. She stops when she sees Annette 
           standing in front of the shop.

                                 ROXXY
                        Um... hi?

                                 ANNETTE
                        I know how to beat them.

                                 ROXXY
                             (grinning)
                        Oh hell yeah.

           INT. KOOL KAT KAFE - DAY

           Roxxy hands Annette a cup of joe.

                                 ANNETTE
                        This whole time we’ve been thinking 
                        about how can we get rid of these 
                        ghosts and had tried to take care 
                        of them in the way that you take 
                        care of ghosts.

                                 ROXXY
                        Right... because they’re ghosts.
                                 ANNETTE
                        To us. But not to themselves. To 
                        them, they’re still people and this 
                        is their house. So we need to stop 
                        thinking of them as ghosts and 
                        start thinking of them as they do, 
                        as people. And if we can reach them 
                        that way, maybe we can convince 
                        them to go.

                                 ROXXY
                        Okay, cool, yeah, just sit down 
                        over a game of Parcheesi and some 
                        snickerdoodles and have a polite 
                        chat to convince these spirits from 
                        the underworld that they need to 
                        move out. Easy.

                                 ANNETTE
                        I was thinking more like Texas Hold 
                        ‘Em and Ovaltine, but yeah that’s 
                        the general idea.

                                 ROXXY
                        And the first step to doing this 
                        is...?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Well, first, we need to learn their 
                        names.

           EXT. CHIMERICAL CEMETERY - DAY

           Annette and Roxxy get out of Roxxy’s car and look out across 
           the field of headstones in front of them.

                                 ROXXY
                        C’mon. This way.

           INT. CEMETERY WELCOME CENTER - DAY

           Annette and Roxxy enter. No one is behind the counter. Roxxy 
           ‘dings’ the bell and out from the back pops LANA, 60s, 
           another Ms. Burnhoffer look-a-like, but a perky one.

                                 LANA
                        Hello there! Why hi, Roxxy.

                                 ROXXY
                        Lana, hi, good to see you. Want you 
                        to meet Annette Swip.
                                 ANNETTE
                        You don’t happen to have any family 
                        in California, do you?

                                 LANA
                        No, why do you ask?

                                 ANNETTE
                        No reason.

                                 ROXXY
                        Lana, we want in the records room.

           INT. CEMETERY RECORDS ROOM - DAY

           Lana turns on a light in a dusty room with shelves and boxes.

                                 LANA
                        Okay you have fun, girls. I won’t 
                        ask what y’all are gonna get up to 
                        in here but all I ask is that you 
                        clean up after yourselves and use 
                        protection. Okay? Bye now.

           Lana leaves and Annette and Roxxy give each other a look. 
           They then go off into the shelves and start looking at boxes.

                                 ROXXY
                        We’re looking for anything that 
                        dates back to the 1860s.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Or that directly mentions Jershua 
                        Kaufman.

                                 ROXXY
                        Right.

                                 ANNETTE
                        But what kinds of documents are we 
                        looking for exactly?

                                 ROXXY
                        Uh, I dunno.

           The women silently search for a moment - opening boxes and 
           dumping out documents.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Wait, here might be something.
           Annette reaches into a box at the top of one of the shelves 
           and pulls out a thick leather bound book. Roxxy comes around 
           and they look at the book together.

                                 ROXXY
                        What is it?

                                 ANNETTE
                        It’s a volume of a directory of 
                        who’s buried here and it dates back 
                        to the early 1800s. 

                                 ROXXY
                        Great, but we don’t know what names 
                        we’re looking for.

                                 ANNETTE
                        No... but maybe...

           Annette flips through the pages. 

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Each year, they compiled a complete 
                        list of every body buried here. If 
                        all of the sudden, there were a few 
                        bodies missing, they wouldn’t be 
                        accounted for on the next year’s 
                        list. 

                                 ROXXY
                        So we’re looking for a set of names 
                        that disappeared from one year to 
                        the next?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Exactly.

           Annette sits down with the book and starts going through each 
           year name-by-name. Roxxy goes back searching for something.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        What are you looking for? Another 
                        set of eyes would help!

                                 ROXXY
                        There’s got to be files on each 
                        person buried here, which will help 
                        us keep the names straight.

           Roxxy grabs a box and it topples on top of her.

                                 ANNETTE
                        You okay?
                                 ROXXY
                        Yep. Luckily that was the wrong 
                        box. Unluckily, I think I’m part 
                        spider web now.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Keep looking! I’m already getting 
                        confused by the number of Andersons 
                        there are.

           Roxxy pulls out box after box until finally she finds one 
           with some folders.

                                 ROXXY
                        Jackpot.

           Roxxy brings the box over.

                                 ROXXY (CONT’D)
                        Lay ‘em on me.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Okay, starting with 1860... 
                        Hannibal Adams.

                                 ROXXY
                        Hannibal Adams...

           Roxxy looks through the files.

                                 ROXXY (CONT’D)
                        Got ‘em.

           Roxxy opens the file to find an old black and white photo of 
           Hannibal Adams. She goes to a corner and lays out the file 
           and the photo and writes Hannibal’s name on a sticky note.

                                 ROXXY (CONT’D)
                        Next.

           TIME PASSES - we see Annette call out different names and 
           Roxxy placing file and photo next to one another and putting 
           sticky notes of their names next to them. Each photo also 
           gets a sticky note of each year they appear in the directory. 

           INT. CEMETERY RECORDS ROOM - LATER

           The photos are covered with sticky notes. Coffee cups are 
           strewn everywhere. Annette and Roxxy both struggle to keep 
           their eyes open.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Hannibal Adams.
                                 ROXXY
                        Hannibal Adams.

           Roxxy writes “1868” on a sticky note and places it on 
           Hannibal’s photo.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Carolina Allman.

                                 ROXXY
                        Carolina Allman.

           Roxxy does the same for Carolina’s photo.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Grace Anderson.

                                 ROXXY
                        Grace Anderson.

           Roxxy puts a sticky note on Grace’s photo, but it’s not the 
           one next to Carolina’s.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Horace--

                                 ROXXY
                        Wait.

                                 ANNETTE
                        What?

                                 ROXXY
                        Hannibal Adams. Carolina Allman. 
                        And then Grace Anderson?

                                 ANNETTE
                             (double checking)
                        Yeah.

           Roxxy picks up a picture of a young man.

                                 ROXXY
                        Where’s Dwayne Amberman?

                                 ANNETTE
                             (excitedly)
                        He’s not listed here.

           Roxxy drops the file in front of Annette.

                                 ROXXY
                        Ghost #1.
           Annette picks up the file and reads it.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Dwayne Amberman. March 17th, 1833 - 
                        November 9th, 1866. Looks like he 
                        was an ambitious politician who was 
                        the youngest candidate for mayor in 
                        1866 only to suffer defeat at the 
                        hands of the incumbent and then 
                        days later... drank himself to 
                        death.

                                 ROXXY
                        Talk about unfulfilled potential.

                                 ANNETTE
                        And our first missing coffin.

                                 ROXXY
                        All right! Let’s keep going. They 
                        all gotta be in this year.

           TIME PASSES - Annette and Roxxy keep going through all the 
           names until they stumble on the next name that’s missing. 
           Roxxy hands the file to Annette and she reads.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Cecilia Simmons. April 15, 1837 - 
                        October 10, 1860. One of the 
                        daughters of the wealthiest 
                        families in town at the time.

                                 ROXXY
                        Look at that photo. What a fox.

                                 ANNETTE
                        She was betrothed to the heir of 
                        another wealthy family, Conrad 
                        Blackwell, but she was disfigured 
                        in an accident and the wedding was 
                        called off. 

                                 ROXXY
                        What was the accident?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Runaway carriage. She was trampled 
                        by a horse.

           Annette pulls another photo out of the file of Cecilia post-
           accident. It’s hard to look at.

                                 ROXXY
                        Oh my god.
                                 ANNETTE
                        And then she killed herself.

                                 ROXXY
                        Jesus Christ. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        Lost vanity.

                                 ROXXY
                        And missing coffin #2.

           TIME PASSES AGAIN - Roxxy hands Annette the last file.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Sarah Wittle. May 21st, 1841 - 
                        January 30, 1845. 

                                 ROXXY
                        What?

                                 ANNETTE
                        She was 3 years old. It looks 
                        like... she died of pneumonia but 
                        the wasn’t buried with the rest of 
                        her family. Why would that be?

                                 ROXXY
                        Only one reason to do that back 
                        then - shame. They must have been 
                        embarrassed by her for some reason 
                        and buried her in secret.

                                 ANNETTE
                        A forgotten child. Is there a 
                        picture?

           Roxxy flips through the file and pulls out a family photo 
           with part of it torn off.

                                 ROXXY
                        She must be that little girl 
                        holding her mother’s hand but the 
                        part of the picture with her face 
                        has been torn off.

           Annette stares at the picture until she notices something.

                                 ANNETTE
                        I don’t think Sarah died of 
                        pneumonia.

                                 ROXXY
                        What gives you that idea?
                                 ANNETTE
                        Her face might be gone but you can 
                        still see her hand holding her 
                        mothers. Look close, tell me what 
                        you see.

           Roxxy takes the photo and looks close at the hands. 

                                 ROXXY
                        Oh my god... her skin is darker.

           Annette and Roxxy look to the other side of the photo to 
           where the Servants stand and they focus in on the one male 
           black servant standing among them.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Like you said - shame.

                                 ROXXY
                        How awful.

                                 ANNETTE
                        No wonder nobody missed her coffin.

           Annette holds the three photos up next to each other and her 
           and Roxxy look upon the faces of the Kaufman House ghosts - 
           Dwayne, Cecilia, and Sarah.

           INT. WHITE VAN - NIGHT

           Roxxy and Annette drive in silent contemplation.

                                 ANNETTE
                        You said no one ever found the 
                        bodies, right?

                                 ROXXY
                        Yep.

           A silent beat.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Bodies are in the house somewhere.

                                 ROXXY
                        Most likely.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Great.

           Silence again as the car pulls up in front of the Kaufman 
           House. Roxxy parks the van and looks at Annette.
                                 ROXXY
                        Do you know what you’re going to 
                        do?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Honestly, I have no earthly idea. I 
                        think I gotta go to them though. 

                                 ROXXY
                        How are you going to do that?

                                 ANNETTE
                        I have a hunch about where they 
                        hang out when no one’s around...
                             (beat)
                        If I’m being honest, I’m scared, 
                        Roxxy. Those things in there... 
                        they know me. They get inside my 
                        head and make me feel all the worst 
                        things about myself all at once. 
                        They’re worse than my mother.

                                 ROXXY
                        Look, I don’t blame you for being 
                        scared. I’m petrified and I’m not 
                        the one who has to go in there. 
                        But, whatever happens, I’ll be 
                        right there with ya.

           Roxxy flips a switch and all the monitors that show the 
           inside of the house light up.

                                 ROXXY (CONT’D)
                        Well... I’ll be here but still with 
                        you, y’know?

           Roxxy hands Annette an earbud.

                                 ROXXY (CONT’D)
                        So we can be incommunicado. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        You know that means unable to talk 
                        to each other, right?

                                 ROXXY
                        No, no I did not.

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Annette exits the white van, puts the earbud in, and 
           approaches the house. She takes a deep breath as she reaches 
           the front door.
                                 ANNETTE
                        All right, Swip. You think you’re 
                        up for this?
                             (beat)
                        No. But I’m gonna do it anyway.

           Annette opens the door.

           INT. WHITE VAN - NIGHT

           Roxxy whips out some snickerdoodles and Ovaltine as she 
           watches Annette on the monitors.

                                 ROXXY
                        Here we go.

           FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette enters the house and immediately sees THE FACELESS 
           MAN, WOMAN, & CHILD standing in front of her, holding hands 
           with each other.

           Then they all suddenly fly off in different Roxxy watches at 
           Annette goes from room to room - front room, living room, 
           kitchen, master bedroom - as she takes one last look at 
           everything.

           Int. FRONT ROOM - 1ST directions. The Man to the kitchen, the 
           Woman to the bathroom upstairs, and the Child to the living 
           room.

           Annette makes her way into the kitchen.

           INT. KITCHEN - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette walks in and sees the Faceless Man leaning over the 
           sink, a bottle in his hand, and breathing heavy. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        Hello...? Dwayne? Can you hear me?

                                 ROXXY
                             (earbud)
                        I don’t know if directly talking to 
                        them is going to work?

           Annette turns away to answer Roxxy.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Well what else am I supposed to try 
                        here?
           The Faceless Man’s head slowly creaks to look at Annette.

                                 MAN WHISPER 
                        Annette...

           Annette snaps her attention back to the Man only to find that 
           it’s actually Don from her office standing in front of her.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Don?

                                 DON
                        Hey there, champ.

                                 ANNETTE
                        What are you doing here?

                                 DON
                        What do you mean? It’s my party.

           Annette turns around and sees that she’s in--

           INT. GALLIGAN BERINGER REAL ESTATE - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           --the middle of Don’s promotion celebration party. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        What?

           Mrs. Burnhoffer gets up to the front of the room.

                                 MRS. BURNHOFFER
                        Ladies and gentlemen, in the 23 
                        years of Galligen Beringer Real 
                        Estate and our 8 years of doing 
                        Prove-Yourself-Promotions, today 
                        set a record for the fastest and 
                        most lucrative closure we’ve ever 
                        had here. And let me tell you 
                        something, it couldn’t have been 
                        done by anyone else but this young 
                        man right here. In all my years in 
                        the business, I’ve never seen 
                        anyone have this much natural 
                        talent in a single person. From the 
                        instant he walked in here, I knew 
                        he was going to be something 
                        special and that no one else who 
                        ever worked here would come close 
                        to him. So would like to welcome to 
                        the front, for the first time as a 
                        Senior Agent, Don Hutton.
           The Audience bursts into applause and cheers as Don 
           approaches the stand.

           Annette looks around the room, searching for some way to 
           escape, but the room doesn’t have any doors.

           That’s when she starts to notice the people in the crowd. 
           They don’t look right. They look too happy. Their smiles are 
           too wide. Their eyes bloodshot. Their fingers too long.

                                 DON
                        Well, I couldn’t have don it 
                        without my competitors. 

           Everyone laughs.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        But seriously folks, there’s only 
                        one person I really want to thank 
                        and that is--

                                 DEEP VOICE
                        DWAYNE AMBERMAN.

           Annette doesn’t know where that voice came from. She turns 
           around and finds herself in--

           INT. PUB - NIGHT

           --an old pub. Old timey. The people in there are in old 
           garments. Sitting alone in the corner is DWAYNE AMBERMAN, 
           with a table full of empty mugs in front of him. He looks 
           inebriated well past the point that anyone should be.

           Standing in front of Dwayne is a LARGE MAN and a SMALL MAN.

                                 LARGE MAN
                             (deep voice)
                        Aren’t you Dwayne Amberman?

                                 SMALL MAN
                        Yeah yeah - aren’t you the loser?

                                 LARGE MAN
                        Ne’er seen a landslide like that in 
                        my lifetime. 

                                 SMALL MAN
                        Guess you’re not as good as you 
                        thought you were, huh?

           The Large Man bends down to get right in Dwayne’s face.
                                 LARGE MAN
                        How does it feel to know that 
                        you’ll never live up to your full 
                        potential?

           The Large Man grabs Dwayne’s half finished mug and knocks the 
           rest of it back.

                                 LARGE MAN (CONT’D)
                        Y’know, no one ever remembers the 
                        name of the loser. You’ll be 
                        nothing more than a footnote in the 
                        annals of history.

           The Large Man snaps at the Small Man who runs over to the bar 
           and then comes back with another mug.

                                 LARGE MAN (CONT’D)
                        ‘Ere. Have another drink on us.

           The Large Man forces the contents of the mug down Dwayne’s 
           throat - making it impossible for Dwayne to breathe. He’s 
           drowning.

           Annette runs towards the table.

                                 ANNETTE
                        No wait! Stop it! You’re killing 
                        him!

           Annette grabs the shoulders of The Large Man and turns him 
           around only to reveal that it’s--

           INT. GALLIGAN BERINGER REAL ESTATE - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           --Don, and Annette is now up at the front of the room with 
           Don’s arm around her waist.

                                 DON
                        That’s right, the one person I 
                        really need to thank is Annette 
                        Swip. Let me see how I can put this 
                        - I hate Annette Swip.

                                 ANNETTE
                        What?

           The crowd applauds at what Don’s said.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                             (to the crowd)
                        What?
                                 DON
                        I hate Annette because she thinks 
                        she’s talented and therefore thinks 
                        she deserves more than she has. 
                        Haha! She’s wrong. There’s a reason 
                        that Annette has never accomplished 
                        what she’s always wanted to, and 
                        that’s because she’s just not as 
                        good as she thinks she is. 

           The crowd applauds more.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        I’m better.

           The crowd CHEERS. Annette looks at the audience in horror.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        And that’s why I really have to 
                        thank her because I wanted to get 
                        this promotion to prove to her that 
                        she will never live up to her full 
                        potential. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        No please... stop it. Stop it.

           Annette closes her eyes and puts her hands over her ears but 
           then she is forcefully turned around until she’s face-to-face 
           with Don except - DON IS FACELESS NOW.

           Annette gasps in horror. She turns to the crowd and sees THE 
           WHOLE CROWD IS FACELESS NOW AS WELL and everyone is standing 
           perfectly still.

                                 DON
                             (faceless whisper)
                        No one will remember your name.
                             (louder, to crowd)
                        Who wants to dance?

           The crowd CHEERS again and eerie musics starts to play and 
           Don grabs Annette and starts to dance with her. She struggles 
           to get out of his grasp but he’s too strong for her.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Let go of me! LET GO!

           Don passes Annette off to another Faceless Person and that 
           passes her off to another and another. She spins around and 
           around, the music getting faster and scarier.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Stop it! Please.
           Annette is finally passed off to another and she realizes 
           she’s back with Don.

           Don LUNGES at her, snarling. Annette falls to the ground and 
           a horde of Faceless People close in on her. Annette SCREAMS 
           until she hears a voice cut through the noise.

                                 BETTY
                        Pardon me, excuse me, please move 
                        aside, my daughter is down there.

           Betty parts through the Faceless People easily to find 
           Annette on the ground.

                                 ANNETTE
                        M... mom?

                                 BETTY
                        Oh Annette, get up, sweetie. C’mon.

           Betty gives Annette her hand and pulls her up to reveal that--

           INT. FIRST CHURCH OF WOODSMITH - ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

           --they’re in the middle of the post-church service lunch 
           buffet. The Faceless People have vanished. Annette holds a 
           plate of fruit salad while her mom shuffles her around.

                                 BETTY
                        There are some people that just 
                        want to say hi to you since they 
                        haven’t seen you in so long.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Mom, I think I have it all figured 
                        out. This is all a supernatural 
                        hallucination that the ghosts are 
                        using to prey on my insecurities. 
                        This is what they do to everyone 
                        who--

                                 BETTY
                        Quiet now and be polite.

           A Group of OLD PEOPLE come up to see Annette.

                                 OLD PERSON 1
                        Annette! Haven’t seen you in about 
                        10 years or so.
                                 OLD PERSON 2
                        Your mother’s been telling us about 
                        all the great thing you’ve been 
                        doing.

                                 OLD PERSON 3
                        Out in Los Angeles and selling 
                        mansions to the rich and famous.

                                 OLD PERSON 4
                        Making your family name proud.

                                 OLD PERSON 5
                        Doing right by your mother. And 
                        your sister.

                                 OLD PERSON 6
                        Being the apple of your mother’s 
                        eye.

                                 OLD PERSON 1
                        Not just settling for some 
                        meaningless way of life that would 
                        embarrass her.

                                 OLD PERSON 2
                        No, definitely not that.

                                 OLD PERSON 3
                        Out there putting the name Swip on 
                        the map.

                                 OLD PERSON 4
                        Bringing pride to your family name.

                                 OLD PERSON 5
                        You’re not a letdown, are you, 
                        Annette?

                                 OLD PERSON 6
                        You’re not a disgrace and total 
                        failure, are you?

                                 OLD PERSON 1
                        Are you, Annette?

                                 OLD PERSON 2
                        Are you?

                                 OLD PERSON 3
                        Are you?
           The camera is swirling faster and faster as Annette is stuck 
           in between this circle of elders closing in on her, until all 
           their faces blur together.

           Annette feels like she’s on a ghoulish merry-go-round until a 
           hand reaches in and pulls her out. It’s Betty.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Mom! I--

                                 BETTY
                        Shhh-shhh.

           Betty, with comfort in her eyes, strokes some of Annette’s 
           hair behind her ear and then looks straight into her eyes.

                                 BETTY (CONT’D)
                        I could never be proud of you.

                                 ANNETTE
                        No, Mom, no--!

           The room goes completely black except for one small pool of 
           light. Standing in the light is small mixed race girl - SARAH 
           WITTLE.

           She stands holding the creepy doll in one hand and in the 
           other hand - a knife.

           Suddenly, Whispering Voices swirl around the air.

                                 VOICES
                        ...look at her... that’s not 
                        right... she’s not right...

           Sarah QUICKLY SLAMS THE KNIFE INTO HER OWN FACE AND THEN 
           PULLS IT OUT. A stream of blood emerges from the wound. 
           Annette is petrified.

                                 VOICES (CONT’D)
                        ...we must do something... you 
                        can’t afford to do this to your 
                        family name... the shame that would 
                        fall upon your family... the 
                        shame...

           Sarah again swiftly stabs her own face again. This time 
           slashing part of her cheek away. Her teeth exposed through 
           the wounded, bleeding flesh.

                                 VOICES (CONT’D)
                        ...we do this and then we will 
                        never speak of her name again...
           Another stab.

                                 VOICES (CONT’D)
                        ...never speak of her name again...

           Another stab.

                                 VOICES (CONT’D)
                        ...never again...

           Another stab - Sarah has torn her small face to shreds.

           Annette turns away in horror. She opens to eyes to find Sarah 
           gone and in her place, a group of adults standing in front of 
           a baby carriage that’s ENGULFED IN FLAMES while an infant 
           wails in agony.

           Annette sees a door on the far side of the room. She runs 
           towards it and goes through it.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Annette runs out onto the street and IMMEDIATELY GETS 
           TRAMPLED BY A HORSE AND CARRIAGE THAT COMES OUT OF NOWHERE.

           Everything goes black.

           INT. OLD HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Annette suddenly comes to. She’s standing in front of a 
           mirror in an old-timey hospital. Bandages cover her entire 
           face except one eye.

           A DOCTOR stands on one side of her while two Women stand 
           behind her and an extremely handsome fellow, CONRAD 
           BLACKWELL, stands on her other side.

                                 DOCTOR
                        I did everything I could but, 
                        unfortunately, there wasn’t much to 
                        work with.

           The Doctor takes one of the bandages off. As he does this, 
           Annette contracts at her waist in pain. She looks down and 
           sees HER BELT has just tightened on its own.

                                 CONRAD BLACKWELL
                        As long as she’s good enough to 
                        look like the wife of a nobleman--

                                 DOCTOR
                        Well...
           Doctor removes another bandage and another - each time the 
           belt tightening again and again.

           The Doctor finally removes the last bandage. We don’t see 
           what Annette looks like, but we see what everyone’s reaction 
           to her is.

           The Women behind her hold each other and start weeping. The 
           Doctor looks forlorn. Conrad looks on in disgust.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Again, I did the best I could.

                                 CONRAD BLACKWELL
                        This... this is not my bride. This 
                        is not Cecilia Simmons. This... is 
                        a monster.

           We now reveal Annette’s face - hideously stitched together 
           with the minimal pieces of flesh left over. Parts of her face 
           still look like they’re bleeding. It’s ghastly.

                                 CONRAD BLACKWELL (CONT’D)
                        This is not my betrothed. My bride-
                        to-be is beautiful. This thing is 
                        hideous. I do not know the name of 
                        this creature. And I shall forget 
                        that I ever knew the name Cecilia 
                        Simmons. She is not dead to me, 
                        rather, she never existed in my 
                        mind’s eye.

           Annette screams out and takes off the crushing belt around 
           her waist and loops it around her neck. She then runs to the 
           side window and jumps through it, catching the other end of 
           the belt around window latch, and hanging herself.

           EXT. OUTSIDE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           A Crowd gathers around the sight of Annette’s body hanging 
           from the broken window. A Man with a ladder shows up and cuts 
           Annette down.

           Her body falls into a wooden coffin on the ground. The coffin 
           is loaded onto the back of a horse-drawn wagon.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           Annette wakes up but doesn’t know where she is. We don’t 
           either because everything’s black.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Hello?
           We hear Annette try to move around but it sounds like she’s 
           confined in tight quarters.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Can anyone hear me?

           We hear a SCRAPING sound coming from above Annette and then 
           hear Annette being JOSTLED around.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Ow. Hey! Hello?

           The sound of wood BREAKING and then finally, light comes 
           pouring in and we realize we’re at--

           EXT. CHIMERICAL CEMETERY - NIGHT

           --the Chimerical Cemetery. But it’s still not present day, 
           it’s 1868, and Annette’s lifeless body falls into the back of 
           another horse-drawn wagon.

           Annette tries to move, but she can’t. She looks around and 
           sees the bodies of Dwayne Amberman and Sarah Wittle already 
           lying in a pile on the back of the wagon.

           A MAN finishes tying the empty coffins to the wagon and then 
           gets onto the horse.

                                 ANNETTE
                        What... What’s going on?

           Annette in tears as The Man - obviously JERSHUA KAUFMAN - 
           gets the horse going.

           EXT. THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - 1868 - NIGHT

           We see the Kaufman House in progress of being built. An 
           unfinished frame of the place that will torture Annette.

           Jershua takes the coffins and pulls them apart board by board 
           and Annette watches as he uses them in different parts of the 
           framework of the house.

           Finally, Jershua comes over to the bodies and picks them up 
           one-by-one and takes them somewhere in the house. 

           The last body he takes is Annette. He takes her over to an 
           UNFINISHED WALL of the backside of the second story of the 
           house - the back Storage Room wall.
           He tosses Annette on top of the other bodies and she watches 
           as Jershua picks up a BLOOD RED DOOR and hammers it into the 
           wall, covering them, and plunging us into darkness.

           INT. STORAGE ROOM - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette opens her eyes and finds she’s laying on top of the 
           red door. As she looks around, she sees that every inch of 
           the Storage Room is COVERED IN RED DOORS.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Oh no.

           Annette tries one red door. And another. And another. Gravity 
           has turned off. Annette runs up and down the walls and the 
           ceiling, trying to find a red door that will open for her.

           She tries one on the ceiling and as she does, one below her 
           CREAKS open. Annette closes her eyes and lets go - falling 
           gracefully downwards and through the open red door below.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette opens her eyes and finds herself on the first floor 
           of the house. She looks up and sees the door to the Storage 
           Room still open. She runs to the stairs.

           Halfway up the stairs though, something catches her leg and 
           she stops in her tracks. She looks down and sees that EVERY 
           STEP ON THE STAIRCASE IS NOW A COFFIN.

           Her foot is caught under the lid of one of the coffins. 
           Annette tries to pull her foot from under the lid but it 
           still won’t budge. 

           Above her, THUNDER ROLLS. She looks up and sees STORM CLOUDS 
           BREWING INSIDE THE HOUSE. 

           INT. WHITE VAN - NIGHT

           Roxxy sees Annette struggle on the stairs and the storm 
           clouds.

                                 ROXXY
                        Annette! Annette! Can you hear me?

           She slurps her Ovaltine.
           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           RAIN POURS DOWN FROM THE CEILING. 

           Annette finally YANKS her leg hard enough to get it unstuck, 
           but in doing so she opens the lid of the coffin stair and 
           finds A ROTTING DEAD BODY CLUTCHING ONTO ANNETTE’S ANKLE.

           Annette SCREAMS. She steps onto the next coffin stair, but 
           the lid pops open and another ROTTING DEAD BODY grabs ahold 
           of her.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Yes, Roxxy, I can hear you. I’m a 
                        little busy right now.

           As Annette runs up the rest of the coffin stairs, she jumps 
           and dodges out of the way as each coffin opens and a dead 
           body tries to hold her back.

           INT. WHITE VAN - NIGHT

                                 ROXXY
                        I know, but listen to me. I saw 
                        everything you went through.

                                 ANNETTE
                             (earbud)
                        You did?

                                 ROXXY
                        Yeah, it was crazy. A couple of 
                        cameras must’ve followed you 
                        through it all. Lost audio 
                        communication though. But it was 
                        like I was watching a movie with 
                        various camera angles and inventive 
                        editing. The ghosts have some 
                        filmmaking skills, I must say.

           INT. HALLWAY - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette reaches the top of the stairs. Rain still pouring. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        How is this supposed to help me?
           INT. WHITE VAN - NIGHT

                                 ROXXY
                        Oh right, well, I was taking notes 
                        and each... experience, or 
                        whatever, you had there was a 
                        moment in each of them where 
                        someone said something about each 
                        ghost’s name. 

                                 ANNETTE
                             (earbud)
                        So?

                                 ROXXY
                        So... I think you gotta call them 
                        out by name and that’ll do... 
                        something.

           INT. HALLWAY - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette heads to the Storage Room door.

                                 ANNETTE
                        Okay, I guess I can try tha--

           Suddenly, the DOOR TO THE MASTER BEDROOM OPENS AND A FLOOD OF 
           WATER COMES RUSHING OUT.

           THE FLOOD OF WATER IS FULL OF DEAD BODIES.

           Annette rushes to the Storage Room door but doesn’t make it 
           in time and is BOMBARDED by the flood of water, SMASHING her 
           into the back wall at the top of the stairs.

           DEAD BODIES PUMMEL HER UNDER WATER. Annette swims upward. Her 
           head breaks the surface and she gasps for breath.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        Dwayn--

           A rotting hand emerges from the water and forces itself into 
           Annette’s mouth, crawling down her throat. Annette falls back 
           under the water. 

           She swims back up to the surface. More rotting hands grasping 
           onto her now, trying to pull her down. Annette fights through 
           them until she finally gets free for a moment and calls out--

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        DWAYNE AMBERMAN! CECILIA SIMMONS! 
                        SARAH WITTLE!
           SUDDENLY - the flood is gone. Annette stands on her own too 
           feet, completely dry, just outside the Storage Room door. 

           Standing in front of her are the three Faceless People. The 
           Man gestures to the door and it opens. Annette walks over and 
           enters the room.

           INT. STORAGE ROOM - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette stands amongst the Faceless People in the room. 
           There’s nothing in there except for the blood red door on the 
           opposite side of the room.

           With nothing else to do, Annette approaches the red door and 
           clasps the doorknob. 

           The Faceless Child begins to WHIMPER.

           Annette turns the knob and the door easily opens. We don’t 
           see what’s inside yet, but Annette is visibly shaken by it.

                                 ROXXY
                             (earbud)
                        What is it? Annette? What do you 
                        see?

                                 ANNETTE
                        Remember how you said no one ever 
                        knew where Kaufman put the bodies? 
                        Well... found ‘em.

           We now see - behind the door is a small compartment where 
           three decomposed bodies / skeletons hang together.

                                 ROXXY
                             (earbud)
                        Oh my god... Of course! Annette, 
                        you’ve got to rebury the bodies in 
                        the earth. That’s how you can get 
                        rid of the ghosts. 

           Annette turns around to face the Faceless except they’re not 
           Faceless anymore. Dwayne, Cecilia, and Sarah - holding the 
           creepy doll - stand in front Annette face-to-face.

           Then they all join hands together again.

                                 ANNETTE
                        No... No, Roxxy, we’ve been getting 
                        it all wrong. They’re not the 
                        unwelcomed guests here... we are. 
           INT. HALLWAY - 2ND FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Annette walks out of Storage Room and down the stairs. 

                                 ANNETTE
                        They had already been laid to rest 
                        and then Jershua Kaufman dug up 
                        their coffins and built them into 
                        the body of this house. Here in the 
                        walls and the rafters and the 
                        ceilings and the floors, the wood 
                        of their final resting place still 
                        resides, and because of that, so 
                        they will reside as well. We can’t 
                        be looking to get rid of them, 
                        Roxxy. They live here. This is 
                        their home.

           INT. FRONT ROOM - 1ST FLOOR - THE KAUFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           The front door has blown open. Annette goes to the doorway 
           and looks out to Roxxy in the drivers window of the van.

                                 ROXXY
                             (earbud)
                        So, what are you going to do about 
                        trying to sell the place? I mean, 
                        who could you find to live there?

                                 ANNETTE
                        It’d need to be someone who accepts 
                        this place and these people for 
                        what they are. 

           Annette turns around and sees Dwayne, Cecilia, and Sarah.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                        And someone who accepts themselves 
                        in the same way too.

                                 ROXXY
                             (earbud)
                        Where are you going to find a 
                        person like that?

           Annette smiles a little to herself. She goes to loosen her 
           belt and then decides to take it off and let it fall to the 
           floor. She even undoes the top button on her pants too.

                                 ANNETTE
                        I think I already have.
           Emphatically, Annette SLAMS the front door with her still 
           inside. She leans her back against the door, closes her eyes, 
           and takes in A DEEP BREATH.

           Dwayne, Cecilia, and Sarah float over to Annette getting 
           closer... closer... and closer.

           And then, just as Annette’s eyes open, and she lets out the 
           first gasp of her breath--

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                 ANNETTE (CONT’D)
                             (whispered, over black)
                        This is my house.
