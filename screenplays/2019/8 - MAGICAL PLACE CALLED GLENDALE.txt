           INT. SOMEONE’S GARAGE - FLASHBACK - NIGHT 

           The door BANGS open and out steps KATE BENCOMO (12), Hapa, a 
           little shit. This won’t necessarily change with age.   

                                 KATE
                        It’s time we get serious here.   
                             (pulling out a bottle)
                        Who’s up for Spin the Bottle?

           A mix of WHOOPS and nervous MURMURS spread through this 
           SEVENTH GRADE PARTY. 

           TITLECARD: Seventh Grade. Palos Verdes, California

           The place is littered with middle school awkwardness. Braces, 
           tall girls, short boys, and slouching. So much slouching. 
           Kate greets every pimply pre-teen like she’s a politician. 
           She even attempts a secret handshake with ONE KID, but they 
           just aren’t in-sync. Whatever!

           She finally spots a girl in the corner who looks like she’s 
           about to bolt -- CHRISTINE BRODEUR (12), a little unsure of 
           herself. This also won’t necessarily change with age.

                           KATE (CONT'D)
           No. No.
                                                        CHRISTINE
                                              I’m not feeling all that well 
                                              from all the Rocky Road. 
           But I ate most of yours!
                                              Tonight’s not the night.

           Kate SIGHS. Grabs Christine’s shoulders. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Christine, what do you want?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        To make my parents proud.

                                 KATE
                        Jesus Christ. You’re such a fucking 
                        Girl Scout.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I am though!

           Kate spins Christine around and points her towards DEVON 
           RUSSEY (12), Black, the runt of the cool kids. 

                                 KATE
                        Do you remember how hot Devon 
                        Russey was in PE after he won at 
                        tetherball? What did you think?
                                 CHRISTINE
                        That I wanted to... lick the sweat 
                        off of him. But only if he wanted. 

           Kate TICKLES Christine. She LAUGHS.

                                 KATE
                        Relax. This will be fun. All you 
                        have to do is sit across from Devon 
                        Russey and the bottle will land on 
                        him. I had Regina rig it. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        What? How?

           REGINA SHOR (12), Black, a child MacGyver, passes by. 

                                 REGINA
                        I put a rock in the bottle.

           Beaming, she pats Christine on the back and moves on. 

                                 KATE
                        See? Now grab Devon and go get your 
                        rocks off. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I don’t necessarily need him for 
                        that, but sure.  

           Christine freezes, now BEET RED. Kate’s genuinely puzzled.

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        I-- no. I’m joking. 

                                 KATE
                        Why wouldn’t you need him...

                                 CHRISTINE
                             (rambling)
                        I do! I don’t do that by myself, 
                        obviously. I’m not like Jeremy, who 
                        clearly can’t stop. I can stop 
                        whenever I want. Not that I do 
                        that. I’m not like Jeremy. It’s...

           Christine awkwardly stops rambling. Kate is still confused. 
           But then the realization hits Kate. Both girls are horrified. 

           INT. SOMEONE'S GARAGE - FLASHBACK - LATER

           Still horror-stricken, Kate and Christine sit next to each 
           other in a circle of kids. The group cheers on Christine. 
           Christine barely pays attention as she SPINS THE BOTTLE. Kate 
           refuses to meet her eye.  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I know I’m gross and perverted. I 
                        know. I don’t do it all the time. 
                             (off Kate’s silence)
                        Please don’t tell anyone. 
                             (more silence)
                        Kate, promise me?

           Kate glances at her as the bottle slows. It passes Regina. 
           Even passes Devon. And then-- It lands on Kate.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. RITA’S HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - DAWN

           Kate Bencomo (now 18) cringes at the memory as she mows a 
           lawn aggressively. 

           TITLECARD: Senior Year. Palos Verdes, California.

           Through her Airpods, Kate increases the volume on “What Makes 
           You Beautiful” by One Direction to distract herself. 

                                 KATE
                             (angry sings)
                        “Don't need make-up to cover 
                        up/Being the way that you are is 
                        enough/Everyone else in the room 
                        can see it/Everyone else but you.”

           MUSIC CUTS OUT for the audience as Kate shout-sings the 
           chorus. RITA ORSON (40s but looks way older) watches this 
           train wreck performance from the porch, completely riveted. 
           Despite being hooked up to a nasal catheter and an oxygen 
           tank, Rita pounds back a Bud Light like a lady.

           That’s when the lawn mower hits a rock, SLAMMING Kate into 
           the handle. She collapses to the ground.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Mother--!

           The engine dies. On the ground, Kate realizes in horror that 
           her white sneakers are smudged.  

                                 RITA
                        White sneakers were a choice. 
                                 KATE 
                        You should really get a gardener or 
                        something. This shit is gross. 

                                 RITA
                        Isn’t that what you’re for?

                                 KATE
                        When I offered my services, I was 
                        expecting to like organize your 
                        closet. Do some inside work. Aren’t 
                        you a hoarder?

           Kate cracks her back dramatically. Joins Rita on the porch.

                                 RITA
                        If you’re not going to mow my lawn, 
                        then I kindly ask you to get the 
                        fuck off my property.  

                                 KATE
                        Aw Rita, I love that neighborly 
                        spirit of yours. 
                             (off Rita’s look)
                        All I’m saying is a heads up would 
                        have been nice. These sneakers were 
                        a thousand dollars. 

                                 RITA
                        For those?!

                                 KATE
                        Relax, I didn’t pay for them.

           Kate helps herself to a beer. 

                                 RITA
                        Shouldn’t you be busy winning Prom 
                        Queen? Or getting pregnant?

                                 KATE
                        One: Did that last year. Two: Did 
                        that last year. 
                             (off Rita’s look)
                        Kidding! I was runner-up.

                                 RITA
                        So what? Helping me is your penance 
                        for coming in second? 

           While Rita’s being playful, the comment unnerves Kate. She 
           grows serious. A haunted look flashes across her face.   
                                 KATE
                        I did something bad last weekend. 

           QUICK FLASH: A BOY (18) that Kate has sex with finishes with 
           an embarrassingly loud MOAN. He’s truly roaring. END FLASH.

           Kate is horrified by the memory. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        It’s maybe the worst thing I’ve 
                        ever done. And trust me, I’ve done 
                        some fucked up shit.  

           QUICK FLASH: From afar, Kate (12) watches Christine (12) open 
           her locker. A DOOR KNOB falls out. Someone coughs out, “Door 
           Knob Humper!” at Christine, prompting passing pre-teens to 
           LAUGH. Another person coughs out, “Pervert.” Devon (12) looks 
           at her, totally grossed out. Christine is CRUSHED. She 
           catches Kate’s eye, completely betrayed. END FLASH. 

           Kate outwardly winces at that one. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        I need to turn this ship around 
                        before--
                             (gestures to the sky)
                        Climate change. 

                                 RITA
                        Huh. And all you had to do was mow 
                        half a lawn? That's incredible. 
                        Hey, maybe I'll mow the other half 
                        and it’ll cure my cancer.

           Kate glares at her. 

           A car pulls up into Rita’s driveway, sending Kate and Rita 
           into a panic. They quickly hide their beers, but it’s too 
           late. JERRI (40s), stern soccer mom, Rita’s hospice nurse, 
           storms out of the car. Kate’s already on the move. 

                                 JERRI
                        Bencomo! You can’t give beer to a 
                        woman with terminal liver cancer! 
                        You are here to help.

                                 KATE
                        I am! She’s dying anyway.

           Jerri SMACKS Kate with a newspaper.
           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAWN

           A beautifully decorated kitchen that was built to frame a 
           1999 Academy Award for Best Directing. Along the walls are 
           signed posters of a YA Blockbuster trilogy -- that’s really 
           what bought this house. 

           A VOICEMAIL currently plays from the landline. 

                                 ANN BENCOMO (VOICEMAIL)
                        Hi honey! Looks like we keep 
                        playing phone tag. Texas has been 
                        fucking insane. I’m seriously 
                        convinced a higher power does not 
                        want me to get this movie made. 

           As the voicemail goes on, Kate stares at the following LIST:

                                 WAYS TO IMPROVE
           1) Help Rita organize her closet??? 
           2) Invite everyone to my parties
           3) Donate (Dogs? Cancer? War?)

                                 ANN BENCOMO (VOICEMAIL)
                        First off, we’ve had to shut down 
                        production three separate times 
                        because of tornadoes. TORDANOES, 
                        KATE! One of them almost got one of 
                        the actors. Could you imagine? 

           ANN BENCOMO (40s), Kate’s amazing mother, CRACKS UP--girl 
           clearly has not had a lot of sleep! Kate shoots the landline 
           a concerned look. Then she goes back to writing. 

           4) Never tell Regina what you did

           Kate pauses on this one. Crosses out the NEVER. Pauses again. 
           Which is better? 

                                 ANN BENCOMO (VOICEMAIL) (CONT'D)
                        Anyway, we have one more day left 
                        and then I’ll be home on Sunday, 
                        but if you need anything, Rita’s 
                        next door. Love you, Kate! Kisses!

           Kate continues writing. 

           4) Never tell Regina what you did, but start doing more nice 
           things for her. Cupcakes?

           5) Christine

           Kate stares at Christine’s name. She crosses it off. 
           EXT. PALOS VERDES HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Home of the Sea Kings. Home of Kate Bencomo. People NOTICE 
           her when she strides down these halls. 

           Her JUNIOR MINIONS fan out behind Kate as they all pass out 
           FLIERS to passing students. People grab them like they’re 
           golden tickets. 

                                 KATE
                        Party tomorrow at my place. Niall 
                        Horan from One Direction is going 
                        to be there. Spread the word.  

                                 JUNIOR MINIONS
                        Spread the word.

           Kate pauses when she reaches a LOCKER. She takes a moment to 
           contemplate, then finally decides to put a flier in the slit.  

           She smiles at this grand gesture, but just as it’s about to 
           fall through--

                                 KATE
                        Fuck. 

           Quickly changing her mind, Kate desperately tries to pull the 
           flier back out. But oops, she’s too late. 

           Regina Shor (now 18) SNORTS from behind her. Yup, she 
           definitely just saw that whole thing. OF NOTE: Regina holds a 
           GOLDFISH IN A BAG. 

                                 REGINA
                        Kate, why are you inviting 
                        Christine Brodeur to your party?

                                 KATE
                             (embarrassed at being 
                              caught)
                        Regina, why do you have a goldfish?

                                 REGINA
                        Oh, this? It’s for the Keep a 
                        Goldfish Alive Scholarship. Winner 
                        gets two grand.

                                 KATE
                        No. That doesn’t exist. 
                                 REGINA
                        There are a lot of bullshit 
                        scholarships no one applies for 
                        because people think they’re too 
                        stupid. Which is perfect for me. 

                                 KATE
                        For the last time, you’re not dumb! 
                        You got into freaking UCLA!

                                 REGINA
                        Any idiot can get into college. 

           This stings Kate, but we don’t know why yet. A GOTH KID 
           passes Kate and takes a flier. Off Regina’s look:

                                 KATE
                        I need fliers because I don’t have 
                        everyone’s numbers. I’m not 
                        psychotic. 

                                 REGINA
                        Then don’t text everyone?

                                 KATE
                        Regina, I’m trying to be inclusive. 
                        Finally let everyone in on the fun.  

                                 REGINA
                        Christine’s not going to go. I 
                        don’t even know why you’re trying. 

                                 KATE
                        I... we don’t know that for sure. 
                        And even so, it’s the thought that 
                        counts. Right?    

                                 REGINA
                        No. 

                                 KATE
                        No, it’s all about the gesture. 

                                 REGINA
                        Absolutely not. She hates you. 

                                 KATE
                        I only told two people she 
                        masturbated! I wasn’t expecting 
                        there’d then be a fucked up game of 
                        Telephone. Door knob humper is 
                        literally so stupid.
                             (then)

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        I just think it’d be nice to do 
                        something nice. 

           Regina shoots her one hell of a look.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Okay, fuck you! I can be nice. I’m 
                        literally planning on making you 
                        cupcakes. At some point.  

                                 REGINA
                        What? Why? Are you okay?

                                 KATE
                        I’m fine! 

                                 REGINA
                        You could just apologize to 
                        Christine, you know.  

           Kate pauses. Visibly sags. 

                                 KATE
                        She wouldn’t want to hear it. 

           Just then, STEVEN WHITE (18), fuckboi, grabs a flier from 
           Kate’s hand. His presence UNNERVES Kate, but it sends Regina 
           into a full-blown frenzy. We’ll recognize him as the BOY Kate 
           had awkward sex with in the opening.

                                 REGINA
                        No, no. Not you, Steven. You’re too 
                        busy fucking Monica FUCKING 
                        Hutcherson to attend any more of 
                        Kate’s parties.

           Steven flees, freaked out. Kate catches Steven’s eye just as 
           he rounds a corner.

                                 REGINA (CONT'D)
                        Go play with your small dick, that 
                        is if you can find it!
                             (to Kate)
                        Sorry, I know I should be over it 
                        by now. I’ll get there.  

           Regina doesn’t notice Kate’s uneasiness.  

           INT. CHRISTINE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Christine Brodeur (now 18) and her young father, JEREMY 
           BRODEUR (late 30s), eat lunch and watch BEVERLY HILLS 90210. 
           Father and daughter are crying at the episode. 
           Her mom, MEGAN BRODEUR (also late 30s), would have been in a 
           sorority if she hadn’t gotten pregnant, comes home early. 
           She’s surprised to see Christine here. 

                                 MEGAN BRODEUR
                        Christine, what are you doing here?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Seniors get to leave school for 
                        lunch. You know that. 

                                 MEGAN BRODEUR
                        Do you come here every day?

           Both Christine and Jeremy are like deer in the headlights. 
           Megan pointedly looks at her husband. 

                                 JEREMY BRODEUR
                        We’ve been honoring Luke Perry’s 
                        memory with a re-watch. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Dad! Have a backbone. 

                                 JEREMY BRODEUR
                        I’m sorry, honey. You know I’m 
                        physically incapable of lying.

                                 MEGAN BRODEUR
                        Christine, go interact with people 
                        your own age. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        School is over in two months. I’ll 
                        just meet people at Stanford.   

                                 MEGAN BRODEUR
                        I met your dad at a party two weeks 
                        before we graduated high school.  

                                 JEREMY BRODEUR
                        The best one night stand I’ve had. 
                             (off Christine’s horror)
                        I’m physically incapable of lying! 
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        My classmates are... How do I put 
                        this mildly? Psychopaths. 

           Megan and Jeremy share a look. 
                                 JEREMY BRODEUR
                        It’s been a couple years since 
                        you’ve found a door knob in your 
                        locker. Perhaps people have 
                        forgotten. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Sad. I was getting a real 
                        collection going. 

                                 MEGAN BRODEUR
                        What about the Robotics Club? 
                        They’re your friends.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Not really. All we talk about is 
                        robotics. And that’s it. We won the 
                        BattleBots competition a month ago 
                        and they’re still making 
                        adjustments to it. We already won! 

                                 MEGAN BRODEUR
                        They’re... dedicated.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I asked Rinaldi what his favorite 
                        movies were and he said AI, 
                        I,Robot, and Wall-E. Come on! 

           Megan pulls Christine up and pushes her towards the door.

                                 MEGAN BRODEUR
                        As your mother--

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I’m calling social services!

                                 MEGAN BRODEUR
                        I’m ordering you to go MINGLE. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Ugh!

           She pushes Christine out the door. Jeremy presses play on 
           Dylan McKay and gets misty-eyed. Megan sighs. 

           INT. CHRISTINE’S CAR/EXT. PV HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Christine pulls into the school parking lot, singing along to 
           “(You’re the) Devil in Disguise” by Elvis. 
           Suddenly, a beautiful creature catches her eye. He’s just run 
           track and he’s so goddamn sweaty. His “RUSSEY” jersey 
           glistens in the sunlight. 

           It’s Devon Russey and boy, did he grow up. 

           Christine’s brain has died.

           OVER TO KATE: She sits in her parked car, putting away 
           leftover fliers. Kate glances up to see Christine’s car 
           headed straight for her. 

           Christine is absolutely not focused on the road. Kate follows 
           Christine’s line of sight to--

           Devon Russey. 

           Pouring water on his head. 

           Like a fucking supermodel.

           Kate panics. Christine’s still driving straight for her.   

                                 KATE
                        Christine! Watch the fucking--

           Christine’s car SLAMS into Kate’s driver side. EVERYONE turns 
           to look, including Devon. He immediately runs over as other 
           people go to get more help. 

           Christine stares at Kate. Both are equally stunned. 

                                 DEVON
                        Woah, woah. Are you guys okay?

           Devon helps both girls out of their cars. Kate nurses her 
           shoulder.  

                                 KATE
                        Fucking ballsack. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I’m so sorry. I guess I wasn’t 
                        paying attention. 

                                 KATE
                        Oh, you were. Just not to me.    

           Christine balks at having been caught. 

                                 DEVON
                        What were you paying attention to?
                                 CHRISTINE
                        A dog. A, uh, hot dog...

           An awkward beat. Christine shifts uncomfortably. 

                                 DEVON
                        Are you sure you’re okay?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Really, I’m--  
                             (off Devon’s stunning 
                              eyes)
                        Ah. 
                             (sudden shift to Kate)
                        Let me see your arm. 

           Christine immediately begins inspecting Kate’s arm. Devon 
           mouths “Is she okay?” to Kate. She nods back. 

                                 KATE
                        It’s fine. I deserved this.

           Devon chuckles as Christine continues her inspection.  

                                 DEVON
                        And why is that? 

                                 KATE
                        You know, Devon Russey, I’ve 
                        sacrificed some virgins over the 
                        years and it didn’t please the Gods 
                        like I had thought-- OW!!!

           Christine POPS Kate’s shoulder back into it’s socket. 

                           DEVON
                                                          KATE (CONT'D)
           Oh my god!
                                              What the fuck?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        My dad and I used to play Airplane 
                        when I was a kid and every time my 
                        arm would pop out of it’s socket. 
                        So I learned how to pop it back in. 

           They just stare at her in silence. Christine’s uncomfortable. 

           INT. NURSE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Shoulder in a sling, Kate fucks around in a wheelchair. She’s 
           clearly not supposed to sit in it. Christine knows it, but 
           doesn’t comment. 
                                 KATE
                        I thought you were squeamish. Do 
                        you remember when I convinced you I 
                        was a robot in a skin suit after we 
                        saw Terminator and I would threaten 
                        to peel back my skin? You were so 
                        freaked out. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Yes. We were twelve. 

           Kate falters. Right. She accidentally rams the wheelchair 
           into the sink. Christine sighs, but holds back her comments. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        I’m going to pay for your car 
                        repairs and any medical bills. So 
                        you know.  

                                 KATE
                        Seriously, it’s chill. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Chill? I hit you with two-tons of 
                        accelerating metal. 

                                 KATE
                        I have money shooting out of my 
                        asshole. We’ll just call this even. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Even? 

                                 KATE
                        Yeah. This is like the universe 
                        balancing itself out. 

           Christine doesn’t respond, trying to contain a growing fury. 
           Kate doesn’t notice, too focused on balancing the wheelchair 
           up on the back of its wheel. Christine forcefully pushes the 
           wheelchair back down. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You’re straining your arm.   

                                 KATE
                        I’m not! It feels fine. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        The nurse is going to walk back in 
                        any minute. 

                                 KATE
                        Buzzkill. 
           They fall into silence. Kate taps the armrest nervously. 
           Finally, she pulls out a crumpled flier. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Hey, you should come to my party 
                        tomorrow night. 
                             (off her silence)
                        I was going to invite you before 
                        the two-tons of accelerating metal 
                        bit. I’m inviting everyone, to 
                        clarify. I’m just trying to do 
                        something nice. For everyone. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        And you thought of me?

                                 KATE
                        Yeah!

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Even though we haven’t spoken a 
                        single word to each other in six 
                        years?

                                 KATE
                        Yeah... 

           Christine clenches her jaw. Kate plays with the wheelchair.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I’m working on something with the 
                        Robotics Club that night. 

                                 KATE
                        On a Saturday night? Didn’t you 
                        guys just win that Battle Robot 
                        thing-a-ma-jig? 
                             (off Christine’s look)
                        I read it in the school paper. 
                             (then)
                        I’m just saying, I know you have 
                        other interests besides that. You 
                        can’t be working all the time. 

           This throws Christine. It’s exactly what she was saying to 
           her parents earlier. Kate pops a wheelie again.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Niall Horan is going to be at my 
                        house. Singing. You don’t want to 
                        miss that. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Who’s that?
                                 KATE
                        From One Direction??? It’s 
                        literally going to be a free One 
                        Direction concert. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Actually, I’ll pay. Would you take 
                        thirty-three door knobs? You know, 
                        so we’re even. 

           Christine SLAMS the wheelchair back to the ground where it 
           belongs. Kate goes quiet.  

           JUST THEN-- a BELL rings from the FRONT OFFICE.  

                                 DEVON (O.S.)
                        Hello? Is anyone here?

           INT. FRONT OFFICE - DAY

           Devon and SAI LAMBA (18), Indian, life of the party, stand at 
           the front desk, which is currently unoccupied. 

           INTERCUT BETWEEN DEVON/SAI AND KATE/CHRISTINE AS NECESSARY:

           Sai is currently texting. 

                                 SAI
                        My dad just found out you’re in the 
                        school musical and he thinks that’s 
                        going to make me gay. 

                                 DEVON
                        Well, my singing does have that 
                        effect on people. 

                                 SAI
                        This is serious, dude. He’s not 
                        going to let me come with you to 
                        Kate’s party tomorrow. 

                                 DEVON
                        Tell him I’m not going anymore. You 
                        can’t miss 1D just because he 
                        thinks we’re fucking. 

           Devon TAPS on the bell. 

                                 DEVON (CONT'D)
                        Hello? Devon and Sai here. 

           Kate’s about to walk out front and say hi, but Christine 
           holds her back. Kate shoots her a questioning look. 
                                 SAI
                        What are we doing here? 

                                 DEVON
                        I’m worried Christine has a head 
                        injury. She could barely speak when 
                        I was there. 

           Christine puts her head in her hands. Great. 

                                 SAI
                        Christine who?

                                 DEVON
                        Brodeur. 

                                 SAI
                        Oh right. Didn’t you have a thing 
                        for her at one point?  

           Kate and Christine freeze. 

                                 DEVON
                        In like seventh grade. And then 
                        something happened with a door 
                        knob? 

           Christine is crushed. So is Kate. 

                                 SAI
                        How’s that even work? Like is she 
                        tall enough to--

           They think about the logistics for a second. 

                                 DEVON
                        It looks like no one’s here. Maybe 
                        they left. 

                                 SAI
                        Do you think I should roll into 
                        oncoming traffic before I go home?

           They exit. The girls are REELING from the news.

           EXT. PALOS VERDES HIGH SCHOOL - AMPHITHEATER - DAY

           Christine storms off. Kate runs after her. 

                                 KATE
                        Christine, wait. That was huge. You 
                        actually had a chance. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        Not anymore. 

                                 KATE
                        If he liked you once, he could like 
                        you again. You gotta go for it. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        No.

                                 KATE
                        Why not? You literally hit me with 
                        your car because you couldn’t take 
                        your eyes off of him. 

           Christine spins on Kate. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You need to stop what you’re doing.

                                 KATE
                        What?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Talking to me like the last six 
                        years didn’t happen. Are you 
                        insane? 

                                 KATE
                             (winks)
                        Clinically. 

           Christine walks away, not in the mood to joke. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Wait, I just-- I can help you. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        What?

                                 KATE
                        We both know my resume shows I’m 
                        expertly qualified here. I’ve dated 
                        five guys in the last three years 
                        and four of them were hot.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Of course you would view that as a 
                        resume. Instead of one that 
                        actually matters. 

                                 KATE
                        This matters. College is a scam, 
                        which is why I didn’t apply.  
           A moment of shock passes across Christine’s face. Then--

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        You can’t ignore this. He liked 
                        you. Something you dreamt about 
                        every day of seventh grade. And it 
                        turns out it was real.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Was!

                                 KATE
                        It could be “is.” Feelings from 
                        seventh grade don’t just change. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Believe me, that is so not true. 

           Christine glares at her POINTEDLY. It stings Kate. 

                                 KATE
                        You’ll always wonder “what if” if 
                        you don’t try.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Helping me now won’t make up for 
                        the fact that you didn’t apologize 
                        when I needed it the most. It’s all 
                        I needed. 

           She leaves Kate to ponder that. 

           QUICK FLASH: Back to Spin the Bottle. The bottle has just 
           landed on Kate. Both girls go beet red as everyone ooh’s. 

                                 REGINA
                        DO IT!!!!!! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

           As everyone chants, the girls turn to each other. END FLASH. 

           INT. RITA’S CAR - DAY

           A pissed Rita drives home Kate. 

                                 RITA
                        I had big plans to bring my TV into 
                        my bathroom and watch Wheel of 
                        Fortune in the bath. Big plans. 

                                 KATE
                        Really sorry me getting hit by a 
                        car has ruined your day.   
                                 RITA
                        I’m just saying, your mom promised 
                        me this would be a hands-off 
                        situation. 

                                 KATE
                        Look, she comes back in two days 
                        and then you can go back to being a 
                        prune-y, drunk asshole. Lucky you.    

           Kate looks out the window. Rita softens. She takes an OLD 
           BABY RUTH out of her bag. Hands it to Kate. 

                                 RITA
                        It’s a couple years old. And 
                        probably not good. 

                                 KATE
                        Thanks. 

           Kate eats it. 

           EXT. RITA’S HOUSE/KATE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Rita pulls into her driveway. Next door, Regina sits on 
           Kate’s stoop, crying. Kate gets out of the car and runs over. 

                                 KATE
                        What happened? 

                                 REGINA
                        Car problems are really going 
                        around today. I was at the gas 
                        station and I had just finished the 
                        Elderly Appreciation Scholarship 
                        where you handcuff yourself to an 
                        elderly person for an afternoon and 
                        write a paper on what you learned. 

                                 KATE
                        What the fuck...?

                                 REGINA
                        I saw there was a cheaper gas at 
                        the gas station.

                                 KATE
                        Oh, no. 
                                 REGINA
                        I put diesel in my mom’s car. I 
                        didn’t know there were two types of 
                        fuel and one of them literally 
                        destroys your car. Why don’t they 
                        tell you that?! 

                                 KATE
                        They... do.  

                                 REGINA
                        Fuck. I’m going to have to use all 
                        my savings for this. My mom’s going 
                        to be so mad. 

                                 KATE
                        I know you don’t want my help, but--

           Regina puts her head on Kate’s good shoulder. 

                                 REGINA
                        This is all I need from you.
                             (then)
                        Do you think this is why Steven 
                        cheated on me? 

           Kate grows very uncomfortable. 

                                 KATE
                        Because of diesel? 

                                 REGINA
                        Because I’m stupid. 

                                 KATE
                        Oh, honey. You’re so not. He 
                        cheated because he’s a piece of 
                        shit with a small dick.  
                             (catches herself)
                        I assume. 
                             (then)
                        You did a stupid thing, but that’s 
                        not who you are. 

                                 REGINA
                        Even when I tried to make my own 
                        poke bowl and ate raw salmon from 
                        Ralphs? 

                                 KATE
                        Honey, you’re making this pep talk 
                        hard for me.  

           Regina laughs through her tears. Kate hugs her.  
           INT. CHRISTINE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Christine and the all male Robotics Club tinker with a BATTLE 
           ROBOT. RINALDI ALVI (17), hyper, somehow got his hands on an 
           energy drink he definitely shouldn’t be drinking. 

                                 RINALDI
                        And what we could do is put wings 
                        on this shit and have her fly. Oh 
                        my god, what if we sent her to 
                        SPACE?! We could do it. We just 
                        need to meet up every night and 
                        find some money for the parts. I 
                        could sell my plasma! Christine, 
                        you could sell your eggs. You don’t 
                        need all of them.  

           Christine’s eyes are wide as fuck.  

           INT. CHRISTINE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Wearing her best party sweater, Christine bounds down the 
           stairs. Stops when she sees her parents holding the car keys, 
           ready to go. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        How did you know? 

                                 MEGAN BRODEUR
                        We were hoping. 

                                 JEREMY BRODEUR
                        We’re so proud of you. Please don’t 
                        get pregnant. Or bring a book. 

           Christine rolls her eyes.  

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           A MASSIVE rager is in full swing at Kate’s house. Niall Horan 
           from One Direction is singing “One Thing” solo. Some kids are 
           doing lines openly. One couple is *possibly* having sex 
           against a wall. 

           A fucked up Kate (who no longer needs an arm brace) and 
           Regina grind on a table at the center of it all. Sai jumps up 
           on the table and grinds against Kate. Nothing sexual. He just 
           wants to talk.  

                                 SAI
                        Kate! Come do a keg stand. 
                                 KATE
                        Don’t you think we’re getting too 
                        old for those, Sai. 

                                 SAI
                        Aw, come on. Everyone wants to see 
                        Ann Bencomo’s kid get wild. 

           A FLASH of annoyance crosses Kate’s face just as Christine 
           enters the party. They catch each other’s eye. Christine’s 
           weirded out by this grind line. 

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER

           Christine pours herself a drink. Sees Devon on the other side 
           of the kitchen getting himself some water. He’s alone. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                             (to herself)
                        Just do it. 

           She doesn’t move. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                             (to herself)
                        Move. Your legs. 
                             (beat)
                        Just one leg. 
                             (beat)
                        Foot?

           Nothing. A JOCK (18) interrupts her dilemma as Regina comes 
           to pour herself a drink. 

                                 JOCK
                        Hey, do I know you? Maybe from like 
                        middle school?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        It doesn’t matter. 

                                 REGINA
                        Christine Brodeur. Hi. I wasn’t 
                        expecting to see you here. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I’m just as surprised.

                                 REGINA
                        I heard what happened. You okay?
                                 JOCK
                        Christine Brodeur. I’ve definitely 
                        heard that name. 
                             (remembers)
                        Oh, right! You were--

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I’m not a door knob humper! Okay? 
                        It was a rumor that some bored, 
                        vapid girls started.  

                                 JOCK
                        I was going to say you were in my 
                        eighth grade Spanish class. 

           Christine nods. Oh right. She quickly rushes out, passing 
           Kate. Mid-Facetime, Kate heads for the back door. 

                                 KATE
                        Hey, what’s up?

           EXT. KATE’S BACKYARD - POOL - CONTINUOUS

           On the other end of the line is Ann Bencomo.

                                 ANN BENCOMO
                        Honey! You look old. 

                                 KATE
                        I look fine!

                                 ANN BENCOMO
                        I’m just saying laugh lines can 
                        become a problem. I have this 
                        amazing cream--

                                 KATE
                        Mom.

                                 ANN BENCOMO
                        Just try it for a week and you’ll 
                        notice a difference.  

           Behind Kate, a NAKED DRAMA KID belly-flops into the pool. 

                                 ANN BENCOMO (CONT'D)
                        Who was that?

                                 KATE
                        My drug dealer. 
                                 ANN BENCOMO
                        Great. 
                             (then)
                        I’m calling because you know that 
                        script I’ve been chasing for the 
                        past year? 

                                 KATE
                        Uh, no?

                                 ANN BENCOMO
                        The guy who was attached to direct 
                        molested some underage girls--
                        shocking--and I’ve been tapped to 
                        step in!

                                 KATE
                        That’s amazing!

                                 ANN BENCOMO
                        I mean, those poor girls...

                                 KATE
                        Of course. 

                                 ANN BENCOMO
                        But this is the kind of project 
                        that could win me another Oscar. 
                        We’re filming in Botswana and I 
                        leave tomorrow! 

           Kate’s face falls. 

                                 KATE
                        Oh. Will you be back for my 
                        graduation? 

                                 ANN BENCOMO
                        Well. I mean, didn’t you say at one 
                        point that you weren’t even going 
                        to go? I thought you said that.

                                 KATE
                        I-- Maybe?

                                 ANN BENCOMO
                        Great. So we’ll both just skip it. 
                        Play hookie. 

           Someone off-screen catches Anne’s attention.

                                 ANN BENCOMO (CONT'D)
                        What? How is there another FUCKING 
                        tornado?! Texas can go fuck itself!
           As Anne freaks out, she doesn’t notice that Kate is 
           completely destroyed.

           INT. KATE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Kate and Steven SLAM into Kate’s room, aggressively kissing.  

                                 STEVEN
                        I thought you said last time was 
                        the last time. 

                                 KATE
                        Shut the fuck up, Steven. 

           She pulls him in for a kiss and grabs his groin.

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Christine reads a BOOK in the bathtub. She stops when she 
           hears MOANING from the room next door. Huh.

           INT. KATE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kate sucks in air to calm herself. She’s clearly pained, but 
           ignores it and pushes Steven onto the bed. 

           She pulls her shirt over her head. Just as it falls to the 
           floor, Kate looks down at Steven, the reality of the 
           situation SLAMMING her in the face. 

           Kate’s now hyperventilating on top of Steven. 

                                 STEVEN
                        Kate? Are you okay?

           She stumbles towards the door. 

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Christine hears the door in the next room OPEN and SLAM shut. 
           Then the bathroom door opens.

           Bra-clad, Kate hastily enters and sits on the floor. She puts 
           her head in her hands. Breathes shakily. 

           Christine clears her throat loudly. Kate jumps. Sees it’s 
           Christine with a book. 

                                 KATE
                        Party animal over here. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        Don’t be a dick, Bencomo. 

           Kate shuts her eyes, close to a full blown panic attack. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Are you okay?

                                 KATE
                        I just need another minute.

           But Kate’s getting worse. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Deep breaths. In and out. In and 
                        out. In and out. 

           Kate tries breathing in and out, but she’s barely taking in 
           air. She’s totally panicked. 

                                 KATE
                        Am I dying? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Kate, watch me breath and follow my 
                        lead. In and out. 

           She tries again, but--

                                 KATE
                        I can’t die an asshole. 

           Kate completely breaks down. Christine’s bewildered by that 
           comment. Studies this broken girl unable to calm herself. 

           Christine picks up her book. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                             (reading)
                        “George's shoulder socked against 
                        the cement of the curb and Dave 
                        Gardener, who had stayed home from 
                        his job at The Shoeboat that day 
                        because of the flood, saw only a 
                        small boy in a yellow rain-slicker, 
                        a small boy who was screaming and 
                        writhing in the gutter with muddy 
                        water surfing over his face and 
                        making his screams sound bubbly. 
                        “Everything down here floats,” that 
                        chuckling, rotten voice whispered, 
                        and suddenly there was a ripping 
                        noise and a flaring sheet of agony, 
                        and George Denbrough knew no more.”
           Christine glances up. Kate’s understandably horrified.

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        I find Steven King calming. 

                                 KATE
                        Continue. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                             (reading)
                        “Dave Gardener was the first to get 
                        there, and although he arrived only 
                        forty-five seconds after the first 
                        scream, George Denbrough was 
                        already dead.” 

           Kate smiles.

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER

           Now wearing Christine’s sweater, Kate sits closer to the 
           bathtub. The girls are mid-debate, laughing as they argue.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Palos Verdes is a swirling cesspool 
                        of unhinged wealth and privilege. 
                        How can you like this place? 

                                 KATE
                        There’s so much to do! You’ve got 
                        tide pools and lighthouses--

                                 CHRISTINE
                        --and surf gangs made up of rich 
                        white people and--

                        CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                                                          KATE
           Trump Golf Course.
                                              Trump Golf Course.

           Christine is horrified. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        It’s a good golf course! 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Kate, you are-- You are--

                                 KATE
                        --someone who leaves people 
                        speechless. I have that effect. 

           They lock eyes for a split second. 
                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Where do you like to go, Master of 
                        Travel? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Glendale. 

                                 KATE
                        No one goes to Glendale on purpose. 
                        No one. Glendale is what happens 
                        when you get off the wrong exit. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Don’t be a dick. 

                                 KATE
                        How did you even find it? 

           Christine says nothing. Kate throws her hands up in triumph. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        It’s so cute. They have a mall--

                                 KATE
                        Oh wow.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        They have this roller rink, 
                        Moonlight Rollerway, my parents 
                        take me to that brings out a slew 
                        of weird people. Almost everyone is 
                        bad, so it’s easy to fit in. I 
                        always forget my problems there.

           A beat as Kate takes this in. 

                                 KATE
                        Right, but they filmed part of The 
                        OC in Palos Verdes, so--

                                 CHRISTINE
                             (laughing)
                        Screw you. 

           They lock eyes, both alight with the passion of debate. Then 
           Kate grows very serious.

                                 KATE
                        I’m so sorry. 

           Christine takes this in, unsure if it’s genuine. But Kate 
           looks really fucking sorry. 
           Just then, the door SLAMS open. It’s Devon, who stops 
           abruptly when he sees Kate and Christine.

                                 DEVON
                        Oh, sorry. Is it cool if I wash my 
                        hands real quick? I spilled 
                        cranberry juice all over them. 

                                 KATE
                        Yeah, go for it. 

           He goes to the sink. Christine is very quiet.

                                 DEVON
                             (to Christine)
                        How’s the head?  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Cool. It’s cool. 

           Kate shoots Christine an exasperated look. 

                                 KATE
                             (to Devon)
                        You were really our knight in 
                        shining armor. 

                                 DEVON
                        Nah, I just kinda stood there. 
                        Christine was the real hero.
                             (to Christine)
                        You should be a doctor. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Okay. 
                             (catches herself)
                        I, uh-- No, I don’t know what I’m 
                        saying. Blood is-- No. I’ve been 
                        dreaming about working at NASA 
                        since I was five.  

                                 DEVON
                        Dig the passion. Maybe I’ll see you 
                        lift off one day. 

           He throws her a breathtaking smile like it’s nothing. Exits. 
           Christine looks at Kate like she can’t believe that happened. 

           EXT. KATE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Rager still going, Kate waits with Christine on the lawn. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        My mom should be here soon.

                                 KATE
                        Great. 
                             (off her silence)
                        For what it’s worth, I think you 
                        have a chance with Devon. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I might. 

                                 KATE
                        You should go for it. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I might. 

           The short replies are killing Kate. 

                                 KATE
                        But I think it would be really 
                        shortsighted of you to not take my 
                        help because I know I’m an asshole, 
                        but I’m also really good at helping 
                        and I can be better than I was.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Kate.

                                 KATE
                        I can’t guarantee it’ll work, but I 
                        can at least open the door for you. 
                        Please let me open the door.

           Christine takes a beat to think it over.  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        It might be a little sticky. 
                             (off Kate’s confusion)
                        When you open the door. The door 
                        knob might be a little sticky. 

           She winks at Kate, who BURSTS into a wide smile.  

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        What else am I doing anyway?

                                 KATE
                        Yes! Let’s make Devon our bitch!

           Kate high-fives Christine.
           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAWN

           Kate stands in the living room the next morning, unsure what 
           to do with herself. She dials a number. It rings. Then--

                                 ANN BENCOMO (VOICEMAIL)
                        You’ve reached the voicemail of 
                        director Ann Bencomo. If this is a 
                        press inquiry--

           Kate hangs up. 

           INT. RITA’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAWN

           Rita enters to find Kate making pancakes and listening to 
           some dumb pop song. 

                                 RITA
                        How the fuck did you get in here?

                                 KATE
                        I broke in.

                                 RITA
                        Either mow the rest of my lawn or 
                        get out. 

                                 KATE
                        But I’m making pancakes. 

                                 RITA
                        I’m not in a pancake mood.

                                 KATE
                        You’re being confrontational for no 
                        reason. Everyone is in a pancake 
                        mood in the morning. Even your rat.

           Next to Kate is an ugly looking rat dog thing, FLIPPER (18-
           years-old, the same age as Kate). Kate feeds him a pancake.  

                                 RITA
                        Flipper’s not a rat!

                                 KATE
                        That seems wrong...

           Jerri enters the kitchen, but she’s on her way out. She stops 
           when she sees Kate.

                                 JERRI
                        Kate.
                                 KATE
                        I didn’t bring beer. I’m just 
                        making pancakes. 

                                 JERRI
                             (ignoring her)
                        Medicine, Rita. 

                                 RITA
                        I know!

           Rita takes her medicine as Jerri exits. 

                                 RITA (CONT'D)
                        Your mom sent me your medical 
                        records last night, which I thought 
                        was a pretty bold move of her if 
                        I’m being frank here. 

                                 KATE
                        Yeah, she doesn’t really ask. She 
                        kind of just does.  

                                 RITA
                        I’m not good with kids. So if you 
                        could just handle your own shit. 
                        Maybe go to the dentist finally. 
                        Your file says it’s been six years. 

                                 KATE
                        Is that long? 

                                 RITA
                        Yes. 

                                 KATE
                        That seems wrong...

                                 RITA
                        There’s a reason I have Flipper 
                        instead of kids. 

           The mole rat dog eats the pancake in a very unattractive way. 

                                 KATE
                        I know. Kids are the worst. 
                             (realizing)
                        Hey, maybe I should get a dog too! 
                        But like a real one. 

           Rita SIGHS loudly. 
           INT. KATE’S CLOSET - DAY

           As Kate and Regina walk over to sit on the sofa (yeah, that’s 
           how big this closet is), Kate pauses in front of Christine. 

                                 KATE
                        Thanks for coming. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Thanks for doing this. 

           Kate smiles and then sits with Regina. They take her in and 
           whisper to each other. Christine is wearing a sweater that’s 
           kind of just fine. She squirms under the scrutiny. 

                                 KATE
                        You wear a lot of sweaters, huh?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Yes. 

                                 REGINA
                        But we live in Los Angeles?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Yes?

                                 KATE
                        I was looking for your Instagram, 
                        but I couldn’t find it. Do you have 
                        it on private or something?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I don’t have Instagram.

           The girls throw up their hands horror.  

                                 REGINA
                        How are we going to do this? The 
                        pool party is in a week!

                                 CHRISTINE
                             (horrified)
                        What does that have to do with 
                        Instagram?

                                 KATE AND REGINA
                        Everything.

           There’s a COMMOTION coming from downstairs. Christine hears 
           the front door open. People laughing. Someone WHOOPS. Regina 
           and Kate don’t react to it. 
                                 REGINA
                        The number one way guys ask out 
                        girls is on Instagram. You’re going 
                        to need one before he sees you at 
                        the pool party.   

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Why wouldn’t he ask me out in 
                        person?

                                 KATE
                        Because it’s 2019 and everything is 
                        terrible. You have to up your 
                        online cred to up your in-person 
                        cred. Does that make sense?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        From a psychotic perspective. 

           MUSIC starts playing downstairs. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Are there people here? 

                                 KATE
                        Oh, yeah. I kinda have an open door 
                        policy on weekends for anyone who 
                        wants to do coke in a safe place.
                             (off Christine’s look)
                        Kidding. We’re too old for coke. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                             (ignoring this)
                        Did the guy you were with last 
                        night ask you out on Instagram?

                                 REGINA
                        What guy?

                                 KATE
                        I-- um. You’re thinking of someone 
                        else. I feel like I saw Simone 
                        hooking up with Jasper...

           Christine picks up the deflection, but doesn’t comment on it.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        So how do we... up my online cred?

           Off Kate’s smile.
           EXT. KATE’S BACKYARD - POOL - DAY

           Now wearing a fly outfit, Christine poses in Kate’s sick 
           backyard. Regina’s snapping photos on her phone. A small 
           party in the house can be heard. 

                                 REGINA
                        Try sexy.

           Christine “tries sexy.” It’s awkward. 

                                 REGINA (CONT'D)
                        Okay. Try sexy this time. 

           She does another awkward pose. Kate shakes her head. 
           Christine’s getting more anxious with each photo taken.  

                                 KATE
                        So Brodeur, Star Wars kind of 
                        sucks, huh?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Are you trying to be funny here? 
                        It’s a classic. 

                                 KATE
                        Just because it’s a classic doesn’t 
                        automatically mean it’s good. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        The special effects were 
                        revolutionary for the time. 

                                 KATE
                        Still sucks. 

           Christine shoots her a LOOK. Regina snaps a picture. 

           Kate pulls Christine’s shirt just off her shoulder. Christine 
           shrugs her shoulders up in response. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Stop. None of this is me.  

                                 KATE
                        We’re just trying to get a hot 
                        photo here. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Why are you trying to change me?

                                 KATE
                        I’m not. You are hot. 
           Christine BLUSHES. So does Kate.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I-- no. I mean. I have other good 
                        qualities. It’s just-- 
                             (then)
                        We need to do different kinds of 
                        photos. I don’t want people to see 
                        me like this.

                                 KATE
                        Like what? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Like I’m some kind of pervert!

           She’s surprised by her own admission. Regina comes up and 
           shows Christine the photos she just took. She got some good 
           sexy/angry photos from that Star Wars argument. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Oh, these are actually quite good. 

                                 KATE
                        See? Super not perverted of you.   
                             (then)
                        Just kidding about Star Wars by the 
                        way. I’ve never seen it. 

           Christine is horrified. 

           EXT. RITA’S FRONT LAWN - DAY

           Kate finishes mowing the other half of Rita’s lawn. Then she 
           looks at Instagram. Christine’s photo has sixty likes.

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - FOYER - LATER

           Kate opens the door, not looking up from her phone. 

                                 KATE
                        You got sixty likes, none of which 
                        are from Devon. I just shared it on 
                        my account so hopefully by the end 
                        of the day--

           She looks up at Christine, who’s wearing a lot of make-up. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Ah. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        What?

           INT. KATE’S ROOM - DAY

           Sitting on the floor, Kate uses a make-up wipe to clean 
           Christine’s face. Christine’s eyes are closed. 

                                 KATE
                        Less is more. You can’t look like 
                        you’re trying too hard.

           Kate pauses, having a surprising amount of trouble focusing 
           on her task while this close to Christine’s face. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        What?

                                 KATE
                        Um. You’re-- Stanford. You excited?

           Kate now begins applying a light amount of make-up.  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I can’t wait. I always knew that 
                        I’d thrive once I got out of here. 
                        You get to pick what you want to 
                        study. You get to pick your friends 
                        and there’s no reputation you have 
                        to worry about.
                             (off Kate’s silence)
                        What?

                                 KATE
                        Don’t take this the wrong way, but 
                        you’re the one giving your 
                        reputation all the power. I 
                        guarantee no one would care as much 
                        if you stopped fixating on it. You 
                        are so much more than a door knob 
                        humper. Again, it’s so stupid. 

           Christine opens her eyes. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        “Don’t be a dick, Bencomo.” I know, 
                        I know.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        No. I think I agree with you. 

                                 KATE
                        Call the presses. 
           They lock eyes.

           QUICK FLASH: Back to Spin the Bottle. Cheering from the other 
           seventh graders eggs on Christine, who nervously leans 
           towards Kate. END FLASH.

           Oh, they definitely both remember that. Christine quickly 
           closes her eyes for Kate to continue applying make-up. Kate 
           lets out a breath she didn’t know she was holding. The fuck?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        So, uh. I’m surprised you didn’t 
                        apply anywhere. I feel like you’d 
                        want to at least join a sorority. 

                                 KATE
                        You really do think poorly of me! 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You’re a little basic. 

                                 KATE
                        This honesty is refreshing and does 
                        not hurt at all. 

           Christine LAUGHS. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        I’ll be busy traveling the world 
                        telling tales of your great love 
                        story with Devon Russey. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Nice deflection.

                                 KATE
                        I-- uh. What?  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You deflect when someone asks you a 
                        personal question. 

                                 KATE
                        I don’t do that. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Is that so? Then who’s that mystery 
                        man from the party? 
                             (off Kate’s silence)
                        I was in the bathroom one room 
                        over. I heard. 

           Christine opens her eyes as Kate flushes in embarrassment. 
                                 KATE
                        I-- It was-- You don’t-- I just-- 
                             (off Christine’s smile)
                        Why are you smiling?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I’ve never seen you be awkward. 
                        Good to know you’re human. And not, 
                        you know, a robot in a skin suit.  

           Kate lightly chuckles. They lock eyes again. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        How does my make-up look?

                                 KATE
                        You’re ready.

           EXT. KATE’S BACKYARD - POOL - DAY

           Everyone is at this party. A mini Bellagio-style fountain is 
           at the center. Two CHEFS prepare burgers-- a sign next to it 
           reads “Weed Burgers.” Just your standard high school party.

           Christine is wildly uncomfortable. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You two don’t know this about me, 
                        but I have a bit of crippling 
                        social anxiety. 

                                 REGINA
                        You? No. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Maybe we should have focused more 
                        on my shit personality before we 
                        came here, huh?

           Regina grabs Christine’s shoulders. 

                                 REGINA
                        Repeat after me: I am worthy.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I am worthy.

                                 REGINA
                        Devon and I belong together. 

                                 KATE
                        We don’t quite know that yet...
                                 REGINA
                        Kate, Jesus Christ. 
                             (to Christine)
                        You and Devon Russey are fated for 
                        each other. You’ve been dancing 
                        around each other since you were 
                        twelve. That’s so freaking cute I 
                        want to vomit. So go out there and 
                        get your soulmate’s dick. 

           Christine’s a little freaked out. Kate stands on a chair to 
           make an announcement. 

                                 KATE
                        Swines! This is Christine Brodeur. 

                                 SOMEONE IN THE CROWD
                             (coughs loudly)
                        Door knob humper.

           Some people GIGGLE. Christine is dying.  

                                 KATE
                        You might remember Christine as 
                        that whip-smart movie buff who sits 
                        at the front of a math class or 
                        two. Well, she’s also a beer pong 
                        champion. So, we will be at the 
                        beer pong table if anyone dares 
                        play us. 

           Murmurs spread throughout the crowd. Christine is horrified. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I’ve never played beer pong.

                                 KATE
                        But you drink, right?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I get wine drunk with my parents 
                        when we’re trying to be classy.   

           A bare-chested Devon passes by. Christine is unwell. She 
           takes Kate’s drink and DOWNS it. 

           EXT. KATE’S BACKYARD - LAWN - LATER

           Kate and Christine wait for any takers as a crowd gathers 
           around the beer pong table. Devon and Sai approach. 

                                 DEVON
                        Beer pong champion, huh? 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        Yes. 

           Kate waits for her to say something else. She doesn’t. 

                                 KATE
                        Christine has this unique ability 
                        where she only gets better the 
                        drunker she gets. It’s pretty 
                        fucking spectacular to watch. 

                                 SAI
                        Alright, we’ll play you. 

           Sai steps up. Kate turns to Christine. 

                                 KATE
                        You have to say something when 
                        people talk to you.  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I know. I know. I will. 

           We think Devon is going to be Sai’s partner, but someone 
           weaves through the crowd. It’s MONICA HUTCHERSON (18). 

                                 REGINA
                        What is Monica FUCKING Hutcherson 
                        doing here?

                                 MONICA HUTCHERSON
                        That’s not my middle name. 

                                 REGINA
                             (pointedly ignoring her)
                        Christine. Beat. Her. ASS. 

           Kate throws and makes it. Christine picks up her ball. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                             (to Sai and Monica)
                        You two are going down like a 
                        frowny. Face. Clown.

           Kate stares at her, wide-eyed, as Christine shoots and 
           misses. Devon is intently watching.

                                 DEVON
                        Champions, I see. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        We are. I learned from the best. 

           Monica’s about to throw. 
                                 REGINA
                        Hey batta batta. 
                             (off Monica’s miss)
                        Swing, and a miss from the whore to 
                        the right. 

                                 KATE
                        Regina. 

                                 REGINA
                        What? I didn’t say anything that 
                        wasn’t true. 

                                 MONICA HUTCHERSON
                        You are so dumb if you think this 
                        was entirely my fault.  

                                 REGINA
                        What did you just call me, Monica 
                        FUCKING--

                                 MONICA HUTCHERSON
                        My middle name is Elaine!

                                 REGINA
                        --FUCKING Hutcherson!

           Kate pulls Regina towards the house. When they’re out of 
           sight, Sai makes his shot. Christine drinks a beer and gags. 
           It’s gross. Devon gives her a suspicious look. 

                                 DEVON
                        Learned from the best, huh?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Yes. Um. Seth Rogen taught me.

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN

           Kate waits for an unsettled Regina to speak first. 

                                 REGINA
                        Look, I know I’m being unfair. You 
                        shouldn’t slut-shame, especially 
                        when he’s so much at fault for what 
                        happened. When I see him, I just 
                        want to plunk out all his eyebrows. 
                             (crying)
                        I loved him. How could he do that?
                             (trying to compose 
                              herself)
                        I can’t put all my anger on Monica. 
                                 KATE
                        She deserves some of it. But I 
                        wouldn’t recommend yelling at her 
                        in public. 

                                 REGINA
                        How rational and logical of you.

           Regina gives a little laugh. So does Kate, but it’s hollow.

           EXT. KATE’S BACKYARD - LAWN

           Kate and Regina come back outside just as Sai lands his fifth 
           cup. Christine drinks it. Then goes back to her story. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        So we get there and Seth Rogen 
                        approaches me and he says, “Hey. 
                        You. Be my partner.” So we beer 
                        pong it and he shows me some moves. 
                        But it was awkward because I’ve 
                        never seen his movies. I’m more 
                        versed in Hitchcock and Godard. 

                                 KATE
                        Oh my god. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Kate. This beer is odd.  

           Kate sees Christine’s neck is starting to break out in hives. 

                                 KATE
                        Are you allergic to beer?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I don’t know, but maybe get some 
                        Benadryl. My throat is closing up. 

                                 KATE
                        What? I don’t have any! 

                                 CHRISTINE
                             (barely audible)
                        Of course not, you perfect robot.  

           Christine gasps for air. The crowd freaks as Devon runs away.  

                                 MONICA
                        Someone call 911!
           Christine turns red. Just then, Devon parts through the crowd 
           with an EPI-PEN and charges at Christine. He SLAMS the needle 
           into her thigh like a goddamn knight in shining armor. 

           Christine GASPS in a huge breath of air. 

                                 DEVON
                        Thank god I’m allergic to 
                        everything, huh? 

           Christine makes an odd noise of approval. Without anyone 
           paying attention, Regina shoves Monica in the pool.

           INT. HOSPITAL - CHRISTINE’S ROOM - DAY

           Christine’s perched in her bed, watching something on the 
           hospital TV. A knock gets her attention. It’s Kate.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Hi. 

                                 KATE
                        Hi. I got you something. 

           Kate hands her the bag. As Christine opens it--

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        I was going to get you chocolate, 
                        but I wasn’t sure if you were 
                        allergic to that. So I Googled what 
                        foods no one could be allergic to. 

           It’s a bottle of water and a container of salt. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        It was a surprisingly small list. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Thank you. 
                             (then)
                        So that was a bust, huh?

                                 KATE
                        What do you mean? You got his 
                        attention. On Monday you can thank 
                        him for being your knight in 
                        shining armor. What a great 
                        conversation opener. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        Opener. But then what? I don’t know 
                        how to talk to him without saying 
                        something really stupid. I’m not 
                        like you. 

                                 KATE
                        Then fake it. Act like you have 
                        confidence and then you will. It’s 
                        what I do when I’m nervous. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Like you have anything to be 
                        nervous about. You’re beautiful. 

           Kate blushes. Quickly looks for something else to say.   

                                 KATE
                        On the bright side, this has 
                        probably made people forget about 
                        the whole masturbation thing. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        What’s so stupid is that 
                        masturbation is very normal! What 
                        backwards society do we live in 
                        where everyone can talk about male 
                        masturbation, but not female 
                        masturbation. 
                             (off Kate’s discomfort)
                        Kate, how are you still 
                        uncomfortable with it? 
                             (realizes)
                        You haven’t masturbated?! But you 
                        have sex! With people! How do you 
                        even know what you like if you 
                        haven’t touched yourself?

           Kate stands abruptly.  

                                 KATE
                        I should go. I have homework. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                             (pulling out her phone)
                        You sure do. I’m buying you a 
                        vibrator right now. 

                                 KATE
                        Christine, no.

           She lunges for her phone as Christine fends her off. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        I’m just being a good friend!

           Kate falls on Christine and RIPS the phone away. 

                                 KATE
                        Not today, bitch! 

           Kate’s breath halts. They’re inches away. 

           QUICK FLASH: Back to Spin the Bottle. Kate and Christine are 
           about to kiss, but just before they do, Kate BOLTS up, 
           freaked the fuck out. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        This is a childish game. Let’s just 
                        get drunk like adults.  

           Off Christine, upset. END FLASH.

           Yup, they both haven’t forgotten that one. Kate quickly gets 
           off her while Christine clears her throat. 

           Moment gone, Kate glances at Christine’s phone.  

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Holy shit. Devon liked your photo.

           Christine pulls back her phone to check. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        What does this mean?

                                 KATE
                        We have some momentum.

           BEGIN QUICK CUTS:

           1. EXT. PALOS VERDES HIGH SCHOOL - AMPITHEATER - NIGHT

           Devon, as Rafiki, opens Palos Verdes High School’s rendition 
           of LION KING with “Circle of Life.”

                                 DEVON (AS RAFIKI)
                        “Nants ingonyama bagithi baba!”

           Kate, Christine, and Regina stare, wide-eyed. He’s an 
           incredible singer, but man is this intense. 

                                 KATE
                             (to Christine)
                        I just want you to think of this 
                        image when he goes down on you. 
           Christine BLUSHES. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        You will compliment him on this. 

           Christine nods back as Devon continues singing. 

           In the crowd, SAI’S FATHER (50s) watches Sai’s reaction like 
           a HAWK, looking of any signs of gayness. Sai’s freaked out. 

           2. EXT. PALOS VERDES HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER

           Christine and Regina walk to class. As they pass Devon-- 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Hey, you were great as Rafiki. 

                                 DEVON
                        Thank you! 

           3. INT. HISTORY CLASS - DAY

           Kate gets a text from Christine. 

           Christine: I did it! 

           Kate: Way to go, Rafiki-fucker!

           Christine: I’m deleting your number.

           4. INT. MATH CLASS - DAY

           Christine and Regina sit down, mid-convo as Christine stares 
           at her phone. Regina is showing Christine her DUCK WHISTLE. 

                                 REGINA
                        This bad boy took me five tries 
                        with a grand total of fifty-eight 
                        hours to complete. 

           Kate: Would your kid be Rafiki Jr. or

                                 REGINA (CONT'D)
                        I’m going to a pond after school. 
                        Need to prove to the Duck Whistle 
                        Scholarship that it works. 

           Christine: Excuse me, he’d be Christine Jr. 

                                 REGINA (CONT'D)
                        Christine! Pay attention. 
           5. INT. HISTORY CLASS - DAY

           Kate smiles at Christine’s last text. The HISTORY TEACHER 
           (40s) is mid-lecture. Devon walks into class.

                                 HISTORY TEACHER
                        Devon, what did I tell you? This is 
                        the tenth time you’ve been tardy. 
                        You know my rule. Detention.

                                 DEVON
                        What the hell!

                                 HISTORY TEACHER
                        Cursing won’t help your case. 

           6. INT. MATH CLASS - DAY

           As the MATH TEACHER (30s) prattles on, Christine sneakily 
           glances at her phone. 

           Kate: Devon just got detention! This is your PERFECT 
           opportunity

           Christine sits back, pondering the idea. She’s unsure. 

           Kate: One detention won’t fuck up your future

           Kate: But one detention could get you fucked in the future

           Kate: [WATER DROP EMOJI] [TONGUE EMOJI]

           Christine nods. She can’t argue with that logic. She scans 
           the classroom. Spots Regina’s Duck Whistle.

           Christine picks it up. Just as she’s about to blow--

           END QUICK CUTS.

           EXT. POND - DAY

           Regina BLOWS on it. She’s at a POND with Kate, testing out 
           that Duck Whistle. Regina BLOWS again. They wait. 

           No ducks. 

                                 KATE
                        Maybe they died.  

           Regina shoots her a LOOK as Christine runs up to them. 
                                 REGINA
                        Christine! How was detention?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I think I did it. 

           INT. HISTORY CLASS - FLASHBACK - DAY 

           Christine and Devon silently write lines on a whiteboard as 
           the History Teacher does work. She’s faced away from them. 

           Christine glances over at Devon. He’s bored out of his mind. 

           She taps on the board to get Devon’s attention. He looks over 
           and sees a HANGMAN GAME on her side of the whiteboard. One 
           four letter word followed by one five letter word. 

           Devon smiles. Writes “O” on his side of the white board. 
           Christine draws a circle for the head of the hangman and puts 
           an “O” in the corner. He got it wrong. 

           Devon writes “I.” He got it right. Christine writes it in.

           They go back and forth like this until Devon has guessed the 
           word. It spells out I HATE THIS.

           Devon lightly laughs. Then stops to see if the History 
           Teacher heard. She didn’t, so Devon draws his own Hangman. 

           Christine’s guessing letters left and right until it spells 
           out KILL ME. Christine chuckles.  

           After this, they stop with the game and just start writing on 
           the board. 

           Christine: WISH I HAD AN ALLERGY ATTACK NOW.

           Devon: WOULDN’T BE ABLE TO SAVE YOU THIS TIME.

           Christine: COME TO MY FUNERAL?

           Devon: ONLY IF SETH ROGEN IS THERE.

           Christine chuckles. Then pauses to debate something. Then-- 

           Christine: GOING TO KATE’S PARTY ON SATURDAY? 

           Devon: YES.

           Christine: WILL I SEE YOU THERE?
           EXT. POND - DAY

           Back to the previous conversation.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        And he said yes!

                                 REGINA
                        WHAT?! Oh my fucking god! What did 
                        I fucking tell you about fate, 
                        dude? Yes!

           As the girls jump up and down with joy, Kate is suddenly not 
           in the mood to celebrate. 

           A duck QUACKS next to them. They’re not dead!

           INT. RITA’S CAR - DAY

           Rita drives a pissed off Kate. She’s mid-rant. 

                                 KATE
                        The thing with Devon is that he’s 
                        kind of a selfish prick. He’s a 
                        track star AND a musical prodigy? 
                        Like COME THE FUCK ON. Pick one! 
                        You can’t be all these things. Give 
                        someone else a chance here.  

                                 RITA
                        And she’d definitely be dating up. 
                        It’s not a good idea to date up. 

                                 KATE
                        Are you for real?

                                 RITA
                        From the photos you’ve showed me, 
                        he looks like a Ken doll. 

                                 KATE
                        Exactly. He’s basically 
                        cauliflower. She’s at least unique.

                                 RITA
                        You’re very upset for someone who 
                        succeeded in helping this girl. 

           Before Kate can respond, she realizes something is off. 

                                 KATE
                        Wait, isn’t the mall on Beverly? 
                                 RITA
                        Is it?

           Rita pulls up to a DENIST’S OFFICE. 

                                 KATE
                        No! You can’t make me! What the fu--

           INT. DENTIST’S OFFICE - RECEPTION - DAY

           Rita reads a magazine. A DENTAL HYGENIST (30s) enters. 

                                 DENTAL HYGENIST
                        You’re good to come back. 

                                 RITA
                        What? No, I’m not--

                                 DENTAL HYGENIST
                        She’s asking for you. 

           INT. DENTIST’S OFFICE - EXAM ROOM - DAY

           Rita enters to see Kate in the dentist’s chair. The DENTIST 
           (50s) is preparing something in the corner. 

                                 RITA
                        You interrupted a thrilling article 
                        about celebrity babies.  

           But Kate isn’t listening. She’s totally freaked out. 

                                 RITA (CONT'D)
                        Kate? 

                                 KATE
                        I have some cavities. 

                                 DENTIST
                        Twelve to be exact. I’ve never seen 
                        this many in someone of her age and 
                        affluence. Truly stunning stuff. 

           He flicks a GIGANTIC needle in preparation. Kate goes white. 

                                 RITA
                        Woah, woah. What are you doing?

                                 DENTIST
                        It’s Novocaine. She’s going to need 
                        it if we’re going to get them all. 
                             (to Kate)
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DENTIST (CONT'D)
                                 DENTIST (CONT'D)
                        This isn’t going to be a fun 
                        procedure, but we wouldn’t be here 
                        if you had come in earlier. I know 
                        candy and drugs are fun, but you 
                        should be taking care of yourself. 

           Kate looks away. She’s trying not to cry. Rita notices. 

                                 RITA
                        Are you a therapist? 

                                 DENTIST
                        No. I’m a dentist. 

                                 RITA
                        Exactly. Maybe re-think your place 
                        next time you give out judgmental 
                        life advice to a child you don’t 
                        know and don’t have an relationship 
                        with, you dickless piece of shit.  
                             (off his stunned silence)
                        Now, do what we’re paying you to do 
                        and fix her mouth. And button your 
                        shirt correctly. You’re an adult. 

           Rita sits down next to Kate, who is moved by Rita’s outburst. 
           The Dentist fixes his buttons. 

                                 DENTIST
                        My apologies if I offended. 
                             (RE: the needle)
                        You’ll only feel a pinch. 

           He puts the needle in her mouth. Kate grabs Rita’s hand. 

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kate has gauze in her mouth. She prepares for a sleepover, 
           putting out snacks, queuing up High School Musical.

           Her phone vibrates. Kate sees who it is and picks it up. 

                                 KATE
                             (singing in phone)
                        “I’m soaring! Flying! There’s not a 
                        star in Heaven that we can’t 
                        reach!”
                             (talking in phone)
                        Just a quick spoiler from the best 
                        movie ever: High School Musical.  

           She’s cut off when she hears an argument. 
                                 CHRISTINE (O.S.)
                        Mom, you can’t have it both ways. 

                                 MEGAN BRODEUR (O.S.)
                        I want you to go out and have fun. 
                        But in the past couple weeks you’ve 
                        been hospitalized and gotten 
                        detention. I’m right to be worried. 

                                 KATE
                        Yo! Think you butt dialed m-- 

                                 CHRISTINE (O.S.)
                        So you won’t be happy until I’m 
                        socializing, but not too much? 

                                 MEGAN BRODEUR (O.S.)
                        I wasn’t expecting you to hang out 
                        with the girl who broke your heart.

           Kate’s face falls. 

           INT. MEGAN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Megan drives Christine. Christine’s phone is sticking out of 
           her butt pocket, currently mid-call with Kate. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        That’s an over-exaggeration. 

                                 MEGAN BRODEUR
                        You listened to the Prisoner of 
                        Azkaban audiobook on repeat for a 
                        year straight. You didn’t even move 
                        on to the next one.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        It’s not as magical. 

                                 MEGAN BRODEUR
                        Don’t let her hurt you again.  

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kate hangs up, unable to listen to the rest.  

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kate, Christine, and Regina watch High School Musical. 
           Christine is in pain. Kate’s zoned out, gauze now out of her 
           mouth. Regina is typing a paper on her computer. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        This is trash. I can’t believe I 
                        let you guys talk me into this. 

           Kate doesn’t respond. She’s lost in thought.

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Kate? 
                             (off her silence)
                        Are you okay?

                                 KATE
                        Fine.

           Regina’s clacking away at her computer. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Am I the only one watching this? 
                        Because if so, we’re changing it to 
                        Vertigo like I wanted. 

                                 REGINA
                        Oh, sorry. This is due tonight. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        What is it?

                                 REGINA
                        It’s for the Superhero Scholarship. 
                        You write a paper on someone who 
                        inspires you. 

                                 KATE
                        Who are you doing? 

                                 REGINA
                        No one. 

           Now Christine and Kate are really interested. They look like 
           they’re about to pounce on this computer. Just as they do, 
           Regina JUMPS away with her computer, now standing. 

                                 REGINA (CONT'D)
                        I knew you fuckers were going to be 
                        like this! I’m going home so I can 
                        finish this in PEACE. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Come on. We’ll be good.  

                          REGINA
                                                          KATE
           Kate won’t be.
                                              I won’t be.

           Regina and Kate LAUGH. They know each other so well. 
                                 REGINA (CONT'D)
                        Don’t make me regret writing this 
                        about you. 

           Kate’s face falls. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        That’s so cute. 

                                 REGINA
                        Yeah, well. Best friends are 
                        inspiring or whatever. 
                             (to Kate)
                        Steven, of course, was a close 
                        second, so don’t get too high on 
                        your horse here. And no, you’re 
                        never reading it. Telling you this 
                        information is all I’m giving you. 
                             (to both of them)
                        Goodnight fools.

           Christine laughs as Regina leaves the house. Kate is 
           completely destroyed. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Kate? 

           Kate runs out of the room.

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Kate rummages through her purse in search for her keys. 
           Christine runs in after her. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Kate, what’s wrong? 

           Christine grabs Kate’s keys. Kate won’t look at her, hiding 
           her tears instead. But Christine puts a hand on Kate’s 
           shoulder and turns her around. Kate’s crying. 

                                 KATE
                        I’m a monster. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        No, you’re not. 

                                 KATE
                        How could you believe that?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You’ve changed.  
                                 KATE
                        I slept with Steven a couple weeks 
                        ago. I haven’t changed. 

           Christine absorbs the news. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        I lied. I did apply to a couple 
                        colleges and when I found out I 
                        didn’t get in anywhere... I was so 
                        sad. And he was nice. 
                             (then)
                        I don’t know what makes me more of 
                        a monster: telling Regina or not 
                        telling Regina. 

           Christine’s expression is unreadable. Then in a move that 
           surprises Kate, Christine brings her in for a hug. Kate grabs 
           her tightly, bawling freely.

           INT. KATE’S ROOM - DAWN

           Eyes still puffy from crying the night before, Kate wakes up 
           in her bed, surprised to be face-to-face with a sleeping 
           Christine. Kate watches her, totally reeling.

           Christine’s eyes flutter open and stare at Kate. Despite 
           being recently asleep, both are very alert.  

           There’s an electricity that is almost suffocating. Did Kate 
           just inch forward?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I think you know what the right 
                        move is here.   

           Kate’s breathing stops. What is she talking about?

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        For the Regina thing. 

                                 KATE
                        Oh. I really don’t. I never do.  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You’re a good person who makes 
                        mistakes. You’re human. 

                                 KATE
                        I make too many. They’re always so 
                        bad. What I did to you was so bad. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        You’re making up for it now. Find a 
                        way to make it up to her. But don’t 
                        tell her. She’s in a good place and 
                        you shouldn’t ruin that just to 
                        clear your guilty conscience.  

           Kate nods. They keep staring at each other. Christine’s 
           basically glowing in the sunlight. It’s breathtaking.   

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Tonight’s the big night.

           A gleeful Christine hops out of bed, leaving Kate to process 
           this probably nothing event.

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The bass DROPS as kids get FUCKED UP. This is the biggest 
           party we’ve seen Kate throw. Kate and Christine are pouring 
           themselves drinks. Regina approaches, miserable. 

                                 REGINA
                        Steven is here with Sky Mackley. 

           Steven whispers in the ear of SKY MACKLEY (18). 

                                 KATE
                        He’s a piece of shit. You need to 
                        remember that.  

                                 REGINA
                        I know. I need a distraction. 

                                 KATE
                             (yells across the room)
                        Rob! Dance with Regina. She needs a 
                        partner. 

           ROB (18) shrugs. Then pulls Regina onto the dance floor. 
           Christine smiles at Kate. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        How are you so good at wingmaning? 

                                 KATE
                        I’ll tell you, young Padawan. I 
                        just don’t give a flying fuck. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        “Young Padawan” is a Star Wars 
                        reference. 
                                 KATE
                        Is it now?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You can’t use it if you don’t know 
                        what it is! You know there’s a 
                        screening of New Hope at The 
                        Egyptian tomorrow, which doesn’t 
                        happen. It’s going to be a huge 
                        event. You should come with me. 

                                 KATE
                        Not to be dramatic, but I’d rather 
                        die than see it. It’s a point of 
                        pride at this point.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Stubborn girl.

           IN THE CORNER: a group of people play SPIN THE BOTTLE. 
           Christine and Kate stare at them for a beat too long. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        You would have been my first kiss. 

                                 KATE
                        Me too. I ended up kissing Reece 
                        Spade at Soak City a couple months 
                        later. He then made it his mission 
                        to pee on every waterslide.  

                                 CHRISTINE
                             (laughing)
                        Ew. 

                                 KATE
                        Who was yours?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Someone from camp. You wouldn’t 
                        know her. 

           Her? But before we can unpack that, Devon approaches. 

                                 DEVON
                        Hey, Brodeur! Bencomo!

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Devon, hi. 

           Kate walks away, now deeply troubled. They don’t notice.  
                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        How, uh, how’s it going with all 
                        the detentions?

                                 DEVON
                        I did it with you, so you tell me. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Right, right. Absolutely. 

                                 DEVON
                        How come I haven’t really seen you 
                        around? I feel like you only really 
                        popped up in the last month. 

           Christine takes a sip of her drink to compose herself. As she 
           pulls the cup away, she has a COCKY smile. Time to act. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I’m what you’d call a mystery. 

                                 DEVON
                        Is that so?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Oh, yes. I’ve been traveling far 
                        across the world learning about 
                        different cultures and dancing 
                        naked in the moonlight. 
                             (then)
                        And watching a lot of movies.  

           OVER TO KATE: She watches Devon laugh at what Christine just 
           said. Furious, Kate DOWNS a shot. Then another. 

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Kate and SOME GUY (18) are drunkenly making out/dancing on a 
           table. Across the room, Christine watches, worried. 

                                 DEVON
                        I don’t know. I like track and I 
                        singing’s fun, but I’m not addicted 
                        to them like other people are. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Really? But you’re amazing. 

                                 DEVON
                        Maybe. I like a lot of things, but 
                        I wish I loved one thing. Like you 
                        with NASA. I don’t have that. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        I think you will. 

           Kate is now making out with a NEW GUY (18). 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Hey, I’ll be right back. 

                                 DEVON
                        Sure thing.  

           Christine moves over to Kate’s side. Grabs her hand. Kate 
           stops kissing this guy and looks down.

                                 KATE
                        You grace me with your presence.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Come down here. I want to talk. 

           Kate jumps off the table. Stumbles a little. 

                                 KATE
                        How’s it going with Cauliflower 
                        Boy? Is it awkward?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        No, I got in character of a 
                        confident person and it worked. I 
                        actually channeled you. 

                                 KATE
                        Me? Why the fuck would you do that?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You’re the most confident person I 
                        know. Why are you mad?

                                 KATE
                        I’m not. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Then what’s wrong? You only drink 
                        this much when something’s wrong.

                                 KATE
                        You don’t know that. You don’t know 
                        me. You literally just proved that. 

           Kate storms off, leaving behind a bewildered Christine.
           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Kate stumbles into the bathroom and tries to close the door, 
           but Christine pushes it open. Kate rounds on her. 

                                 KATE
                        Since when do you kiss girls? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        What? Why does that matter? 

                                 KATE
                        You’re so fucking casual about 
                        everything! It’s really annoying. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Why are you acting so weird?

                                 KATE
                        I’ve been acting weird a lot longer 
                        than tonight. I was fine before you 
                        walked back into my life.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I beg your pardon?

                                 KATE
                        I beg your pardon? My GOD. You’re 
                        so pretentious.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        And you’re so basic! 

                                 KATE
                        Then why are you taking my advice 
                        when you know that? I’m the worst 
                        person you could have turned to.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I’m so confused. It’s working.

                                 KATE
                        It’s not fucking working if you’re 
                        pretending to be me! 

           Kate steps closer to Christine, who’s now trapped between a 
           drunk, angry Kate and a door. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        I am not confident at all. That’s 
                        why I called it an act. I’m 
                        pretending to be something I’m not. 
                        It’s fucking awful. I’m nervous all 
                        the time. I can’t sleep.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        I’ve lost like fifteen pounds in 
                        the last couple weeks and trust me, 
                        I’m not bragging. It’s actually 
                        concerning and god, I just want it 
                        to stop--

           Kate cuts herself off and KISSES Christine. 

           Christine is frozen in place. When Kate realizes, she slowly 
           pulls back. They lock eyes. Christine is totally bewildered. 

           Kate books it the fuck out of there.

           INT. RITA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAWN

           Rita’s passed out on the La-Z-Boy, her respiratory monitor 
           beeping loudly. Flipper has a nightmare on Rita’s lap. Kate’s 
           on the couch. She’s the only one not sleeping. 

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - FOYER - DAWN

           Kate enters her TRASHED HOUSE. It’s empty. Kate dials a 
           number on her phone. It rings. 

                                 ANN BENCOMO (VOICEMAIL)
                        You’ve reached the voicemail of 
                        director Ann Bencomo. If this is a--

           Kate hangs up. Calls a new number.

           EXT. KATE’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - LATER

           Clearly a nervous wreck, Christine stands in front of Kate’s 
           front door. Takes a moment to compose herself. 

           She knocks. Kate opens the door in a bathrobe. 

                                 KATE
                        Sup? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Hi. 

           Silence. 

                                 KATE
                        Did you need something?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Where did you go last night? Regina 
                        was trying to reach you. 
                                 KATE
                        I was at Rita’s. I don’t really 
                        check my texts when I’m that drunk.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Oh. 
                             (off the silence)
                        About last night--

                                 KATE
                        Girls make out at parties all the 
                        time to get guys attention. It’s 
                        not a big deal.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        But we were in a bathroom alone. 

           Kate bites her lip. Right.

                                 KATE
                        I was so drunk. I didn’t know where 
                        I was. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Look, you caught me by surprise. I 
                        mean, everything you said about 
                        being nervous around me--

                                 KATE
                        Dude, I say crazy shit when I’m 
                        drunk. Like, really crazy shit. I 
                        one time got so plastered I told 
                        that weird kid Edmond Green that 
                        I’d catsit for him sometime. He 
                        doesn’t even have a cat. He just 
                        seems like the kind of guy who 
                        does, you know?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You were pretty convincing when you 
                        told me all of that. 

                                 KATE
                        Brodeur, do I look like someone who 
                        gets nervous? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        No. I guess not. 

           Between Kate and the door, Christine sees Sai come down the 
           stairs, mid-putting on a shirt. Christine’s suddenly beaming. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Is that Sai? 
                                 KATE
                        Yeah. Love a good peen.   
                             (annoyed)
                        Why are you smiling?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You sleep with inappropriate men 
                        when you’re deflecting from 
                        something. 

                                 KATE
                        That’s so stup--

           Kate’s voice stops short when Christine tentatively steps 
           into her space, now only a couple inches away from Kate’s 
           face. She gauges Kate’s reaction. Kate’s breathing becomes 
           shallow. So does Christine’s. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Fascinating. 

           They stare at each other’s lips. But the sound of footsteps 
           gets Christine’s attention. She backs away as Sai opens the 
           door wider. He’s surprised to see Christine. 

                                 SAI
                        Oh, hi. I was just, uh. I left 
                        something here last night, so I 
                        came to pick it up. What are you 
                        doing here?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I was inviting Kate here to see a 
                        movie tonight. They’re playing Star 
                        Wars at The Egyptian and Kate said 
                        she’s been dying to see it. Isn’t 
                        that right, Kate?

           Kate is speechless. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                             (to Sai)
                        I’d invite you, but it’s a girls 
                        night. 

                                 SAI
                        Totally. You girls have fun. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                             (to Kate)
                        Ten o’clock. I’ll leave your ticket 
                        at the kiosk. 
           As a dumbfounded Kate closes the door, Christine doubles 
           over, her nerves finally hitting her at full force. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Holy CRAP.

           INT. THE EGYPTIAN THEATER - THEATER ONE - NIGHT

           The theater slowly fills up. Christine’s already seated, 
           excessively TAPPING her arm rest. 

           She checks the time on her phone. It’s 10:01. She swivels 
           around to check the doors. No Kate. 

           Christine turns back around, upset. An USHER (20s) stands in 
           front of the screen. He puffs out his chest in importance. 

                                 USHER
                        Ladies and gentleman, tonight you 
                        will be taken to a galaxy far far 
                        away where darkness reigns supreme 
                        and our only hope lies in a boy. 

                                 KATE
                        Jesus. 

           Kate sits next to Christine, who breathes a sigh of relief. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        It’s going to be good.

                                 KATE
                        I blame you if it’s not. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Screw you. 

           They lock eyes. 

                                 USHER
                        We’re happy to present Star Wars: A 
                        New Hope. 

           The audience claps as the lights go down. The movie begins. 

           Both girls look at the screen, neither paying attention. 

           Kate’s arms lay very still on her armrests. Christine clocks 
           this. Moves her arms to rest on her own armrests, only inches 
           apart from Kate’s. 

           Kate registers the move, but she’s frozen in place. 
           Christine’s hand inches closer, millimeter by measly 
           millimeter. Kate’s breathing picks up. 

           Just as they’re about to touch--

                                 REGINA (O.S.)
                             (loud whisper)
                        Guys!

           Kate and Christine jump apart as Regina and TWO OTHER GIRLS 
           (18) sit down next to Kate. What fun!

                                 REGINA (CONT'D)
                        What are you guys doing here? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        What are you doing here? 

                                 REGINA
                        We don’t usually come to stuff like 
                        this--

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Oh, fantastic.

                                 REGINA
                        --but we were in the mood to see a 
                        classic.
                             (realizing)
                        Christine, oh my god. How’d it go 
                        with Devon last night? Did you 
                        kiss? Did you fall in love? 

           Kate runs out of the theater, now thoroughly freaked out. 

                                 REGINA (CONT'D)
                        Is she okay?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Yes. I think she’s sick. I’ll go 
                        check on her.

           Christine quickly exits the theater.

           INT. THE EGYPTIAN THEATER - LOBBY - NIGHT

           Christine enters and scans the lobby for signs of Kate. She 
           catches her just as Kate pushes open the front doors. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Kate!

           But she’s already gone. Christine runs after her. 
           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Christine slams open the door to The Egyptian Theater and 
           sees Kate next door at the Pig N’ Whistle. Kate FIST BUMPS 
           the BOUNCER (40s), who laughs at something she just said. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Kate!

           But she disappears into the bar. Christine sprints over to 
           the Bouncer. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        ID. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I don’t have one. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        Tough luck. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        That’s not fair! She got in. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        That’s Kate, though. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Sir, you have to let me in. I know 
                        her. We’re friends. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        Call her and have her come out. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        She never looks at her phone. I 
                        could show you my breasts.  

           The Bouncer LAUGHS. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Sir, I’m in the middle of a pretty 
                        big moment here!

           INT. PIG N’ WHISTLE - NIGHT

           Kate GULPS down a vodka cranberry like she’s dying of thirst. 
           Christine enters and angrily approaches Kate. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        What kind of Lorelei Lee stunt was 
                        that? I had to pay him a hundred 
                        dollars to get in here. 
                                 KATE
                        Who’s Lorelei Lee?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Marilyn Monroe’s character in 
                        Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. 

                                 KATE
                        I can’t with your references. You 
                        are the most pretentious person I 
                        have ever met in my life. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        And again, you’re insufferably 
                        basic. But here we are! 
                             (off her silence)
                        Why did you run away? 

                                 KATE
                        It doesn’t matter. Just go home. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        If I go home, you’re going to get 
                        drunk and call someone you don’t 
                        care about because that’s what you 
                        do when you’re scared. I get it.  

           Someone TAPS on Kate’s shoulder. She turns and SOME OLDER GUY 
           (30s) throws her an award winning smile. 

                                 SOME OLDER GUY
                        Want to dance? 

                                 KATE
                        No, thanks. 

           He walks off. Christine continues. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        But you’ve had me do scary things 
                        for a while now and it feels good. 

                                 KATE
                        You’re only saying that because 
                        Devon’s talking to you. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        That’s not it.  

                                 KATE
                        Bullshit. You’ve been in love with 
                        Devon since seventh grade. You’re 
                        fated. I can’t compete with that.
                                 CHRISTINE
                        Do you want to compete with that?

           ANOTHER GUY (20s) sneaks his way into the circle. 

                                 ANOTHER GUY
                             (to Kate)
                        Excuse me. Would you like to dance?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        She’s good. 

           He shrugs and slinks away. Christine waits for Kate’s answer.  

                                 KATE
                        How are you not freaked out? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I’m terrified. And curious. 

           Kate catches Christine staring at her lips. But--

                                 YET ANOTHER GUY
                             (to Kate)
                        Wow, you are beautiful. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Oh my god. 

                                 YET ANOTHER GUY
                        Do you want to dance with me? 

                                 KATE
                        No, thanks.  

                                 YET ANOTHER GUY
                        Aw, come on. Dance with me. 

                                 KATE
                        I’m good. 

                                 YET ANOTHER GUY
                        Come on. It’ll be fun. Why not?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Because she’s dancing with me. 

           Christine grabs Kate’s hand and pulls her into the next room.

           INT. PIG N’ WHISTLE - DANCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The place is packed with sweaty dancers. Christine pulls Kate 
           in close as they dance to the beat. 
           Their foreheads touch.

           Christine leans in. They MAKE-OUT. It’s hot. It’s heavy. Kate 
           pulls away and smiles. Then leans back in. 

           INT. SCIENCE CLASS - DAY

           Regina descends upon Kate and Christine. 

                                 REGINA
                        Christine, how did it go with 
                        Devon? I need details! 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        It was fine. Nothing really 
                        noteworthy happened.

           Christine chances a glance Kate’s way and catches Kate’s eye. 
           They both look away quickly. 

                                 REGINA
                        What did you talk about?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I don’t know if there was a spark. 

                                 REGINA
                        But you’re soulmates! Maybe you 
                        guys were just having an off night.

           Christine and Kate don’t say a word. 

                                 REGINA (CONT'D)
                        Why are you guys so quiet?
                             (off their odd silence)
                        Kate, are you feeling better?

                                 KATE
                        I’m fine. 

           Regina’s weirded out. Kate quickly searches for a deflection.  

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Brodeur, what are you wearing?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Uh, my clothes?

                                 KATE
                        What about the clothes I gave you? 
                        This whole thing with Devon is 
                        pointless if you don’t do what we 
                        say. Maybe that was your problem. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        Really? Because everything you’ve 
                        told me to do has almost gotten me 
                        killed and tarnished my record.  

                                 KATE
                        Through no fault of my own. I’ve 
                        done some amazing stuff for you.  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Oh, have you?

           Regina sighs in annoyance. Here we go again.

           INT. KATE’S CAR - DAY

           Different day. Different clothes. But Kate and Christine are 
           still bickering. Regina’s in the back seat zoning out. 

                                 KATE
                        You wouldn’t even know who Beyonce 
                        is if I hadn’t sat you down and 
                        forced you to listen to her. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I know who she is. I don’t live 
                        under a rock. But honestly, I don’t 
                        see what the big deal is. 

                                 KATE
                        Lemonade was revolutionary!

           EXT. KATE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Different day. Different clothes. Regina has already been 
           dropped off. But instead of driving Christine home, they exit 
           the car and march towards Kate’s house, still bickering. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You’re only saying that because 
                        everyone else says that. 

                                 KATE
                        Are you calling me a follower? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Absolutely.  

           INT. KATE’S ROOM - DAY

           Different day. Different clothes. Kate opens the door. 
                                 KATE
                        I am not.  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Yes, you are. 

                                 KATE
                        Screw you. 

           Just as Christine’s inside, Kate grabs her and shoves her 
           against the door. They passionately kiss, neither coming up 
           for air. This is their routine and they both love it. 

           INT. CHRISTINE’S ROOM - DAY

           Kate and Christine are making out on Christine’s bed. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Hey, I got you something. 

                                 KATE
                        Later. I’m busy.

           Kate kisses her again.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        It’s really good. 

           Christine rolls off and runs to her desk. Pulls out a package 
           and hands it to Kate. 

           Kate opens it. Flushes when she sees it’s a vibrator. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Every girl needs one. 
                             (off Kate’s silence)
                        What?

                                 KATE
                        Nothing. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        It’s not a big deal. See?

           She takes out the vibrator. Pretends to talk as the vibrator. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                             (Vibrator voice)
                        Don’t let the patriarchy scare you 
                        into not enjoying yourself. 

                                 KATE
                        You’re the one scaring me!
           Without either of them noticing, Jeremy opens the door. Stops 
           when he sees them. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                             (Vibrator voice)
                        Kaaaaaate. 
                             (turns on vibrator)
                        Buzz! I’m lonely.

                                 KATE
                        Stop it!

           Christine tries to kiss Kate, who isn’t having it. 

                                 JEREMY BRODEUR
                        WOAH THERE.

           The girls jump apart. 

           INT. CHRISTINE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Jeremy and Megan sit before Christine, who is mortified. 

                                 JEREMY BRODEUR
                        So. That’s actually not how you use 
                        a vibrator. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Dad! 

                                 JEREMY BRODEUR
                        I’m just saying, they’re pretty 
                        straight forward. 

           Christine hits her head on the table dramatically. 

                                 MEGAN BRODEUR
                        Are you... using protection? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        We’re girls? 

                                 MEGAN BRODEUR
                        And you can still get STDs. Dental 
                        dams are a way to protect yourself. 
                        I can explain how to use them if 
                        you’d like. I’ve had my fair share 
                        of female experience. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        What?!
                                 JEREMY BRODEUR
                             (so god damn proud)
                        She did. 

           Christine suddenly stands. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I’m moving out. 

                                 MEGAN BRODEUR
                        Christine, wait. We don’t have to 
                        talk about it, but I just need to 
                        know. Are you okay with this?
                             (off Christine’s nod)
                        Then so are we. Even if Kate can be 
                        Kate. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Only sometimes.

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           Kate and Christine stumble into the house, mid-make-out. They 
           hear noises from the kitchen and Kate immediately SHOVES 
           Christine off of her. She’s a little rough about it. 

           Regina, Sai, Devon and a group of TWELVE PEOPLE stumble out 
           of the kitchen when they hear the noise.

                                 REGINA
                        Kate! 

                                 EVERYONE
                        Kate!!!

                                 KATE
                        Ha. Ha. Oh my god. I almost forgot 
                        about my open door policy. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        So amazing you do that...

           Regina turns to Christine and mouths, “I brought Devon. Now’s 
           your chance.” Then winks terribly at Christine. 

           Devon approaches.

                                 DEVON
                        Hey Christine. Did you get my 
                        message on Instagram? I sent it 
                        yesterday. 
           Regina and Kate shoot Christine one hell of a look. Christine 
           catches Kate’s eye. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Remind me what it says?

                                 DEVON
                        It said, “Hey.” So I just wanted to 
                        come up and say, “Hey.”
                             (then)
                        Hey. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Hi. 

                                 DEVON
                        Um, do you want to get Trader Joe’s 
                        tonight? Was thinking we could like 
                        get a spread of some cool shit and 
                        eat by the beach. 

           Christine is speechless. Regina is practically jumping up and 
           down with joy. Kate’s panicked. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Devon--

                                 KATE
                        She would love to. Eight sound 
                        good? 

                                 DEVON
                        Uh, yeah. Perfect. 
                             (to Christine)
                        Text me your address. 

           Devon throws Christine a winning smile and walks off. 

                                 REGINA
                        Can I give a speech at the wedding? 
                        Can you promise me that honor?  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Regina, I--

                                 REGINA
                        Thank you, you’re the best!

           Regina moves off. Christine can’t even look at Kate. 

                                 KATE
                        We have to keep up appearances. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        Should I blow him too?

           Christine leaves. Kate closes her eyes. Sighs. 

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           As the small gathering has turned into a full blown party, 
           Kate keeps checking her phone. The time is 8:00pm. Yup, 
           Christine’s on that date now. 

           There’s some GASPS on the other side of the room that catch 
           Kate’s attention. 

           Regina and a group of people are watching ACCESS HOLLYWOOD. 
           They turn up the volume.  

                                 REPORTER (ON TV)
                        We’re getting reports that director 
                        Ann Bencomo was held at gunpoint in 
                        her Botswana hotel room. No news on 
                        her condition, but the gunman is 
                        still at large.  

           As everyone gasps at the news, Kate runs to the backyard, mid-
           dialing. Regina follows.

           EXT. KATE’S BACKYARD - POOL - DAY

           Kate and Regina anxiously wait as the phone rings. 

                                 ANN BENCOMO (O.S.)
                        Hello? 

                                 KATE
                        Mom! I just heard. Are you okay?

                                 ANN BENCOMO (O.S.)
                        Oh, yeah. I just had this amazing 
                        breakfast. It was kind of orgasmic. 
                        Everything’s so fresh here. 

                                 KATE
                        Mom. You were just held at 
                        gunpoint. 

                                 ANN BENCOMO (O.S.)
                        Oh, I paid a guy to point a gun at 
                        me for half an hour. He has six 
                        kids! Kind of a nightmare. 
                                 KATE
                        What? 

                                 ANN BENCOMO (O.S.)
                        It’s just a strategy. The publicity 
                        will really do wonders for this 
                        movie come Oscar season.

                                 KATE
                        Are you fucking insane? 

                                 ANN BENCOMO (O.S.)
                        You kind of have to be to win. 
                             (then)
                        Why are you upset? This has nothing 
                        to do with you. 

           It’s like a knife to the heart. But Kate ignores it. 

                                 KATE
                        Could you just... tell me before 
                        you decide to jump off a cliff or 
                        something? So I know?

                                 ANN BENCOMO (O.S.)
                        Of course, dear. 

           Kate hangs up. Devastated. Regina gives her a look.

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Kate storms back inside, Regina closely following. The group 
           pounces on Kate. 

                                 SAI
                        Kate, are you okay?

                                 JUNIOR MINION #1
                        Kate! What happened? 

                                 JUNIOR MINION #2
                        Your mom’s a fighter. 

                                 KATE
                        She’s fine! I’m fine!

           Everyone shuts up. Then start talking amongst themselves. 
           Steven SNORTS a line of coke. 

                                 REGINA
                        Steven, save some for me. 

           Kate shoots her a look. Why the fuck is she talking to him?
           INT. RITA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Kate storms into Rita’s house as she’s mid-Wheel of Fortune. 
           Rita is noticeably sicker since we last saw her. 

                                 RITA
                        At some point, could you knock down 
                        this wall? I want to open up the 
                        space before I put the house on the 
                        market--

           Kate picks up a hammer and THROWS IT at the wall in question. 
           Flipper sprints away at the noise. 

           Rita watches as Kate picks up the hammers and DESTROYS the 
           wall, getting out some much needed aggression. 

                                 KATE
                        What are you putting the house on 
                        the market for?

                                 RITA
                        I don’t know if you know this, but 
                        I’m kind of dying. 

           Kate SLAMS the hammer into the wall, silencing Rita. Kate 
           breathes heavily while Rita waits patiently. 

                                 KATE
                        How are you so calm about this?

                                 RITA
                        I’m a complete mess, actually.   

                                 KATE
                        Have you always been? 

                                 RITA
                        Yes and no. It fluctuates depending 
                        on what stage of my life I’m in.  

           Kate doesn’t say anything. Processing. 

                                 RITA (CONT'D)
                        What’s gotten me through the mess 
                        is surrounding myself with people I 
                        admire. That being said...

           Rita gestures to her empty house. 

                                 RITA (CONT'D)
                        No one really wants to watch 
                        someone die. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 RITA (CONT'D)
                                 RITA (CONT'D)
                        They come around when they can, but 
                        it’s hard to not already view me as 
                        being dead. So, I started prank 
                        calling them from “beyond the 
                        grave” and I will say, it’s making 
                        me feel a lot better. 
                             (off Kate’s silence)
                        Is there anyone you admire?

                                 KATE
                        Yes. 

                                 RITA
                        Then tell them. I never told anyone 
                        that. 

           Rita breathes in a ragged breath that is seriously 
           concerning. Kate’s crushed. 

           EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

           Christine and Devon have a night picnic on the beach. Devon 
           prepares a concoction for Christine. She’s kinda off.  

                                 DEVON
                        We get some Trader Joe’s Pita Bite 
                        Crackers, add a splash of Trader 
                        Joe’s Vegan Pesto Dip--and 
                        seriously, I’m not vegan, but this 
                        shit is good. And finally, Gouda. 

           He hands the cracker to Christine, so proud of himself.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        What are you, a spokesperson for 
                        Trader Joe’s? 

                                 DEVON
                        I may follow all of their Instagram 
                        accounts and may be up to date on 
                        all their new products, sure. But 
                        that’s just because I want TJoe’s 
                        to kill the competitors. 

           Christine forces herself to smile. Then takes a bite. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                             (sad)
                        Wow, that was quite good. 

                                 DEVON
                        It doesn’t seem like it was. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        This is the first real date I’ve 
                        been on. It’s all so lovely. 

           She’s says that like it’s a bad thing. Devon notices. 

                                 DEVON
                        I could make it not nice. I mean, 
                        psh. I could kick sand in your face 
                        if you want. How not nice is that?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Devon, I’ve spent years dreaming of 
                        this moment and you’re exactly how 
                        I imagined you’d be. But I’m not 
                        how I imagined I’d be.  
                             (off his stunned silence)
                        I guess when I found out you liked 
                        me in seventh grade, I thought I 
                        did too because I had a crush on 
                        you back then. But I realized that 
                        sometimes seventh grade feelings 
                        don’t translate to twelfth grade 
                        interest. I’m sorry. 

                                 DEVON
                        How’d you know that? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I overheard you talking about it 
                        with Sai. You said the door knob 
                        thing made you stop. 

                                 DEVON
                        That’s not why. I didn’t want to 
                        rock the boat when I realized Kate 
                        also had a crush on you. 
                             (off Christine, stunned)
                        I caught her staring at you a lot 
                        in seventh grade. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        She did? 

                                 DEVON
                        You’d have to be blind not to 
                        notice. 

           Christine smiles. Devon notices. 

                                 DEVON (CONT'D)
                        For what it’s worth, I’ve noticed 
                        her do the same thing now. 
                        Seriously, no hard feelings.

                                 DEVON (CONT'D)
                        If you like her, you should tell 
                        her before school ends. Just my two 
                        cents. I won’t say anything. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Thank you.

           She looks down at her phone. 

           Kate: Come over after?

           Kate: Please?

           Christine watches Devon making himself a Trader Joes cheese 
           cracker with such care. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        Hey, you found something you’re 
                        passionate about. 

           Devon pauses. Then BEAMS. 

                                 DEVON
                        I guess I did. 

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Christine enters with purpose and scans the now very crowded 
           party. She catches Kate’s eye on the other side of the room. 

           Picking up a nearby EMPTY BOTTLE, Christine spins it on a 
           table. Kate walks closer to Christine as it keeps spinning. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Hear me out. There’s a magical 
                        place called Glendale where no one 
                        knows us. I can confirm it has 
                        food. You could dress up and I 
                        could dress up and we could get off 
                        on the wrong exit. What do you say? 

           INT. KATE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The girls SLAM into the Kate’s room, aggressively making out. 

                                 KATE
                        I’m so glad it was a bad date.  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Yes, his penis tasted too tangy. 

           Kate pulls back, horrified, as Christine BURSTS out laughing. 
                                 KATE
                        So help me god, I’m going to bury 
                        myself under this house. 

           Christine KISSES her and LOCKS the door. Kate’s eyes widen. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Really?

           Christine answers by pulling her shirt over her head. Kate 
           kisses her neck and backs her against the bed. 

           As she falls on the bed, Christine looks up at Kate, totally 
           in love. Kate straddles her, moaning a little as she grinds 
           into her.  

           INT. KATE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Limbs and sheets are tangled together, both girls very happy.

                                 KATE
                        I didn’t know sex could be good. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Poor Steven and Sai. 

           Kate’s stomach RUMBLES loudly. Christine LAUGHS. 

                                 KATE
                        I’m gonna enter the lion’s den and 
                        get us some food. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Hurry back.

           They KISS. Then Kate quickly puts on clothes, unlocks the 
           door, and exits. Christine lays back down, totally content. 

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The house is swarming with people as Kate grabs chips and 
           water. She catches Regina SMILING at Steven across the room. 

           He winks back. Kate pulls Regina to face her, furious. 

                                 KATE
                        I’m sorry. Did I miss something?

           INT. KATE’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Christine lies under the covers. The door opens. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        Oh wow, Kate. That was fast--

           Christine stops when she sees Monica FUCKING Hutcherson 
           staring back at her. Monica quickly exits, wide-eyed. 

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME TIME

           Back to Regina and Kate. 

                                 REGINA
                        I’ve been maybe thinking about 
                        getting back together with Steven? 
                             (off Kate’s horror)
                        I know what you’re going to say. 
                        But you don’t know what these past 
                        couple months have been like. It’s 
                        like a part of me has been ripped 
                        out. Kinda like in Ancient Egypt 
                        when they’d make mummies, they’d 
                        put a pick up your nose, scramble 
                        it, and rip your brain out through 
                        your nose. 

                                 KATE
                        Literally what?

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY/STAIRS

           Monica WHISPERS to one of Kate’s Junior Minions. She laughs 
           and runs off to tell a CHEERLEADER. 

           We FOLLOW the Cheerleader down the stairs. She tells ANOTHER 
           CHEERLEADER, who turns and tells her BOYFRIEND. 

                                 BOYFRIEND
                        Oh my fucking god! The door knob 
                        humper? 

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Back to Regina and Kate. They walk out of the kitchen and 
           into the living room.  

                                 REGINA
                        We talked about it last night. He 
                        apologized and, I don’t know. I 
                        believe him. It was a one time 
                        mistake and he’s allowed me to 
                        scream at him periodically for the 
                        past couple months.

                                 REGINA (CONT'D)
                             (off their silence)
                        If I don’t try, I’ll always think 
                        “what if.”

                                 KATE
                        Regina. You can’t trust him.

                                 REGINA
                        Why not?

           LAUGHING catches their attention. Everyone around them is 
           whispering and staring at Kate. 

                                 PERSON #1
                        --door knob humper in Kate’s bed.

                                 PERSON #2
                        Kate’s gay? Since when?!

                                 PERSON #3
                        Christine Brodeur’s naked in her 
                        bed. Are they dating? 

           Round and round, people’s whispering increases as the color 
           drains out of Kate. Regina shoots Kate a questioning look. 
           Now dressed, Christine comes downstairs to hear the final 
           round of whispers. 

                                 PERSON #4
                        Do you think they’ll make out? 

                                 PERSON #5
                        They’re so brave. 

                                 PERSON #6
                        Kate humping a door knob humper. 

           Kate’s on the verge of another panic attack. Christine takes 
           a step towards Kate to comfort her. 

           Kate RECOILS back. 

                                 KATE
                             (loudly)
                        Were you waiting for me? 

           Christine stares at Kate. Stunned. Whispering surrounds them.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Kate. Please. 

           She silently pleads with Kate to stop. Kate’s doesn’t have 
           time to process all of this, the whispering growing louder. 
                                 KATE
                        Dude, I don’t swing that way. What 
                        the hell?

           Christine’s heart plummets at those words. She can’t speak. 
           She glances at Regina, who’s shocked. The entire party is 
           going wild with the new gossip. 

           Christine runs out.

           EXT. KATE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Kate closely follows behind a devastated Christine. 

                                 KATE
                        Christine, wait. 

           Christine turns and tries to SLAP Kate, but Kate catches her 
           hand mid-air. Tears brim Christine’s eyes. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        How could you do this to me? AGAIN.

                                 KATE
                        I panicked. I’m sorry.  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        My mom told me this was going to 
                        happen again and I-- aagh!

                                 KATE
                        I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. Fuck, 
                        I’m so sorry. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Shut up! If you were actually 
                        sorry, you would go back in there 
                        and tell the truth. But you won’t 
                        now and you didn’t back then 
                        either. Which is crazy because 
                        Devon told me you liked me in 
                        seventh grade, so why on earth 
                        would you tell people I masturbated 
                        when you had a crush on me? Why 
                        would you deny you’re with me now 
                        when I know you love me?
                             (off Kate’s silence)
                        Right?

                                 KATE
                        It’s not that simple. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        It is. You’re the problem. You can 
                        stop this. 

                                 KATE
                        Have some compassion. 

           Christine shoots her one fuck of a look. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        I have a reputation. I can’t just 
                        blow that up in a single second.   

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You’re blowing up mine to protect 
                        yours, then? 

                                 KATE
                        Yours was already bad!

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Because of you. Again. All of my 
                        social highs and lows have hinged 
                        on your bullshit.

                                 KATE
                        Excuse me?

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You tell everyone I’m a pervert and 
                        I have no friends for six years. 
                        Then you tell everyone to hang out 
                        with me and I suddenly have 
                        friends. Then you kiss me and run 
                        away and you leave me to pick up 
                        the pieces. And now, oh screw me 
                        again! The cycle starts over!  

                                 KATE
                        That is so unfair. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        It’s true. 

                                 KATE
                        I haven’t been in your life for the 
                        past six years. Have you made any 
                        friends in that time? Have you 
                        tried at all to connect to people? 
                        Don’t use me as an excuse to hide 
                        behind your fucked up problems. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Screw you.
           Like a slap to the face.   

                                 KATE
                        I wasn’t ready for all of this.   

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Neither was I. But. Here we are. 

           Christine backs away, unwilling to look at her anymore. 

           WE STAY on Kate. She wears a mix of distressing emotions. 

           The party RAGES behind her. The lights are off at Rita’s 
           house. Almost dead in a way. Regina and Steven make-out 
           against one of the windows. 

           Kate storms back inside.

           INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Everyone is laughing. Dancing. Having such a magical time. 
           “One Time” by Justin Bieber plays. 

           Kate grabs a bat leaning against a wall and SMASHES a window. 
           Everyone immediately stops and stares.  

                                 KATE
                        Let’s fuck shit up!

           The crowd CHEERS and go ham on the house. Someone SMASHES a 
           chair at the TV. Another person SHATTERS the Academy Award 
           against the wall. 

           Kate uses the bat to DESTROY pictures of her family. She 
           scream-sings along to “One Time” in an unhinged rendition.

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        “You're my one love/My one heart/My 
                        one life for sure/LET ME TELL YOU 
                        ONE TIME!”

           As she pulls back the bat, she knocks Regina in the face!

                                 REGINA
                        Ow! What the fuck?

           Kate drops the bat. Stares at Regina’s bleeding lip.

                                 REGINA (CONT'D)
                        What the hell are you doing?
                                 KATE
                        I fucked Steven. That’s why you 
                        can’t trust him. That’s why you 
                        can’t trust me.  

           They stare at each other as the chaos surrounds them. Regina 
           finally bursts into tears.  

           Kate walks out of her house. 

           INT. UBER - NIGHT

           Kate’s in the back of an Uber, lost in thought.  

           INT. LAX - CHECK-IN - NIGHT

           Kate approaches a nerdy TICKET AGENT (20s). 

                                 KATE
                        I’d like one ticket to Antarctica. 

           The Ticket Agent is taken aback, but politely checks anyway.

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        I don’t know if we do that. Think 
                        you might have to stop in Chile 
                        first and take a boat from there...

                                 KATE
                        Look, Antarctica isn’t going to 
                        exist soon. I just want to see it 
                        before it’s gone. Is Antarctica gay-
                        friendly?

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        I don’t really know a lot about 
                        Antarctica. But if you want to see 
                        something before it’s gone, you 
                        should really go to the Great 
                        Barrier Reef. I think it’s like 
                        ninety percent bleached.

                                 KATE
                        Brilliant! Australia is like made 
                        of criminals. It’s perfect for me. 

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        Umm...

                                 KATE
                        Hold that thought. 
           Kate pulls out her phone and we see she has TEN MISSED CALLS 
           from Regina. 

           She ignores that and dials a number. We stay on Kate during 
           the following conversation. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hello?

                                 KATE
                        Rita! Hear me out. You’re not dead 
                        yet. We should go to Australia or 
                        Antarctica and see the end of the 
                        world before you go out. I’m at LAX 
                        right now, so I could send a car 
                        for you and--

                                 JERRI (O.S.)
                        Kate, it’s Jerri. Rita’s in the 
                        hospital right now. She’s not doing 
                        so well. I think she’d like it if 
                        you came by.
                             (off Kate’s silence)
                        Kate?

           Kate hangs up, unable to deal with this news. 

           INT. LAX - CHECK-IN - LATER

           Kate sits on a bench watching the check-in line in a daze. 
           She’s clearly been sitting there for hours. 

           Regina RUSHES in. Finally spots Kate. Slows down when she 
           sees just how out of it Kate seems. 

                                 REGINA
                        Hi. 
                             (off Kate’s silence)
                        Jerri called Rita and then Rita 
                        called me and threatened me a 
                        little. So here I am. 
                             (more silence)
                        Where are you going?

                                 KATE
                        Antarctica. Or. Chile. I haven’t 
                        decided yet.  

                                 REGINA
                        But you don’t even have a coat. 
                             (off Kate’s silence)
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 REGINA (CONT'D)
                                 REGINA (CONT'D)
                        I called Christine when I was 
                        looking for you. She was upset. I 
                        think she’s in love with you. 

                                 KATE
                        She told you about us?

           Regina reacts to that. A little surprised. 

                                 REGINA
                        No. 
                             (as it sinks in)
                        Oh, wow. 

                                 KATE
                        Well. This is who I am. Someone who 
                        makes horribly rash decisions and 
                        then has to hide those decisions 
                        for the rest of time. That’s me. 
                        Now you know just how garbage I am. 
                        I can’t escape from me. You should. 

                                 REGINA
                        But I don’t want to.

                                 KATE
                        Fuck off. 

                                 REGINA
                        No, you fuck off. We’ve been best 
                        friends for a decade and that’s not 
                        going to change just because you 
                        fucked me over. Fight for me, 
                        damnit! 

                                 KATE
                        You can’t seriously suggest we 
                        forget about this. You’ve been 
                        railing on Monica for months.

                                 REGINA
                        I don’t give a shit about Monica 
                        FUCKING Hutcherson, but you are 
                        Kate FUCKING Bencomo. I hate you 
                        and I need you to fight for us 
                        because that’s what you do for the 
                        people you love. 

           Kate’s barely keeping it together now. 

                                 KATE
                        But I’m horrible. 
                                 REGINA
                        You are horrible AND you are great. 
                        You’re like a beautiful disaster. 
                        In my Superhero Scholarship essay, 
                        I wrote about how you come with me 
                        to the doctor and hold my hand 
                        every time I need to get a shot. 
                        You came when I was nine. You came 
                        when I was ten. And eleven. And 
                        twelve. And thirteen. And sadly 
                        fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, and 
                        seventeen. 
                             (realizing)
                        Fuck, I have to get another one in 
                        a couple weeks. Oh Jesus, fuck. 

                                 KATE
                        Hey, it’s okay. 

                                 REGINA
                        I am also a goddamn disaster. I 
                        need you. So please stay, let me be 
                        mad at you, and fight for me. Fight 
                        for Christine. Just fight. 

                                 KATE
                        Okay. 
                             (then)
                        I’m so sorry, Regina.  

           They hug. Pull back. 

                                 REGINA
                        You’re going to make it up to me by 
                        doing my laundry for two years. 

           Kate LAUGHS. But stops when she sees Regina is serious. 

                                 KATE
                        Right, no totally. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - RITA’S ROOM - DAY

           Kate enters. Sees Rita’s not looking too good. 

                                 RITA
                        Regina found you, I see. 

                                 KATE
                        Thank you for that. 
                                 RITA
                        Figured I’d do one good deed to 
                        scam my way into Heaven. 

                                 KATE
                        You’ve done a lot of good deeds. 

                                 RITA
                        So have you. You’ve kept a dying 
                        woman company. 

                                 KATE
                        I was just doing that so you would 
                        will away all your money to me.  

           Rita CRACKS UP. But as she does, her eyes roll into the back 
           of her head. Kate watches in horror as Rita CRASHES. A Crash 
           Team rush into the room and take out a defibrillator. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Clear. 

           They SHOCK Rita. Kate holds her breath as Rita regains hers. 

                                 DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                             (to Kate)
                        She’s good. We got her. 

           Rita opens her eyes as the Crash Team backs away. 

                                 RITA
                        Your bad joke almost killed me. 

           Kate BURSTS into tears, completely losing it. Rita scoots 
           over as Kate gets in bed with her. She holds Kate like a 
           little kid. 

                                 KATE
                        I admire you. 

                                 RITA
                        I admire you, too. 

           EXT. PALOS VERDES HIGH SCHOOL - FIELD - DAY

           Graduation is in full swing. Some of the seniors stand in 
           line as the Principal calls names.  

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Kate Bencomo.
           People clap as Kate strides on stage and takes her diploma. 
           She smiles at Jerri and Rita in the crowd. She’s in a 
           wheelchair looking a little better, but still not great.

                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
                        Regina Shor. 

           In A DUCT TAPE GRADUATION GOWN, Regina strides on stage. 

                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
                        Winner of the Duct Tape Graduation 
                        Gown, the Elderly Appreciation 
                        Scholarship, the Duck Whistle 
                        Scholarship, the Superhero 
                        Scholarship, the Keep a Goldfish 
                        Alive Scholarship, the--

           Regina grabs the mic before the Principal can finish. 

                                 REGINA
                        Grand total of fifty-five thousand 
                        dollars. FUCK ALL THE HATERS! 

           The Principal angrily grabs the mic back as people in the 
           crowd hoot and holler. Kate LAUGHS. Notices Christine in the 
           crowd doing the same. 

           They make eye contact.

           As Regina strides towards her, Kate grabs her hand. 

                                 KATE
                        You might be the smartest person 
                        I’ve ever met in my life. 

           Regina beams.

           INT. CLASSROOM - LATER

           Graduating seniors take off their graduation robes and 
           deposit them in various boxes.

           Kate sees Christine across the room. Makes a split second 
           decision. Standing on a chair-- 

                                 KATE
                        Hey!

           She immediately has everyone’s attention. Like always. 
                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        Christine was waiting for me in my 
                        room. But that’s because she was my 
                        girlfriend.  

           Murmurs from the crowd. Christine is stunned. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                             (to Christine)
                        Christine, I love you. I’ve always 
                        loved you. I didn’t quite know 
                        that’s what that was when I was 
                        younger, but I do know I was 
                        freaking obsessed with hanging out 
                        with you. Then we almost kissed and 
                        you told me you masturbated and it 
                        scared me because you were so much 
                        more in tune with your sexuality 
                        than I was. But I tried it the 
                        other day and you were right. It’s 
                        fucking awesome!

           The students kind of laugh to themselves. There are some 
           “awws.” Christine gives a small smile.  

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        I needed to set the record straight 
                        that I am so goddamn gay for you.

                                 REGINA
                        Kiss her! 

           Christine approaches Kate and pulls her down from her chair. 
           They kiss. Led by Regina, the crowd CHEERS.

           As the kiss goes on, Christine’s brows furrow. Something’s 
           wrong. She pulls back as if she’s been slapped. 

           Kate’s breathless and smiling like an idiot. She hasn’t 
           noticed the change in Christine. 

                                 KATE
                        I can’t believe this is real. I 
                        never thought I’d get you back. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Kate--

           Some people start going back to their business. Others are 
           still staring. 
                                 KATE
                        Regina was saying I should make a 
                        grand gesture, but I was like “no, 
                        that’s cheesy as fuck.” But I don’t 
                        know. It just felt right in the--

           That’s when Kate realizes Christine is crying against her. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I don’t-- I just-- I need--

           Kate quickly pulls her into the hallway. 

           INT. PALOS VERDES HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           A deeply concerned Kate finds them a secluded hallway. 
           Christine leans all her weight on Kate as she breaks down. 

                                 KATE
                        Hey, it’s okay. 
                             (off Christine’s silence)
                        Maybe that was too public. 

           Christine continues sobbing against Kate. Kate rubs soothing 
           circles on her back, but it ends up having the opposite 
           effect. Christine leans back. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I’m not okay. 

                                 KATE
                        Huh? Really? 

           Kate offers a small smile for comfort. Christine is 
           devastated by it. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I love you so much. 

                                 KATE
                        I love you too. Is that bad?  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I’m so hurt by what you did. I 
                        don’t know how those two things can 
                        co-exist, but they do. 

                                 KATE
                        Okay. That makes sense. But I can 
                        be better. I mean, I just professed 
                        my love for you in front of 
                        everyone. That was huge for me. 
                                 CHRISTINE
                        It was. For you. 

                                 KATE
                        I have bullshit, but I know if I 
                        work hard I can get rid of it. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I need to get rid of mine, too. 

           Christine catches Kate’s eye. 

                                 KATE
                        I don’t understand. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You were right when you said I 
                        haven’t tried to connect and open 
                        up with anyone besides you. I’ve 
                        spent six years so furious at the 
                        past that I couldn’t live in the 
                        present. How sad is that?

                                 KATE
                        Okay. We’re both fucked up. We can 
                        work on it together. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        I can’t. 

           Kate backs up. 

                                 CHRISTINE (CONT'D)
                        If I let you back in, I’ll fall 
                        back into the cycle. I need to find 
                        myself without you and you need to 
                        find yourself without me. Does that 
                        make sense? 

                                 KATE
                        From a psychotic perspective.

           Christine kisses Kate. She pulls back. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Maybe with time...

           She leaves that hanging as she turns away. Kate lets her go. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           TITLECARD: Two Years Later.
           EXT. CEMETARY - DAY

           Sporting a CSULB sweater, Kate Bencomo and Flipper (now both 
           20) visit Rita’s grave. Her headstone reads, “Rita Orson: 
           1965-2020. Mother to many.” 

                                 KATE
                        I swear to god, I tried to convince 
                        Jerri to change your headstone to 
                        say something else. Because 
                        honestly it sounds a little whore-
                        ish. Like anyone who walks by is 
                        going to think you were throwing 
                        your cat around left and right and 
                        popping out dozens of babies. Jerri 
                        didn’t really like that argument. 
                             (emotional)
                        But I think she was ultimately 
                        right. 

           Kate puts a BUD LIGHT next to her grave. Tears roll down her 
           cheeks. Flipper starts peeing on her grave. 

                                 REGINA (O.S.)
                        Flipper! Jesus, how did that dog 
                        outlive Rita? 

           Regina Shor (now 20) comes up from behind Kate. A huge bag is 
           slung over her shoulder. 

                                 KATE
                        The biggest mystery of them all. 

           Kate wipes away her tears, still staring at Rita’s grave. 

                                 REGINA
                        She would have been proud of you. 

                                 KATE
                        I know. 

           Regina puts a reassuring hand on Kate’s shoulder. Then--

                                 REGINA
                        If you could have my laundry back 
                        by five tomorrow, that’d be 
                        excellent.

           She swings the bag towards Kate. Pats her on the back. Then 
           Regina gets a text. She sighs loudly. 

                                 REGINA (CONT'D)
                        Fuck me in the asshole.
           INT. UCLA ADPI HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           Regina begins unscrewing the hinges of a DOOR. Kate is deeply 
           disturbed as another SORORITY SISTER stands by, furious.  

                                 SORORITY SISTER
                        Amelia, this is getting ridiculous!  

                                 AMELIA (O.S.)
                             (sobbing)
                        Go away!

           Kate lowers her voice. 

                                 KATE
                        What happened? 

                                 REGINA
                        Something with her mom. I don’t 
                        know. She’s like this every time 
                        her mom calls.  

                                 SORORITY SISTER
                        TWO OTHER PEOPLE LIVE HERE, AMELIA! 
                        You can’t keep doing this!

           Kate puts a hand on her shoulder and approaches the door. She 
           gives a soft knock. 

                                 KATE
                        Amelia, this is Kate, Regina’s 
                        friend. What happened?

                                 AMELIA (O.S.)
                        My mom thinks I need to lose 
                        weight. But I’ve already been 
                        trying so hard. 

                                 KATE
                        I’m sorry. She’s just wrong. 

                                 AMELIA (O.S.)
                        I wish she was nicer. 

                                 KATE
                        You can’t change her. 
                        Unfortunately. All you can do is 
                        surround yourself with people you 
                        admire and wait out the storm. 
                             (off the silence)
                        Do you want to go somewhere fun? 
                        Forget your problems for a night?

           Silence. And then AMELIA (20), a total mess, opens the door. 
           INT. MOONLIGHT ROLLERWAY - RINK - NIGHT

           Kate, Regina, and Amelia hang onto each other for dear life 
           as they awkwardly skate around the rollerway. Amelia SCREAMS 
           as she almost falls. Then LAUGHS. 

                                 AMELIA
                        What the fuck is this place?

           Everyone falls around. The girls LAUGH. Kate suddenly stops, 
           having caught someone’s eye. 

           ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RINK is Christine Brodeur (now 20). 
           Her hair’s shorter. Maybe it’s dyed. She waves at Kate. 

           Next to Christine, Devon Russey (now 20) pops his head out 
           and beams at Kate like a puppy. 

           Kate WIPES OUT. 

           INT. MOONLIGHT ROLLERWAY - REST AREA - DAY

           On the sidelines, Christine inspects Kate’s shoulder.  

                                 CHRISTINE
                        On the bright side, your fall 
                        looked quite graceful.  

                                 KATE
                        That’s why I did it. To look 
                        graceful.   

           Christine chuckles. As Devon, Regina, and Amelia skate by, 
           Devon passes Christine an ICE PACK. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Thank you, Devon. 

           Devon throws back a THUMBS UP as the trio circles the rink. 
           Kate keeps staring at Devon. Christine notices. 

                                 KATE
                        Could you tell me when you’re going 
                        to pop it back in? Just a three 
                        second warning would be stellar.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Absolutely not. It’s better if it 
                        comes out of nowhere. 

                                 KATE
                        No, it’s not! It wasn’t last time.
                                 CHRISTINE
                        One. Two--

                                 KATE
                        Wait! Wait! Wait! Just let me get 
                        in the right mind space. 

           Closing her eyes, Kate takes in a deep breath. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Devon and I are just friends. His 
                        dorm was across from mine freshman 
                        year and now we’re roommates. Just 
                        so you know. 

                                 KATE
                        You two really were fated, huh?   

           Kate opens her eyes. They instantly lock onto Christine’s. 
           That’s when she POPS Kate’s shoulder back into it’s socket. 

                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                        OW! What the FUCK?! 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        It was going to hurt either way.

                                 KATE
                        You used my weaknesses against me!

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You’re welcome.  

           Christine holds the ice pack to her shoulder. Kate’s buzzing 
           from her proximity. 

                                 KATE
                        Guess what? I watched Star Wars. 
                             (off Christine’s shock)
                        I’m a film major so I kinda had to. 
                        It was good. 

           Another silence. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You hated it, didn’t you?

                                 KATE
                        I have some notes.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You’re unbelievable.

                        They walk around the desert for the 
                        first half of the movie. HALF! 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        It’s world and character building! 

                                 KATE
                        Half a movie is a long time for 
                        nothing to happen. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        You’re an asshole. 

           Kate looks away. Focuses on the skaters.  

                                 KATE
                        How are you? 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Great. I joined this mountain 
                        climbing club and we go camping 
                        every weekend. I scaled a one 
                        hundred foot sheer rock face the 
                        other day. I couldn’t believe it. I 
                        had gone up with this girl I was--
                             (catching herself)
                        Anyway, we woke up at four AM like 
                        psychopaths. I barely ate breakfast 
                        and it was freezing. But when we 
                        finally got to the top, we watched 
                        the most beautiful sunrise. That 
                        was the first time I’ve done that. 
                        It was almost perfect. 

                                 KATE
                        Almost? 

           Christine catches her eye. Yup. Almost. 

           SCREAMS catch the girls’ attention. Devon, Regina, and Amelia 
           have just wiped out, now CRACKING UP on the floor.

                                 CHRISTINE
                        So you missed your exit then? 

                                 KATE
                        No.  

           As they break into smiles...  

                                 THE END
