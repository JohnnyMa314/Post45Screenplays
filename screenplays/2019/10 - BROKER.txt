           INT. EAST SIDE DINER - NIGHT

           Late-night clientele at the counter. A lower-middle-class 
           street out the windows. Staring out at it an unshaven man in 
           a booth, alone. Nothing on the table but a coke. Paper 
           wrapper tip still on the straw. The man’s name is WHITACRE. 

           A Burberry coat outside catches his eye. A man in his 60s, 
           too groomed for this neighborhood, looking lost. Finally his 
           eyes connect with Whitacre’s. 

           The man enters the diner, sits in the booth. His name is 
           GETTY. They watch each other a moment. 

                                 GETTY
                        I don’t remember you. 

                                 WHITACRE
                        Does it matter?

                                 GETTY
                        No, I suppose not.

           He smirks sadly as he looks off toward a waitress -

                                 WHITACRE
                        Whitacre. MJI development lab. 
                        Seven years, until you bought us. 
                        Tried not to ask questions after 
                        that... should have tried harder. 

           Getty turns back at this. 

           On Whitacre’s face now: his left eye with a subconjunctival 
           hemorrhage (bloody retina). The hand next to his coke: three 
           fingers bandaged together. 

           Getty absorbs this, looks away again, eyes wandering. 

                                 GETTY
                        I often don't recognize this world 
                        anymore. I remember when ‘pharmacy’ 
                        used to mean a place on the corner. 
                        Now it's patent wars, generic 
                        knockoffs slitting each others 
                        throats to squeeze blood from a 
                        policy. The things we've been made 
                        to do to survive... I started this 
                        company with very little, but 
                        everything I had. And I am proud of-

                                 WHITACRE
                        ...proud.
           Getty’s sermon falls silent as Whitacre places a black 
           document tube on the table. A glimpse at the label: 

           “GETTY PHARMACEUTICALS/MJI DIVISION DIAGNOSTIC No.117425” 

           A look. Whatever’s inside is nothing to be proud of. It sits 
           there, waiting to be claimed. 

           Getty eventually reaches for it. 

                                 GETTY
                        You believe I’m some stone-hearted 
                        prick for all this. Okay. But you 
                        are making the smart decision here. 
                        It’s easier for-

           Whitacre’s FIST comes down on the tube, pinning it to the 
           table. He’s trembling, a mix of boiling rage and exhaustion. 

           Cognizant of some hell Getty won’t understand. Finally:

                                 WHITACRE
                        If anything happens to me, to my 
                        family, there are arrangements. If 
                        the calls don’t stop, or the cars 
                        don’t leave, there are 
                        arrangements. If I feel I’m being 
                        followed, if I’m even fucking 
                        suspicious, this will go to every 
                        newspaper, network and government 
                        agency in the English speaking 
                        world. I’ll make sure copies get...

           Whitacre’s voice FADES as we suddenly begin to DRIFT AWAY 
           from their table. We’ve heard this speech before. Instead we 
           float down the counter toward a MAN listening at the end. 

           40s, greying temples, the etiquette of a library veteran 
           keeping quiet and to himself. This is TOM NAMATH.

           He pays his tab and rises.

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

           Commuters swaying in silence, Tom blended in with the rest.

           EXT. LENOX HILL POST OFFICE - NIGHT

           One of the older brick stations dotting the Upper East Side. 

           Tom exits onto the street, a black document tube under his 
           arm, similar to the one Whitacre brought Getty. 
           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A penthouse loft at the top of a fourth floor walk-up. 
           Industrial. Lived in. A decent record collection. A work 
           bench with a soldering lamp in the corner. An obscure device 
           with a keyboard but no screen. We’ll see this later. 

           A brick fireplace fills the living room wall - a remnant of a 
           different time. He's been here for years.

           Tom sits in the corner addressing an envelope to someplace in 
           VENEZUELA. Next to him on the bench are two pre-addressed 
           post cards, messages already written in. 

           One: "Weather’s been beautiful" The other: "Got rained out" 

           Tom slides them both inside the envelope and seals it shut. 

           EXT. CHELSEA NEIGHBORHOOD - DIFFERENT DAY

           Still raining. Tom stands across the street from a luxury 
           apartment building, eyeing a set of windows on the 5th floor. 

           They’re dark. No activity inside. 

           EXT. LENOX HILL POST OFFICE - LATER

           Flipping through a stack of mail as he walks out. Con Edison 
           bill, election flyers, junk mail... no postcard.  

           INT. COPY STORE - NIGHT

           The only customer this late. 

           Tom stands over the copier. We recognize the document tube on 
           the counter beside him, now open and empty. 

           Another copy spits into the tray. A glimpse at the Xerox’s 
           touch screen as it ticks down: 21 of 50

           As the high beams of the copy machine wash across his face...

                                 YOKUM (V.O.)
                        Insurance. It’s an 800 billion 
                        dollar a year industry. 

           INT. CHELSEA NEIGHBORHOOD - ANOTHER DAY

           Sunny now. Tom once again standing across the street. We see 
           the furniture has been moved out, a sign now hanging from the 
           fire escape: “2 Bedroom Available - Call 212 Management”
                                 YOKUM (V.O.)
                        Worried your house is going to burn 
                        down? You can get a policy. Call a 
                        broker. 

           EXT. LENOX HILL POST OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY

           Flipping through another stack of mail. Tom spots a card 
           peeking out. He turns it over. Just a dental office reminder. 

                                 YOKUM (V.O.)
                        Your horse, your kid’s teeth, your 
                        pop star’s ass, your entire 
                        company. Bad luck comes after it, 
                        call a broker.

           Tom slips it into the trash. 

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A record playing in the corner. The table has been pushed 
           aside, making room for the grid of manila envelopes now laid 
           across the floor. 

           Tom wears a pair of rubber nitrile gloves, methodically 
           packing each envelope with a copy as we catch glimpses of the 
           addresses on their front:

           The Wall Street Journal, CNBC, The Times of India, Al Jazeera

                                 YOKUM (V.O.)
                        But what if bad luck comes after 
                        you. See something you shouldn’t? 
                        Take something you wish you hadn’t? 
                        Get cold feet before you blow a 
                        whistle or blackmail someone out of 
                        your league, and now you’re jumpin’ 
                        at shadows you wish to God were 
                        just your imagination. 

           INT. MID-MANHATTAN PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT

           Tom sits at a computer. We see “NEW YORK DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC 
           HEALTH” at the top of the screen. And beneath it:

                                  PUBLIC DEATH RECORDS 

           An endless column of names and dates. As he scrolls through..

                                 YOKUM (V.O.)
                        That’s a different type of policy.
           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - ANOTHER DAY

           It’s snowing. A large duffel bag sits on the table, manila 
           envelopes now neatly packed inside. 

           Tom stands at a window overlooking 2nd avenue. His mind looks 
           busy, calculating.

                                 YOKUM (V.O.)
                        One they can’t come after. One that 
                        can protect the only leverage you 
                        have left. One that’s going to 
                        still be alive to come through if 
                        those shadows don’t stop at the 
                        door.

           INT. LENOX HILL POST OFFICE, LOBBY - DAY

           CUSTOMERS wrapped for winter, lined up at the service 
           windows. POSTAL WORKERS keeping up in the back.   

           Tom moves through the crowd, duffel slung over his shoulder. 
           He walks past the windows, turns a corner. 

           CORRIDOR

           A wall of P.O. boxes. Miniature windows built into each brass 
           door. Tom approaches, peers into one of them. Empty. 

           On Tom. A beat. He starts back toward the lobby...

           FLIT FLIT FLIT FLIT

           Sounds of paper hitting glass. Tom turns as empty P.O. BOX 
           windows start filling with mail. 

           The silhouette of a snow-covered USPS WINTER JACKET on the 
           other side. A late delivery, held up by the weather. 

           CLOSE ON Box 121 as a postcard slides inside. 

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           HIS DESK -

           One of the postcards from earlier has been sent back to him, 
           Venezuelan postage in the corner: “Weather’s been beautiful” 

           The duffel sits open and empty, the fireplace lit behind it. 

           TOM stands next to the mantel, feeding the last of the manila 
           envelopes into the flames. Watching it burn...
           EXT. LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY - NIGHT

           Floating over a car as it heads out of the city. 

           INT. TOM’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The black document tube laid across the back seat.

           Tom at the wheel, staring out as he ventures further and 
           further away from civilization. 

                                 YOKUM (V.O.)
                        You wanna protect your houseboat? 
                        Call State Farm.

           EXT. STORAGE FACILITY - NIGHT

           Late. Quiet. Hundreds of identical units in the middle of 
           nowhere. Tom’s car parked in front of the only one lit up. 

           STORAGE UNIT

           A series of shelves housing fireproof safes, file cabinets, 
           and cannisters. Some decades old. Meticulously arranged. A 
           mix between a library card catalogue and a catacomb. 

           The walls have been retrofitted with insulation. A control 
           panel monitoring temperature, humidity, barometric pressure. 

           Tom files away the contents of the document tube into a steel 
           drawer, locking it shut with a circular key. 

                                 YOKUM (V.O.)
                        You’re afraid a guy is gonna kill 
                        you? You call this guy. 

           Tom steps outside, and pulls the unit door shut. 

           BLACK. 

           INT. ATTORNEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           A card face down on the desk, a phone number written on the 
           back. After a moment a hand reaches in for it. UP TO:

           KAREN GRANT. 40s, VP dress code, betraying no emotions. 
           Except her hand is shaking. 

           An attorney, YOKUM, watching her as she studies the card. 

                                 KAREN
                        He’s with your firm?
                                 YOKUM
                        I’ve never met him. Or her. That’s 
                        kind of the point. Consider it a 
                        referral. 

                                 KAREN
                        I don’t need a referral, I need a 
                        lawyer-

                                 YOKUM
                        Someone left a bullet in my son’s 
                        lunch box yesterday. 

           Karen grows silent. Yokum reaches down, quietly sets an 
           accordion folder on his desk, slides it back to her. 

                                 YOKUM (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. 

           She looks back down at the business card, flips it over. A 
           GLIMPSE at the front: 

                           SHAW AND MOREL LLP
                              Dennis Yokum 
                     Arbitration & Mediation Attorney

                                 KAREN
                        Your referral, how did you find 
                        them?

           Yokum sits, choosing his words. 

                                 YOKUM
                        Arbitration is an inherently 
                        conflict-driven practice. I was in 
                        a difficult position. Someone gave 
                        me a number. 

                                 KAREN
                        And they’ve helped other clients of 
                        yours? 

                                 YOKUM
                        Some. The one’s we couldn’t.

           On Karen, skeptical. Yokum sees it. 

                                 YOKUM (CONT’D)
                        A pharmaceutical chemist, two UN 
                        translators and a New Jersey 
                        Supreme Court judge. 
                             (off her look, affirming)
                        Call that number, see if he takes 
                        your case. 
           She turns it back over, staring at the number. 

                                 KAREN
                        What will he ask me?

                                 YOKUM
                        Nothing. It’s a messaging service.
                        It’s a little 3 Days of the Condor, 
                        I know. You leave him a message and 
                        he calls you back. Or...he doesn’t.

           INT. BASEMENT, CHURCH OF SAINT CATHERINE - NIGHT

           Tom sitting quietly at a folding table. Twenty others seated 
           around the room, coffee cups and winter jackets. An AA group, 
           all listening to a MODERATOR somewhere off screen. 

                                 MODERATOR (O.S.)
                        ...for last week. Caesar has extra 
                        literature if anyone needs it. 
                             (paper shuffling)
                        Okay, let’s open up the last few 
                        for sharing. Who’s our timer? 

           Tom doesn’t offer. A hand goes up down the row.

                                 MODERATOR (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Rebecca, thank you. And who’s got 
                        something to talk about? 

           Tom, remaining silent. His usual answer. The silence hangs 
           into awkwardness. Finally a hand goes up in the bg --

                                 MODERATOR (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Yes, Amy. Five minutes, go ahead. 

           EXT. CHURCH OF SAINT CATHERINE - NIGHT

           Members filing out onto the sidewalk. Tom is flagged down by 
           another man, VANN. We’ll meet him later. They exchange a few 
           words before Tom continues on his way. 

           EXT. NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE - NIGHT

           Floating over Tom’s car again. 

           EXT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT

           Suburban New Jersey. The parking lot too full for a town this 
           size. Tom pulls in.
           INT. TOM’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Tom turns off the engine but stays inside. We see he’s 
           changed into a suit, watching the restaurant entrance.

           INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT

           A FUNERAL RECEPTION, rented out for the night. 40 people, all 
           black suits and dresses. Taking advantage of the open bar.

           Photos on an easel in the corner. Spanning the life of a 
           WOMAN in her 80s. 

           A group of men gathered near the bar. One notices Tom 
           entering, looking lost. This is RAY, a few years younger and 
           a slight resemblance. He breaks off.

                                 RAY
                        You got here...

                                 TOM
                        Hey Ray.

           They skip the handshake, embrace. 

                                 RAY
                        I wasn't sure you got all the 
                        details, I left it on your 
                        answering service thing- 

                                 TOM
                        Yeah I got it all, thanks.

           Ray nervously motions to the spread around them. 

                                 RAY
                        I hope this is okay. The pictures, 
                        I would have done the funeral you 
                        know but mom just kept sayin’- 

                                 TOM
                        You did good, don’t worry. This is 
                        good. How’s Nancy doing?

                                 RAY
                        Better than me. She’s here 
                        somewhere... 

           They look around the room a moment.

                                 TOM
                        Lot of people. Forgot she knew so 
                        many. She would have liked this. 
           Ray just nods, grabs Tom again. Emotional, a little drunk. 

           ACROSS THE ROOM

           THE TWO MEN Ray was talking to watch them.

                                 MAN 1
                        Who’s Ray talking to? 

                                 MAN 2
                        That’s his cousin Tommy.

                                 MAN 1
                        Cousin Tommy?

                                 MAN 2
                        Yeah, think he lived with Ray when 
                        they were kids. Mom died early.

                                 MAN 1
                        What’s he do? 

                                 MAN 2
                             (waving for another drink)
                        I dunno. Shipping insurance or 
                        something. 

           WITH TOM

           Alone now, standing in front of the photo display. 

           CLOSE ON: A younger photo of Ray’s mom, something from 1970s, 
           with another woman her age. Identical smiles. Sisters.

           We may not realize it yet, but the other woman is TOM’S 
           MOTHER.

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        I helped him put it together. 

           Tom turns to find a long-haired teenager, a high-school 
           hoodie thrown on over a black funeral skirt. This is NANCY, 
           Ray’s daughter. She motions to the photo of the two sisters.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        They looked alike huh?

           A beat. Tom just nods. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        When I was going through them all, 
                        you know how I could tell grandma 
                        and your mom apart? 
                                 TOM
                        How’s that?

                                 NANCY
                        Grandma was always the one with the 
                        cigarette. 

           They both smile at this. Tom nods at her hoodie - a cartoon 
           Husky beneath the lettering. 

                                 TOM
                        Huskies huh. When I was there it 
                        was the Mammoths.

                                 NANCY
                        Well, guess it was time for a 
                        change. Mammoths are extinct.  

           At Tom, a tease. Tom shrugs, defensive, eyes wandering...

                                 TOM
                        Oh I don’t know, there could still 
                        be one or two of us still hanging 
                        around we just didn’t notice. 

           He stops, nods toward the corner behind her. She looks -

           A thick man at the bar, one of the mourners. Long hair, mangy 
           beard. Nancy turns back, stifles a laugh. Tom grins, 
           something familiar here. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        So how is it going. School.

                                 NANCY
                        Good. I graduate next month. 
                             (off Tom’s surprise)
                        I guess it’s been a while huh?

           A sad silence. Tom’s gaze drifts to the bar. And then -

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you come?

                                 TOM
                        You want me to come by?

                                 NANCY
                        No I want you to like, come see it. 
                        Plus I’m having a graduation party 
                        after. You could bring someone if 
                        you want. That girl you brought to 
                        dad’s-
                             (Tom winces slightly)
                                 (MORE)
                                 NANCY (CONT'D)
                        Or just you. Maybe finally settle 
                        the reigning gin rummy champion of 
                        New Jersey. 

           Tom gives her a look. She smiles back.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        So you’ll come?

           A beat.

                                 TOM
                        Okay, yeah. 

                                 NANCY
                        Good, it’s just at the high school. 
                        Hey what’s your address?
                             (pulling out her phone)
                        I’ll send you the invite. 

           Tom balks a little.

                                 TOM
                        ...you can just, leave me a 
                        message. 

           EXT. RECORD SHOP - LATE NIGHT

           Watching Tom alone inside, flipping through the racks. He 
           starts strolling down the aisle, a zen look on his face. We 
           get the sense he spends a lot of nights here. 

           EXT. 2ND AVENUE - DAY

           Tom walks groceries toward his apartment building. He digs 
           out his keys, starts to unlock the door, slows... 

           TWO MEN on the corner, pointing up at his building. Generic 
           looking, grey raincoats and slacks. 

           If they notice Tom, they don’t appear interested.

           Tom lowers his head, disappears inside. 

           PRELAP: the short tones of an international call. Straight to 
           the machine. We recognize the caller’s voice as Whitacre’s.

                                 WHITACRE (RECORDING)
                        I wasn’t sure if this number would 
                        still be working. 
           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Tom, headphone in his ear, listening to the message while he 
           watches the two men from the window. Something feels off. 

                                 WHITACRE (RECORDING) (CONT’D)
                        I waited like you said, but I made 
                        it. I’m guessing you got the post 
                        card so you knew that already. 
                             (pause)
                        I know you and I are finished with 
                        this thing. I’m not sure why I’m 
                        calling. Not even sure you still 
                        listen, you may not even get this. 
                        I guess I just wanted to thank you.

           Tom listens, motionless.

                                 WHITACRE (CONT’D)
                        It's strange down here. I know this 
                        was the plan, all of it. But -
                             (silence again, then)
                        I can't help but keep asking 
                        myself, what I did...am I a coward?

           The message ends. Tom, a little troubled by this last part.

           He goes to check the window again when suddenly a NEW message 
           begins to play. We recognize the female voice. 

                                 KAREN (RECORDING)
                        ...Yes I was given this number. 
                        There weren’t many instructions. My 
                        name is --

           She halts. Nervous. We get the sense she might hang up. Then - 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        My name is Karen Grant and I am in 
                        possession of something that does 
                        not belong to me.

           Tom turns back to the window. The two men are gone. He rises, 
           starting toward his desk, listening as he gets to work. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - DAY

           Karen jogging. Soft outlines of RUNNERS behind her. They 
           could be other joggers. They could be keeping up. 

                                 KAREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...something that could prove very 
                        damaging to my employers. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KAREN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        W-we intended to bring this to 
                        authorities, go public, but...

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY

           Karen rides, glances at her phone, pretending not to notice: 

           A MAN AND WOMAN down the car, fellow runners, eyes down. 

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        My lawyer has a family. We were 
                        being followed. I’m still being, 
                        intimidated. I’m afraid. 

           INT. KAREN’S CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT

           3:00 AM. Every light on. 

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        I can’t go through with this 
                        anymore. 

           An exec’s budget. Hotel sterile. Newly installed dead bolts 
           on the door. Her office in boxes against the wall. A block of 
           kitchen knives next to an empty bed, one missing.

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        I’m ready to give it back but once 
                        I do, now that I know, they’ll have 
                        no reason to stop coming after me. 
                        I was told you might be able to act 
                        as a liaison. To help return it 
                        with some... protections.

           Karen sleeps on the couch, a muted TV left on for company.  

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        And I don’t know how this works but 
                        whatever it is - I’ll pay it.
                             (dead air)
                        I’ll be at this line all night. 

           ANGLE ON

           A cell phone on the table as it LIGHTS UP, starts ringing. 
           Karen stirs, instantly grabs for it through the fog of sleep. 

                                 KAREN (ON PHONE)
                        Yes hello.

           Dead silence. Bordering on eerie. Then --
                                 VOICE (RECORDING)
                        Congratulations, you have been 
                        approved for a student loan debt 
                        forgiveness plan from -- 

           She hangs up. Her face falls. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Karen at the window, looking down at the street. Cars parked 
           for the night. A darkened late model UTILITY VAN amongst them- 

           INT. CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - DAY

           It’s raining. Karen running HARD this time, pounding forward. 

           INT. KAREN’S CONDOMINIUM - DAY

           Steam from the other room the only sign of life. 

           A phone on the counter begins to ring. Karen runs in, soaked. 

                                 KAREN
                        Hello? 

                                 OPERATOR (OVER PHONE)
                        Hello. This is relay operator 2217. 

           On Karen, unsure she heard right. 

                                 KAREN
                        I’m sorry?

                        A person is calling through the 
                        relay service. Have you received a 
                        relay call before?

                        ...I don’t think so.

                        The person who has called you is 
                        deaf or hard of hearing. The caller 
                        will type their conversation and 
                        I'll read it to you. When it's your 
                        turn to speak, I'll type everything 
                        heard. Please speak directly to the 
                        caller, and say "go ahead" when 
                        you're ready for a response. One 
                        moment for your call to begin.
           We hear typing on the other end. 

                                 OPERATOR (CONT’D)
                             (reading, unemotional)
                        I'm returning your call. I am going 
                        to ask you some questions, please 
                        only speak to answer these 
                        questions. Do not volunteer any 
                        additional information. Do you 
                        understand? 

           On Karen, this is surreal.

                                 KAREN
                        Yes I understand. 

           More typing. A beat.

                                 KAREN
                        Yes... go ahead. 

                                 OPERATOR

                        What is the nature of the item that 
                        does not belong to you?

                                 KAREN
                        It’s a redacted FDA proposal for a 
                        protein-based tobacco substitute we 
                        were developing. Go ahead. 
                                 OPERATOR
                        Why was it redacted? 

                                 KAREN
                        It included an early case study 
                        with symptoms consistent with other 
                        carcinogens. Essentially our 
                        synthetic strain was still causing 
                        the natural harmful effects. Go 
                        ahead.

                                 OPERATOR
                        Why do they want it now?

                        Our company is on the verge of a 
                        400 million dollar acquisition by 
                        Philip Morris. Namely for the 
                        promise of the protein-strain. The 
                        publication of that case would 
                        endanger the deal, and with nine 
                        years of R&D invested, Synth-AG 
                        likely wouldn’t recover. Go ahead.

                                 OPERATOR
                        Why did you take it?

                        If it wasn’t published, the product 
                        could go to market. I felt a 
                        responsibility for that. I still 
                        do, I just -- there’s a...
                             (cutting herself off)
                        I’m sorry. Go ahead. 

           A pause. 

                                 OPERATOR
                        And why did you call me?

           Karen sits with this a moment. 

                                 KAREN
                        I have no one else to trust. 
                             (beat)
                        Does this mean you’ll help me?
                        Go ahead.

           Typing. And then, silence. 

                                 OPERATOR
                        And your caller has hung up. Thank

           EXT. TRIBECA STREET - DAY

           The utility van. 

           INT. UTILITY VAN - DAY

           ANGLE ON

           A LAPTOP SCREEN: “Incoming Line ISP 104.193.19.59/Routing...”

           A retrofitted 16 passenger - a surveillance rack and work 
           bench. Urban. Professional. Two TECHNICIANS hovering over a 
           laptop as a directory scrolls. 

           An ADDRESS appears: 339 East Ave, Livingston, New York

           EXT. CALL CENTER, UPSTATE NEW YORK - EVENING

           Brick, functional. Satellite dishes on the roof. 

           INT. CALL CENTER, UPSTATE NEW YORK - EVENING

           The man and woman we saw behind Karen on the subway, now 
           fresh pressed in attorney-stiff overcoats. Early forties, 
           posture and haircuts of former military. HOBBS and ROSETTI.  

           A sprawling cubical landscape behind them. They sit watching 
           a CALL CENTER SUPERVISOR page through an ancient department 
           manual, taking her time. On the night shift for a reason. 

           Eventually she finds her page. Begins to read...

                                 SUPERVISOR
                        The Americans with Disabilities Act 
                        of 1990 section 225 prohibits relay 
                        operators from disclosing the 
                        content of any relayed conversation 
                        and from keeping records of the 
                        content of any such conversation 
                        beyond the duration of the call.

           She leans back. Hobbs and Rosetti exchange a look.

                                 HOBBS
                        We can get a warrant. 

           The supervisor just stares. Creaks forward. Starts paging 
           through again. Finally...
                                 SUPERVISOR
                        Relay conversations will be 
                        protected by exclusionary rules 
                        preventing the revelation of such 
                        conversations and their fruit in 
                        criminal proceedings, thus giving 
                        the ADA confidentiality provision 
                        its greatest effect.

           She closes the book, stares over her glasses. 

                                 SUPERVISOR (CONT’D)
                        Even if you got a warrant, there'd 
                        be nothing to search. We don't keep 
                        records of our logs, where they're 
                        going to or where they're coming 
                        from. We direct over 79,000 calls a 
                        day. You think I know where your 
                        damn number is? 

           On Hobbs and Rosetti. They’ve lost here. 

           INT. TOM’S BUILDING, STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Tom descends the stairs. We hear noises behind the staircase. 
           A maintenance man, wrangling the trash cans out to the 
           street. 30s, Puerto Rican. This is LUIS. 

           Tom gets the door for him. 

                                 LUIS
                        Oh, thank you Mr. Namath. How we 
                        doin’ tonight?

                                 TOM
                        Fine. 

                                 LUIS
                        Marcia and I meant to thank you for 
                        the holiday tip. Very generous. 

           Tom nods, lets him pass. 

           OUTSIDE

           Tom starts on his way. Doubles back -

                                 TOM
                        Hey Luis. Have you noticed anyone 
                        lately? Sort of hanging around 
                        outside the building? 

           Luis thinks to himself, shakes his head. 
                                 LUIS
                        No I don’t think so. But they only 
                        got me here a couple hours Tuesdays 
                        and Fridays now for the trash. 

           Tom thinks, nods casually. 

                                 TOM
                        Well, have a good night. 

           He starts off down the sidewalk. 

                                 LUIS
                        You too Mr. N. 
                             (then, calling out)
                        You want me to report it or 
                        something? 

           Tom just waves. 

           INT. WEST VILLAGE DINER - NIGHT

           A knock-off of the diner from the opening. Simple. 
           Unremarkable. On a corner. 

           Tom sits with VANN, the man from his AA group. Queens born, a 
           talker, mindful of his shirt and tie while he wolfs down 
           corned beef hash.

                                 VANN
                        ...tow truck pulls it out, he knows 
                        the car, I know the car. Owner was 
                        the goddamn chief of police. 
                        Pissin’ himself, couldn’t even put 
                        on his shoes. 

           Tom’s eyes wander, but not bored - like he’s mapping the 
           room. The windows. The exits.

                                 VANN (CONT’D)
                        I could have been that guy. I was 
                        that guy. Look at him now, eighteen 
                        years in - done.
                             (he snaps, staring off)
                        I used to bowl with that guy... 

           Vann sees Tom, now attentive, listening. No comments.

                                 VANN (CONT’D)
                        I like how you asked me to be your 
                        sponsor, I end up fucking pouring 
                        out everything to you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 VANN (CONT’D)
                        Make me feel better. What’s shitty 
                        in your world?

           Tom shrugs. Nods at his plate.

                                 VANN (CONT’D)
                        Hey you wanted the change. Nothing 
                        wrong with the food at that place 
                        on 2nd. 

                                 TOM
                        I like trying new places. 

                                 VANN
                        Well, happy I could oblige your 
                        wanderlust. 

           A waitress floats past with the check. As VANN digs out a few 
           bills we catch a glimpse of a badge. 

                                 VANN (CONT’D)
                        My turn. You want anything else?

                                 TOM
                        Nah I gotta go to work. 

           Vann smirks as he watches Tom collect his coat. 

                                 VANN
                        Work. You need a real day job.  

                                 TOM
                        Yeah what’s a real day job?

                                 VANN
                        One where you don’t wear shorts. 

           A weekly dig. Tom just pats him on the shoulder as he exits.

           INT. KAREN’S CONDOMINIUM - DAY

           A PHONE on the table. Silent. 

           Karen back at the window. Trance-like, watching the utility 
           van. It hasn’t moved. A BUZZER breaks her out of it.

           Another buzz. Someone’s downstairs. 

           THE INTERCOM

                                 KAREN 
                        Who is it?
           She presses the two-way button, listening. Tries again. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Who is it?

           Dead air and static. Then --

                                 VOICE (OVER INTERCOM)
                        Package. 

           INT. LOBBY, KAREN’S BUILDING - DAY

           Karen steps out of the elevators. A double set of glass doors 
           lead out to the street, light flooding in. No one’s there.  

           Karen walks closer, cautious. She peers out: Pedestrians. The 
           back of a POSTAL WORKER as they continue down the block. 

           Something at her feet.

           INT. KAREN’S CONDOMINIUM - DAY

           Looking down on a box. A little beat up. No return address. 

           Karen, hesitant. She gingerly begins to cut it open, lifts 
           out a BACKPACK. She digs further in. Nothing else. 

           She turns over the backpack, checks the pockets, finds:

           - Two ACCORDION PORTFOLIOS: An empty manila envelope in one 

           - A stack of CURRENCY STRAPS in the other, generic. “$1,000” 
           printed on their labels. His fee.

           - A CELL PHONE, older model Motorola. A dial pad. A charger 
           with it.

           - An ENVELOPE, sealed. Instructions. And finally...

           A PLANE TICKET in her name - PIT to ATL... 

           EXT. PENNSYLVANIA - EARLY MORNING

           Over a TRAIN as it cuts through the Pennsylvania countryside.

           INT. AMTRAK TRAIN CAR - SAME

           Karen sitting against the window, industrial landscapes 
           blurring past. The backpack in the seat beside her. 
           A DINING CAR ATTENDANT and cart roll into frame.

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Coffee ma’am? 

                                 KAREN
                        No, thank you. 

           The attendant smiles, moves on. We STAY WITH HER, offering 
           the same along the way. Several rows ahead... 

                                 ATTENDANT
                        Coffee ma’am? Sir? 

           They decline. As she moves past we reveal HOBBS and ROSETTI, 
           another pair of New England commuters enjoying the quiet car.  

           EXT. PITTSBURGH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Glass and concrete hubs. Hundreds flowing in and out, cars 
           and shuttles crawling along the curb.  

           INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL, SECURITY LINE - DAY

           Karen unloads through security, backpack in the tray, arms 
           raised toward the scanner. As she steps through... 

           ROSETTI back behind the TSA entrance, watching Karen 
           disappear toward her gate. 

           INT. UTILITY VAN - DAY

           Hobbs and the two technicians, MOSLEY and KUAN. A KNOCK as 
           the van door slides open, Rosetti climbing in. 

                                 ROSETTI
                        No one else. She went through. 

           Eyes turning to HOBBS. Quietly he reaches into his jacket, 
           starts unarming himself. A nod toward Rosetti and Mosley. 
           They follow suit. A pile on the workbench starting to form:

           Latex gloves...syringe case...P380 pistol...taser...zip ties

           INT. SHOPPING CORRIDOR, PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - DAY

           Posh travel stores and kiosks. Karen heads toward her gate, 
           backpack on, flowing with the rest of the crowd. 
           INT. LUGGAGE STORE, PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

           As Karen passes by outside... 

           TOM

           Browsing a wall of roll-aways. He pulls a black carry-on off 
           the rack, glances at the empty ID tag - gives it a once-over. 

           REGISTER

           Tom sets the carry-on on the counter. The cashier scans it.

                                 CASHIER
                        Total comes to 119.82. Anything 
                        else today? 

                                 TOM
                        Just the bag, thanks. 

           Tom sets out a few bills, glances out at the terminal while 
           he waits for his change. Then --

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Actually, any way I could borrow a 
                        pen? 

           INT. CONCOURSE, PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - DAY

           Tom takes a seat against the wall at a bank of pay phones, 
           the new bag beside him. From behind he looks like everyone 
           else. But in front of him - 

           He unearths the keyboard device we saw on his workbench. 

           This is a TTY machine (or “teletype”). Something between a 
           laptop and an early model pager. A full keyboard underneath a 
           scrolling green LCD display, an acoustic phone cradle beside 
           a call indicator light.  

           This device is real, store bought and for the deaf, possibly 
           with a few home-made alterations. 

           Tom plugs his own phone into the device. We see the LCD 
           screen LIGHT UP, powering on. Then, scrolling across: 

                 “...HELLO, THIS IS OPERATOR 627... HOW MAY I CONNECT YOUR 
                                  CALL?...GO AHEAD...” 

           INT. GATE, PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - DAY

           Karen waits, nervous. 
           A loud unfamiliar ring. She jumps, realizes it’s the older 
           Motorola phone she’s been sent. She answers.

                                 KAREN (ON PHONE)
                        Hello?
                             (a pause)
                        Yes, I’ve gotten one before... 
                        thank you, I’ll hold.  

           She waits. The call connects.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        I’m at my gate. I think we’re about 
                        to board. When I land what do we- 
                        well where should I go? Go ahead.

           She listens, a panic growing. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t understand, they’re both 
                        packed, like you said. How will we- 

           She scans the area around her. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        ...I-I’m listening. Go ahead. 

           INT. TSA ENTRANCE, PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - DAY

           Rosetti and Mosley clearing security. Gathering their things-

                                 MOSLEY
                             (under his breath)
                        Turned TSA into their personal 
                        bouncer. Never seen that. 

                                 ROSETTI 
                        Tie your fucking shoe. 

           He looks down, kneels. Hobbs already ahead, buying a paper. 
           All slowing as...

                                 SERVICE AGENT (OVER PA)
                        Passenger Karen Grant, please 
                        return to the lost property counter 
                        in Terminal D. Passenger Karen 
                        Grant, lost property counter in 
                        Terminal D. 

           On Hobbs.

           FROM AFAR: Momentarily conferring with the others. They 
           separate, Hobbs heading in another direction. 
           INT. PROPERTY COUNTER, PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - DAY

           At the dead end of a corridor, away from the foot-traffic. 
           Hobbs seated on a nearby bench, newspaper out. Waiting. 

           A SERVICE AGENT types behind the property counter. Innocuous. 

           Hobbs careens his head toward the concourse. Only travelers 
           criss-crossing back and forth. Every direction but his.  

                                 SERVICE AGENT (O.S.)
                        Sir. May I help you with anything? 

           Hobbs turns back, the agent now looking up from her monitor. 
           He’s been here a while. He puts on a smile.

                                 HOBBS
                        Just, staying out of the zoo.

           He motions toward the concourse. The agent nods politely, 
           returns to her screen. Hobbs flashes another look down the 
           hall, settles back in.

           Then -

                                 GATE AGENT (OVER PA)
                        Passenger Karen Grant, please 
                        report to Gate B17. Passenger Karen 
                        Grant, Gate B17. Thank you. 

           Hobbs, thrown. What the hell is happening. As he rises...  

           ANGLE ON

           The agent, watching him go. We DRIFT DOWN behind the counter: 

           The black carry-on Tom purchased. 

           INT. GATE - PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - DAY

           The tail end of a PASSENGER LINE filing onto the jet bridge. 
           As they disappear inside we see MOSLEY, waiting on an ever 
           thinning bench, nervous. 

           He spots Hobbs coming down the terminal, intercepts him.

                                 HOBBS
                             (low)
                        Where is she?
                                 MOSLEY
                        Never got on, I don’t know. That’s 
                        why they’re paging her, they’re 
                        about to close the doors.

           They stand there, eyes darting, minds running.

                                 GATE AGENT (OVER PA)
                        Last call for flight 8317. All 
                        rows, all passengers.

           The remaining seats emptying out. Hobbs, watching. And then- 

           He stops, face falling. He realizes what’s happening. 

                                 MOSLEY
                        Should we circle back? If he’s 
                        following her he’s got to be 
                        somewhere in the- 

                                 HOBBS
                        He wasn’t following her. 

           Mosley, still not getting it, looking for answers. But Hobbs 
           just stares forward, fuming, impotent. It’s too late.

           They’re being exposed. 

           TOM

           Observing from the across the terminal, taking stock of 
           Hobbs, the man he followed here, now beside Mosley.

           The only two remaining at the gate.

           HOBBS

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                        We’re made. Both of us. Let’s go. 

           As they walk off...

                                 GATE AGENT (OVER PA)
                        ...Final call. Passenger Karen 
                        Grant, please report to Gate B17... 

           EXT. PITTSBURGH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Making their way down the crowded arrivals sidewalk, the van 
           in the distance ahead. Hobbs’ finger goes to his ear, a call 
           coming through. Answering.
                                 HOBBS 
                        Yeah. 

                                 ROSETTI (OVER PHONE)
                        I’ve got her.

           INT. TERMINAL, PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - AT THAT MOMENT

           Rosetti, leaning against the wall, headphones in. 

                                 HOBBS (OVER PHONE)
                        How’s it look? 

                                 ROSETTI
                        She’s passing it off now. 

                                 HOBBS
                        So you’ve got him?

           A beat. She looks away...

                                 ROSETTI
                        No. 
                                                            REVERSE TO:

           PITTSBURGH AIRPORT POST OFFICE

           A full service USPS within the terminal. 

           Karen stands at the register inside, two white boxes on the 
           counter beside her. Similar sizes to the accordion portfolios 
           we saw earlier. 

           WITH KAREN

           As the clerk takes the second box off the scale. 

                                 CLERK
                        Does either box contain anything 
                        fragile, liquid, perishable, or 
                        potentially hazardous including 
                        lithium batteries and perfume? 

                                 KAREN
                        No. 

                                 CLERK
                        Would you like to add any package 
                        insurance or signature confirmation 
                        today? 

                                 KAREN
                        No.
                                 CLERK
                        Both going priority mail first 
                        class, 1-3 business days. You can 
                        insert your card.

           Karen pays as the clerk momentarily disappears behind the 
           counter with the boxes. 

           ROSETTI, watching this from afar.

           Karen takes her receipt from the clerk, discarding it as she 
           nervously heads for the exit, disappearing down the terminal. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Rosetti wanders inside. She grabs a blank package slip, 
           pretends to fill it out. A glance over the counter... 

           The boxes are gone. 

           A beat. She turns to leave, throwing the slip away on her way 
           out... and stops. A piece of paper, sitting on top. 

           GLIMPSES of its print: 

           Two parcels... costs... weights... tracking numbers...

           Karen’s receipt.

           INT. AIRPORT TRAM CAR - DAY

           Tom rides between concourses. Another face in the crowd, on 
           his way to the parking lot. 

           The tram makes a stop, a team of girls volleyball players, 
           Nancy’s age, all cramming on. Tom makes room. 

           The tram pulls away again, the girls drowning everything out. 
           Tom closes his eyes... suddenly snaps them open again. 

           EXT. NEW JERSEY HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK

           Tom’s car screeching to a halt at the curb. Tom slams the 
           door behind him, hustling across the front lawn.

           AHEAD

           Lights on in the gymnasium, offering some hope. 

           As Tom closes in a JANITOR exits the gym door, offering a 
           glimpse of what’s inside. An empty stage. Folding chairs 
           being put away. A few graduation caps left behind.
           Tom slows. It’s over. 

           INT. BASEMENT, CHURCH OF SAINT CATHERINE - NIGHT

           An AA meeting in progress. Tom at his usual spot. The timer 
           going off as one member finishes. Another hand goes up -- 

           It’s VANN. As he starts SOUND FADES...

           PRELAP: Karen’s voice. 

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        So, how does this work?

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Tom sitting down at his workbench, pulling the TTY keyboard 
           forward. 

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        There are rules. 

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. KAREN’S CONDOMINIUM - DAY

           Karen, just a silhouette at the window. The clunky outline of 
           the Motorola. (note: she will use this phone moving forward)

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        There’s going to be an order to 
                        this.

           As Tom types we see his words scroll across the display, but 
           we’ll start to hear each of their voices as if they’re having 
           the conversation directly. 

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        Everybody follows it, we’ll finish. 
                        Each side has obligations. Don’t 
                        worry about theirs. Follow yours, 
                        you’ll be okay. 

           Karen stares down at the street.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        You use the phone I gave you. Do 
                        not contact them. Do not respond if 
                        they contact you, and they will. 
                        They’ll try to scare you, they’ll 
                        try and make a deal. But pay 
                        attention, there is no other deal. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                             (then)
                        You’re going to meet them exactly 
                        once to make the return. I will 
                        tell you both where and when. It 
                        will be open, it will be public, it 
                        will be short. 

                                 KAREN (V.O)
                        And you’ll be there. 

           Hopeful. Tom pauses at this, resumes typing. 

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        You and I will never meet. Let me 
                        be clear, I am not a body guard. 
                        I’m a broker. Follow the steps, 
                        you’re going to be protected. But 
                        if you do anything to put yourself 
                        in danger, I will not come back for 
                        you. I will walk away. 

           On Karen, absorbing this.

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        ...I understand. 

           At home, reading her hesitation.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        You need to be sure you want to do 
                        this. I’m not here for your 
                        morality, I’m here for your safety. 
                        If at the last second your 
                        conscience gets a second wind and 
                        you want to go public, or do some 
                        version of the right thing, you're 
                        on your own. 

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        No. I’m done running. 

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        They’re not done chasing. 

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        But you’re involved now. They’ll 
                        know that, why would they try 
                        anything?

           Beat.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        They’ll try.
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

           Darkened office space. Could be anywhere. Karen’s POST OFFICE 
           RECEIPT projected against the wall:

                    Parcel                    Parcel

                                 HOBBS (O.S.)
                        So the guy uses airport security. 

           Hobbs talks to the screen, his questions at himself as much 
           as the room. Rosetti, Mosley and Kuan staring behind him. 

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                        He could have done the same at JFK, 
                        LaGuardia, Newark. Why go all the 
                        way to Pittsburgh?

                                 MOSLEY
                             (offering)
                        That’s where he’s operating from.

                                 ROSETTI
                        Then why have her send these 
                        halfway across the country? 

           No answer. Then, reading:

                                 KUAN (O.S.)
                        Since 2001 the TSA has closed or 
                        relocated over 113 airport branches 
                        of the United States Post Office. 
                        The only remaining full-service 
                        post office inside security...

           Kuan stops reading, turns his laptop around. 

                                 KUAN (CONT’D)
                        Pittsburgh International airport.

           Hobbs rubs his face. He hasn’t slept.

                                 HOBBS
                        Okay, two packages. Why split them 
                        up? 

                                 ROSETTI
                        Decoy? Second party? 
                                 MOSLEY
                        Tracking confirmed they’re both 
                        going to P.O. boxes. Both due to 
                        arrive in two days. 

           Back at the projection. 

                                 ROSETTI
                        First one’s the money. 

                                 KUAN
                        ...adds up. FDA report is 211 
                        pages, standard letter, that’s 2 
                        pounds. With packaging... that’s 
                        Davenport. Like she said, 
                        Scottsdale’s the money.

                                 MOSLEY
                        So which one is he going after 
                        first? 

           The room falls quiet, no one willing to venture a guess. This 
           guy is an anomaly. Finally Hobbs turns from the projection, 
           throws them all a look. 

           EXT. POST OFFICE, SCOTTSDALE ARIZONA - MORNING

           Harsh sunlight. Mosley shields his eyes as he exits, digging 
           out a phone as he heads toward a rental car in the lot. 

           He waits while it rings, leans on the hood - yanks his hand 
           back, the metal already baking. As the other end answers -

                                 MOSLEY (ON PHONE)
                        Yeah I got nothing. Box is still 
                        empty, tailed anyone picking up. 
                        Either we’re missing something or 
                        it never showed. Any luck there?

           INT. ANOTHER RENTAL CAR - AT THAT MOMENT

           Rosetti listening. She hangs up without answering. Just sits 
           there, troubled, annoyed. She climbs out.

           EXT. POST OFFICE, DAVENPORT IOWA - CONTINUOUS

           RISING as she heads inside, the patchwork quilt of FARMLAND 
           in the distance. 
           INT. POST OFFICE, DAVENPORT IOWA - CONTINUOUS

           Vacant. No one at the counter. This is a small operation. 

           Rosetti clocks one of the PO box windows for the hundredth 
           time. Still empty. 

           An elderly USPS employee emerges from the back. Rosetti 
           throws on a smile, starts toward him.  

                                 ROSETTI
                        Hi there. 

                                 ELDERLY USPS
                        Good afternoon. How are we today?

                                 ROSETTI
                        Well, my friend asked me to pick up 
                        his mail for him, and I noticed he 
                        hasn’t been receiving anything the 
                        last few days. He’s expecting a 
                        package... is there any way it’s 
                        being held in the back?

                                 ELDERLY USPS
                        Well if it was, you’d still have a 
                        package slip in the box. 

                                 ROSETTI
                             (smiles, playful)
                        No way it’s hiding somewhere? I can 
                        come back with the tracking number, 
                        if that’s helpful. 

                                 ELDERLY USPS
                        I’m sorry ma’am. I was just back 
                        there, everything left is going out 
                        with a carrier this afternoon.

           On Rosetti, resigned.

                                 ROSETTI
                        I’ll let him know. Thanks anyway. 

                                 ELDERLY USPS
                        Yes ma’am.  

           She turns to leave, the facade dropping as she goes. She 
           pushes through the doors -- 

                                 ELDERLY USPS (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Did they recently move? 
                                 ROSETTI
                        I’m sorry?

                                 ELDERLY USPS
                        Did they move recently? If they 
                        did, whatever address it was 
                        originally sent to, they could have 
                        put a forwarding address on file, 
                        once it arrives it’ll get rerouted 
                        to the new one, may take an extra 
                        couple days. 

           He shrugs, hoping to be helpful. Through her teeth -- 

                                 ROSETTI
                        Mail forwarding...could be. And any 
                        limits to where you’ll forward to? 

                                 ELDERLY USPS
                        No ma’am we’ll pass it along to, 
                        well just about anywhere. 

           He smiles.

           EXT. LENOX HILL POST OFFICE, NEW YORK - AFTERNOON

           Tom exits onto the street, two familiar white boxes under his 
           arm. 

           EXT. 2ND AVENUE - CONTINUOUS

           As he rounds the corner. Stops. 

           ACROSS THE STREET

           His apartment building. Three FIGURES talking on the roof. 
           One in a GREY RAINCOAT we saw earlier on the curb. Broad 
           daylight but too far away to see much else. 

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, BACKSIDE - AFTERNOON

           Looking into Tom’s apartment through the rear window, framed 
           by the fire escape. The soft taps of rubber on metal. 

           Tom ascends up the fire escape into frame, about to continue 
           upwards when he pauses. The calculating stare we saw earlier.

           He finds a KEY RING on his belt, quietly but quickly unlocks 
           his own window and slips inside his apartment. 
           From our angle his next moves are a mystery, but moments 
           later he reappears, continuing upward toward the roof. 

           AT THE TOP

           Just under the edge, crouched against the wall. He listens: 
           Wind, car horns, the glockenspiel of the city. He peers over-

           THE ROOF

           It’s deserted. Vents, the chimneys below, the staircase 
           access door. Lifeless. 

           TOM

           For the first time looking thrown himself. As he starts down, 
           we now see the glint of a HAND GUN tucked behind his shirt. 

           PRELAP: A phone ringing...

           INT. UTILITY VAN - AFTERNOON

           A CELL PHONE on the seat, the screen lighting up: 

                                      INCOMING CALL

                                          7-1-1
                                         Unknown

           Hobbs and Kuan at the work bench. Hobbs stares at the screen, 
           flashes it to Kuan - who shakes his head - doesn’t know what 
           to make of it either. Hobbs sets it to speaker, answers. 

                                 HOBBS
                        Hello.

                                 OPERATOR (OVER PHONE)

                        before?

           Hobbs and Kuan, eyes up. It’s him. 

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - AT THAT MOMENT

           The white boxes opened on the table. Tom at his desk, one of 
           the accordion portfolios beside him. He waits. 

           A green signal light appears on the TTY machine. “Call 
           Connected”. He starts typing. We hear the operator’s voice...
                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)(OVER PHONE)
                        Page nine.

           INTERCUT WITH:

           Hobbs and Kuan. The operator continues -

                                 OPERATOR (CONT’D)

           Hobbs and Kuan. What the fuck is this?

           Kuan, picking up on it. He reaches for his laptop. Starts 
           transcribing as the operator reads...

                                 OPERATOR (CONT’D)

                        addiction.

           TOM

           The redacted FDA REPORT open beside him. He flips through, 
           selects another section, begins copying off the page. 

                                 OPERATOR (CONT’D)

           Tom pauses. Sees his is LCD screen flickering in and out. He 
           frowns, taps it. It returns to normal. He resumes typing. 

                                 OPERATOR (CONT’D)

           KUAN highlights his passage, searches. Matches it to a PDF on 
           his laptop. He turns the screen to Hobbs:

           Side by side, to the letter. He’s giving them excerpts. 
                                 OPERATOR (CONT’D)

                        toxic impacts of nicotine exposure.

           Silence. Long. It appears Tom is finished. 

                                 HOBBS (ON PHONE)
                        What do you want? Go ahead.

                        She violated a non-disclosure

                        property, she’s harboring 
                        proprietary research. I was hired 
                        by the owner of that research. 
                        We’re not in the wrong here. She 
                        took something she shouldn’t have.

                        Here’s how this works. We’re going 
                        to walk the situation back. No more 
                        threats, no publication. No more 
                        surveillance, no further copies. 
                        Once I’m satisfied with both 
                        parties, I’ll facilitate the return

                        That first number you called, 
                        you’re going to use it every night

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE FLOOR:

           As Tom lifts up a panel in the wood. 

           A metal footlocker underneath, a built-in combo lock on the 
           front. Tom dials in the combination, lifts the lid. Inside: 

           The circular KEYS from the storage unit. And the HAND GUN we 
           saw earlier, resting in the foam. Tom sets Karen’s report in 
           beside it, grabs the panel, and closes us back inside.

           EXT. KAREN’S BUILDING - NEXT DAY

           Karen stands just outside the doors, timid. Eye’s surveying.  
           No strangers hovering. No white vans. She starts walking. 

           INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

           A dying shop, hanging onto the past. Karen walks the aisles, 
           finds the band she’s looking for. She flips through, pulling 
           an album out: THE WHO - MY GENERATION

           She turns it over, smirks. 

           Side B - first track: “The Kids are Alright”.
           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Tom waits against a building, dials into his service. 

                                 KAREN (RECORDING)
                        All right. 

           He tucks his headphone away, checking for cars as he starts 
           across the street toward...

           EXT. LENOX HILL POST OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Nodding at a passing POSTAL WORKER as he jogs up the steps.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - ANOTHER DAY

           Karen runs.

           INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - LATER

           Riding back. She looks down the car. No Hobbs. No Rosetti. No 
           shadows in sight. She breathes in, lets her eyes close.

           INT. HELL’S KITCHEN DINER - ANOTHER DAY

           Another unremarkable dive. Tom once again listening to Vann 
           as his eyes case the room. A buzz in his pocket. He slides 
           his phone out, clocks the screen: New Messages (1). 

           EXT. 2ND AVENUE - LATER

           Tom walks toward his building, headphones in.  

                                 KAREN (RECORDING)
                        All right. 

           Ahead: LUIS at the curb, dragging two empty trash cans back 
           inside. Tom jogs ahead, grabs a third and follows him in.

           INT. KAREN’S CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT

           Phone to her ear. Staring out as she did in the beginning - 

           Cars parked for the night. Normal cars. Family cars. The 
           utility van no where in sight. 

           The machine on the other end beeps. 
                                 KAREN (ON PHONE)
                        ...all right. 

           EXT. TRIBECA STREET - AT THAT MOMENT

           Down the block, a view into Karen’s apartment from here. She 
           hangs up in the window, draws the curtains. A beat. 

           A FIGURE on the street moves for the first time. Someone we 
           didn’t see until now. Someone that’s been in frame the entire 
           time. 

           As they walk through a streetlight we see it’s TOM, tucking 
           his headphone back into his jacket. Done for the night. 

           PRELAP - A doorbell ringing. 

           INT. NEW JERSEY HOME - DAY

           Ray opens the door, finds Tom on the stoop, waves him in. 

                                 RAY
                        Sorry to call you out here, I just 
                        didn’t realize she’d held on to so 
                        much goddamn stuff... 

           Continuing inside, a suburban home. Half the place in boxes. 
           What's left out looks aged, 60s, cigarette smoke still in the 
           wallpaper. As they thread through...

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        When I got to the basement and 
                        realized some of it was your mom’s, 
                        well I didn’t want to toss anything 
                        ya know? Figured you’d want to go 
                        through, see if there’s anything 
                        you want to hold onto.

                        She did, yeah.
                             (an awkward silence)
                        Sorry Tommy. She’s out back but, 
                        I’d let her be. She’ll get over 
                        it... anyway, stuff’s downstairs. 
           INT. BASEMENT, NEW JERSEY HOME - DAY

           Years of storage. A dusty PIANO against the wall. Tom kneels 
           beside a box, emptying it out: a Rutgers University sweater, 
           physics text books, an old boy scout handbook, probably his. 
           A brief moment with each before discarding into a bag. 

           He pauses. A RECORD ALBUM in the bottom. The hint of a grin.

           Tom lifts it out. THE WHO - TOMMY, double LP. He opens it. 

           PAPER falling out. A town newspaper clipping. A picture of 
           TOM’S MOM on the page. “In Memoriam.” She was young. 

           CAMERA catches glimpses of the column beneath it - “vehicle 
           found” “survived by son Thomas” “sister Carol and nephew...”

           He softly places it back inside, closes the album. 

           EXT. NEW JERSEY HOME - DAY

           Tom walks toward his car at the curb, his mom’s record under 
           his arm. He fishes out is keys...

           A SOUND somewhere - gears grinding, the choke of an engine 
           trying to start. 

           EXT. ALLEY DRIVEWAY, NEW JERSEY HOME - DAY

           A grey CHEVY CORSICA in the carport. 

           INSIDE

           NANCY unsuccessfully shifting the gears, cursing under her 
           breath. A YouTube video playing on her phone: “How to drive 
           stick shift” She restarts the video, glances over... 

           Tom, watching through the passenger window. He climbs inside. 

                                 TOM
                        I think I saw a bike in the 
                        basement. 
                             (getting nothing back)

                                 NANCY
                        She left it to me. 

           A beat. Tom casually reaches over, releases the emergency 
           break for her. Winks. Nancy tries not to smile behind a 
           curtain of hair, gives up. 
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Dad said I could take it to Purdue, 
                        but don’t try driving it by myself 
                        yet. He was going to get a friend 
                        from work to teach me but he’s 
                        been, you know, distracted. 

                                 TOM
                        ...you’re going to Purdue. 

                                 NANCY
                        Yeah.

           Tom, hadn’t realized. They fall back into silence. 

                                 TOM
                        I’m sorry I wasn’t there for your 
                        graduation. I don’t mean to miss 
                        things like that. 

                                 NANCY
                        Then why do you?

           No answer. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Grandma said you used to come back 
                        a lot more. Then you stopped. Said 
                        something happened with your job. 
                             (then)
                        Whatever happened, I wish it 
                        hadn’t.

           Tom, that library quiet look. Then - 

                                 TOM
                        When do you leave?

                                 NANCY
                        End of the month. I’ve got some 
                        advanced classes I’m trying to test 
                        out of before the semester starts.

                                 TOM
                        ...what if I came with. 

                                 NANCY
                        You’re offering to drive me?

                                 TOM
                        No. You drive. But I’ll be there in 
                        case your other driving instructor 
                        here runs out of battery. 
           She eyes him, already burned once. But then she nods. Tom 
           nods back. Deal. He pops open the door, pauses.  

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Car starts in neutral. Didn’t hear 
                        it from me. 

           EXT. STORAGE FACILITY - LATER

           Tom’s car pulls up to the storage unit we saw in the 
           beginning.  

           INT. STORAGE UNIT - CONTINUOUS

           As he rolls up the door. He’s got the record under his arm, 
           heading for one of the safes. He counts off keys on a ring, 
           dozens, finds the right one and opens the door. Inside: 

           Some photographs. Programs from a first communion, child-
           scrawled cards marked “Goddaughter.” And CASH. Stacks of it. 
           We get the sense this safe is for him.

           He makes space and slides the record in, about to lock it 
           away -- but he PAUSES, holding the door. 

           The record, laying there inside. On Tom.

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           His record shelf. TOMMY now sitting with the rest. 

           We hear the tone of a phone ringing. Tom puts groceries away 
           in the kitchen, his speakerphone on, calling into his 
           service.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        Inbox 482. 

           A beep, then --

                                 KAREN (RECORDING)
                        ...All right. 

           Routine. Tom goes to hang up - waits. Faint background noise 
           on the other end. Breathing. He checks the message duration: 
           timer still running. Then --

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know how to picture you. 
                        When you listen to these. 
           Slightly slurred. Liquid pouring into glass. She’s drunk.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Are you married? Are you lonely? Do 
                        you do this from some bunker? Maybe 
                        you’re a twelve year old. I wonder 
                        if you ever listen this far in... 

           Glass clinking again. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        I bought that album. All this 
                        reminds me, well you remind me of 
                        this song. I can’t remember the 
                        name, or who sings it. Just the... 
                        melody I guess.  

           She begins to hum. Soft, dreamy. Familiar. Tom closes his 
           eyes, letting her voice drift over him. 

           She finishes. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        My son used to sing that one... 
                        maybe that’s why I forgot it. 

           Dead air. The message ends. 

           EXT. TRIBECA STREET - DAY

           Karen returning for the day. She turns into her building.

           INT. LOBBY, KAREN’S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Pausing inside the doors. A package at her feet. She picks it 
           up. Thin, no return address. She tears away the corner...

           Shrink wrapped. A record logo underneath. 

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Tom’s phone lighting up. “New Messages (1)” on the screen.

           Tom sits at his desk. He’s got protective goggles on, a 
           soldering iron smoking in his hand. The TTY machine is 
           partially disassembled, soldering a new screen to the board. 

           He glances at the phone, dials in from memory, dials in a 
           pin, sets it to speaker.

                        Inbox 482. 

           A beep, then -- nothing. Silence. 

           Tom sets the iron back in the stand, listening. A faint 
           knocking in the background. Or maybe it’s a footfall. 

           Worried now, he reaches for the phone...

           Then: MUSIC. The melody of a mid 70s keyboard as a song 
           begins to play. The hi-fi crackles of a record needle.

           Tom smiles. She got his gift. 

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. KAREN’S CONDOMINIUM - EARLIER

           An ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA record spinning on her player. 
           Karen drinking beside it, holding her phone out next to it as 
           the lyrics kick in... 

                                 RECORD
                        Hello, how are you? /
                        Have you been all right through all 
                        those lonely, lonely, lonely, 
                        lonely nights? That's what I'd say, 
                        I'd tell you everything /
                        If you’d pick up that telephone...

           ELO’s Telephone Line continues to play as she sits back.

                                 RECORD (CONT’D)
                        Blue days, black nights, doo wah 
                        doo wahhahhhaa...
           TOM

           Sitting back himself as the song reaches the chorus, we 
           realize it’s the melody she was humming earlier. The song she 
           was trying to remember. 

                                 RECORD (CONT’D)
                        I look into the sky (the love you 
                        need ain't gonna see you through) /
                        And I wonder why (the little things 
                        you planned ain't comin' true) /

           He closes his eyes, listens. Almost as if she’s there in the 
           room with him. 

                                 RECORD (CONT’D)
                        Oh, oh telephone line, give me some 
                        time, I'm living in twilight...
           MUSIC FADES as we cut to...

           INT. HARLEM DINER - DAY

           Tom eating, smiling to himself. He looks up, finds Vann 
           across from him, a look. 

                                 TOM
                        What?

                                 VANN
                        You’re looking well. 

           Tom shrugs. Plays innocent. 

                                 TOM
                        Work is going... well.

                                 VANN
                        Good on you. Me, I get a corporate 
                        laundering case with an AD wants me 
                        to search the ceilings of every 
                        partner in a seven story firm. 
                        Seven stories of ceilings. You know 
                        what’s in a ceiling? Rat shit. 

                                 TOM
                        Maybe it’s time to retire. 

                                 VANN
                             (thinks on it)
                        Nah, what else am I going to do. 
                        Get a second job?

                                 TOM
                        That could work. 

                                 VANN
                        You? Early retirement?

                                 TOM
                        Maybe I like my job. 

                                 VANN
                        No shit. No office, fresh air, get 
                        a tan like yours, I would too. 
                        Maybe I’ll stop by one day, grab an 
                        application. 

           Tom, amused. He considers a response, just keeps eating. 
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

           File folders covering the table. Kuan, Rosetti and Mosley 
           camped out, laptops and stale take out, pouring through. 

           Hobbs enters.

                                 HOBBS
                        Union chief checks out. Never even 
                        met the broker. Said he was 
                        contacted through the relay 
                        switchboard like everyone else. 

                                 MOSELY
                             (sorting folders)
                        Switchboards, message services, 
                        money through the goddamn pony 
                        express. Guy’s technology is from 
                        the dark ages. 

           He glances up, finds Hobbs staring at him. 

                                 HOBBS
                        Do you know where he is? Got an    
                        e-mail with an IP address we can 
                        trace? A cell phone? A bank 
                        transfer? 
                             (Mosely, silent)
                        Those dark ages are why we’re still 
                        fucking sitting here. 

           He moves on, eyes the mess of files on the table. 

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                        What’s this? 

                                 KUAN
                        No hits in New York, we had to 
                        expand. Every extortion, blackmail 
                        and whistleblower case filed in the 
                        tri-state courts. This guys gotta 
                        have made a mistake somewhere.

                                 ROSETTI
                        Or maybe the clients made the 
                        mistake and he walked. 

                                 KUAN
                        Either way, early days, one of 
                        these goes south, maybe someone 
                        knows a name.

           Hobbs picks up a file, reads the brief, trades it for 
           another, another. He starts reading aloud. 
                                 HOBBS

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                        1978!? C’mon guys, get serious. The

                                 ROSETTI
                        Well what do you want Paul? You 
                        said it yourself, we don’t have a 
                        face, we don’t have a phone, we’ve 
                        got nothing. So where else do you 
                        want us to look?

           Hobbs starts to answer, realizes he doesn’t have one. Rosetti 
           evens her voice. 

                                 ROSETTI (CONT’D)
                        Maybe it’s time to call this in.

           EXT. 125TH STREET METRO NORTH PLATFORM - NIGHT

           Tom waits for his train. A buzz on his phone. He smiles, 
           dials in. Surprised when it isn’t Karen’s voice, but a man’s. 

                                 MALE VOICE (RECORDING)
                        Your phone still works. I’m glad. 

           It sounds distant, gravely. But a voice we know. WHITACRE.

                                 WHITACRE (RECORDING) (CONT’D)
                        Nice to speak English again, even 
                        if it’s to a machine. I’ve been 
                        down here almost three months now.
                             (dead air, then)
                        I thought I saw someone. 
           EXT. GUACARA, VENEZUELA - DAY

           A market. Whitacre steps out of a bodega, beard grown out 
           now. He looks both ways, but neither matter. He’s drifting. 

           INT. BUS, VENEZUELA - DAY

           Goats, knotted yarns dangling from windows. Whitacre’s the 
           only white man. He looks down the bus, reacts to something. 

                                 WHITACRE (V.O.)
                        Like they were following me. 
                        Happens more and more. Even if I 
                        don’t see it, it feels like it. 

           The bus pulls over for a stop. Whitacre disembarks.

           EXT. PARK, VENEZUELA - DAY

           Walking now. 

                                 WHITACRE (V.O.)
                        I found an American medical journal 
                        down here. Well, Canadian. Study 
                        found over seventy brands of 
                        tainted supplements on the US 
                        market. Getty Pharmaceuticals makes 
                        nine of them. One of them was mine. 
                        They sent 2,300 people to the 
                        emergency room. I helped do that. 

           A family across the park, kids tossing crumbs for the birds.  

                                 WHITACRE (V.O.)
                        I missed my niece's baptism.

           INT. APARTMENT, VENEZUELA - NIGHT

           One room, spartan but clean. Whitacre lies in bed. Eyes open. 
           A faint scratching on the roof. Imagined? We don’t know. 

                                 WHITACRE (V.O.)
                        I’m scared all the time. You might 
                        be the only other one who 
                        understands that. The people you 
                        help, to protect ourselves, the 
                        ones we love, how lonely that can 
                        feel. We have to uninvolve 
                        ourselves from the world.

           MOMENTS LATER
           Walking out. 

           EXT. STREETS, VENEZUELA - NIGHT

           Vice hours. Shadows from neon, steam from food vendors. 
           Whitacre pays one, trades for some corn Hallacas. 

                                 WHITACRE (V.O.)
                        I’m not changing my mind. I know 
                        it’s too late for that. And even if 
                        I did, I know you can’t. Your work 
                        survives on your... impartiality. 

           As he waits for his change he spots a few silhouettes 
           lingering down the street. They weren’t there a second ago. 

           ANGLE ON

           The Hallacas in the trash. Whitacre in a dead sprint down the 
           alley in the bg. 

           EXT. NEXT BLOCK, VENEZUELA - NIGHT

           He emerges, slows his pace as he weaves into the crowd. 
           Sweating now, heading in no particular direction. Drifting. 

                                 WHITACRE (V.O.)
                        I just wonder, what’s the point of 
                        getting away, if the rest is like 
                        this. 

           We lose him in the crowd. 

           EXT. KAREN’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           Tom stands across the street. A light on up above. 

           INT. KAREN’S CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT

           Karen sleeps on the couch. The knife block is back on the 
           counter. Her phone begins to ring. She grabs for it, still 
           waking up.

                                 KAREN
                        Yes?

                                 OPERATOR (OVER PHONE)
                        Hello. This is relay operator 4297.

           INTERCUT WITH:
           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Following a cable as it snakes from Tom’s phone to the TTY 
           machine, the panel now off and exposed from the soldering. 

           As Tom types we once again hear each of their voices as if 
           they’re having the conversation directly. 

                                 KAREN
                        I didn’t check in. Shit I’m sorry, 
                        I must have passed out. Did I miss 
                        a call? 

                                 TOM
                        No.

                                 KAREN
                        Is it news from them? Did they 
                        agree to the exchange?

                                 TOM
                        No. Not yet.

                                 KAREN
                        Oh no. Something’s wrong-

                                 TOM
                        No. No...
                             (a beat)
                        I just wanted to... check on you. 

           Karen, surprised at this.

                                 KAREN
                        Everything’s okay. 
                             (then, an instinct)
                        What about you?

           On Tom. He’s never been asked that before. 

                                 TOM
                        Fine. 

           A long silence. Karen, getting the sense she’ll have to take 
           the lead here. 

                                 KAREN
                        I meant to say thank you, for the 
                        album. You know your music. Maybe 
                        you’re some... late night radio DJ. 
                        That would explain the odd hours.  

           She smiles. He does too.
                                 TOM
                        Someone I knew used to play piano. 
                        She liked that one. 

                                 KAREN
                        And your messages, I guess you do 
                        stick around to listen.
                             (a beat)
                        So are you? 

                                 TOM
                        Am I what?

                                 KAREN
                        A twelve year old? Married? 

                                 TOM
                        No and... no.

                                 KAREN
                        And what about lonely?

           He waits, watching her words as they drift across his screen. 

                                 TOM
                        It can be.

                                 KAREN
                        It's strange, talking to someone 
                        who knows everything about you, and 
                        you don't know the first thing 
                        about them.

                                 TOM
                        I don’t know everything. 

                                 KAREN
                        What would you like to know?

                                 TOM
                        You mentioned your son. 

                                 KAREN
                        ...I think I’ll keep that one to 
                        myself.
                             (and then)
                        May I ask you a question?

                                 TOM
                        Depends what it is.

                                 KAREN
                        Think I’ll ever hear your real 
                        voice? 
                                 TOM
                        If everything goes well, no.
                             (sensing disappointment)
                        I call you, I meet you, you become 
                        the path they use to get to me. You 
                        won’t mean to. You’ll promise to be 
                        quiet, to be careful, but you know 
                        something now, a number, a face - 
                        and it’s the only reason they’ll 
                        need to hurt you. So take away 
                        their reason. That's why this 
                        works. Never meeting me, is the 
                        only thing that keeps you safe. 

           On Karen. Sad but understanding.  

                                 KAREN
                        May I ask you another question?
                             (beat)
                        Have you ever lost anyone?

                                 TOM
                        ...some people run. And sometimes, 
                        I have to walk away. The 
                        instructions, not everyone listens. 

                                 KAREN
                        So you have lost people. 

           A long pause. 

                                 TOM
                        Yes.

                                 KAREN
                        I’m sorry. 
                             (and then)
                        But I hope you know that thanks to 
                        you, I won’t be.

           On Tom, absorbing this. Then -

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Good night.

           Tom’s end this time, for once not the one to end the 
           conversation. The words scrolling across his screen:

                 “THE RECIPIENT HAS HUNG UP. THANK YOU FOR USING THE RELAY 
                            SERVICE. HAVE A WONDERFUL EVENING.”

           Tom leans back in his chair. After a moment he goes to the 
           record player, flipping through until he pulls out TOMMY. 
           He queues it up, drops the needle, falling back in his chair. 
           As the overture starts to play, Tom lets his eyes close.

           FADE TO BLACK

           Then... harsh buzzing. Loud. Violating.

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Tom’s eyes shoot open. He’s fallen asleep in his chair. A 
           drink on the work bench beside him. 

           Someone’s buzzing downstairs. 

           INT. TOM’S BUILDING - MORNING

           Tom peers into the hallway. A classic walk up, two apartments 
           to each floor, his at the top.  

           No one in sight. He walks to the staircase, looking down. 

           HIS POV

           The ground floor below. From this angle we can’t see the 
           front door, just a shadow cast across the tile. And then:

           His neighbor’s buzzer rings. Then a door on the third floor. 
           The other door. The 2nd floor. Spiraling down. Surreal. 

           Tom backs away from the stairs -- retreats into his own 
           apartment -- shuts the door. 

           INSIDE

           Tom, pulse running. He takes stock of his breathing, locks 
           his dead bolts. Then his eyes drift toward his work bench... 

           HIS PHONE - blinking. A message. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Tom dials in, waits...

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        Inbox 482. 

           A click. Then -

                                 HOBBS (RECORDING)
                        We accept your conditions. And your 
                        price. The money’s been sent. But 
                        there’s been a request.
                                 (MORE)
                                 HOBBS (RECORDING) (CONT'D)
                             (a beat)
                        It’s non-negotiable. 

           EXT. PORT AUTHORITY BUS TERMINAL - DAY

           Chaos. Commuters criss-crossing between taxis and home. 

           PRELAP - A phone ringing. A conversation from earlier playing-

           INT. PORT AUTHORITY BUS TERMINAL - DAY

           Tom hustling through the terminal, eyes darting. An 
           adrenalized version of the diners - mapping doors, exits. 

                                 TOM (V.O)
                        The report you gave me, it wasn’t 
                        the whole file, was it. 

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        What?

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        Section 43-B, the group 7 NRT 
                        study. Do you have it?

           Tom tries an electrical room door: locked - keeps moving...

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        Well, yes-

                                 TOM  (V.O.)
                        They need it, all of it. Why would 
                        you leave that out? 

           Tom walks to a pay phone wall, scans beneath it, moves on. 

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        Because the redaction was 
                        conclusive. The rest was... not 
                        nearly as relevant. 

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        You said it yourself, there’s a 
                        400 million dollar acquisition on 
                        the line here. You don’t get to 
                        decide what’s relevant. They can’t 
                        risk any part of this in the wind.

           Tom checks a utility hallway, dead end. Claimed by a wire 
           cart, newspapers and toiletries. Just a HOMELESS WOMAN 
           staying out of the crowd. A look from her. He walks out -
                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        So I’ll send it to you like before. 

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        That’s not going to work. There’s 
                        an SEC filing deadline next week. 
                        There’s no time.

           A beat. 

                                 KAREN (V.O.)
                        ...I can bring it to you. 

           Tom pauses, sees something. 

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        No, you’re going to leave it for 
                        me.

           A HUDSON NEWS newsstand, neon lit in the center of the 
           terminal floor. 

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        I’m going to give you instructions. 
                        Very specific ones. Pay attention, 
                        because we both need you to get 
                        this right.

           Tom heads for an escalator leading back up to the street.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        There’s a newsstand off the 8th 
                        avenue entrance of Port 
                        Authority...

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. PORT AUTHORITY BUS TERMINAL - NEXT DAY

           Karen descends the escalator. Coming into view: 

           THE NEWSSTAND

           But Karen drifts to a breakfast counter instead, orders 
           something, pays in cash. The cashier tongs a muffin into a 
           bag, hands it over with a coffee. Karen takes them over to 
           the cream and sugar, hovering over...

           As she digs a MANILA FOLDER out of her purse. She folds it 
           once, twice, trashes the muffin and slides it inside the bag. 
           TERMINAL

           Karen approaches the newsstand, a TELLER restocking magazines 
           inside. A stand-alone rack on the corner, newspapers stacked 
           on the shelves: The New York Times, The Washington Post, The 
           Chicago Tribune...

           Karen goes to it.

           The camera is angled such that we see little, but when she 
           rises the bag is gone and shes holding a paper in her hand. 
           She steps up to the teller to pay. As she does...

           HOBBS, ROSETTI AND MOSLEY

           Watching as she takes her change and walks away. A nod from 
           Hobbs sends Rosetti on her tail. Then, digging out his phone-

                                 HOBBS
                        Watch the Tribunes.

           They wait, watching commuters pluck up papers on their way to 
           the trains. Finally a MAN takes one from the Tribune rack, 
           goes to pay. No clear look but quiet looking. Grey temples. 

           Mosley sits up, looks at Hobbs. Still watching his phone. He 
           looks back out at the man. Disappearing. Getting away... 

           Mosley rises. 

           FOLLOWING BEHIND THE MAN

           Walking brisk down the terminal. Mosley catches up. 

                                 MOSLEY 
                        Excuse me! Excuse me there -

           The man turns. It’s not Tom. But Mosley doesn’t know that. 

                                 MOSLEY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry to bug you but my daughter 
                        just won state last night, finals 
                        were at MSG. Long shot but, I was 
                        hoping I could check your sports 
                        section, see if she made it. 

           The man grunts but lets Mosley fan through the paper, patting 
           it down as he goes. He clocks the sports page, frowns.

                                 MOSLEY (CONT’D)
                        Guess not. Thanks anyway.

           He hands it back. The man disappears back into the fray. 
           NEWSSTAND

           Hobbs still on his phone. REVERSE TO:

           His screen: we see he’s recording the newsstand, faces and 
           profiles of customers coming through. 

           Mosley returns to the bench. 

                                 MOSLEY (CONT’D)
                        Wasn’t him. Didn’t run. Didn’t try 
                        to hide anything. 

                                 HOBBS
                             (not looking up)
                        So what’s your plan, shake down 
                        every person that buys a paper?

                                 MOSLEY
                        What if that was our guy?

                                 HOBBS 
                        Who said our guy’s a guy. 

           On Mosley, no answer. Hobbs nods at the newspaper rack. 

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                        How many Tribunes do you see? 

                                 MOSLEY
                        ...maybe twenty.

                                 HOBBS
                        That’s twenty faces down from the 
                        eight million we were at this 
                        morning. We’ll get them. Unless you 
                        want to scare them away first. 
                             (Mosley, sheepish)
                        Go cover the other end. 

           Mosley rises, starts across the terminal. Hobbs taps his ear. 

                                 HOBBS (INTO EARPIECE) (CONT’D)
                        Any sign?

           EXT. BRYANT PARK - AT THAT MOMENT

           Rosetti on a bench, an eyeline on Karen across the park.

                                 ROSETTI (INTO EARPIECE)
                        Nothing. 
                             (she hesitates, then)
                        They’ve got no reason to show here. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROSETTI (INTO EARPIECE) (CONT'D)
                        If she’s made her drop we know 
                        where they’re going to be. 

           INT. PORT AUTHORITY TERMINAL - CONTINUOUS

                                 HOBBS (INTO EARPIECE)
                        Yeah that’s what we said at the 
                        airport... stay on her. 

           Hobbs perks as another commuter picks up a Tribune, a 
           Hispanic woman (30s). Hobbs taps his phone, zooms in.

           ACROSS THE TERMINAL

           Mosley on his way to cover the opposite wall. He steps around 
           a group of TRANSIT COPS, moves on. Moments later...

           TOM

           Passing by the same. He continues toward... 

           THE NEWSSTAND

           Tom walks up to the rack, bends down for a Tribune. CLOSE ON 
           his hand as he subtly flips to the bottom, slides the last 
           one out of the stack. 

           HOBBS

           Recording from afar, glimpses of Tom in profile as he gets in 
           line. Unremarkable. Jeans, blue windbreaker, nothing setting 
           him apart from the others but Hobbs watches just the same, 
           mind running. A feeling here - like he might get up...

           ...the moment passes, another commuter grabbing the next 
           Tribune. Hobbs moves the camera to the new mark.

           Tom pays and walks away. 

           INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM, PORT AUTHORITY - DAY

           Tom waits amongst the crowd, Tribune under his arm. A glow 
           down the tunnel as the train pulls in. Tom steps aside to let 
           passengers off, takes the moment to glance down at the paper, 
           fingering through... stops.

           PASSENGERS now cramming in. Tom steps away, opens the paper 
           fully, racing through the pages. Reaches the end. 

           It’s empty.
           INT. FOOD COURT, PORT AUTHORITY TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER

           The TTY machine on the table, phone jacked in. The status 
           light blinking “Call Connected.” Tom types rapidly. Their 
           conversation scrolling across its screen:

                                “...NO REPORT IN PAPER...”

           He waits. After a moment Karen’s response scrolls through.

                                  “...IT HAS TO BE...” 

           Tom’s jaw clenches. He impatiently types again. 

                                  “...PAPER IS EMPTY...”

                  “...IT CAN’T BE. I LEFT IT IN THE TRIBUNE, BOTTOM COPY,    
                            2ND SHELF, LIKE YOU TOLD ME TO...”

           A beat. Tom’s face falls. His eyes close. A mind processing 
           supreme trouble. He slowly puts his fingers back on the keys. 

                              “...TRIBUNE IS ON 3RD SHELF...”

           The machine stays quiet for the longest time. Finally -

                                    “...I’M SORRY...”

           Tom rises, eyes red. She continues:

                “...WALK AWAY, PLEASE, I’LL COME BACK FOR IT. WE’LL ASK THEM 
                                  TO CHANGE THE DEAL...”

           He types:

                      “...WE DON’T DO THIS NOW, THERE IS NO DEAL...”

           Tom starts dismantling his set up as her last messages scroll 
           through:

                       “...FUCK I’M SO SORRY...FUCK...WHAT ARE YOU-”

           He slams the TTY keyboard shut. 

           INT. PORT AUTHORITY TERMINAL - DAY

           Tom steps back into the crowded hall. The newsstand sits down 
           the corridor. Tom keeps his distance, surveying the scene, 
           any bodies not on the move: 

           An MTA employee on break... a mother wrangling two kids... a 
           shoe shiner with an open chair... and A MAN’S LEG, just 
           visible on a bench behind it. Tom drifts further over... 
           HOBBS coming into view. Tom scans further - finds Mosley 
           leaning against the wall on the other side, the newspaper 
           rack between them. On Tom. 

           He’ll be seen again. 

           WITH HOBBS NOW

           Moments later, phone in hand, skimming through the morning 
           video, scrubbing for anything he’s missed. He looks out 
           toward the corridor - an instinct. That same surveying look. 

           In a way these two men are not all that unalike. 

           His view: flagging the same figures: The shoe shine - the 
           metro employee - the mother... did we see Tom in there?

           Suddenly - YELLING.

           Hobbs turns back to the newsstand. The Teller now with the 
           Homeless Woman we saw previously, arguing over something on 
           the counter. She pours out her change, shoveling it at him. 

                      HOMELESS WOMAN
           Here, here, and get my 
           goddamn lottery ticket too. 
                                                         TELLER
                                              I told you, same thing last 
                                              week. Put something back, it 
                                              ain’t enough. 

           Hobbs turns away, eyes back on the crowd. Then - a CRASH

           A tray of lighters knocked over. The Teller glares, turns 
           around to grab the phone. The woman uses the moment to grab 
           her things off the counter and retreat, pushing over the rack 
           of newspapers on her way.

                                 HOMELESS WOMAN
                        Cocksucker! 

           Fifty papers scattering across the floor. Hobbs EXPLODES to 
           his feet. Mosely sees it too. 

           The woman scurries off as the Teller curses, emerging to 
           collect the mess. Tribunes with Posts, Times on top Journals. 
           An impossible game of Three-card Monte. 

           Hobbs and Mosley - eyes darting between the papers, alert for 
           hands dipping down, the crowd flowing past, chaotic, too many 
           faces to clock... 

           And then, Hobbs stops. His head snaps back down the hall.
           INT. UTILITY HALLWAY, PORT AUTHORITY TERMINAL - DAY

           The dead-end Tom found earlier. The homeless woman bent over 
           her cart, packrating something away. 

                                 HOBBS (O.S.)
                        What’d you do with the paper. 

           Hobbs standing in the corridor. She glares at him, cautious. 

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                        I’m not here to bust you. 
                             (then)
                        Where’s the paper?

                                 HOMELESS WOMAN
                        Wiped my fuckin’ ass with it. 

           Hobbs steps closer. She spins, territorial.

                                 HOMELESS WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Get out! My spot! Get out!

           Hobbs steps back, but now sees the fold of cash she’s trying 
           to conceal in her hand. Fresh bills. Slowly, he reaches into 
           his pocket, opens his wallet, counts out his own money.

           He holds it out. 

                                 HOBBS
                        I just want to know, what did he 
                        look like. What was he wearing?

           She stares at it. He brings it closer. 

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                        And which way did he go. 

           INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM, PORT AUTHORITY - DAY

           Hobbs steps onto the platform. Three hundred feet of faces 
           stretching along the station, waiting. Hobbs starts walking. 

           As he threads through the air begins to kick up, a train 
           approaching. Hobbs picks up speed. 

           Bodies start shuffling into his path, preparing to board. He 
           shoves forward, eyes darting, the train pulling up alongside 
           him now. In thirty seconds this crowd will double.  

           He’s only halfway. 

           Train brakes drown out the next moments as he peers down the 
           remaining platform, head craning, desperate for something -
           And then he sees it. A blue windbreaker near the far end. 

           It’s Tom.

           As soon as he’s spotted he’s lost, the platform flooded as 
           passengers disembark. Hobbs straining, five cars away. 

                                 SUBWAY PA SYSTEM
                        Stand clear of the closing doors.

           He takes a final look, then slips onto the train. 

           INT. SUBWAY TRAIN, 9TH CAR - DAY

           A discarded Washington Post hits the seat. 

                                 SUBWAY PA SYSTEM
                        ...This is an uptown express A 
                        train. The next stop will be 59th 
                        street, Columbus circle...

           Tom hangs onto the rail, a glimpse of the manila folder as it 
           disappears inside his shirt. A beat. 

           Dark rings under his eyes. He hasn’t slept. The same drained 
           look after the airport. He lets his eyes close. 

           INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - 6TH CAR

           As Hobbs enters from the adjoining car. We hear the roar of 
           the exposed passageway behind him, thin handrails the only 
           barrier between the tracks below. 

           Hobbs makes his way through the car, continues into --

           7TH CAR

           Moving forward, methodic, careful not to draw attention. Then- 
           A JERK as the train starts to slow. 

                                 SUBWAY PA SYSTEM
                        This is 59th street, Columbus 
                        circle.

           EXT. 59TH STREET STATION - CONTINUOUS

           The train pulls to a stop. The doors release. Hobbs sets a 
           foot on the platform, eyes focused down the length of the 
           train - passengers getting on and off.

           The wave thins, the last few stragglers jumping off.
           No Tom. Hobbs steps back inside. 

           As the train pulls away, Hobbs continues forward into...

           INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - 8TH CAR

           Less people here, nearing the back of the train. He clears it 
           visually, presses forward... goes still. 

           THE CAR AHEAD

           Through the door’s porthole window. TOM at the far end.

           Hobbs, masking any reaction. He reaches up for the hand rail, 
           lets his arm block his face. Moving very slowly now he starts 
           side-stepping toward the door. A glance at Tom. 

           No movement. Unaware. In fact it appears his eyes are closed. 

           Hobbs steps over someone’s bag, near the passageway door now -

                                 BLACK MAN (O.S.)
                        Excuse me sir. 

           Hobbs looks up. Finds an older BLACK MAN looking at him, 
           three friends behind him. 

                                 BLACK MAN (CONT’D)
                        You know what time it is? 

                                 HOBBS
                             (trying to move on)
                        Don’t know, sorry. 

           A look. Hobbs follows his eyeline up: Hobbs’ wrist watch 
           exposed on his wrist. A pained smile. He checks it.   

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                        It’s 2:11. 

                                 BLACK MAN
                        Nope! It’s...

           His three friends step forward.

                                 ALL TOGETHER
                        DOO-WOP TIME!

           Hobbs freezes as right there they launch into an a-capella 
           rendition of “Under the Boardwalk.” Snapping, stomping, 
           scattered riders clapping along. LOUD. 

           Hobbs’ head snaps toward the door. 
           THE CAR AHEAD

           Tom now alert. Looking right at him. 

           The singers start walking the rows, passing the hat, blocking 
           their view. Hobbs abandons all stealth, charges for the door.  

           He pushes a passenger aside, throws open the door. 

           9TH CAR

           Passengers looking up as Hobbs barrels in - eyes roaming. 

           Tom is gone. Hobbs composes himself, stares ahead. Only one 
           car left. He starts toward the door...

           A SLIVER OF BLUE outside the glass.

           Tom’s jacket sleeve between cars, barely visible in the tight 
           space beside the door. Lying in wait. 

           Hobbs dips to the same side, obscuring his approach. He stops 
           just before the door, leans against the wall between them. 
           Slowly, he reaches into his belt, quietly pulls out

           THE P380 PISTOL - held inside his jacket out of view. His 
           free hand reaches for the door handle. A silent count...   

           He throws it open.

           PASSAGEWAY 

           The roar of the train. Hobbs’ gun instantly out and aimed at -

           Tom’s jacket, tied onto the handrail, empty. 

           Hobbs’ eyes leap toward the last car, finds --

           TOM

           Inside, staring at him. His hand on a red handle attached to 
           the ceiling. A sign on the wall beside it. 

           Tom yanks it down. 

           METAL ON METAL as the EMERGENCY BREAKS ENGAGE. 

           Passengers thrown to the floor. In the window Hobbs vanishes 
           from sight. Bags falling, bodies tripping, sliding forward.

           Tom braces himself against the wall - heavy compression 
           breaks firing outside as the train scrapes to a halt. Tom’s 
           eyes never leave the empty passageway window... 
           A final JERK. Moaning, cursing, riders getting to their knees

           HOBBS reappears, a gash in his head but still hanging on. The 
           two men lock eyes. The cloak and dagger is over. 

           Tom throws open the last door, and leaps. 

           Hobbs, about to run in after him -- sees the crowded aisle --
           leaps over his handrail instead. 

           EXT. SUBWAY TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

           Cavernous. Rail beams and soot with no promise of light.

           Hobbs hits the ground, gun in hand. He sees Tom ahead, 
           disappearing from the fading light of the train. Too dark. 

           Hobbs holsters and starts after him.

           TOM

           Breathing hard. The solitary. We get the sense he knows he’s 
           running for his life.

           HOBBS

           Sprinting forward. The veteran. Blood from his gash beading 
           with his sweat. 

           THE TUNNEL

           The two silhouettes pounding through. A rasping coming from 
           Tom’s chest telling us it’s everything he’s got. 

           A second set of foot-falls joining his. Two metronomes, one 
           ticking faster... faster... 

           Hobbs tackles him. 

           They wrestle in a cloud of soot, covering their hands, faces, 
           in mouths. A CRACK - the TTY machine breaking. The flash of a 
           zip tie coming out. Tom - giving a feral fight but Hobbs 
           reels back, hammers down a blow that sends him limp. 

           Hobbs puts a knee on his chest, keeps the gun on him while he 
           secures the zip tie around his wrists - cinches it tight. 

           VOICES down the tunnel. Flashlight beams wandering their way.

                                 HOBBS
                        Stay back!
           They press forward, not hearing or not listening. Hobbs sees 
           Tom coming around beneath him. He shouts again. 

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                        I said stay back! 

           They continue closer. Tom’s eyes fluttering open now. Hobbs 
           points the gun in the air -- fires twice -- shots echoing -

           The lights down the tunnel FLINCH. Hobbs checks back over his 
           shoulder, watching to make sure they retreat. They do.

           Turning back -- 

           TOM’S HANDS fly up, still bound together, grab Hobbs’ grip 
           around the pistol, and squeeze. A FLASH OF LIGHT -- FIRING a 
           shot directly next to Hobbs’ ear. SOUND DROPS - 

           Hobbs’ hands to his ears, the gun dropping, his mouth open in 
           some silent scream. 

           His tilted view as Tom is up and running, wrists together, 
           the glow of the next station in the distance. 

           Hobbs gropes for his gun, half buried somewhere in the filth, 
           his world still ringing. New lights appearing behind him now. 
           They’ll be here soon. 

           He sees a second train coming on the downtown track. Deaf, 
           bloody, Hobbs abandons his search and stumbles across the 
           tracks, disappearing behind the train as it missiles through 
           the underworld. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           BLACK. Silence. Then from the void comes the sound of a phone 
           ringing. It continues over:

           INT. KAREN’S CONDOMINIUM - DAY

           Karen paces against the window, curtains pulled. The tone of 
           the message machine again. 

                                 KAREN (INTO PHONE)
                             (frantic)
                        It’s still me. I haven’t heard from 
                        you. I don’t- I don’t know where 
                        else to try. I just want to know 
                        you’re okay.

           She hangs up. Sits.
                                                           POP WIDE TO:
           The apartment: The tops of file boxes ripped off. Empty 
           bottles covering counters. Disorder everywhere. Karen looks 
           fixedly at something across the room.

           The RECORD PLAYER: the album he sent still on the platter. 

           Suddenly the phone rings. She snaps it up. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - AT THAT MOMENT

           Silent as we pan across the room. Clothes on the floor, 
           barely recognizable, crusted in black silt. 

           A bowl, a bloody cloth inside, a box cutter...

           His mobile TTY machine on the desk. Powered on but cracked, 
           missing a few keys, the LCD screen spider-webbed. And:

           The manila folder... ripped and bent to hell, but there. 
           Tom sits at his desk, back to us. Nothing but an undershirt 
           letting us see the bandages around his forearms, wrists. He 
           finally raises his hands to the machine, types slow. 

                                 OPERATOR (OVER PHONE)
                        I have it.

           longer hearing the intimate effect of a direct conversation.)

                        Do you understand? 

           A shiver through Karen. Wounded, ashamed. Whatever they had, 
           it’s now gone. 

                                 KAREN
                        Yes... go ahead.

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           INT. LENOX HILL POST OFFICE, CORRIDOR - DAY

           The wall of P.O. boxes. Tom appears from around the corner, a 
           dark bruise on his face. He looks in on box on 121. 

           A package slip inside. 

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - DAY

           ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE FLOOR:

           As Tom unearths the footlocker. He unlocks the lid, Karen’s 
           new pages now in with the rest. 

           He’s sets a saran-wrapped brick of cash inside beside them. 
           Then another. Another... 

           INT. KAREN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Karen with the motorola to her ear. 

                                 KAREN
                        All right. 

           She inhales, about to say more... 

           Decides against it. She ends the call. 

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tom’s phone lighting up. “New Messages (1)” on the screen.

           Tom holds the soldering iron at his desk, the battered TTY 
           machine laid out before him, piecing it back together.

           INT. MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS DINER - DAY

           Tom at the counter, notebook out, watching the front door. 

           People piling up, waiting to be seated. This hostess runs 
           behind. No clean exit. No good. Tom finishes his coffee. 

           INT. KAREN’S CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT

           Karen listens to the record in the dark. 
           EXT. LITTLE ITALY DINER - DAY

           Tom walks the perimeter, peers into the alley behind. 
           Options. He opens the door and heads inside.

           INT. BASEMENT, CHURCH OF SAINT CATHERINE - NIGHT

           A meeting in session. 

                                 MODERATOR (O.S.)
                        And does anyone have something 
                        they’d like to talk about? 

           A few hands in the air. Vann looks over at Tom - head down, 
           drawing out something in the notebook. 

           EXT. 2ND AVENUE - NIGHT

           Tom walks up the block, pauses. Ahead:

           Luis outside his building, leaning over a sedan parked at the 
           curb. We can’t see who’s inside but after a moment the sleeve 
           of the grey raincoat emerges - hands Luis a business card. 

           Luis takes it, then shakes his head, apologetic, hands it 
           back. They exchange a few last words - the sedan pulls away.

           On Tom.

           END SERIES

           INT. MEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Large and sterile. Corporate looking. 

           Hobbs stands at the sink, replacing the bandage on his ear. 
           As he pulls it away we see a DIVOT now missing from the rim 
           of the cartilage. The bullet was close. 

           He cleans it, tapes a new swab over the wound.

           KUAN enters in the mirror behind him, holds a phone out. 
           Hobbs looks at the screen.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Hobbs sets the phone in the middle of the table. Rosetti, 
           Mosley and Kuan gathered around, listening. 

                                 HOBBS

           Blown up images of Tom on the wall, stills taken from the 
           cell video. Grainy, but still the ghost of a face. 

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Tom switches off the machine, adrenaline running. His phone 
           screen lights up as he disconnects it - “New Messages (2)”

           He rubs his eyes, annoyed. Probably Karen trying too hard. He 
           dials in.

                        checked the obituaries of the towns 
                        they were in. I found two of the 
                        names. Our clients. Our...patients. 
                        And who knows how many I didn’t 
                        find...how many are still coming.
                             (a pause)
                        These fucking secrets...

           Silence. The wind.
                                 WHITACRE (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t worth it. I get that now. 
                        I was just a coward. 
                             (a beat)
                        You won’t hear from me again. I 
                        promise... but thank you. 

           We hear a scrape, as if the phone is being set on the ground.

           Steps, trailing off, and then --

           Nothing. Back to the birds and the wind. Tom waits, finally 
           checks the call. The timer hits 3 minutes, ends. The limit. 

           INT. MID-MANHATTAN PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT

           Tom sits at a computer. We see a regional Venezuelan news 
           site pulled up. He clicks through, guessworking the links by 
           the picture. Then, a caption tucked away on the side bar: 

           “Turista Americano Encontrado Muerto”

           He clicks. As it loads we stay on his face. Hardened at 
           first, but as he reads on something starts to give, a 
           swelling breaking through from deep inside.    

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Tom drinks.

           INT. BASEMENT, CHURCH OF SAINT CATHERINE - NIGHT

           Another meeting in session. Tom quiet in his seat, Vann 
           listening down the row. A cell phone stop watch chimes.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        That’s time. 

           The group claps as the speaker sits back, finished.

                                 MODERATOR (O.S.)
                        Okay, we’re almost at an hour, 
                        remember no meeting on Monday 
                        because of the holiday. Let’s go 
                        ahead and say our closing affir-

           Tom raises his hand. Silence. People around the room 
           exchanging looks. He keeps it up, stubborn, eyes eventually 
           drifting up to the moderator. Bloodshot. Asking. 
                                 MODERATOR (CONT’D)
                        ...why don’t we do one more. Becca 
                        would you get the time again?
                             (back to him)
                        Go ahead Tom. 

           Trying to figure out how to start. 

                                 TOM
                        The last person who really knew 
                        anything about me died last month.

           He drifts back into silence, staring ahead at nothing in 
           particular. Then: 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I keep secrets from people. Some 
                        are embarrassing. Some are 
                        expensive. Some are dangerous. I 
                        knew someone, when I was a kid.  
                        She was, really pretty. She liked 
                        The Who. And she liked science, she 
                        worked on these big nuclear 
                        reactors out in Jersey.
                             (then)
                        But she was keeping this secret. 
                        She wanted to tell someone about it- 
                        she tried to tell someone about it, 
                        the right people but -  a car hit 
                        her before she could. 
                             (then)
                        The secret was about somebody else. 
                        And sometimes I wonder, if she’d 
                        kept it, if she had someone to keep 
                        it with, maybe there would have 
                        been no car. 
                             (then)
                        I used to think that was better, 
                        for people not to know all the ugly 
                        things, going on out there in the 
                        dark. But I don’t know anymore... 
                        Maybe we’re all just cowards. 

           Eyes glazed, talking to himself as much as anyone. The room 
           sits still. Vann watches him, awestruck, waiting. 

           But he says nothing more. He’s done now. 

           Finally the electronic chime goes off.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                             That’s time. 
           INT. TOM’S BUILDING, STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Watching from above as Tom climbs the stairs. His steps are 
           slow, leaden. The journey to the top a long one. 

           Tom rounds the third floor, starts up the last flight. 

           Stops.

           A pair of legs, standing outside his door. The rest is 
           obscured by the railing, but we can see the fringe of a grey 
           raincoat, hanging at his side. 

           Absolute silence. The man, knowing he’s been seen. Tom, 
           knowing he’s been heard... 

           The man steps forward.

           Tom SPINS AROUND, barreling down the staircase. We hear the 
           pounding of steps behind him as the stranger chases after.

                                 STRANGER (O.S.)
                        Mr. Namath!

           But Tom’s sprinting the hall, starting down the next flight-

                                 STRANGER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Thomas Namath! I’m with the 
                        building management. Frank Lucchesi 
                        let me in!

           Tom, about to round the banister, stops. Absorbing this.

           We hear the man continue down, finally stepping into sight, 
           out of breath. Sixties, ordinary looking, a dress shirt and 
           tie under his coat. 

                                 STRANGER (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Namath, sorry to bother you 
                        like this. 
                             (offers his hand)
                        I’m Harold Caul. 

           Tom doesn’t take it, eyes still drifting toward the door. 
           Caul gives up, steps forward, reaching into his jacket --

                                 CAUL
                        Well again sorry to bother you in 
                        the evening like this but... 

           He pauses, sees Tom tensing. Caul slows down, unearths an 
           envelope. 
                                 CAUL (CONT’D)
                        ...we’re required to serve these 
                        directly to the tenant. Like I said 
                        I work for the building’s 
                        management company. 

                                 TOM
                        Frank Lucchesi owns this building. 
                        He’s owned it for forty years. 

           Caul starts opening the envelope... 

                                 CAUL
                        Mr. Lucchesi sold this property and 
                        the one next door to the Siren 
                        Management group late last year. 

           ...pulls out a stack of papers, offers them to Tom.

                                 TOM
                        What is it?

                                 CAUL
                        Notice of termination, for your 
                        lease. 

                                 TOM
                        An eviction notice. 

                                 CAUL
                        Not as aggressive as that but, yes 
                        an intent to vacate in the coming 
                        months. We’ll be tearing down the 
                        two buildings in order to develop 
                        something newer on the site.  

           Tom takes the papers, adrenaline still pumping. He starts 
           scanning the pages. Caul straightens out his clothes.

                                 CAUL (CONT’D)
                        We were hoping to schedule a time 
                        at your convenience but, you’ve got 
                        no phone number on file, no e-mail. 
                        We left notices in your mailbox 
                        downstairs, tried your buzzer...

           Tom ignores him, continues to read. Caul watches.

                                 CAUL (CONT’D)
                        You’ll notice a settlement 
                        agreement in there, compensating 
                        you for the rest of your lease, any 
                        relocation costs-
                                 TOM
                        Leave. 

           Caul grows quiet. 

                                 CAUL
                        I recognize for long residing 
                        tenants this won’t be an easy 
                        transition- 

                                 TOM
                        I’m not going anywhere.
                             (cold)
                        I’ll get a lawyer on this, bleed 
                        out your development funds, your 
                        permits, your contractors. I’ll 
                        organize. I’ll incorporate. This 
                        will be tied up in court for years; 
                        housing, civil, appeals, until 
                        Siren Management or whoever hired 
                        you goes bone fucking dry. Because, 
                        Mr. Caul, I’m very thorough. And 
                        I’ve got nothing but time. 
                             (then)
                        Now leave. 

           Caul stares back at him. But not angry, or afraid. His look 
           is almost sympathetic. Sad for the man. 

           He says nothing else, awkwardly passing Tom in the narrow 
           hallway as he continues down toward the front door. After a 
           moment we hear it close as he exits below. 

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Dark. Tom lets himself in, doesn’t bother with the lights. 

           He lowers himself onto the couch, in a daze, looks around his 
           place. The few things on the shelves. The silence. 

           He looks lost. 

                                                                  FADE OUT.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

           The city in motion. The rapid fire voices of news radio tuned 
           in as pedestrians flock the streets.

           EXT. MOTT STREET - DAY

           The narrower streets and shops of little italy.

                        the rest of the week... 

           EXT. BAR - DAY

           On a COKE as the bartender sets it down, wrapper tip still on 
           the straw. Up to:

           Tom. His bruise has gone down. He’s picked a stool next to 
           the window, his phone set out on the counter. He peers out:

           ACROSS THE STREET

           A clean view of the Nolita diner. A few faces in the booths 
           running along its windows. None of them Karen.

           Tom presses his phone. 1:45 pm. Still early.

           He sits back, pretends to watch the TV over the bar.  

           EXT. BAR - LATER

           On the bar TV. Playing a new game now. New people sitting 
           next to him. Tom’s not watching. 

           ACROSS THE STREET

           Nobody in the booths. Tom checks his phone again: 2:25 now.

                                 BARTENDER (O.S.)
                        Get you a refill? 

           Tom turns back, his coke down to the ice. A look back out the 
           window, mind running. He digs out his wallet.

                                 TOM
                        No. 
           EXT. KAREN’S BUILDING - DAY

           Tom stands in a doorway across the street, watching the 
           windows of Karen’s apartment. Still. No activity inside. 

           He pulls out his phone, scrolls through: New Messages (0)

           INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY

           Tom riding. Troubled now, scenarios running. He gets 
           something out of his wallet. Looks like a business card from 
           behind. 

           He stares down at it, debating. 

           EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - DAY

           Tom emerges from the station, above ground now. The green 
           blur of Central Park in the background. A chime goes off in 
           his pocket, getting a signal again. He checks it. 

                                     New Message (1)

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           Quieter here. Tom, anxious, fingers flying as he dials in.

                        Inbox 482. 

           He finds a bench, goes still, listening. Finally:

                                 KAREN (RECORDING)
                        I know I should have called. You 
                        don’t have to worry, I’m okay. 

           He lets out a breath at the sound of her voice. She’s alive.

           Then:

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        They know who you are. Where you 
                        live, your birthday, your family. 
                        They told me they’d go after you, 
                        after them. 
                             (and then)
                        They told me your name. James 
                        Keaton.

                        chased you, got your wallet. Almost 
                        got you.... 

           Tom’s face falls, starting to realize what’s happening here. 
           Karen continues. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        ...and it would have been because 
                        of me. Why didn’t you tell me...
                             (faster now)
                        You were right. You gave me 
                        instructions, I put you in danger, 
                        it would have been my fault. Well I 
                        won’t let that happen to you.
                             (a beat)
                        They said if I met them at their 
                        location and brought the rest of 
                        the files, they'd leave you alone, 
                        leave both of us alone... 

           Tom, already pulling out his TTY, booting it up. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        It’s at Lincoln Center, it’s 
                        public, like you said it should be. 
                        I wasn’t supposed to tell you but, 
                        you said that we wouldn’t speak 
                        again and I needed to warn you... 
                        and to thank you. Goodbye James. 

           Tom plugs his phone into the machine, eyes glued to the call 
           indicator light. 

           INT. LOBBY, LINCOLN CENTER - DAY

           Karen slides her phone into her pocket as a SECURITY GUARD 
           goes through her bag, a glimpse of the report inside. A sign 
           on the table beside them reads: 

           “As A Courtesy To Others, Please Silence Your Cell Phones.” 

           She waits, watching the next row over as another guard 
           removes a Nikon camera from a man’s bag, hands it back to 
           him, points to a coat check outside security. 

           The guard slides Karen’s bag back to her. 

                                 GUARD
                        Enjoy the show. 
           EXT. CENTRAL PARK RESEVOIR - DAY

           Words scrolling across the machine’s screen:

                “....NOT RESPONDING AT THIS TIME. THE USER IS NOT RESPONDING 
                                    AT THIS TIME....”

           Tom curses under his breath, starts to pace. He looks back 
           down at the screen, a message waiting:

                           “WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEAVE A MESSAGE?”

           He jumps back on the keyboard, typing frantically. Over this:

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Do not go to the meet. They are 
                        lying to you. That is not my name, 
                        they know... 

           INT. ATRIUM, LINCOLN CENTER - DAY

           As Karen walks through the crowd, oblivious. Tom’s voice 
           taking over now:

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        ...nothing. I told you they'd try 
                        to make another deal, this is it. 
                        It’s a trap. The files aren’t the 
                        rest of the evidence. You are. 

           Karen continues into -

           INT. THE CONCERT HALL, LINCOLN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

           Expansive. Historic. The three-tiered mezzanines of a 
           thousand seats wrapping the orchestra stage. 

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        I can’t follow you. I told you I’d 
                        need to walk away. I can’t protect 
                        you anymore. 
                             (and then)
                        Please. Get out.

           Karen checks her tickets, and starts down the aisle. 

           INT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Tom stares down at the screen.
               “MESSAGE SENT. CALL NOW DISCONNECTED. THANK YOU FOR USING THE 
                        RELAY SERVICE. HAVE A WONDERFUL EVENING.”

           He doesn’t move for the longest time. Then, calmly, he 
           unplugs his phone, folds the keyboard, and rises. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK RESEVOIR - DUSK

           Tom walks along the water, sun disappearing to the West.  
           There is no urgency to his steps, a ghost. 

           A GROUP OF RUNNERS suddenly swarming past him. He steps off 
           to the side, waiting as they pass. The last of them clear...

           But Tom stays, in a trance, staring across the water. More 
           than just calculating now. He’s searching for what he is. 

           ...Tom begins walking back the way he came. 

           The slow build of Ravel’s Pavane Pour Une Infante Défunte 
           rising in the distance.

           Tom’s walk quickens, turns to a run. 

           EXT. PLAZA, LINCOLN CENTER - DUSK

           “THE MUSIC OF RAVEL” displayed across the plaza. CONCERT 
           GOERS drifting past the fountain, dressed for the evening.

           Tom crosses the street into frame. 

           BOX OFFICE WINDOW

           Tom makes his way to it, slows his breath. 

                                 TOM
                        Show me what you’ve got left. 

           INT. LOBBY, LINCOLN CENTER - DUSK

           Tom waits in line. The last people now filing in behind him. 
           He steps forward, raises his arms to let a security guard 
           with a wand metal detector screen him. 

           A beep. 

           Tom opens his jacket, shows him his cell phone, his keys, the 
           folded TTY machine. The guard clocks the machine.
                                 GUARD
                        No laptops or recording devices 
                        allowed inside sir.  

                                 TOM
                        It’s not a laptop. 

                                 GUARD
                        I’m sorry sir, you’ll have to check 
                        it. The counter can be found just p-

                                 TOM
                        It’s an assisted calling device. 
                        It’s for the deaf. It’s not a 
                        laptop.

                                 GUARD
                        Then why’s it got a keyboard?

           Tom, flustered now.

                                 TOM
                        Because it’s --

                                 GUARD
                        Look, check it or miss the show, we 
                        got people waiting behind you. 

           People starting to look. The guard waves up the next person 
           in line. Tom stands aside, thrown now, out of options. 

           PRELAP: Piano music RISING. Fast, chaotic...

           Tom starts toward the coat check.

           INT. CONCERT HALL, LINCOLN CENTER - LATER

           Dark. A thousand silhouettes listening as the piano continues 
           on stage. The conductor sweating, the orchestra chasing, 
           trying to keep up.

           AUDIENCE

           Karen watches, her bag beneath her, an empty seat beside her. 

           IN THE BALCONY

           Tom, two tiers away, watching her from above. 

           He suddenly loses his view as the orchestra finishes, 
           audience members beginning to stand, applauding. 
           The orchestra clears the stage as the house lights come up, 
           “INTERMISSION” fading up on the screen above them. 

           People rising for the bathrooms, the cocktail counter, a 
           smoke outside. Above, the echo of a Ravel track starts 
           playing over the PA system. Tom empties into the aisles with 
           the rest, hoping to get an eyeline.

           He finds Karen again. Still in her seat. And now...

           HOBBS walking down her aisle. He takes the seat beside her. 

           They speak, heads forward, their words a mystery this far 
           away. Hobbs remains a moment, then rises, now holding Karen’s 
           bag... 

           ...and walks away. Tom takes in the scene. Karen in her seat, 
           safe. Hobbs departing. Is it over?  

           Tom heads toward the curtains.

           INT. ATRIUM, LINCOLN CENTER - NIGHT

           A landing from the balcony level with a view. Tom steps out 
           of the theatre, following Hobbs from above. 

           ATRIUM FLOOR

           Hundreds talking, stretching their legs, a line at the bar. 
           Hobbs weaves his way across the floor, finds a quiet place. 

           He opens the bag, fingers through its contents. Satisfied he 
           closes it up, starts toward the exit... 

           But he doesn’t, instead drifting to the wall near the doors 
           where MOSLEY waits with two others. A man and woman he’s 
           never seen before, but we recognize KUAN and ROSETTI.  

           Tom, seeing this, on alert now. 

           KUAN has his hand on an empty wheelchair, listening as Hobbs 
           confers with them. They break up, the three heading back 
           inside the theatre, each moving toward a separate door. 

           Hobbs remains by the entrance. 

           Tom rushes back toward the theatre.

           INT. CONCERT HALL, LINCOLN CENTER - NIGHT

           RAVEL still playing above, haunting from the rafters.
           Tom runs to the banister. 

           BELOW

           Karen, still in her seat. Mosley, Kuan and Rosetti stationing 
           themselves in the wings, but going no further. 

           Something’s coming. 

           Tom’s eyes darting around the hall, the ushers, the exits, 
           searching for a way to warn her. He digs into his pocket, 
           pulls out his phone. A beat. 

           He begins to dial. 

           KAREN

           A small glow in her jacket, her phone screen blinking on. But 
           she sees and hears nothing. 

           TOM

           Phone to his ear. Hearing --

                                 KAREN (OVER PHONE) (VOICEMAIL)
                        You’ve reached Karen Grant, I’m 
                        unable to take your call at the mo- 

           He hangs up, tries again. Desperate now.

           Suddenly, CHIMES above. The lights dimming in and out. 

           Intermission is coming to an end. The crowd starts trickling 
           back in. Tom clocks KUAN at the top of the aisle as his hand 
           suddenly goes to his ear. A radio.

           Mosley and Rosetti, hands raised, on the same channel. 

           Tom watching. The theatre filling now, people in motion. 

           They begin to move in. Their approach blending in as people 
           shuffle back to their seats. Kuan remains with the 
           wheelchair, unfolding the leg mounts. Tom, panicking now. 

           A last look at Karen, oblivious to it all. 

           INT. STAIRWELL, LINCOLN CENTER - NIGHT

           The door slams open. Tom barrels inside, goes to the wall. An 
           emergency exit map for the building, a red box beneath it. He 
           scans the map, finds what he’s looking for, then -- 

           CRASH -- he breaks the glass on the alarm box -- PULLS.
           INT. CONCERT HALL, LINCOLN CENTER - NIGHT

           The room plunges into darkness, house lights switching to 
           strobes as the FIRE ALARM begins to pulse over the PA. 

           INT. ATRIUM, LINCOLN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

           The same. People stalling in their tracks, eyes to the 
           ceiling. HOBBS, a look on his face, realizing what’s next. 

           The exodus begins. 

           INT. CONCERT HALL, LINCOLN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

           Mosley and Rosetti finding themselves suddenly fighting the 
           current. Kuan pressed against the door, now in everyone’s 
           way...

           INT. ATRIUM, LINCOLN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

           The flow reversing, colliding as inbound guests 180 toward 
           the doors. HOBBS, trying futilely to cover the exits. Doesn’t 
           see --

           TOM

           Emerging from the stairwell. He moves along the wall, against 
           the grain of the stampede. He skirts behind the now abandoned 
           cocktail counter, emerges, ducks into the theatre. 

           INT. CONCERT HALL, LINCOLN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

           Lights still strobing, causing the scene to disappear, bodies 
           and faces reappearing seconds later and feet ahead.  

           Karen inches forward as her row exits. 

           Lights OFF, Lights ON.

           The aisle ahead: MOSLEY, waiting, letting Karen come to him.

           Lights OFF, Lights ON.

           Behind her: ROSETTI entering her row on the other side, 
           squeezing past evacuees, closing in.

           Lights OFF, Lights ON.

           Mosley’s hand, a syringe at the ready, scanning the aisle 
           around him. A sea flowing out, the backs of heads... 
           Lights OFF, Lights ON.

           And then, Tom’s FACE. Eyes burning as he STABS something into 
           Mosley. Mosley’s eyes go wide, hand dropping, A WINE 
           CORKSCREW from the bar now sticking out of his leg.

           Karen’s mouth opens as she sees the man in front of her 
           buckle to his knees. Tom takes his head, slams it against the 
           seat, knocking him out. He looks up at Karen. 

           Their eyes meet. 

           Karen, terrified, turns to run the other way. Tom grabs her 
           by the shoulders, yells something, but he’s drowned out by 
           the siren. Karen struggles against his grip. He yells again.   

                                 TOM
                        -aren, it’s me. All right? It’s me.

           Something in his voice. She looks down, the syringe next to 
           Mosley’s hand. Tom looks past her, sees ROSETTI fighting 
           toward them. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        We have to go. 

           EXT. SIDE STREET, LINCOLN CENTER - NIGHT

           Backstage crew spilling out onto the street. Tom and Karen 
           filing out with the rest, heads down as fire trucks pull up 
           around the corner. 

           DOWN THE STREET

           Tom tows Karen away from the chaos, pulls her into a doorway, 
           clocks the direction they came from.

                                 KAREN
                        That man, was he-

                                 TOM
                        In two blocks there’s an M11 bus. 
                        You’re going to take it to Penn 
                        Station-

                                 KAREN
                        Wait, where are you going? I’ll go 
                        with you.

                                 TOM
                        No. We need you away from here, 
                        now. Don’t go back to your place- 
                                 KAREN
                        Let me come with you.

           Tom ignores her, eyes glued down the street. 

                                 TOM
                        At Penn you’re going to get on New 
                        Jersey transit, use cash- 

                                 KAREN
                        James please-

                                 TOM
                             (reaching to her, direct)
                        My name’s not James. They lied. 
                        Everything they said was a lie.

           She suddenly goes still. He follows her eyeline, sees there’s 
           blood on his hands. He lowers them. 

           A city bus comes into view up the street, waiting at the 
           light. He motions toward it.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Don’t tell me where you’re going. 
                        Don’t stop for anything. 

           Karen starts toward it, still in shock. She stops. 

                                 KAREN
                        When will I talk to you again? 

           On Tom. He can’t give her an answer. He doesn’t know.

                                 TOM
                        The phone I gave you, you still 
                        have it?
                             (she checks, nods yes)
                        I’ll find you. 

           With that she runs toward the bus. Tom waits in the doorway, 
           watching until she’s made it inside. It pulls away.

           Tom shoves his hands in his coat, starts walking. Faster. 
           Eyes red. A fire getting ready to burn.

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Hands sliding the floor panel aside. He opens the footlocker: 

           Karen’s report inside. Keys, hand gun, money all laying 
           beside it. We see now this doubles as a sort of go-bag. 
           Tom takes the gun, ejects the magazine, examines a hole on 
           the side, brass at the bottom. It’s full. Ready if needed.

           He sets it back inside, grabs the report, and shuts the lid.

           INT. COPY STORE - NIGHT

           Tom stands over the copier as he did in the beginning, high 
           beams washing across his face, rubber nitrile gloves on his 
           hands, watching Karen’s report feed through the machine. 

           Another copy hits the tray. As Tom checks its pages we see 
           lines he’s circled, underlined, notes in the margin: 

           "SEC Violation Form D... CGMP/FDA Ingredient/Adulterated...”

           Their evidence. Tom finishes, places it in a duffel bag on 
           the table, several copies already inside. 

           A glimpse at the Xerox’s touch screen: 06 of 40

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Tom marches down the street, the duffel weighing on his 
           shoulder. 

           EXT. 2ND AVENUE - NIGHT

           He turns the corner, heading for his building. A figure in 
           the background notices as he passes, starts to follow. Then --

                                 MALE 
                             (calling out)
                        Mr. N!

           Tom glances over his shoulder, LUIS running up behind him. 

                                 LUIS
                        Hey Mr. Namath, sorry to bother you-

                                 TOM
                             (keeps walking)
                        I can’t talk right now Luis. 

                                 LUIS
                        Okay, it’s just, you asked me the 
                        other day if I’d noticed anything 
                        outside the building, and, well I 
                        noticed something.

           Tom stops. Listening now, waiting for more.
                                 LUIS (CONT’D)
                        Thought it might be one of the 
                        contractors, this van, people kept 
                        getting in and out. Van eventually 
                        drove off, but I was getting the 
                        cans out back - there’s the van 
                        again, parked like a block away. 

           Tom goes cold. 

                                 LUIS (CONT’D)
                        I was gonna call management or some-

                                 TOM
                        When?

                                 LUIS
                        What do you mean?

                                 TOM
                             (direct now)
                        When you saw this. How along ago 
                        was it?

           Luis stares at him, confused.

                                 LUIS
                        It’s still here. 

           Tom, absorbing this.

           EXT. EAST 68TH STREET - NIGHT

           Around the corner. Tom stares from a distance, alone now. 

           The white utility van sitting down the street, silent at the 
           curb. 

           Tom quietly crosses, getting an angle on the back of his 
           building now. His windows at the top: Dark. No sign of life.

           Tom doesn’t move, instead clocking the traffic light down the 
           block. Red. Cars idling at the intersection.

           He waits. 

           The light turns green. Cars starting to move, turning, 
           headlights beaming. Tom looks back up at his windows... 

           SILHOUETTES revealed as headlights wash over his apartment, 
           their outlines cascading across his ceiling. 

           They’re inside. 
           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Hobbs standing back from the window, silently watching the 
           street below. He looks across the apartment.

           Rosetti standing post at the back window. She sees Hobbs, 
           shakes her head. They resume their watch.

           And then, a hum in Hobbs’ jacket. Rosetti, looking over. 
           Hobbs wordlessly pulls the phone from his pocket. The screen: 

                                       212-206-0216

           He answers, listening. Nothing on the other end. 

                                 HOBBS
                        Is this you?

           More dead air. Finally, softly: 

                                 TOM (OVER PHONE)
                        Do you know what you’ve done?

           Hobbs looks up, waving his finger, signaling-

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Don’t bother. I’m at a pay phone 
                        and I won’t be here long. 

                                 HOBBS
                        ...I think we can still come to a- 

                                 TOM
                        What was your plan?

           EXT. CORNER, CHINA TOWN - CONTINUOUS

           Tom stands at a pay phone, streets deserted around him.

                                 TOM
                        That I wouldn’t send it? That I was 
                        bluffing? I get the money either 
                        way now right, why risk seeing this 
                        through and having some LLC bag man 
                        chasing me down the rest of my 
                        life. You guessed. You made a call. 
                        Except that’s not how this works. 
                             (then)
                        See when the markets open tomorrow 
                        you won’t have lost me, you’ll have 
                        lost a company. And the people 
                        playing that high up don’t just 
                        take the loss. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        They find the guy that made the 
                        wrong call. Are you getting it now? 
                        You’re not coming after me. They’re 
                        coming after you, you fuck.   

           Sneering these last words. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I know where you are. It doesn’t 
                        matter. I’ve got what I need. And 
                        you’ll never find her.

           ...We hear rustling on the other end...

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Are you listening to me? She’s 
                        gone. And so am I.

           Tom slams the phone back on the hook. Burning now.

           A beat. 

           The payphone begins to ring beside him. He stares at it. 
           Metallic, violating. Screaming.

           Tom hitches the duffel bag up on his shoulder and starts 
           walking away. The payphone calling after him...

           He pulls out his own cell phone, begins scrolling through the 
           numbers.

           Behind him the payphone calls out a last time, goes silent. 

           Tom keeps walking, finds Karen’s number and dials. As it 
           rings he eyes the sky, faint light on the horizon. It’ll be 
           dawn soon. Tom spots a cab in the distance, raises his arm.

           Finally the other line answers. And then we hear:

                                 HOBBS (OVER PHONE)
                        It’s still me. 

           Tom goes cold. Icy calm on the other end. 

                                 HOBBS (CONT’D)
                        I’ll get her for you. 

           The sound of rustling again. Then:

                                 KAREN (OVER PHONE)
                        ...I’m sorry.
           Tom winces, hearing her voice with theirs. The world starts 
           to echo. Scenarios all running at once, the things they 
           shouldn’t know, couldn’t know. Racking his brain. 

                                 TOM
                             (then, steeling himself)
                        You’re going to be okay. I’m going 
                        to figure this out. You tell them, 
                        you tell them I can take the FDA 
                        report to-

                                 KAREN (OVER PHONE)
                        There is no FDA report. 

           A tone in her voice. Different now.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Everything in that report, my job, 
                        my apartment, my records. It was 
                        all for you. 

           The ground falling out. 

           Tom looks down at the duffel, the pounds of pages inside. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        Synth-AG Institutes is a subsidiary 
                        of Getty Pharmaceuticals. 

           Hearing but not listening. Tom lets the duffel fall, sits 
           down on the curb beside it. Moving very slowly now. 

                                 TOM
                        ...this was about Jeff Whitacre.

                                 KAREN
                        You brokered his deal. Returned his 
                        originals. But that left the last 
                        copy with you. And who are you? 
                        Maybe a guy with money problems, 
                        starts selling things off. Or legal 
                        problems, get yourself a plea 
                        bargain. Or maybe one day your 
                        conscience just gets that second 
                        wind, and you suddenly feel like 
                        doing some version of the right 
                        thing. In any case, we couldn’t 
                        afford the risk. We needed you...
                             (then)
                        But you’re very good. We only had 
                        one side of it the first time. We 
                        were hoping with both sides, we’d 
                        be able to find you in the middle. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        The airport, the mail, the second 
                        handoff. Very thorough. You only 
                        broke your rule once.

           On Tom.

           A FAST JARRING JUMP CUT -- NO SOUND

           In the concert hall -- TOM watching from the balcony, his 
           cell phone pressed to his face -- KAREN down below, phone 
           vibrating in her pocket, feeling it but letting it ring --  

           Tom blinks. Back in the present. 

           That same phone now resting in his hand. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        But then we knew where you’d be. 
                        And where you’d been. 

                                 TOM
                             (empty)
                        I’ll be gone before you get here. 

                                 KAREN
                        We’re not coming. We don’t need to. 
                        You said it yourself, you know 
                        where we are. 

           INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - AT THAT MOMENT

           Karen standing in the middle of the room. Pushing toward her-

                                 KAREN
                        Your real name. A photo. A letter. 
                        You’ve got to have somebody. A 
                        friend. Some family. We'll pull 
                        your prints, find them that way.

           And past her, floating toward the record player. The TOMMY 
           album on the shelf. The newspaper obituary folded inside.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        No one’s left. All those clients, 
                        moving on, leaving you to keep 
                        their secrets for them. The only 
                        person left to protect, is you...

                                 TOM
                        Stop. 
                                 KAREN
                        ...we’ll find something in the 
                        drawers. Something in the walls. 
                        We’ll find someone here. And then, 
                        we’ll go-

                                 TOM
                        There’s a lock box, in the floor.

           A long silence. He’s breaking.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Combination is 4855. Inside you’ll 
                        find two keys. One is to a PO Box. 
                        I have a backup. The other key is 
                        to a storage unit where your files 
                        are being kept. Leave it in PO Box 
                        121 at the Lenox Hill Post Office 
                        and walk away. I’ll get your files, 
                        they’ll be back in the box by 
                        tonight. Take them and we're done. 

                                 KAREN
                        Why don’t we all go out to the 
                        storage unit together.

                                 TOM
                        No, this is the deal. Like you 
                        said, you’re not my only client. 
                             (waiting)
                        Walk out, right now, and I'll give 
                        you everything you want.

           On Karen, weighing. 

                                 KAREN
                        I don’t have to tell you what 
                        happens if you fuck around on this.

                                 TOM
                        You’ve seen my work. I don’t have 
                        the temperament to fuck around. 

           Tom hangs up, breathing hard, the facade dropping. He’s 
           scared to death. 

           It’s light out now, the runners and early workers starting to 
           emerge. Tom takes the phone, removes the battery, drops them 
           in the trash. His eyes land on the duffel on the ground. 

           He leaves it there, starts walking. 
           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Karen lowers the phone, looks up at the others. 

                                 KAREN
                        Lenox Hill Post Office. 

                                 ROSETTI
                             (to Hobbs)
                        Won’t open for a few hours. 

           Hobbs glances at his watch, plays it out in his head.

                                 HOBBS
                        Leave Mosley here with the van.
                             (he starts out)
                        Let’s go look at his exits. We’ll 
                        let him bring the key out, take him 
                        then. 

           EXT. DRUG STORE - EARLY MORNING

           Watching Tom inside as he buys a prepaid cell phone off the 
           wall behind the register. 

           EXT. EAST RIVER - EARLY MORNING 

           The greyer side of Manhattan. The traffic vein of the FDR 
           running the shore, Roosevelt Island floating in the distance.

           Tom sits on a bench facing the water. The phone packaging 
           mangled open beside him. 

           He’s holding the phone, a number already dialed in. After a 
           moment he hits “Call”, waits as it rings. Eventually:

                                 NANCY (RECORDING) 
                        Hey this is Nancy. I’m not here but 
                        probably not far either so, leave a 
                        message and I’ll talk to you soon.  

           The beep. Tom opens his mouth to say something. Nothing 
           comes. He quietly lowers the phone, hangs up. 

           He looks back out at the water. It’s quiet here. 

           The phone suddenly chirps. A call coming through. Tom stares 
           at the screen, finally answers. 

                                 TOM (INTO PHONE)
                        Hello.
                                 NANCY (OVER PHONE) 
                        Yeah, sorry I just missed a call 
                        but didn’t recognize this number?

           Background noise on the other end. Tom hesitates a moment. 

                                 TOM
                        Yeah. It’s Tommy. 

                                 NANCY
                        What!? You got a phone? Holy shit!
                             (then, louder)
                        Well what’s up!? 

                                 TOM
                        Just... calling to say hi. Can you 
                        hear me okay? 

                                 NANCY
                        ...Yeah, sorry. It’s a little loud 
                        for me here. We’re at a volunteer 
                        thing but it’s wrapping up. I’ll 
                        call you back right after, k?

           Tom stares off, a pained smile.

                                 TOM
                        Maybe I can try you later. 

                                 NANCY
                        You sure? Well I’m around whenever 
                        this afternoon. I think dad wanted 
                        to ask you something about the car 
                        anyway. 

                                 TOM
                        Okay. 
                             (then)
                        Hey, Nancy. Tell your dad something 
                        for me?

                                 NANCY
                        Sure. 

                                 TOM
                        Tell him...
                             (searching for some words)
                        Just tell him I tried, to call.

           A beat. Background noise getting louder, drowning her out. 

                                 NANCY
                        I’ll tell him. I should get back 
                        but congrats on the phone! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NANCY (CONT'D)
                        I’m glad you came out of hiding. 
                        Welcome back Tommy.  

           The line goes quiet. 

           Tom stands, steps up to the railing. The water slapping the 
           bricks below... 

           He starts walking North. 

           INT. LENOX HILL POST OFFICE, CORRIDOR - MORNING

           CLOSE ON Box 121 

           As Hobbs unlocks the box, setting the storage unit key 
           inside. He closes the door, the key sitting in the window, 
           and walks out into...

           LOBBY

           A few people already in line. Postal Workers in the back. 
           Hobbs takes in the space. The same darting eyes as Tom, 
           mapping the exits. The heavy locked doors to the back, the 
           caged art deco service windows...

           And three sets of doors leading out to the sidewalk. 

           His only exits. 

           INT. UTILITY VAN - MORNING

           Hobbs slides the door open. 

           Karen, Kuan and Rosetti in the back. Mosley in the driver’s 
           seat. A bandage on his leg. His face looks pale. Hobbs reads 
           his condition, nods toward Kuan.

                                 HOBBS
                        Give him your gun. 

           Mosley unclips, hands it to Kuan. Hobbs meets eyes with 
           Karen, but gives no further instruction. She’s staying here. 

           EXT. 2ND AVENUE - DAY

           The sidewalks full now. Tom makes his way up the block. 
           EXT. LENOX HILL POST OFFICE - DAY

           As Tom rounds the corner down the street. It’s residential 
           here, between the avenues. A few mail trucks. A few 
           brownstones. Nothing out of order.

           Tom starts up the post office steps, takes a last look, then 
           goes inside.

           We stay on the street. 

           ...HOBBS, ROSETTI, AND KUAN all emerging. Invisible until 
           now, crossing the road. The van appears down the block, pulls 
           in silently behind a furniture truck, waiting. 

           Hobbs moves quickly to the door, glances through the glass. 

           INSIDE

           Tom disappearing around the corner toward the PO boxes. 
           Trapped.

           HOBBS

           Rolls away from the glass, motions to the others. Each 
           stationing themselves beside the remaining two exits, out of 
           view. Calm, casual... 

           CLOSE ON: Hands inside fabric, tightening around taser 
           triggers, syringe handles, the pistol...

           They wait. 

           Kuan’s door opens. He tenses, watching... It’s not Tom.

           Another person exits Hobbs’ door. A woman. Another through 
           Kuan’s, an older Asian man. Someone else going inside. 

           The van, idling. They wait. 

           LATER

           The furniture truck has finished off-loading. Hobbs watching 
           as they pack up. This is taking too long. 

           He peers inside again toward the PO boxes. No angle. No view. 
           A look to the others. They shake their heads. No eyes either.

           Hobbs puts his hand to his ear.

           DOWN THE STREET

           Karen steps out of the van, approaches. No look to the others 
           as she passes them on the steps, disappearing inside. 
           INT. LENOX HILL POST OFFICE, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Humming now. The faces of New York gripping package slips, 
           taping boxes, addressing envelopes. No sign of Tom. 

           Karen starts toward the PO boxes.

           CORRIDOR

           Abandoned. She walks further in, finds PO box 121, peers in: 

           The storage unit key still there, sitting inside the window.

           On Karen, thrown. Another look down the corridor. She’s still 
           alone. She reaches for her phone, starts to dial.

           And then, a sound. 

           A HAND slowly reaching into box 121... from the other side. 
           She looks up through the glass... 

           Finds Tom looking back at her, in the blue work shirt of a 
           POST OFFICE WORKER. Red stripes down the pockets. Eagle patch 
           on the breast. 

           His day job. 

           Karen’s mind catching up as she backs away. Tom just stays 
           there, staring silently behind the broken collage of PO BOX 
           windows between them. He slides the key into his pocket. 

           Karen realizes what’s happening. She starts for the lobby...

           INT. LENOX HILL POST OFFICE, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Hobbs, Rosetti and Kuan at the windows. Suddenly PATROLMEN 
           appearing behind them, pressing them against the wall. 

           Blue and red flaring in from the street. Customers inside 
           starting to notice. Karen enters the lobby, seeing it all. 

           They weren’t trapping him. He was trapping them. 

           A man slips in around the officers at the door, fast, 
           efficient. Coat and tie. It’s Vann. 

           He scans the crowd, meets eyes with Karen. She stands there, 
           defiant, impotent. No where to run.

           He starts for her. 
           EXT. LENOX HILL POST OFFICE - LATER

           Squad cars lining the front. Police moving up and down the 
           stairs. Down the street --

           Mosley being removed from the van. Limping. A forensic unit 
           has the back doors open, flashlights waving inside. 

           TOM

           Standing out of the way, watching it all. 

           His eyes fall on one of the squad cars. A head in the back. 
           Almost by instinct HOBBS looks up in the window. The bandage 
           on his ear. The fading bruise on Tom’s face. Their game is 
           over. Hobbs turns away.

           DOWN THE STREET 

           Vann speaks with one of technicians at the curb. He breaks 
           off, joining Tom on the steps.   

                                 VANN
                        Found two more unregistered 
                        firearms in the van, counterfeit 
                        agency papers, syringe cases 
                        contained some kind of 
                        neuromuscular-blocker. Techs still 
                        need to go through the laptop 
                        but... it was like you said. 

           Standing together, surveying the scene. Vann looks over. 

                                 VANN (CONT’D)
                        You want to tell me what’s going 
                        on?

           Tom doesn’t answer immediately, watching the squad car pull 
           away, lights off. Finally --

                                 TOM
                        Let’s go for a ride. 

           EXT. LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY - DAY

           Floating over a sedan as it heads out of the city. 

           INT. SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

           Vann drives. Tom stares out the window. But not the 
           calculating look this time. Lighter. Almost as if he’s turned 
           his mind off, just seeing the view. 
           EXT. STORAGE FACILITY - AFTERNOON

           Vann pulls up to the gate. 

           IN THE CAR

           Tom undoes his seat belt. 

                                 TOM
                        I’ll be back. 

           He climbs out. Vann watches him punch a code in at the gate, 
           disappearing inside. Vann waits a moment.

           OUTSIDE

           The door swings open, Vann starting to follow. A glance into 
           the maze of units inside. Tom out of sight. 

           Vann pulls out his phone, starts typing. Slows...

           Another look at the gate. Something stopping him. A feeling. 
           A bond between men who have seen each other at their weakest.

           He lowers the phone. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Tom reappears, the black document tube from Whitacre slung 
           over his shoulder. He finds Vann leaning against the car, 
           waiting. Tom unslings the tube, offering it to him.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        This is a copy of a chemical 
                        diagnostic for Getty 
                        Pharmaceuticals. It identifies nine 
                        illegal supplements within their 
                        product lines. And the internal 
                        memorandum approving their release 
                        to market.

           Vann, absorbing this. 

                                 VANN
                        Why do you have it?

                                 TOM
                        Because the man who was trying to 
                        do the right thing with it is dead.
                             (a beat)
                        And because this is what I do. 

           Meeting his eyes. Confiding. Vann takes it, looking down at 
           the tube. Finally:
                                 VANN
                        You know, when you called I thought 
                        it was because you were in some bar 
                        ready to have a seat. 
                             (then)
                        But you didn’t choose me because 
                        you needed a sponsor, did you. 

           Tom doesn’t answer. He doesn’t need to. Instead he digs out a 
           set of storage unit keys, rotating them in his hand. Then...

                                 TOM
                        If anything happens to me. To my 
                        family.

           He holds the keys out to Vann. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           INT. TOM’S APARTMENT - WEEKS LATER

           Completely empty. Slowly drifting across the loft, the muted 
           city out the window. Dust outlines of furniture now gone. The 
           workbench. The TTY machine. The record player. 

           Bleached and naked. 

           PRELAP:

           The leaves and birds of somewhere far from here. 

           EXT. GAS STATION, OHIO - DAY

           A lone station off a rural road. Tom stands at the pump, 
           refueling the grey Chevy Nancy had in the driveway. The boxes 
           of a college freshmen pressing the windows inside.  

           Nancy emerges from the station, a bag of snacks and sodas 
           dangling from her hand, eyes glued to her phone.  

                                 TOM
                        What’d your dad say?

           No response. He realizes she’s got headphones in. He motions 
           to her ears. She pulls the headphones out...

           ...and reinserts two devices, a clear tube running behind 
           each ear. HEARING AIDS. Her hair falling back down as she 
           approaches...

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        What’d your dad say?
                                 NANCY
                        He’s going to meet us Saturday at 
                        the dorm. Here, smile:

           She raises her phone, takes a photo. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        He asked for proof of life. I told 
                        him I mastered 5th gear halfway 
                        through Pennsylvania.

           Tom keeps his mouth shut. She sees it. 

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Shut up. 

           Tom grins, nods at the car.

                                 TOM
                        You wanna switch?

                                 NANCY
                        No, I got this. 

                                 TOM
                        Eating and driving stick, that’s a 
                        new level. 

                                 NANCY
                        I got this. Here you can DJ. 

           She hands him her phone, climbs into the driver’s seat. 

           Tom scrolls through her music, pauses, finding something. The 
           hint of a smile. He opens his door. 

           As he climbs in the passenger side we hear a piano begin to 
           echo, the early chords of THE WHO - I’M IN TUNE. 

           We float over the Chevy, watching as it pulls away from the 
           station, changes gears with a jerk, and starts down the road. 

                                         THE END
