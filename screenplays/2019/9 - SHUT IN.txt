                                     SHUT IN

                                                              FADE IN:

           EXT. UNDER AN APPLE TREE - DAY

           An APPLE rotting on the ground. A worm wiggles out. 

           BARE FEET tiptoe around it. A child's. 

           HEAVY BREATHING from the owner of the feet. Then a small, 
           soft HAND grabs a different apple. A better one.

           The little feet run off.

           EXT. RURAL FARM HOUSE PROPERTY - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Rows of battle-scarred apple trees, neglected and gnarled but 
           heavy with fruit in the crisp autumn air.

           Peaceful. Like a cemetery is peaceful.

           They lead up to an old farmhouse, a thin ridge of Smoky 
           Mountains in the background, ghostly blue and gray. Must be 
           Tennessee or thereabouts.

           Paint peeling, a few missing boards on the exterior, a hole 
           through the front porch.

           A pile of new 2x4s that never got used.

           And likely never will because...

           There's a FOR-SALE SIGN out front next to an older Ford 
           Escort weighed down with luggage. 

           Moving day.

           The WIND STIRS the leaves.

           An under-dressed GIRL, barely four, with bright pink cheeks 
           in the chilly air, emerges from them, running toward the 
           house and...

           Clutches the apple like it was the last damn apple on earth.

           She bounds up the porch steps.

           And skillfully avoids the hole like she's done a thousand 
           times, just as --

           -- the screen door swings open with a SQUEAKY CRASH, a 
           frantic woman's VOICE spilling out over pounding HEAVY METAL 
           MUSIC.
                                 YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Lainey! Where have you been?!

           JESSICA DARCY, 20, broom in hand, appears at the threshold, 
           her Appalachian twang a dead giveaway for the mountainous 
           south.

           The too-young mother is slightly underweight and exudes an 
           anxious naiveté, like she was just playing house one day when 
           the dolls suddenly turned into real children with real needs. 
           She's in over her head but her eyes are clear and thoughtful.

           Lainey offers the apple to her mother.

                                 JESSICA
                        I told you I need to see you at all 
                        times. Do you understand me?

                                 LAINEY
                        Mommy, I got you an apple. It's a 
                        good one.

           A beat. How can she be mad at that?

                                 JESSICA
                        Thanks. Come on, get inside.

           She takes the apple and we follow them --

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           -- inside to the empty living room of tall windows, scuffed 
           original hardwoods, and a fireplace in the corner missing a 
           few bricks. A fixer-upper's fantasy. The heavy metal music is 
           an odd contrast.

           Jessica promptly locks the front door.

                                 JESSICA
                        I told you not to unlock this, 
                        Lainey. Didn't you hear me? And 
                        stop getting apples. We don't need 
                        them.

           Ignoring her mom, the precocious pre-schooler takes a seat on 
           a rusted tricycle sitting on the old hardwoods.

           Next to her is a large CRATE brimming with apples, someone's 
           halfhearted attempt at harvest.

           Jessica tosses the apple onto the pile.
                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        He can join his friends in there.

           Lainey is utterly devastated.

                                 LAINEY
                        No! It's for you! Eat it!

           A beat as Jessica decides if an argument is worth it. 

           She quickly picks an apple from the pile.

                                 LAINEY (CONT’D)
                        That's not the one.

           A BABY'S CRY echoes down the staircase over the music. 
           Jessica huffs and plucks another apple from the pile.

                                 LAINEY (CONT’D)
                        No!

           The baby's CRY GETS LOUDER. Jessica studies the pile of red 
           fruit trying to remember which one it is. They all look 
           exactly the same.

                                 JESSICA
                        Are you kidding me?

           The dire look on Lainey's face says no. 

           Jessica picks another.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        This one?

           Lainey beams and nods in approval. Jessica's incredulous. 
           Yeah, right, it's the same one.

           Satisfied, Lainey pedals down the hallway toward the crying.

                                 LAINEY
                        I'll get the baby!

           Jessica follows behind, buffing the apple on her faded 
           Metallica t-shirt, readying it for an obligatory taste.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'll get him, Laine. You know the 
                        rules.

           Jessica takes a bite of the apple. Then --

           -- stops suddenly.
           She spits out the bite into her palm. A beam of light from 
           the living room window reveals the problem.

           It's rotten.

           Unnerved, she stares at the apple for a beat.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           A RUSTY SQUEAK as the lid to a metal garbage can swings open, 
           revealing a blurry background of a farmhouse kitchen framing 
           Jessica's pensive face. She watches the rotten apple fall in.

           The lid shuts.

           Darkness.

           INT. PANTRY - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Darkness.

           A solid wood pantry door swings out revealing Jessica's 
           slight frame.

           She pulls a string and the light illuminates her face. 

           A quick scan of the space -- just large enough to walk in, 
           deeper than wide with rows of shelves on the side and back 
           wall. 

           We see some boxes, miscellaneous pantry items, dust, 
           mousetrap shoved in the back, a small pile of old bricks on 
           the floor that must have fallen out of the fireplace.

           A small CRUCIFIX high on the back wall stares down at the 
           small tomb-like room. Someone was religious enough to hang it 
           in a pantry. Odds are it wasn't Jessica.

           A red metal TOOL BOX sits near the door.

           Jessica slumps. 

           More stuff to deal with. Later.

           On a sparse shelf among a couple of tin cans missing labels 
           is one solitary container of baby formula. 

           She eyes it as if calculating how long it will last.

           Then she props the door open with one foot and grabs the 
           formula with the other, careful to not allow the door to shut 
           on her, a well-practiced move.
           Must be a reason for it.

           Light CLICKS OFF. 

           Door springs SHUT. 

           Darkness as WE STAY INSIDE THE PANTRY and hear:

           Her FOOTFALL on the squeaky hardwoods into the kitchen over 
           sounds of HEAVY METAL.

           A baby's CRY from somewhere beyond.

           The tricycle WHEELS by.

           MUTED VOICES.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Mommy, can I make the bottle?

                                 JESSICA (O.S.)
                        No, I got it, baby.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                            (screaming)
                        Pleeeease?!

                                 JESSICA (O.S.)
                        Stop it, Laine.

           FOOTSTEPS just outside. Rapid SWOOSH of a bottle being 
           shaken.

           The TRICYCLE follows.

           HEAVY STEPS up a staircase on the other side of the wall.

           Then...

           NOTHING.

           INT. STAIRCASE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Jessica bounds up the last few steps to an empty second floor 
           hall shaking a bottle, the baby's cry now a SHRILL SCREAM.

           Lainey scampers up behind.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY - LATER

           Crying has stopped. Just the LIGHT HUM OF MUSIC from 
           downstairs.
           Next to an empty wall, a pack-n-play used a crib. A few 
           blankets lay inside. A bottle, half-filled with milk.

           Near it, an air mattress in the corner under disheveled 
           blankets, pillows and a scuffed plastic doll. Lainey plops on 
           it causing her doll to fall to the floor.

           Somewhere else, Jessica can be heard talking on a phone.

                                 JESSICA (O.S.)
                        Yes, ma'am, I will. I'm gonna take 
                        off tonight so the kids can sleep 
                        most of the way.

           Lainey picks up her doll by the hair. Swings it on the bed. 
           She's not the most gentle mother.

           Jessica steps into sight balancing a 6-MONTH OLD BABY in one 
           arm, a fresh bottle in the other. A cell phone braced between 
           her shoulder and ear.

           She lays the baby down onto the mattress and grabs a diaper 
           bag from nearby. Her tone is overly accommodating.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                            (into the phone)
                        I'm mostly done. Just have to clean 
                        out the pantry, finish packing up 
                        the car. Everything else is clean. 
                        Yes, ma'am, I did. 

           Jessica gives the baby the bottle and pulls out a diaper and 
           wipes. She gets to work. Multi-tasking like moms tend to do.

           Lainey, watching, follows suit with her doll.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                            (into the phone)
                        I understand. Already looking at 
                        job postings so it won't be long 
                        before we can pay rent. We really 
                        appreciate the help. 

           As Jessica pulls pants up over the freshly changed diaper, 
           her face goes tight. 

           She stands up and defensively folds her arms across her 
           chest, then glances out the window -- slightly open at the 
           bottom.

                                 LAINEY
                        Mommy?
                                 JESSICA
                            (into the phone)
                        There's no chance of that 
                        happening.

                                 LAINEY
                        Mommy?

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm clean. Since rehab. I told you 
                        that.

                                 LAINEY
                        Mommy?!

                                 JESSICA
                            (to Lainey)
                        Hush! I'm on the phone to Auntie 
                        Claire.

           Lainey pulls at Jessica's t-shirt.

                                 LAINEY
                        Mommy, mommy!

                                 JESSICA
                            (into the phone)
                        You want me to take a test? 

                                 LAINEY
                        Mommy, please!

           Jessica looks down at her phone, confused. Lainey wriggles in 
           the background, like she's about to pee herself.

                                 JESSICA
                            (into the phone)
                        I just used my last minute. Yeah, 
                        I'll take a test -- if that's what 
                        you need.

           Jessica hangs up. The window bothers her. It's open three 
           inches at the bottom.

           She pulls it up and then slams it down. It catches and won't 
           close all the way. Proof she's weak. 

                                 LAINEY
                        Mom!!!!

                                 JESSICA
                        What do you need?
                                 LAINEY
                        I have to pee.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY - LATER

           WATER RUNS into a worn, white porcelain sink. Lainey's voice 
           is in the background, SINGING the alphabet song.

           Jessica splashes water over her face. A quick pat with a 
           towel and she looks back into the mirror.

           Off to the side, Lainey sits on the toilet SINGING happily.

                                 LAINEY
                        L-len-meno-pee...

           Eyes on her reflection, Jessica carefully runs her finger 
           over skin feeling for imperfections. It's clear.

                                 JESSICA
                            (enunciating)
                        L-M-N-O-P, Laine.

           Jessica looks down at her daughter.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Done?

                                 LAINEY
                        No.

           Jessica grabs a wad of toilet paper and sits on the edge of 
           the cast iron tub, waiting. Seems like an eternity.

                                 JESSICA
                        Can you hurry up? As fun as it is 
                        to wipe your butt, I've got other 
                        things to do.

           Lainey stops singing, hurt. Jessica regrets it.

           Searches for words that don't seem to come easily.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Keep practicing the ABCs. You 
                        almost got it perfect.

           Lainey smiles. Keeps SINGING.

           Jessica pokes at the ancient linoleum floor with her stained 
           Converse shoe. Seems wet. Peeling. 

           She leans down to see the plumbing running to the tub faucet.
           A leak -- water escaping slowly onto the floor boards.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                            (to herself)
                        Crap. It's still leaking? 
                            (anguished)
                        Fuuuuuuck!

                                 LAINEY
                        That's a bad word.

           Jessica sighs. She just can't win.

                                 JESSICA
                        I know. Sorry.

                                 LAINEY
                        Nana says it's the baddest word.

           Jessica is irritated. She looks up and catches Lainey's 
           judgmental scowl from the toilet.

                                 JESSICA
                        Nana's dead. 

           Lainey processes this with a blank stare. 

                                 LAINEY
                        I'm done.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY - LATER

           HEAVY METAL blares from a small, outdated boombox on the 
           counter next to a bowl of mostly eaten baby food.

           Jessica counts out cash in a neat stack. It's a very thin 
           stack. Disproportionate number of ones.

           The baby is in a highchair banging a toy on the tray. Lainey 
           sits at a small table chomping on a Pb&J on white.

           Jessica shoves the money into a blue denim purse.

                                 JESSICA
                        It'll be enough to get us there.

           Jessica grabs a sponge and scrubs down the counter.

                                 LAINEY
                        Mommy?

                                 JESSICA
                        What, baby?
                                 LAINEY
                        Daddy's dead like Nana.

           Jarred, Jessica stops scrubbing. Time to be a grown up. She 
           hates this.

           She TURNS DOWN THE MUSIC and crouches to Lainey's level.

                                 JESSICA
                        Daddy didn't die. He's sick.

                                 LAINEY
                        Nana said he's bad.

           Jessica considers how to respond.

                                 JESSICA
                        No, no he's not bad. He's sick.
                            (then)
                        Like mommy was. Mommy's not bad.

           Jessica searches for confirmation that she, in fact, isn't.

           Finds none.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        But I got better. Cause I love my 
                        little monkeys too much to stay 
                        sick.

           Jessica grabs at Lainey's tummy for a tickle. They giggle.

           The baby LAUGHS. 

                                 LAINEY
                        I'm not a monkey! I'm a girl!

                                 JESSICA
                        No, you're a laughing monkey from 
                        the Planet Monkopolis!

           More giggles as Jessica pulls Lainey in for a tight hug.

           And kisses the baby.

           In her eyes, doubt, fear. Not sure she can pull this off. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY - LATER

           Lainey rides her tricycle in a circle.

           Jessica balances a brown grocery bag on her knee while 
           struggling to open the front door. 
                                 LAINEY
                        What's that?

                                 JESSICA
                        The rest of our food. We'll eat it 
                        during the trip. Got fish crackers 
                        in there.

                                 LAINEY
                        I don't want to leave Nana's house.

                                 JESSICA
                        No jobs around here and I don't 
                        have money for taxes... or anything 
                        else.

                                 LAINEY
                        I can sell the apples for money!

           Jessica steps out the door.

                                 JESSICA
                        The apples are rotten, Laine. 

           EXT. FRONT PORCH/YARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                            (shouting)
                        No they're not! What's taxes!?

           Jessica pretends she didn't hear. Lugs the food to the car. 

           She places it on the passenger seat. 

           Shuts the door.

           A beat as she assesses the car that now contains nearly 
           everything she owns in the world.

           She presses the lock on the key chain. CLICK CLICK

           Locked up tight.

           INT. PANTRY - DAY - LATER

           MUSIC BLASTING, armed with an empty box and a trash bag, 
           Jessica pulls open the door. She grabs a brick from the pile 
           inside and shoves it in front of the door to hold it open.

           Jessica lugs the red toolbox out. 

           Her foot kicks the brick a few inches. She doesn't notice.
           That's unfortunate.

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Jessica sets the red toolbox on the top step. Belongs to 
           someone else. 

           Dumps the crate of Lainey's apples. Can't pack them.

           She looks at the apples on the dirt. A pang of guilt.

           INT. PANTRY - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           The brick holding the door has shifted. Close to the edge.

           Jessica's feet march by into the pantry. She shoves cans into 
           the trash bag.

           DOOR MOVES. Starts to overcome the weight of the brick.

           Jessica doesn't notice because she's contemplating the 
           crucifix on the back wall. Under it, a LARGE DUSTY BIBLE. She 
           throws it into the trash bag without a thought.

           But the crucifix. Take or trash? 

           Her fingers curiously trace over the image of the tortured 
           Christ when --

           -- THE PANTRY DOOR SLAMS SHUT.

           Jessica whips around.

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh shit.

           She POUNDS on the door where a handle should be, but is not.

           Now we see why she propped it open. It's old-fashioned one-
           sided hardware and can't open from the inside. 

           Jessica's trapped.

           She BEATS on the door.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Lainey! Lainey! Come here!

           The TRICYCLE SQUEAKING, gets LOUDER. Lainey is coming.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Where are my apples, mommy?
                                 JESSICA
                        Laine, listen to me, I need you to 
                        try and open the door. Just turn 
                        that latch real hard. It's rusted a 
                        little, so you have to use your 
                        muscles.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Did you throw them outside?

           Jessica sighs, impatient.

                                 JESSICA 
                        They're bad, Laine. Please open the 
                        door.

           Lainey CRIES softly from the other side.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        We can pick more, okay? Mommy needs 
                        your help. Can you help me?

           The door JIGGLES. Lainey's trying.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        It's hard to turn. Make sure it's 
                        going the right way.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Are my apples sick?

                                 JESSICA
                        Crap. No, they're not. Just bad. 
                        Not worth saving. 

           Jessica grabs a brick.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Okay, stand back.

           She POUNDS the door at the spot where the handle should be.

           Nothing.

           She pulls up her leg and KICKS. 

           Nothing.

           She THROWS HER BODY against it. 

           Nothing.

           It's a solid ass door. Don't make 'em like that anymore.
           Jessica spots the old brass hinges and runs her fingers over 
           the exposed screws covered in 50 years of sloppy paint jobs. 

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Lainey? You there?

           A tricycle SQUEAKS in reply.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Unlock the front door and go to the 
                        red box on the porch. Open it and 
                        bring me a long metal tool. One 
                        that has kind of an X on the end.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        A tool?

                                 JESSICA
                        Yes. Bring me what you can. The red 
                        box on the porch. Bring anything 
                        from inside it. Hurry up.

           The tricycle SQUEAKS away. The HEAVY METAL MUSIC still plays 
           in the kitchen, a manic soundtrack to her current state.

           LATER

           A large FLAT HEAD SCREWDRIVER appears under the pantry door.

           Jessica grabs it.

                                 JESSICA
                        That'll work! Good job! Try and get 
                        one just like this one but with an 
                        X, okay?

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Okay.

           Lainey SQUEAKS AWAY. 

           Jessica sets to work and positions the screwdriver in the old 
           screw head holding the hinges onto the frame.

           The screwdriver is too big and not the right fit. 

           She keeps at it, scraping and pushing into the old metal.

           LATER

           Jessica sits on the floor, catching her breath. She's got her 
           cell phone in her hand.
           On the screen, a Tracfone message states she's out of 
           minutes, but she can still make an emergency call to 911.

           She presses a 9. BEEP. Then stops.

           She leans her cheek against the door.

                                 JESSICA
                        Lainey? Did you find the tool?

           This time, the SOFT PADDING OF BARE FEET toddle to the door.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Someone's here.

                                 JESSICA
                        Who's here?

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Daddy. He took the red box.

           On Jessica's face a mixture of panic, hope, indecision.

           She looks back down at her phone. She could still call 911.

           She examines the flat head screwdriver and glances at the 
           stripped Phillips-head screws. It's a mangled mess.

                                 JESSICA
                        Is the door locked like I told you?

           The baby STARTS CRYING from upstairs. 

           Jessica winces.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Dammit.

           She stands up and tries at the hinges again. Useless.

           She KICKS the door in anger. 

           She doesn't want to do this.

           Lainey's voice is distant now, like she's shouting from the 
           living room.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Daddy's leaving!

           Jessica squeezes her eyes shut, like she's afraid of the 
           words coming out of her mouth. 
                                 JESSICA
                        Lainey, go outside and get him. 
                        Hurry! Run! 

           LATER

           The pantry door swings open and a young man, ROB TILLER, 22, 
           stands there grinning like he just won a ten dollar scratch-
           off.

                                 ROB
                        Got yourself locked in here again, 
                        Jess? Why am I not surprised?

           Dressed in jeans and a plaid button-down shirt, he would be 
           handsome if he gained 20 pounds and shaved two weeks of 
           patchy stubble poorly hiding red welts and pocks on his face.

           Jessica tries not to look shocked at his appearance. 

           It's been a while.

           She hands him the screwdriver.

                                 JESSICA
                        Thanks. This is yours.

           Just before she takes a step out, he --

           SLAMS THE DOOR SHUT ON HER.

           She YELLS.

           He opens it, laughing.

                                 ROB
                        Just kidding. Calm down.

           Jessica nearly knocks him over to get out of the pantry.

           Another man's LAUGHING catches her by surprise. She marches 
           into the --

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           And sets eyes on SAMMY, 45, who lurks close by, skeletal 
           under mottled skin and greasy hair. 

           Some druggies you feel sorry for. Others scare you to death 
           like they would slit their grandmother’s neck for a hit. 
           Sammy is the latter.
           Dingy hoodie over jeans two-sizes too big, any semblance of 
           humanity rotted away a long time ago leaving behind a man-
           shaped husk. Even the other meth-heads in town cross the 
           street when they see Sammy coming.

           And here he is. In Jessica’s house. With her kids.

           She's stunned at the sight. 

           He waves a hello, meanwhile assessing the place like he's 
           figuring out if his furniture will fit.

           She turns to Rob, horrified, but tries to be discreet.

                                 JESSICA
                        You're hanging out with Sammy?

                                 ROB
                            (accusingly)
                        I needed a place to stay.

                                 JESSICA
                        You could've stayed here if you 
                        passed a drug test. You know that.

           Rob's head hangs a bit. Avoids eye contact. Not gonna talk 
           about it. Again.

           An awkward beat.

           Jessica looks away, notices Lainey on her tricycle mere feet 
           from Sammy near the front door. 

                                 SAMMY
                            (to Lainey)
                        Hey small fry. You're so pretty. 
                        How old are you?

                                 LAINEY
                        I'm not a fry. I'm a girl.

           Jessica makes a beeline for them. 

           Puts her hands protectively around Lainey's shoulders. Pushes 
           her in the opposite direction.

                                 JESSICA
                        Lainey, go to the kitchen. Finish 
                        your sandwich.

           Lainey wheels past her parents to the kitchen. 

           Rob ruffles her hair and smiles as she goes by.
                                 ROB
                        Where's the little guy?

                                 JESSICA
                        He's taking a nap before we leave.
                            (then)
                        I don't want to wake him.

           An odd pause. She doesn't want him to see the baby. He can 
           tell. Changes the subject.

                                 ROB
                        So Texas, huh?

                                 JESSICA
                        Can't afford to stay here.

           A beat between them. There's double meaning to that. 

           Rob gets it. Suddenly seems irritated by everything. 

           Rubs the back of his head like something's crawling on it. 
           Something else is on his mind now.

                                 ROB
                        Your grandma didn't leave you 
                        anything? Like, money?

           He sounds like a starving man trying to act casual as he asks 
           what's for dinner.

                                 JESSICA
                        No. Just the house.

           Jessica's eyes dart to Sammy who has sauntered to the front 
           porch, door left open, and now pretends to tap dance on the 
           wood planks to the METALLICA SONG PLAYING FROM THE KITCHEN, 
           an unnatural shift in mood.

           She turns around to Rob, folds her arms.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        You're both high. You should go.

           Rob rubs his hands over his face hard. Puts his hand on his 
           hips and leans in like he just had a profound thought.

                                 ROB
                        No, I think this is good for us. 
                        Glad you asked me in. It's a chance 
                        to talk. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Talk about what?
                                 ROB
                        I figured out our problem, Jess. 
                        You think you're too good for me.

           A beat as Jessica considers it.

                                 JESSICA
                        No, I don't. I just got help. You 
                        can get help too. We have kids.

           He's studying her, seems thoughtful. Maybe finally listening 
           to reason? She leans in and lowers her voice. 

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        You brought Sammy here? You know 
                        what he did to that little girl.

                                 ROB
                        You're always paranoid about that 
                        stuff. It's called projection.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Oh yeah? What did I do, Jessica?

           Jessica jumps. 

           Sammy, having returned from the porch unnoticed, closes in on 
           her from behind, Rob at her front. He's irritated.

           She looks like a lamb between two hungry wolves.

                                 JESSICA
                        Nothing. I was just talking to Rob. 

           A tense beat. She moves toward the door, grabs the handle, a 
           subtle suggestion. Time for them to go.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I have a lot to do... so 
                        thanks for getting me out. I'll 
                        call you when I get there.

                                 SAMMY
                        Rob, I believe you just got dis-
                        missed.

           Rob scratches his beard, agitated, embarrassed. 

                                 ROB
                        I'm tired of getting dismissed by 
                        you. You know that? These are my 
                        kids too.
           He ambles over. Maybe to leave? Jessica's hand tightens 
           around the cell phone. 

           Without warning, he SLAPS JESSICA'S FACE.

           Her phone falls. 

           She's shocked. 

           This is new?

           She glances at her cell phone a few feet away on the floor, 
           her hand covering her cheek. 

           But she dare not move.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        You haven't changed. Still weak and 
                        needy. What would've happened if I 
                        hadn't let you out of that pantry? 
                        Out here in a boondocks, miles from 
                        the nearest neighbor?

                                 JESSICA
                        You're right. I'm sorry.

           A heavy beat as Jessica stays pinned to her spot.

           Sammy saunters up behind Rob, angling his mouth into his ear, 
           while Rob stares down his prey.

                                 SAMMY
                        She's lying. She's not sorry. You 
                        just saved her ass and she told you 
                        to leave.

           Rob nods enthusiastically, comically.

           Then, out of nowhere, his energy changes.

                                 ROB
                        Come on, let's go.

           Rob moves toward the door. He's leaving. Jessica exhales. 
           She's just dodged a bullet. 

           Her hand rests on the deadbolt, ready to turn it.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Just pretend I wasn't here, Jess.

           At the threshold, he stops. Turns around, struck with a 
           thought.
                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Tell you what, you don't have to 
                        pretend. I'll put things back to 
                        the way they were. Before I got 
                        here.

           Jessica processes the meaning and backs away.

                                 JESSICA
                        Rob, no. Don't. 

           But Rob is on her before she can break into a run.

           He lifts her off the ground, arms pinned to her side. 

           She fights like a wild cat, but she's no match.

                                 ROB
                            (between labored breaths)
                        This... is you... without me...

           He drags her across the living room, down the hall.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)

                        ...always saving... your sorry ass.

           He lugs her back inside the...

           INT. PANTRY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

                                 JESSICA
                        This isn't funny. Let me go! 
                        Please!

           The DOOR SLAMS SHUT.

           We stay inside with Jessica.

           It's dark except for the stream of light under the door and 
           around the sides.

           Jessica is barely visible, just a thin beam of light exposes 
           her eye and parts of her face, the rest of the space shadowy 
           and dark.

           Jessica's BREATHING, ragged and heavy.

           POUNDING on the door.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Rob! Let me out! What are you 
                        doing?
           Sammy's distant LAUGH.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Thought you were a pussy, but I 
                        stand corrected.

           The MUSIC still playing in the kitchen.

           The baby CRYING from upstairs, awakened from his nap.

           Lainey's tricycle SQUEAKING up to the door.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Mommy, are you in there?

                                 JESSICA
                        Baby, go upstairs in the bedroom 
                        and lock the door. It's the little 
                        button on the door. You turn it. 
                        You understand?

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Why are you in there?

                                 JESSICA
                        Just go now. Now!

           The tricycle SQUEAKS away.

           Little FOOTSTEPS on the stairs.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                            (to herself)
                        Good girl.

           A man's hurried FOOTFALL headed her way. 

           The sound of a METAL BOX HITTING THE FLOOR, metal items 
           jangling inside.

           The toolbox.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Rob? Please let me out. Please.

           SCRAPING and BANGING of wood on wood. 

           Then...

           HAMMERING.
           BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG.

           A thin crack of light around the door goes black, covered. 

                                 JESSICA
                        What are you doing?

           BANG.

           Jessica SCREAMS LIKE SHE'S BEEN STABBED. What the hell just 
           happened?!

           She FUMBLES for the chain of the overhead light.

           Pulls on it. 

           CHITCH-CHITCH.

           Light.

           Now we see everything clearly.

           Jessica peels her right hand from the door with a tortured 
           GROAN.

           It's bleeding from the palm after being IMPALED, a blood-
           covered nail left behind in the door.

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh my god, oh my god. Don't do 
                        this. You put a fucking nail 
                        through my hand you fucking 
                        asshole!

           She sobs. 

           Rob finally speaks, his voice close to the door.

                                 ROB (O.S.)
                        Here's the deal, Jess. You're gonna 
                        have lots of time in there to 
                        think.

           BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG.

                                 ROB (O.S.)
                        I'll come back...
           BANG. BANG. BANG.

                                 ROB (O.S.)
                        ...when you're back to your old 
                        self.

           BANG. BANG. BANG.

           Jessica pleads through tears.

                                 JESSICA
                        You're high. Not thinking straight. 
                        Don't do this. 

           BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG.

           Another nail misses a stud and punches through the door.

           She jumps back.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                            (to Rob)
                        Want me to grab your kids? We can 
                        bring them to my place.

           Jessica goes ballistic.

                                 JESSICA
                        Don't fucking touch my kids, you 
                        asshole! Rob, he's a child 
                        molester! 
                            (screaming to the ceiling)
                        Lainey, lock the door! Turn the 
                        button!

           In between nails being pounded into the door-frame --

           -- HEAVY FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. 

           Someone's going up. Sammy?

           The baby's faint CRY.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Rob, don't let him touch our kids! 
                        Please! Leave them!

           The hammering STOPS.

           Jessica listens carefully. What's happening?
           A tiny plastic bag filled with small white powder slides 
           under the door stopping at her shoe.

           Jessica stares at it.

                                 ROB (O.S.)
                        Be careful with this. It's 
                        pharmaceutical grade. 

           FOOTSTEPS to the kitchen. 

           THE MUSIC STOPS.

           FOOTSTEPS down the stairs. 

           Just one set? 

           She listens hard.

                                 JESSICA
                        Rob? Don't take the kids. Please. 
                        Lainey, are you there? Mommy loves 
                        you. Lainey?

           The JINGLE OF KEYS. 

           Hers?

           MUFFLED VOICES. 

           Can't hear what they're saying.

           The front door SLAMS SHUT in the distance.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                            (screaming)
                        Rooooob?!!!

           The faint sound of an ENGINE IGNITING OUTSIDE. Then...

           NOTHING.

           Not a sound.

           An empty house?

           Her children are gone?

           The reality of the situation hits Jessica like a punch to the 
           gut. 

           She doubles over from the impact.
           Then slides down the wall of the pantry onto the floor in 
           anguish, her injured hand cradled in the other.

           And sobs.

           LATER

           Jessica's DEEP MEASURED BREATHS are the only sound.

           Her injured right hand, loosely bandaged with a torn piece of 
           table linen, moves shakily across the battered linoleum floor 
           and delicately...

           ...picks up the small bag of meth.

           She holds it up to her puffy, tear-stained face, examining it 
           in the light.

           Dark thoughts, desires.

           But she's stronger. At least, now she is.

           She tosses the bag on a shelf, behind some cans of food in 
           the corner. 

           Under the crucifix. 

           Out of sight.

           A moment passes. 

           Then...

           SOUND.

           Jessica hears it. She presses her ear to the wall.

           SMALL FOOTSTEPS padding down the stairs.

                                 JESSICA
                        Lainey?

           Jessica scrambles to her feet. Directs her voice to stairs.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Lainey! Is that you? Are you here?

           Silence.

           Then...

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Mommy? Why are you in there?
           Jessica chokes back tears of relief.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm stuck. Again.
                            (then)
                        Where's Mason? Is he okay?

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        He's sleeping. I turned the button 
                        on the door and I sanged him the 
                        alphabets until he falled asleep.

                                 JESSICA
                        You did a good job.

           A moment of reflection. She's been given a second chance. 
           What to do now? 

           She wipes her face. Sniffs.

           Glances at her injured right hand and stretches her fingers. 
           She winces, but it's usable.

           She mentally compiles a to-do list, energy returning.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Lainey, I need you to listen to me 
                        very carefully.

           She rearranges the order of her list in her mind. Exhales 
           loudly. What's the most important thing?

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Go lock the front door. You already 
                        know how to unlock it. Just turn 
                        that metal thing the other way.

           Jessica hears Lainey SCAMPER AWAY. 

           She takes a moment to inspect the door.

           A few nails protrude. Much of the light around the sides have 
           been blocked out with wood.

           She assesses the contents of the pantry again. Same useless 
           jars of old food, boxes of knickknacks. Pile of bricks. Her 
           plastic garbage bag, half-filled.

           SMALL FOOTSTEPS return.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                            (catching her breath)
                        I turned the lock.
                                 JESSICA
                        You're a smart girl, Laine.
                            (then)
                        Okay, what did daddy do to the 
                        door? Can you tell me what you see?

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Daddy messed it up. It's broken.

                                 JESSICA
                        I know, but what did he nail over 
                        it?

           A beat.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        All Nana's wood.

                                 JESSICA
                        The two-by-fours? Crap.
                            (then)
                        Okay, Laine, listen. Go get my 
                        purse -- no, not my purse. My cell 
                        phone is on the floor in the living 
                        room. Go get it and bring it here.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Mommy, why are you in there again? 
                        Please come out!

                                 JESSICA
                        I need to call 9-1-1. Just go get 
                        the phone.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        What's 9-1-1?

                                 JESSICA
                        Get the phone!
                            (then, calmly)
                        Please.

           Silence.

           Lainey's SOFT FOOTSTEPS down the hall.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Jessica's cheek is against the door.

                                 JESSICA
                        Are you sure you looked everywhere? 
                        It was on the floor.
                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        I can't find it.

                                 JESSICA
                        And my purse is gone? Are you sure? 
                            (to herself)
                        Rob, you bastard! You fucking took 
                        it. Dammit.

           SOFT CRYING. Lainey's losing it.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Mommy, come out. I have to pee. You 
                        need to come with me.

           The baby CRIES, awake again. 

           Jessica stares hard at the plastered ceiling, compelled to 
           punch through it.

           She tries to sound composed. 

           She fails.

                                 JESSICA
                        Lainey, listen to me. It's time for 
                        Mason's bottle -- there's one in 
                        the fridge. And he needs his diaper 
                        changed. Mommy can't help him --

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        I have to pee!

                                 JESSICA
                        Then go pee! I. Can't. Go. With. 
                        You. I'm stuck in the fucking 
                        pantry!

           Lainey CRIES LOUDLY.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        I miss Nana! I want Nana!

           Jessica rubs her eyes, ashamed, pained, confused. 

           The baby's CRY chimes in, a scream this time. 

           Jessica pulls herself together, crouches down, presses her 
           cheek against the door.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry. Mommy 
                        wasn't nice.
           Lainey stops crying. SNIFFS.

           Encouraged, Jessica keeps at her speech.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        I miss Nana, too. But we have to 
                        take care of each other now. Okay?

           Silence. 

           Then...

           WATER DRIPPING

           Startled by something, Jessica looks down. 

           A pool of urine slowly flows from under the door.

           Lainey CRIES again loudly.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Sorry, mommy. Please don't get mad.

           Jessica leans her forehead against the door.

           Squeezes her eyes shut. A temporary escape.

           LATER

           The hanging light in the pantry swings casting eerie shadows.

           A bandaged hand stops it.

           Jessica is balanced on a box investigating the top shelf. 
           It's littered with a few dead bugs and more jars filled with 
           homemade concoctions.

           She examines one. 

           A label written in neat cursive reads "Apple Butter."

           She runs her finger over the writing as if invoking the 
           spirit of the woman who last touched it. Nana.

           LITTLE FOOTSTEPS outside.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Mason pooped.

                                 JESSICA
                            (to herself)
                        Oh crap. He waited until now?
           Jessica crawls down from the box.

           Leans against the door.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Lainey, you remember how mommy does 
                        it. Get some wipes from the diaper 
                        bag. Use those to clean him. Then 
                        throw them away with the diaper and 
                        wash your hands. Got it?

           Little feet already bound up the stairs.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        I know what to do!

           The look on Jessica's face says she doubts that.

                                 JESSICA
                        He's not a doll. He's heavy.

           Nothing. She's gone.

           Jessica goes back to the jar of apple butter. 

           She unscrews the top, then jams a fingernail under the 
           suctioned lid. 

           A POP, and it releases.

           It's this lid she's interested in. 

           She bends it in half.

           And digs at the wall with her uninjured left hand.

           LATER

           The bent lid falls to the floor with a light metallic clank. 

           We trace it's path up the door: lots of scratches, a few 
           minor dents, but it's no match for the 100-year-old wood. 

           Jessica stands staring at the door disappointed.

           She's distracted by a voice at the door.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Mommy, I'm hungry. 

           Her eyes go to the opened jar of apple butter on the shelf.
           LATER

           A paper plate passes under the door. It's already stained 
           with spicy, brown apple butter.

           Jessica dumps a nice helping onto it from the half-empty jar 
           and sends it back.

           She licks a heap off of her finger. She nearly moans in 
           ecstasy -- it's that good.

                                 JESSICA
                        There's a plastic spoon in the 
                        diaper bag. Use it to feed the 
                        baby. Make sure to sit him up. 
                        Okay?

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Mommy, I'm still hungry. And I'm 
                        thirsty.

                                 JESSICA
                        You can drink water from the sink. 
                        Use the cup there.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        I don't like water. I want juice.

           A beat. Is she kidding?

                                 JESSICA
                        I packed up all our food and juice 
                        boxes in the car. We need the keys. 
                        And the keys are in my purse. 

           Then, like an afterthought.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        You shouldn't be drinking juice all 
                        the time anyway. It's bad for you.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        I'm thirsty for juice!

                                 JESSICA
                        Drink water!

           Beat.

           Little FOOTSTEPS up the stairs. 

           Jessica stands up and directs her voice to the wall.
                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Don't let him choke! Sit him up! 
                        You hear me?!

           INT. PANTRY - NIGHT

           Jessica lies on her side, fetal position, facing the small 
           crack under the door. The only strong light comes from the 
           hanging bulb above. 

           Must be dusk outside.

           From her viewpoint under the door, a SLIVER OF LAINEY'S FACE 
           stares back. She's lying the same way on the other side, 
           face-to-face.

                                 JESSICA
                        It's time for bed, Laine.

           Her little eyes widen, panicked.

                                 LAINEY
                        No, no! Please come out! I'm 
                        scared.

           Jessica reaches her left hand under the door and finds 
           Lainey's. She squeezes it.

                                 JESSICA
                        I can't get out. You know that. Or 
                        else I'd tuck you in.

                                 LAINEY
                        You can get out. You just need to 
                        try harder.

           Something about these words poke at Jessica.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm trying my best.

                                 LAINEY
                        A monster's gonna grab me. 

                                 JESSICA
                        There's no monsters, Laine.

                                 LAINEY
                        He's in the dark.

                                 JESSICA
                        Then keep the lights on, baby. 
                        Okay? It's alright for tonight.
                                 LAINEY
                        I don't wanna go.

                                 JESSICA
                        Mason needs you. He's all alone. 

                                 LAINEY
                        I want to stay here with you.

                                 JESSICA
                        It's cold down here. Heat's on 
                        upstairs. Shove a towel in the 
                        window, where it won't close. And 
                        put on socks.

           Lainey teeth nearly chatter from cold as she speaks.

                                 LAINEY
                        I'm not cold.

                                 JESSICA
                        It's just one night. I'll be out 
                        tomorrow. Daddy will come back. 
                        Okay?

           Silence. Lainey's not buying it.

                                 LAINEY
                        Daddy's bad. 

           Jessica doesn't have a reply this time.

                                 JESSICA
                        Go on, baby. Get to bed. 

           INT. PANTRY - DAY - SECOND DAY INSIDE

           A row of three emptied jars of apple butter sit on the shelf. 

           Silence.

           The suctioned POP of a jar lid releasing. 

           A full jar, just opened, placed next to them. 

           Jessica stands at the door, staring at the space under it, 
           waiting. The lack of sleep shows on her face and her slumped 
           shoulders.

           A stained paper plate slides under the door. Jessica grabs it 
           and dumps the thick, brown, spice-studded apple mixture onto 
           the plate. 
           Breakfast.

           Slides it back under. 

           The SOFT THUMP of little feet scampering away and up the 
           stairs. 

           Jessica follows the sound with her eyes on the wall. She 
           knocks her fist on the plaster.

                                 JESSICA
                        Sit him up, Laine! Be careful!

           Mistake. She winces in pain at her wounded right hand.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Dammit.

           Time to assess.

           In the morning light streaming through the cracks and holes 
           around the door, she unwraps the homemade bandage, caked with 
           dried blood.

           The wound is puffy and red. She runs a finger lightly over 
           her palm. Tender.

           Infection?

           She wraps it up again.

           Jessica turns around to her night project, a careful and 
           thorough inventory of the contents in the pantry, the 
           important items laid out like a surgeon's tools on the 
           shelves.

           - Candles.

           - Matches.

           - Small sparse pile of knitting yarn.

           - Collection of gaudy salt and pepper shakers from different 
           states.

           - Stack of Knitting USA Magazines.

           - Tangle of plastic Catholic rosaries.

           - Very old, dingy bottle of Amaretto liquor.

           - The old cans of food from the trash bag. Most of the labels 
           fallen off.
           - The dusty over-sized Bible she trashed the day before.

           - The bag of meth laid out next to the Bible.

           She eyes it for a brief moment as if asking herself why the 
           hell she put it there. 

           She knows why.

           Her eyes glance up at the crucifix still hanging on the wall. 
           She quickly looks away.

           She yells.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Lainey, when the baby falls asleep, 
                        I need your help! 

           LATER

           A small branch from a tree slides under the door. Jessica 
           plucks it up, irritated.

                                 JESSICA
                        No, Laine, that won't work. I need 
                        something metal. A tool. So I can 
                        chip away at the wood.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        It's a strong stick. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Keep looking.

           LATER - MONTAGE

           - A pebble slides under the door.

           - A toy car zooms under. 

           - A plastic fork.

           - A green crayon.

           Jessica picks up the crayon and throws it at the door. Her 
           voice is low and impatient.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Mommy cannot break through a wall 
                        with a green crayon, Laine. You 
                        know that. Find something hard! 
                        Something metal! I told you 
                        already!
           Lainey CRIES LOUDLY, fear in her voice.

           Jessica cries, too. She's a sucky mother.

           They cry together, their sobbing becoming one child-like 
           chorus of hopelessness.

           Somewhere in the distance, the baby has awakened.

           And CRIES too.

           There's no parent here. Just three kids alone.

           Lainey whimpers out some words.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        I miss Nana. She took care of us. 

           It's a do-or-die moment for Jessica. Time to put on her big-
           girl pants. 

           She wipes her eyes, takes a deep breath.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm sorry, Laine. I'm sorry for 
                        yelling at you. You're doing the 
                        best job. You are.

           Silence. Apology not accepted.

           A beat. Jessica looks miserable. She needs to say more.

           And this will hurt.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        I'm a bad mom. Okay? I didn't know 
                        how to do it... I never learned. 
                        And you don't know this, but I'm 
                        real young, Laine. Too young. And 
                        then I left you alone for a long 
                        time when I... got sick. I messed 
                        up. Real bad. But I'm trying. 
                        Please don't hate me, Laine. I'll 
                        do better. 
                            (then)
                        I promise. Just gotta get out of 
                        here and we'll figure it out. 
                        Together.

           She sniffs at the tears running down her face.

           A beat. No response to her big confession.

           Where did Lainey go?
           Jessica presses her ear to the door and listens.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Lainey? You there? Lainey?

           Front door SLAMS SHUT in the distance.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Who's there? Lainey, answer me!

           The SQUEAK of the tricycle across the floor. 

           Getting LOUDER.

           The sound of something hard SLIDING across the floor.

           It appears from under the door.

           THE SCREWDRIVER!

           Jessica stares dumbfounded.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                            (catching her breath)
                        I found it under the leaves. It's 
                        daddy's tool. He losted it.

           Jessica picks up the beefy, oversized, flat-head screwdriver 
           with reverence. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Good job, baby! You did it! Exactly 
                        what I needed. 

           You can practically feel Lainey beaming with pride from the 
           other side of the door.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        I did it!

           Jessica wipes away tears with her shirt, a smile breaking on 
           her face.

                                 JESSICA
                        You're a good girl, baby. I love 
                        you.

           No answer. The tricycle SQUEAKS. 

           Little FOOTSTEPS.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        I'll go take care of Mason!
           Jessica grabs the screwdriver tightly in her left hand, ready 
           to get to work. 

           Yells up at the ceiling towards the kids.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm gonna get out of here! Sit 
                        tight!

           She chooses a spot on the wall and stabs at it.

           LATER

           TAP, TAP, TAP.

           A screwdriver hitting wood.

           The pantry wall is a series of shallow holes.

           Plaster piled on the floor, wood lath behind, some of it 
           chipped away.

           Hard stuff. Not easy.

           The door's been attacked, too. Holes and gouges around the 
           hinges. Not much progress. Besides, there's 20 or so nails 
           holding that door back now.

           Jessica crouches over the floor concentrating on a spot near 
           her feet, the linoleum gone, thick wood planks underneath.

           She's made a small hole. There's crawlspace below. 

           Progress. 

           This could work.

           She grabs a brick from nearby and uses it to pound the 
           screwdriver deeper.

           The screwdriver gets embedded. 

           She can't get it out. She's weak, worn out. Needs a break. 

           Sits back against the wall. 

           Listens for her children.

                                 JESSICA
                        Laine, ya there? I'm almost done. 
                        Maybe a few more hours. I can crawl 
                        out under the house.
           A distant THUMP.

           Jessica sits up straighter.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        What's going on up there?

           A high pitched SCREAM from the baby.

           Jessica stands up. 

           Listens hard.

           QUICK STEPS down the stairs. 

           Laine is back.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Lainey? What happened? 

           SOFT SOBS.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        I dropped the baby. 

           Jessica covers her mouth with her hand.

           Tries to remain calm.

                                 JESSICA
                        Is he okay? Oh god.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        He was trying to crawl down the 
                        stairs.

                                 JESSICA
                        It's okay, it's okay.

           LOUD UGLY CRYING from Lainey.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Mommy, I'm sorry!

           Jessica wants to yell. 

           She doesn't.

                                 JESSICA
                        Lainey, listen, you need to go pick 
                        him up and hold him until he stops 
                        crying. He's alone and scared right 
                        now.
                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        He wants milk but it's all gone.

           Jessica rubs her eyes. 

           Thinks.

                                 JESSICA
                        You need to make him a bottle. You 
                        remember how mommy does it? Three 
                        scoops of formula -- the powder in 
                        the can -- and fill it with water. 
                        Put the nipple on tight and shake 
                        it.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Okay.

                                 JESSICA
                        You can do it. 

           Little STEPS up the stairs. 

           Jessica grabs the screwdriver and --

           -- VIOLENTLY STABS at the tiny hole like she's attacking 
           every bad decision she ever made.

           LATER

           A small ROACH scurries across the pantry shelf up over the 
           screwdriver. 

           A rolled up copy of Knitting World WHACKS it. 

           Dead.

           Jessica tosses the magazine to the floor, wipes her brow, and 
           grabs the tool. 

           She stares at the hole approvingly, now big enough to squeeze 
           a leg through. 

           Her lips are noticeably parched, and she keeps her right hand 
           close to her body. 

           It's painful.

                                 JESSICA
                        Lainey, I'm almost there. I can do 
                        this. It's gonna be fine.

           No answer.
                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Laine?

           The SQUEAK of the tricycle coming closer.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Mommy, someone's here.

           Jessica stares a hole through the door, frozen, her face 
           vacillating between panic and hope.

                                 JESSICA
                        Who is it? Is it daddy?

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        It's that man. He called me a fry. 

           Panic wins. 

           Jessica leans into the door.

                                 JESSICA
                        Please tell me you locked the door.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        He's coming in. 

           From a distance, Jessica can make out the sound of the FRONT 
           DOOR SQUEAKING OPEN slowly. 

           Then --

           -- BOOTS ON THE HARDWOODS.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Hello? Anyone home? 
                            (then)
                        Little girl?

           Jessica whispers through the door.

                                 JESSICA
                        Lainey, run upstairs and lock the 
                        bedroom door.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Maybe the man can get you out.

                                 JESSICA
                        He's bad, Laine. Run!

           Laine seems to understand quickly. 

           Light FOOTSTEPS scamper up the stairs.
           Jessica presses her ear to the door listening for Sammy's 
           movements. 

           There's none. 

           Where is he?

           Jessica breathes heavily.

           She tries to slow it down.

           Nearly holds her breath. Maybe he'll leave.

           And then...

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Jessica?

           Sammy's voice jumps through the door. 

           He's right there.

           Jessica flinches.

                                 JESSICA
                        Where's Rob? Is he with you?

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Rob's busy so I thought I'd come 
                        over and babysit for you.

           A beat as Jessica decides if she should use threats or 
           reason.

                                 JESSICA
                        I don't need a babysitter. We're 
                        fine.
                            (then)
                        Please leave my house.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        You sure like to dismiss people, 
                        don't ya?

           An anxious beat. What can she do?

                                 SAMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Your daughter is very pretty. She 
                        upstairs? Thought I saw her go up 
                        there.

           Jessica clenches the screwdriver tighter. 

           She's panicking. Time to use threats.
                                 JESSICA
                        Rob will be pretty pissed if you 
                        mess with his kids. Stay the fuck 
                        away from them.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Rob owes me money. I'm here to 
                        collect payment. He'll understand.

           Floor CREAKS. 

           FOOTSTEPS.

           He's headed for the stairs.

                                 JESSICA
                        No! Stop! Wait! 

           BOOTS UP THE STAIRS. 

           STEP.

           STEP.

           STEP.

           The old wood GROANS under his weight.

           Jessica frantically searches the small pantry for something 
           to spark an idea. 

           She finds it next to the dusty Bible.

           The bag of drugs.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        I have Rob's meth here! It's yours! 
                        I haven't used it. Please! 

           The FOOTSTEPS FALL SILENT. 

           He's listening.

           She aims her words at the spot she last heard him.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Got probably three grams down here! 
                        Come on, don't let it go to waste. 
                        Rob will just take it back. 

           Sammy's footfall REVERSES. 

           He's coming down the steps.
           Jessica listens intently.

           STEP.

           STEP.

           STEP.

           His voice appears outside the door.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        He gave you three grams and he owes 
                        me money?

           It worked. 

           She moves closer to the door. Tries to sound amiable.

                                 JESSICA
                        Yeah. It's yours if you want it.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Send it over then.

           Beat.

                                 JESSICA
                        Let me out and it's yours.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        No can do. I don't get involved in 
                        domestic disputes. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Call the police. Or let me use your 
                        phone. Please.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Not calling the police. Not getting 
                        you out.

           Beat.

                                 JESSICA
                        If I give the meth to you, will you 
                        leave us alone? You have to leave 
                        the house. You can't come back.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Of course I will. I'll go. You have 
                        my word.

           He's lying. Jessica knows it. He knows it. We know it.
           But she has no choice.

           She reaches for the bag of meth with her injured right hand, 
           but pulls back, wincing.

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh shit. Ouch.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        What's taking so long? You busy 
                        organizing cans of soup? 

           He LAUGHS at his dumb joke.

           Jessica unwraps the bandage. 

           The mark in her palm is worse. 

           She glances up at the crucifix, just now making the 
           connection. 

           Both impaled in the hand.

           A glance at the screwdriver.

           A beat.

                                 JESSICA
                        Sorry, I just, I'm injured. I'm too 
                        weak to get close enough.
                            (then)
                        Reach under the door and I'll drop 
                        it in your hand.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Huh? You sound fine. Just slide it 
                        under. 

                                 JESSICA
                        I can't reach that far! I told you 
                        I'm stuck over here at the other 
                        end. I can't move much.

           Silence. He's thinking about it.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Rob says it's good stuff. You tried 
                        it yet?

           Silence.

           It's too much silence.
                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        If you can't decide, I'm gonna dump 
                        it out.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Wait! Hold on.

           A RUSTLE and THUMP. 

           He's getting on the floor.

           Jessica steadies her breathing. Hand tight around the 
           screwdriver.

           She crouches down near the door.

           A GRIMY MALE HAND appears, palm up, outstretched.

           An ever-so-slight tremor in the skeletal fingers crowned with 
           dirty fingernails.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Where is it? Can you reach me?

           Jessica is paralyzed with self-doubt. 

           Her voice is small.

                                 JESSICA
                        Almost. Can you stretch a little 
                        more?

           The hand inches farther inside under the door.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        I can just reach you. 
                            (then)
                        Here it comes.

           She shuts her eyes for a beat, a silent prayer. The 
           screwdriver raises in the air. Primal fury on Jessica's face 
           as her eyes spring open wide. 

           The long, metal tool plunges into Sammy's hand.

           He SCREAMS!

           The hand jerks back but Jessica's foot SLAMS DOWN on it. 
           She's all-in now.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Get it out! Get it out!
           As he writhes in agony, blood pooling in his palm and 
           spilling over, Jessica grabs a brick and --

           -- POUNDS THE SCREWDRIVER DEEPER into his hand and deeper 
           into the wood floor beneath it.

           Sammy's unable to pull his hand out, pinned.

           His GROANS and SCREAMS fill the air, maybe for miles.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You bitch! What did you do?

           She keeps pounding. With each hit, a new, louder scream.

           BANG

           AAAH!

           BANG

           AAAH!

           BANG

           AAAH!

           The screwdriver is buried into the floor. She raises the 
           brick above her head, one last adrenaline-fueled blow.

           She pounds it down so hard the brick BREAKS IN TWO.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god I'm going to kill you 
                        bitch you whore! 

           Jessica sits back against the wall, spent, and cradles her 
           injured hand.

           It's bleeding through the bandage now.

           The sound of her BREATHING.

           Sammy's BREATHING in between agonized GROANS. 

           They sit in silence.

           He MOANS.

           And then...
                                 SAMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I'm sorry. Please take it out. I 
                        won't hurt you or your kids. I'll 
                        leave. I'm not lying. Please.

           Jessica watches his hand, the fingers splayed out, blood 
           seeping. It's disturbing. 

           But necessary.

           Beat.

                                 JESSICA
                        You'll get out when I get out.

           She jumps as he SCREAMS out the next words.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        I'm gonna gut your kids while you 
                        watch you stupid bitch! TAKE IT OUT 
                        NOW!

           She scoots away from his hand, her eyes never leaving it.

           Urgency in her eyes. Need to escape. Now.

           Close by, her hole. 

           She was making progress.

           She examines it.

           Her eyes shoot to the screwdriver, embedded in The Hand.

           Useless now.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I'll kill you all.

           LATER

           The bottle of amaretto. 

           The screw top lid placed carefully beside it on the shelf, 
           next to the matches.

           Jessica takes a swig.

           She doesn't like it. Examines the label. What is this stuff?

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Whatcha doin' in there, Jessica? 
                        Smells like liquor.
                                 (MORE)
                                 SAMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You gettin' liquored up you bitch 
                        whore? TAKE IT OUT!

           She ignores his HEAVY PANTING and MOANS. Screws the top back 
           on. 

           An apple butter jar lid next to it. 

           She picks it up. 

           Eyes the hole in the floor. 

           Jessica squats over the hole, a few inches from The Hand, and 
           scrapes at the wood with her left hand, the right too painful 
           to use. 

           A few splinters fall away. Better than nothing.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Jessica.

           She ignores him.

           The DISTANT CREAK of the front door swinging in the wind.

           Left open. 

                                 SAMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                         It's fuckin' freezin' out here.

           Jessica stops working. 

           She rubs her arms as if finally noticing. Yeah, it's cold.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Ice storm coming -- early freeze. 
                        It's on the news. Let me go, 
                        please. I get cold real easy.

           She looks up to the ceiling to the place where her children 
           are. A new worry.

                                 JESSICA
                        You left my front door open. I hope 
                        you freeze to death.

           Sammy CACKLES out a HOARSE LAUGH.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        You hope I freeze to death? People 
                        who use the word hope are usually 
                        fucking desperate or weak as shit.
                                 JESSICA
                        Shut up. 

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Rob said you went through rehab. 
                        Did they teach you to hope there -- 
                        after they took all your money?

           Sammy CHUCKLES. 

           Then COUGHS.

           Then MOANS in pain.

           Jessica scrapes at the wood.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I went to rehab. 

           Jessica stops scraping. 

           Looks at The Hand.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I was clean for three hundred and 
                        five days. Took some college 
                        classes. Got a good job. Filed my 
                        tax returns.

           There is nothing more interesting to her than what Sammy is 
           saying right now.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Then my mom died and there were 
                        medical bills and I realized no one 
                        in the whole fucking world cared 
                        two shits about me. 

           Jessica almost looks sympathetic.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        That's what they don't tell you in 
                        rehab. You sober up only to go back 
                        to the miserable fucking life you 
                        used drugs to escape from in the 
                        first fucking place. 
                            (then)
                        You still got the three grams in 
                        there?

                                 JESSICA
                        Yes.
                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        You won't last much longer. I can 
                        smell the weakness from here. 
                            (then)
                        You don't wanna be here -- just 
                        like the rest of us don't.

           Jessica punches at the hole again, suddenly furious.

                                 JESSICA
                        I don't molest little girls, 
                            (screaming)
                        You sick fuck! I hate you and 
                        everyone like you!

           She slams into the wood in a fury.  

           This seems personal.

           Sammy has picked up on it. 

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        How many people you know like me? 

           She stops hacking at the wood. 

           No, not going there.

                                 JESSICA
                        Stop talking to me.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Did someone touch you when you were 
                        little, Jessica?

           Jessica freezes. Bingo. 

                                 SAMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Did you like it?

                                 JESSICA
                        Fuck you. Stop talking to me. 

           She digs at the hole.

           LATER

           Jessica pulls the black garbage bag around her like a shawl, 
           her teeth chattering.

           The WIND HOWLS outside the door.

           She squats down over the hole again, jar lid for her tool. 
           A quick glance at The Hand. It's violently shaking from the 
           cold or withdrawals. Or both.

           She HACKS at the wood.

           CHIP.

           CHIP.

           CHIP.

           The LIGHT FLICKERS.

           She stops. 

           Listens.

           It's nothing.

           CHIP.

           CHIP.

           CHIP.

           Hail or rain BEAT AT THE HOUSE. It's a big storm.

           CHIP.

           CHIP.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Gonna scratch through the wood? 
                        Like a mouse or something?

           Jessica glances at his hand. 

           Keeps chipping away.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm getting out. 

           CHIP.

           CHIP.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        I wasn't gonna hurt your kid.

                                 JESSICA
                        Yeah. Right.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        I like kids. I'm not a bad guy.
                                 JESSICA
                        You're a fuckin' monster.

           And then...

           BOOM! Lightning strikes somewhere close.

           CHIP.

           LIGHTS GO OUT.

           Darkness.

           WE ARE IN THE DARK WITH JESSICA.

           Jessica's BREATHING. 

           The sound of the chain for the light being pulled over and 
           over.

           CLICK-CLICK.

           CLICK-CLICK.

           Nothing.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Power's out, you dumb bitch.

                                 JESSICA
                            (to herself)
                        No, no. 

           Small FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. 

           Little CREAKS.

           Lainey.

           A GASP as Jessica realizes.  

           The sound of her moving closer to the wall, RUSTLE of the 
           trash bag around her.

           STEP.

           STEP.

           STEP.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                            (to herself)
                        Lainey, no. 
           STEP.

           STEP.

           Jessica yells.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Lainey, stay upstairs! Don't come 
                        down!

           STEP.

           Lainey's small voice, muffled.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Mommy? The lights are broken. I'm 
                        scared. Where are you, mommy?

           We hear Jessica POUND on the wall.

                                 JESSICA
                        Go back! Go upstairs, Laine! 

           Quiet. 

           Jessica's quick BREATHS. She's listening to hear something 
           but hoping she doesn't.

           Beat.

           And then...

           Lainey's VOICE...

           RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Mommy? Are you in there?

                                 JESSICA
                        Lainey, run! 

           A THUMP and RUSTLE outside the door.

           Lainey SCREAMS.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Got you, girlie!

                                 JESSICA
                        Let her go!

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Mommy, help me! Help!
           BANGING on the door. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Don't hurt her!

           Lainey's CRYING.

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        He got me! Mommy!

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Pull it out, you bitch! Pull the 
                        thing out of my hand right now! I 
                        got your little girl right here and 
                        I ain't lettin' go.

           Jessica screams back her answer.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'll pull it out! Don't hurt her!

           We are still in darkness as Jessica moves around doing 
           something. 

           A SCUFFLE across the floor.

           Dark shadows against darkness.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Hurry up!

                                 JESSICA
                        Hold on. I need to find a way to 
                        get it out. 

           The CLINK OF GLASS. 

           More SHUFFLING.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        Pull it fast. If you do it slowly, 
                        I'll squeeze her neck.

                                 JESSICA
                        Okay, okay. Hold on. I can't see.

           SPLASH. Something wet hitting the floor.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        What's that? What are you doing?

           The STRIKE of a match.

           ONCE.
           TWICE.

           The SIZZLE of a match lighting.

           NOW WE CAN SEE...

           Jessica squatting over The Hand, the bottle of amaretto next 
           to her.

           Empty, on its side.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I'm gonna snap her neck if you mess 
                        around with me!

           Jessica holds the flame above his hand. 

           She drops it.

           His sleeve IGNITES in a flambé.

                                 SAMMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        AAAHHHH!!!! Put it out!

                                 LAINEY (O.S.)
                        Mommy! Help!

           Jessica POUNDS on the door.

                                 JESSICA
                        Run, Lainey! Get away from him! Go!

           The flames are strong and --

           -- creep up the door, making eerie shadows on the wall, the 
           light warm and orange, like a campfire.

           Jessica panics as the tiny space fills with smoke. 

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Lainey? Are you there?

           Sammy MOANS and CURSES.

           And then...

           She hears them.

           LITTLE STEPS up the stairs.

           Jessica puts her ear to the wall.

           A TINY CREAK under Lainey's weight.
           Yes, they're footsteps.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Good girl.

           She turns back to the fire. It grows quickly, lapping up the 
           wall and door. The small PILE OF YARN catches on fire.

           It threatens to overtake the pantry.

           Jessica grabs the garbage bag and attacks the flames, 
           coughing, the smoke thick.

           Sammy is eerily quiet now. Screaming's stopped.

           Jessica BEATS on the flames.

           The flames recede.

           COUGH.

           WHACK. WHACK.

           COUGH.

           And then...

           Darkness.

           INT. PANTRY - NIGHT - LATER

           Darkness.

           Quiet.

           Jessica COUGHS in the black void.

           Match STRIKES. 

           ONCE.

           TWICE.

           The SIZZLE of the match igniting. 

           Jessica's face appears, gaunt, shadowy, grimy, ash on her 
           cheek. 

           The small flame moves to a religious candle, the Virgin Mary 
           on the peeling plastic sticker over tall glass. 

           The wick catches fire.
           In the flickering light of the candle, the pantry is in 
           disarray, items thrown about from her fight against the fire.

           Jessica moves the candle over to the floor in front of the 
           door, the black plastic garbage bag in melted shreds.

           Sammy's hand is covered in angry blisters, openly bleeding, 
           his forearm charred, the shirt sleeve ragged black ash.

           The Hand doesn't move. 

           She ponders it, her eyes narrow. 

           Dead?

           His little pinkie finger twitches slightly.

           Nope. Still alive.

           The hole next to The Hand, her one chance at escape.

           A hard stare. 

           Hopeless.

           Jessica looks over the shelf. Something's missing.

           She moves the candle to search the floor.

           Not in this corner.

           Not over there.

           Wait.

           There it is.

           The baggie of meth.

           On the floor near her feet.

           She sets the candle down next to it, its tiny form casting a 
           much bigger shadow on the wall, like a giant looming over 
           her.

           Jessica, tired, spent, curls up on her side, trying to keep 
           warm, and faces the meth, like a new mom would with a 
           newborn, fresh and full of promise, and she --

           -- strokes it lightly like it was a baby's cheek.

           Her finger shakes.
           INT. PANTRY - MORNING - THIRD DAY INSIDE

           A stream of sunlight hits Jessica's face, the rest of the 
           pantry is dark shadows.

           Her eyes spring open to her current hell.

           She blinks. Nope, not a dream.

           In the thin streaks of morning light squeezing in around the 
           door, her BREATH IS VISIBLE.

           It's freezing.

           She angles her face toward the ceiling and yells, her voice 
           weak, cracked.

                                 JESSICA
                        Lainey! Let me know you're okay! 
                        Put a blanket on the baby!

           Silence.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Lainey!

           Nothing.

           Her eyes well with tears. She shuts them releasing the tears 
           down her cheek.

           Defeated, discouraged, she weeps.

           MOMENTS LATER

           The candle is lit, burned almost down to the bottom, giving 
           light to Jessica's next project taking place on the shelf.

           It's another escape. This one, a sure bet.

           She stands over a small clearing on the shelf serving as a 
           surface for the white meth powder to be snorted.

           Next to her is the Bible, an odd neighbor for her current 
           task. But she's not distracted.

           Jessica's eyes are dead, singular in dark purpose.

           She gingerly spills a tiny pile onto the shelf.

           Then rips the cover of Knitting World Magazine off. 

           Then a smaller piece two inches wide. 
           She uses the magazine cover to form a line.

           SCRAPE.

           SCRAPE.

           SCRAPE.

           She tears another piece of magazine cover and --

           -- rolls it into a tight straw. She's noticeable good at 
           this, despite having one working hand.

           Jessica leans over, ready to snort, and turns her head to the 
           side slightly. 

           Her eyes are level with the outer pages of the Bible, each 
           new chapter marked with a gold plastic tab.

           She notices something odd about it. 

           Something green edges out of the pages. Doesn't belong. She 
           recognizes that shade of green.

           Jessica drops the rolled paper and pulls at the green edge.

           An old ONE-HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL slides out.

           This has her attention.

           Jessica holds the bill by the light of the candle, curious 
           and confused.

           She looks back at the old Bible.

           What?

           She flips it open to a random page. Another one-hundred-
           dollar bill is Scotch-taped to the page. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Oh my god.

           She pulls out more, all taped to the pages.

           Soon, she realizes there's purpose on how they're placed. All 
           carefully affixed under verses of some import.

           She shuffles through the pages, barely glancing at the words. 

           Then stops. 

           Something about this verse catches her attention.
           Her finger traces the words.

           Matthew 7:16-20 

           16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes 
           of thorns, or figs of thistles?

           17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a 
           corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

           18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a 
           corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

           19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn 
           down, and cast into the fire.

           She thinks on this for a moment. Means something to her.

           She turns the page. 

           Nothing.

           Another page.

           More money.

           She flips through the pages quickly. The flashes of green 
           tell her there's thousands inside.

           She shuts the Bible, then opens it to the front.

           There, a family record is written in the same neat cursive as 
           the apple butter labels. 

           A long list of dates and name, baptisms and marriages.

           Her finger stops at her name and birth date. 

           Jessica Rose Darcy

           Born August 2, 1998

           She turns the page where an OLD PHOTO has been placed. 

           Jessica picks it up and squints at it. 

           It's the farmhouse kitchen, a little girl sitting at the 
           table with a pile of apples, an older woman smiling in an 
           apron.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Nana.
           Jessica CRIES. Not a nostalgic cry over a treasured memory, 
           but a deep, painful weeping over lost time and lost things.

           But...

           Something is paper-clipped to the back of the photo. She 
           turns it over, still crying.

           In her Nana's handwriting, a RECIPE CARD FOR APPLE BUTTER.

           She's quiet now, focused.

           Jessica's eyes dart down the ingredient list and 
           instructions. 

           Her eyes linger on it. 

           This means something to her. Something more than just a 
           recipe for a fruity spread.

           A sticky note drifts down to the floor, jostled from 
           somewhere inside the Bible. 

           Jessica plucks it up.

           Her Nana's handwriting. "For Jessica."

           She SOBS now.

           HEAVES. 

           She SCREAMS in frustration.

           The crucified Christ looks down on her. 

           She feels the weight of His stare.

           She looks up at it.

           Grabs the Bible and THROWS IT at the crucifix. Screams.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        What good is all this now you 
                        bastard!?

           It FALLS.

           BOUNCES off a shelf.

           BREAKS in two on the floor.

           She stares, frozen. Regret.

           What did she do?
           Jessica kneels down and retrieves the cross, now empty, 
           Christ's tortured body separated from it. 

           Must have slid under the bottom shelf in the corner. 

           She reaches for it.

           Pulls it out.

           Looks down on the face of Christ, freed from His cross.

           She seems to say a silent prayer or make a wish. Maybe it's 
           the Serenity Prayer used at AA meetings. But something in her 
           seems to find peace.

           A beat.

           Then she notices something.

           A drop of water on his face

           Her tears?

           She wipes it away. 

           A new drop falls.

           DRIP.

           She looks up.

           Tries to see the source.

           Up in the far corner of the ceiling, nothing but blackness.

           Jessica grabs the candle, edges into the corner, and holds it 
           up to illuminate the area.

           Another DRIP from the ceiling...

           Onto her forehead. 

           She wipes it away.

           MOMENTS LATER

           The cardboard box on its side, swaying, slowly collapsing 
           under her weight.

           Jessica balances on top, her foot stepping up to a pantry 
           shelf.
           She angles up to the next shelf and positions herself closer 
           to the corner ceiling.

           She grabs the candle and holds it up to the ceiling.

           Now we see it: 

           A large WATER STAIN on the white plaster. 

           A drip falls again from the center.

           DRIP.

           DRIP.

           Jessica sets the candle down nearby and scratches at the spot 
           with her finger.

           Plaster falls away easily.

           A small hole appears. 

           A ROACH crawls out.

           She jumps, then swats it away.

           She looks back at the hole inside the rotting plaster and 
           wood as if making a connection.

           Something about it makes sense.

           Frantically now, she SCRATCHES...

           And TEARS at the wood. 

           It comes apart, years of rot from a leak having done its 
           damage.

           But she only has her left hand with work with, her right too 
           painful.

           She WHACKS at the wood, pulling and tearing.

           She yanks her hand back.

           OUCH!

           By the light of the candle, a large SPLINTER in her palm.

           She pulls it out with GROAN.

           Her right hand shakes from the effort.

           She pulls off the bandage. 
           The puncture is angry red and puss-filled. 

           She looks at both her hands outstretched in front of her. 
           Both marked like Christ. 

           A beat.

           Christ-like or not, she's not getting through the ceiling 
           with bare hands.

           She grabs the candle and holds it to the center of the 
           pantry, looking for something.

           She sees it.

           It's sitting in Sammy's palm.

           The screwdriver.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Two fingers placed delicately on a burnt, red, blistered 
           wrist.

           Jessica's face looms over it, trying to find Sammy's pulse.

                                 JESSICA
                        Sammy? You there? Sammy?

           Silence.

           Not satisfied, Jessica lays her cheek to the floor and 
           squints. 

           Sammy's silhouette in the morning light. 

           Unmoving.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Sammy! Wake up you stupid asshole!

           She sits up and pushes at his hand. Should be painful enough 
           to incite a reaction.

           Nothing.

           Conflicted, Jessica peers up at the hole in the ceiling as if 
           calculating how long it might take to punch through.

           It's decided.

           She wraps her hands around the handle of the screwdriver and 
           yanks.
           Doesn't budge.

           She grabs a brick and bangs the handle from the side to 
           loosen it.

           Seems to work.

           She wriggles it out of the floor and Sammy's hand.

           A GRUNT and a big yank.

           It's hers.

           One last glance at The Hand.

           Hasn't moved at all.

           LATER

           The long end of the screwdriver POUNDS into wet, rotting 
           wood. 

           It pulls back to reveal a small hole.

           LIGHT streams in onto Jessica's face.

           She's broken through.

           A boost of motivation. She hacks at it with fury.

           A big chunk of wood falls away, enough for her to poke her 
           head through.

           This is gonna work.

           It's time to leave the pantry.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Next to the bathtub -- close to the spot where Jessica 
           complained about the leak two days ago -- there's a HOLE in 
           the linoleum.

           FINGERS reach up and pull at the sides.

           They give way, collapsing in.

           A beat.

           JESSICA'S HEAD edges through the floor, reborn out of the 
           darkness. 
           A moment to look around the bathroom. 

           Almost out.

                                 JESSICA
                        Lainey? I'm in the bathroom! I'm 
                        coming!

           She groans as she pushes her arms against the floor for 
           leverage to pull her body out. She wriggles up, much like 
           that worm outta the apple.

           It's tight. 

           Her hip wedges against the floor. 

           Stuck.

           She leans onto one side and hacks at the floor with the 
           screwdriver.

           Another chunk loosens. She pulls it away.

           And then...

           Jessica emerges from the pantry below.

           Free.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           The bathroom door. 

           MUFFLED THUMPS. Jessica behind it, making her way from the 
           hole to the door.

           The door handle shakes and turns, likes she's having trouble 
           making it work.

           The door swings open.

           Jessica shuffles through into the direct morning light, her 
           eyes squinting -- not used to it -- and her right hand 
           immediately embraced by her left, still in pain.

           She's battered, bruised, exhausted and dehydrated. 

           It's frigid upstairs. Her ragged exhale, icy clouds. Teeth 
           chatter.

                                 JESSICA
                        Laine? Mason? I'm coming.
           Even still, she moves quickly to the door at the end of the 
           hall.

           Where her babies are.

           She STUMBLES on something, nearly trips. 

           Looks down at the floor. 

           It's a half-eaten apple. 

           Lainey's. 

           She keeps walking through a MINEFIELD OF BITTEN APPLES 
           discarded on the floor of the hallway.

           Some rotten.

           She kicks one out of her way.

           At the door, she stops for a beat.

           Afraid of what she might find behind it.

           Then she tries the doorknob.

           Locked.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Laine?! Open the door. It's mommy.

           Silence.

           Nothing.

           Not a sound.

           She knocks on the door. Wiggles the doorknob aggressively.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Lainey? The door is locked, baby. 
                        Please come unlock it. I'm out of 
                        the pantry now.

           Nothing.

           She puts her ear to the door and listens.

           The HUM of the WIND outside. Branches BREAKING. RAIN.

           She yells.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        It's mommy! Open the door!
           Bangs on the door.

           BANG.

           BANG.

           BANG.

           Then pounds with her shoulder.

           POUND.

           POUND.

           Nothing.

           It's clear they're dead. It's the only explanation.

           She MOANS. SCREAMS. The idea they're gone stops her 
           breathing. She almost chokes on grief.

           And then...

           She gathers herself. No, can't give up now. 

           And...

           THROWS HER BODY AGAINST THE DAMN DOOR.

           She KICKS it.

           BEATS it.

           Determined like hell.

           Not getting locked away from them again.

           Jessica steps back and barrels into it.

           BANG!

           Again. 

           BANG!

           Again.

           BANG!

           IT OPENS.
           INT. BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           As if afraid of seeing a ghost, Jessica delicately steps into 
           the room and takes in the scene.

           More partially eaten APPLES litter the floor. 

           Dirty DIAPER in the corner. Heap of baby WIPES next to it.

           Spilled FORMULA. The can left open. 

           Empty.

           The baby's play-pen.

           Empty.

           The window, still open at the bottom where she was too weak 
           to close it earlier, a frigid wind whips through the 
           curtains. 

           THUNDER echoes through the space.

           And on the mattress...

           A mound of blankets.

           They have to be under there.

           Her feet pad softly to the mattress, abject fear in her eyes.

           Jessica's voice is soft and unsure, like she might be talking 
           to two corpses.

                                 JESSICA
                        Mommy's here. You're safe now.

           Her shaky hand reaches for the blankets. 

           She pulls one back to reveal another.

           She pulls it back.

           Another blanket.

           And then, the last one, draped over two small figures, 
           motionless.

           She pulls it back.

           Lainey lies on her side, turned toward the baby, her armed 
           draped around him.

           The baby clutches an empty bottle.
           Their eyes are closed. They're pale.

           Dead?

           No.

           Lainey stirs.

           Looks up at Jessica.

                                 LAINEY
                        Mommy. Mommy!

           Jessica kneels on the mattress. 

           Lainey bolts into her arms.

           An intense hug. 

                                 JESSICA
                        I got out, baby. I'm here.

                                 LAINEY
                        I had a dream you were breaking the 
                        door.

           Jessica kisses her daughter. 

                                 JESSICA
                        I did, baby. I broke it down.

           Then examines her quickly, like a nurse. Checks her eyes, 
           feels her hands.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Hands are cold.

           She rubs them, breathes warm air on them. Then turns to the 
           baby.

           A beat. He's so still. 

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Momma's here, Mason.

           She reaches for the baby, pulls him up.

           He stirs. 

           Wakes from his deep sleep.

                                 LAINEY
                        Mommy, I'm hungry.
           Jessica envelopes the baby with her arms, kisses his chubby 
           cheeks.

           He COOS. He's intact. Alive. Gonna be fine.

           She pulls in Lainey, hugs them both tight. 

                                 JESSICA
                        You did a good job, Laine. 

           Lainey is single-minded.

                                 LAINEY
                        Can I have fish crackers? They're 
                        in the car, remember?

           A beat. 

           Jessica glances at the window into the icy abyss outside. 

           What now?

           INT. STAIRS - DAY - LATER

           Jessica warily tiptoes down the stairs. In her arms, the baby 
           wrapped up in the blanket. Lainey clings to her side, a 
           blanket draped over her shoulders.

           At the bottom, Jessica's eyes dart to the feet lying 
           motionless around the corner.

           Lainey's terrified, eyes on Sammy's feet. 

           Jessica stops. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Stay here. 

           Jessica hands Lainey the baby and they sit on the bottom 
           step. 

           She pads softly to the pantry door.

           Now we see the horrific mess from the other side. A dozen or 
           so boards nailed over the door. Sammy twisted on his side, 
           eyes closed, his arm pinned under the door.

           He hasn't moved since she pulled the screwdriver out.

           Jessica NUDGES him with her foot. 

           Nothing.
           Satisfied, she kneels down over his body. A chain peeks out 
           of the front pocket of his jeans.

           She pulls it out. 

           Keys!

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Jessica and her kids stare out the open front door at a DIRT 
           BIKE. Sammy's ride.

           The wind and rain is so extreme, it shakes. 

           A BICYCLE HELMET BLOWS OFF and rolls down the icy driveway.

           Not happening. Jessica's head drops, defeated.

                                 LAINEY
                        Mommy, I'm hungry.

           The baby starts to WHINE. Likely hungry, too.

                                 JESSICA
                        Laine, you stay here with Mason. 
                        I'm gonna get the food from the 
                        car.

           A quick glance back toward Sammy -- not visible from where 
           she stands. 

           Not a sound.

                                 LAINEY
                        Don't leave, mommy!

           A beat. She's right. Not leaving the kids now.

                                 JESSICA
                        Okay, come with me. Stay close. 

           The three of them head out of the front door into the --

           EXT. FRONT YARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           The frigid wind whips around them as they awkwardly move to 
           the car as one mass, huddled together. 

           BAM!

           A TREE BRANCH FALLS close by. 
           Too close.

           Lainey SCREAMS. Jessica guides her away, closer to her side.

           Maybe this wasn't a good idea.

           AT THE CAR

           Jessica checks the door. The brown paper grocery bag filled 
           with food sits on the passenger seat.

           She tries the door. It's locked. But she knew that.

           She scans the ground for something. 

           Sees it.

           Grabs a loose paving brick from a landscaping border, the 
           shrubs and flowers inside withered and dead. 

           Bashes in the driver's side window. The baby CRIES in her 
           arms.

           BANG.

           BANG.

           CRASH.

           She's in.

           A quick glance to the front window of the house. Looks fine 
           still.

           Grabs the bag.

           A TALL SHADOW PASSES ACROSS THE FRONT WINDOW

           But she doesn't see this.

           Tries to situate the baby and the bag with an injured hand. 

           Doesn't look good.

           Heads up to the house with the kids. But it's hard to balance 
           the baby AND the bag AND hold Lainey's hand. Everything's 
           slipping.

           Another BRANCH FALLS.

           Jessica stumbles.

           DROPS THE BAG OF FOOD.
           A beat as she looks at it on the ground ripped open, food 
           spilling out, her kids clinging to her, frightened.

           Frozen rain pelting everything and everyone.

           Can't manage both.

           Holding the baby with her injured right arm, she grabs a 
           PACKAGE OF COOKIES and JUICE BOXES with her left, WINCING. 

           And heads back inside.

           Leaves the rest.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY - LATER

           Lainey sits in the corner closest to the front door sucking 
           up a juice box, wrapped in a blanket, cookie in her hand.

           Jessica stands over her, baby in her arms with a bottle of 
           apple juice. 

           Jessica's unsettled, eyes darting around, trying to figure 
           out her next move, wrapping the baby up tighter in the 
           blanket.

                                 LAINEY
                        Can I have fish crackers now?

           Jessica glances out the window. The food is mere steps away. 
           But the rain is still beating down.

           Lainey shivers from the cold.

                                 JESSICA
                        Let me go get them. Here, keep 
                        Mason next to you. Stay warm.

           Jessica sits the baby down next to Lainey. 

           A quick glance down the hall, toward the pantry, but it's not 
           visible from there. 

           Still, nothing seems amiss. And this will just take a minute. 

           Jessica leaves out the front door.

           Closes it behind her.

           EXT. FRONT YARD - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           A mess of packaged convenience food on the wet ground. 
           Jessica's good left hand grabs at individual bags of fish 
           crackers and piles them into the crook of her right arm. 

           A quick glance up at the front window over the porch. 

           Nothing unusual.

           A few baggies of fish crackers fall from her arm onto the 
           ground. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Dammit. 

           She starts over, piling more into her arm. 

           Sees an insulated bag, like you would take for lunch, and 
           grabs that, too. 

           Stands up, ready to go, wet, cold, muddy now.

           Looks at the window over the porch again.

           SAMMY STARES OUT AT HER!

           She drops everything, and RUNS FOR THE PORCH.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        No!

           He disappears. Gone.

           She blinks her eyes. Wipes rain from them. Did she imagine 
           it?

           As she gets up the stairs to the porch, her eyes target the 
           front window, where her kids should be visible.

           But aren't.

           Panic.

           But she forgets about the damn HOLE IN THE PORCH.

           And STEPS INTO IT.

           She lets out a strangled YELL. 

           Wrenches her foot free.

           Bolts for the door.

           Her hand finds the doorknob.

           LOCKED!
           She's fucking locked outside.

           A beat. Her mind running wild with every scenario possible 
           but settles on the worst one.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Let me in!

           She POUNDS on the door. 

           BEATS on it.

           Then...

           Runs back to the car.

           Her foot smashing a bag of fish crackers into the frozen mud.

           Grabs the brick.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Brick meets glass in the front window.

           CRASH!

           Jessica climbs through the jagged glass. 

           A piece of glass embeds in her thigh.

                                 JESSICA
                        Ahhh!

           She pulls it out. 

           Pushes shards out of her way.

           Gets through.

           Eyes go to the corner where her kids were.

           A juice box is left.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Lainey?! Where are you?!

           She runs down the hallway, toward the pantry...

           Stops dead, wind knocked out of her.

           SAMMY.

           IS.
           GONE.

           He's not on the floor dead. 

           Because he's not dead. Because he was at the window.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        No. No!

           Just then...

           She hears the BABY CRYING.

           From UPSTAIRS.

           NO!

           She bolts.

           Up the steps.

           Into the --

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           The CRYING is louder.

           Coming from the end of the hall.

           In the bedroom.

           Jessica runs to the door, which is slightly ajar.

           Barges through, into the --

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Jessica stops on a dime, shocked at the sight before her.

           In the far corner, Sammy sits on the floor, his back against 
           the wall.

           In his lap, THE BABY.

           A knife in his hand.

           Lainey sits next to him, paralyzed, confused.

           But she jumps up when she sees her mom.
                                 LAINEY
                        Mommy! He took the baby! He won't 
                        give him back!

           Sammy, with his one good hand and clutching the pocket knife, 
           pulls Lainey back down. His injured hand is a bloody, charred 
           mess. He seems to be impervious to the pain.

                                 SAMMY
                        No, no, sit down, little girl. What 
                        did I tell you? 

                                 JESSICA
                        Let them go.

           Sammy angles the knife dangerously close to the baby.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Please.

           A creepy grin breaks out on Sammy's face. 

                                 SAMMY
                        Please? I said please let me go a 
                        dozen fucking times, Jessica. Don't 
                        you remember?

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm sorry. 

                                 LAINEY
                        Mommy, I want to go.

                                 JESSICA
                        Just sit tight, baby.

           Jessica edges closer.

                                 SAMMY
                        Stop, little momma, right there. 

                                 JESSICA
                        The meth is still in the pantry. Go 
                        get it. It's all yours.

           A beat.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        There's money in there too. Lots of 
                        it. Thousands. My grandma's money. 
                        Just give me the baby.

           Sammy's listening. Seems interested. Looks down at his 
           injured hand. It's shaking pretty fiercely.
                                 SAMMY
                        Thanks for letting me know about 
                        that. 

           His hand tightens around the knife. Aims it at the baby's 
           neck. But he's shaking like a leaf. Weak.

           Jessica leaps at him. Grabs his arm.

                                 JESSICA
                        Stop! Let him go!

                                 ROB (O.S.)
                        Drop the fucking knife, Sammy!

           The sound of ROB'S VOICE stuns them both. 

           Sammy sees him first. 

           Whatever he sees makes him drop the knife.

           Jessica grabs the baby and grabs Lainey's hand and moves 
           away.

           Now she finally sees Rob. He's at the doorway with a large 
           HANDGUN pointed at Sammy.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        What the hell are you doing here 
                        with my kids?

           Sammy puts his hands up, submissive.

                                 SAMMY
                        That bitch hammered my hand to the 
                        fucking floor! Look at it!

           He shows his bloody raw palm to Rob.

           Meanwhile, Jessica edges out of the door with the kids into 
           the --

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           As she softly pads down the hall, she can hear the rest of 
           the conversation.

                                 ROB (O.S.)
                        You didn't answer my question. What 
                        are you, some kind of pedophile?
                                 SAMMY (O.S.)
                        You owe me money!
                            (then, weakly)
                        You owe me money, man.

           Jessica, clutching her baby and Lainey's hand, storms down 
           the --

           INT. STAIRCASE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           BANG!

           She stops. Freezes. Baby SCREAMS at the sound. Lainey's 
           shaking.

                                 LAINEY
                        What's that, mommy?

           It's a gunshot.

           Jessica gathers herself. Keeps descending the staircase.

                                 JESSICA
                        Tree branch fell.

           Hits the last step. 

           Then, over her shoulder, from above.

                                 ROB (O.S.)
                        Jessica, where ya running off to?

           She whips her head up.

           Rob stares down at her, casually leaning over the railing, 
           gun visible in his hand, most likely just killed a man. 
           Capable of anything.

           But she tries to reason anyway.

                                 JESSICA
                        Thanks for coming back. I need to 
                        get the kids safe now. I just need 
                        my car keys.

                                 ROB
                        Kids are safe. Sammy won't hurt 
                        them now. I took care of it.

           Jessica is terrified. She tries not to show it.
                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        So, what's this about your Nana's 
                        money?

           A beat as Jessica realizes she's not going anywhere.

           INT. OUTSIDE THE PANTRY - DAY - LATER

           A CROWBAR wrenches a 2x4 free.

           It's the last one covering the pantry.

           Rob, pistol tucked into the waist of his jeans, steps back to 
           admire his work.

           Done.

           Jessica stands near, baby in her arms. Lainey holds her hand 
           tightly. They look like a family of scared field mice staring 
           down a plow.

                                 ROB
                        I think that was easier to put up 
                        than take down.

           He looks at Jessica for a response. Like, a laugh or 
           something.

           Her face is stone.

                                 JESSICA
                        I need to get the kids to a doctor.

           Rob looks them over.

                                 ROB
                        They look fine to me. Don't be such 
                        a helicopter parent.

           Jessica responds carefully. Doesn't want to ruffle his 
           feathers.

                                 JESSICA
                        They're hungry. We need to eat. 
                        It's freezing and my hand is 
                        infected.

           Rob ignores her. Pushes inside the pantry. Jessica watches 
           him.

           He finds the baggie of meth. Sees the remnants of her attempt 
           to snort it. 
                                 ROB
                        Looks like you had a little fun in 
                        here.

           Gives her a wide grin. 

                                 JESSICA
                        I didn't. I'm still clean.

           His grin fades. This bothers him.

           Her eyes move to the floor under his feet. A hundred dollar 
           bill. 

           Rob follow her gaze, sees it, too.

                                 ROB
                        Holy shit. You weren't lying.

           Jessica just watches.

           Rob sees another one.

           Traces it back to the Bible on the floor. Hunches over it, 
           ripping pages out.

           Extracting the money.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Holy shitballs! Fuckin' awesome!

           He looks over to her, ecstatic. 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        You know what this will buy us?

                                 JESSICA
                        You can have it. Take it all. Just 
                        go and leave us alone.

           Rob leans out the pantry, hand stuffed with hundreds.

                                 ROB
                        You never shot it? Wanna try?

           Jessica has no answer. Her eyes stayed trained on his handgun 
           now tucked in the waistband of his jeans.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        We'll do it together.

           It's a command, not a question this time.
           Her eyes move to the floor of the pantry. Under his boot, the 
           image of Christ. Asshole doesn't even notice.

           Above it, the shelf. 

           One last jar of apple butter.

           Next to it, the powdery meth.

           Some kind of resolve comes over her. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Okay.

                                 ROB
                        Okay? 

                                 JESSICA
                        Yeah, let's do it. I'm ready. 

           Jessica feels the confused eyes of Lainey on her. A quick 
           glance down. 

           Lainey lets go of her hand.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        There's a bag of food outside. I 
                        wanna feed the kids first. 
                            (then)
                        We should eat, too. It's important 
                        to eat or you'll get... sick. You 
                        know that.

           Rob rubs his gaunt face, thinking. 

                                 ROB
                        Yeah, alright. Let's eat first. 
                        I'll get the food. You stay here.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY - LATER

           A plastic bowl, like you would use for baby food, full of 
           apple butter. A spoon stirs and stirs.

           And stirs.

           Jessica's face, concentrating on the task, as she leans over 
           the counter-top. 

           Behind her, Lainey sits at the table. The baby is in the high 
           chair waiting on something to eat.
                                 LAINEY
                        Can I have some?

           Jessica looks up, tense. Thoughtful.

                                 JESSICA
                        No, baby, this is for daddy. He's 
                        bringing in our food from outside.

           Beat.

                                 LAINEY
                        Daddy's bad.

           Jessica spots a tiny speck of something white in the apple 
           butter. She stirs it in with purpose. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Yeah. He is.

           LATER

           At the table, Lainey munches on white bread, maybe peanut 
           butter inside, a pile of bright orange fish crackers at her 
           elbow.

           The baby sucks down a milk bottle at the high chair. They're 
           both wrapped in blankets. 

           Rob carefully lays out some items on the table. 

           A bent spoon. 

           Lighter. 

           Syringe.

           Stack of hundreds from Nana's Bible. Jessica's inheritance. 

           The handgun next to it.

                                 ROB
                        Jess, you ready? I got some better 
                        stuff here. Just picked it up on my 
                        way over.

           He pulls out a baggie of meth crystals from his shirt pocket.

           Jessica sets a plate down in front of him. Two slices of 
           white bread spread thick with apple butter.
                                 JESSICA
                        Better than what you gave me? You 
                        said it was pharma grade.

           Rob looks up at her and smiles like he just got caught 
           playing a harmless joke on her.

                                 ROB
                        I was wrong. That shit's cut heavy. 
                        I had one hit and lost it pretty 
                        bad. That's why I got here so late. 
                        Wasn't my fault.
                            (then)
                        Glad you didn't take it. Stickin' 
                        to crystals from now on.

           She looks at him with even more hate if possible.

           Rob notices the plate of food before him. He doesn't look 
           impressed or hungry.

           Pushes it away.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Not hungry.

           She pushes it back to him. Rubs his shoulder.

                                 JESSICA
                        You need to eat first. Look at how 
                        Sammy -- was. Wasted away. You have 
                        to make yourself eat -- even when 
                        you don't feel like it.

           She sounds nurturing, motherly. He's oddly touched by it. 
           Doesn't notice how forced her tone is.

           He puts his hand over hers.

                                 ROB
                        Yeah, yeah, you're right. 
                            (then)
                        Thanks.

           Jessica stays standing. Watching for a beat.

                                 JESSICA
                        You're welcome.

           Rob, eyes staying on Jessica, takes a large bite.

           She watches his face.

           He chews, swallows. 
           Nods his head in appreciation.

                                 ROB
                        It's good. What is this crap? Looks 
                        like literal crap, ya know?

           Jessica seems to exhale a little.

                                 JESSICA
                        Nana's apple butter. Won first 
                        place at the county fair when I was 
                        a kid.

           A beat.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Eat up.

           LATER

           Jessica runs water over an empty plate, a smear of brown left 
           from the apple butter. 

           Looks like he ate it all.

           She scrubs that smear off with a vengeance. 

           But her hand stings. Still infected. She pulls it up. Winces. 
           Nearly swoons from her current state. 

           Steadies herself against the counter.

           Shakes off the pain. Deep breaths.

           Behind her, Rob sits at the table, holds a lighter under a 
           bent spoon, concentrating on it.

                                 JESSICA
                        Can we do that in the living room? 
                        I don't want the kids to see.

           Rob looks up at her. Then at the kids, still eating, innocent 
           eyes trying to ascertain what's going on. 

           A beat.

           A twinge of something on his face. Guilt? Parental 
           responsibility? 

                                 ROB
                        Sure, sure. Come on.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY - LATER

           Rob's face, in ecstasy. 

           A deep exhale, like all his worries just dissipated from his 
           body.

           He sits on the hardwood floor of the living room, leaning 
           against the wall, arm outstretched, and unties the tourniquet 
           around it.

           Turns his head to Jessica.

                                 ROB
                        Your turn. Here.

           Hands Jessica the tourniquet. She sits across from him.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm not ready. I'll do it later.

                                 ROB
                        Nah. 
                            (then)
                        We're doing this together. 

           Jessica glances down at his free hand on the floor. It rests 
           on the handgun.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Hurry up. I got one more hit in 
                        this needle.

                                 JESSICA
                        Well, I want a clean needle. 

           Rob senses she's stalling. 

           Cause she is.

           He points the gun at her, loaded syringe in the other hand.

                                 ROB
                        Tie yourself off. This is for your 
                        own good. I don't want to hurt you, 
                        Jess. I never did.

           A beat.

           Jessica rolls up her sleeve. 

           Ties the tourniquet, using her mouth and good hand.

           It takes her a bit. He's losing patience.
                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Hurry the fuck up!

                                 JESSICA
                        My hand is hurt. I'm not good at 
                        this.

           She looks over to him, sincere.

           Rob puts down the gun. She notes this.

           He reaches over to help.

           Jessica WHACKS him in the face.

           Goes for the gun.

                                 ROB
                        You bitch!

           Rob pushes her easily aside. 

           She hits the floor.

           From her vantage point on the floor, Rob is now standing over 
           her.

           She looks up at the barrel of his gun.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Get up and tie yourself off or I'll 
                        shoot you in your fucking eye.

           Jessica pushes herself up, standing.

           A beat as they stare at each other.

                                 JESSICA
                        Go ahead and kill me. I might as 
                        well be dead. 

           BAM! 

           Rob pistol whips her.

           She grabs her cheek, blood appearing at her nose.

           Beat. She's unsure of her next move.

           They stand facing each other.

           Suddenly, Rob seems overly agitated. Rubs his eyes hard. 
           Something's not right.
           Jessica watches. Takes the chance and...

           RUNS LIKE HELL!

           Towards the stairs.

           Heavy boots follow behind her.

                                 ROB (O.S.)
                        Where you goin', Jess?!

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm not doing it!

           INT. TOP OF STAIRS - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Jessica leaps up to the top of the stairs and looks back. 
           Rob's head bounces up towards her.

           She runs down the hallway.

           To the bedroom.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Jessica whips inside and tried to lock the door behind her.

           But it's broken from earlier.

           Through the crack, she sees Rob rushing toward her.

           She scans the room.

           Sammy slumps in the corner, dead, a pool of blood under him.

           Nearby, the window.

           The window!

           Jessica bolts to it.

           Pulls it open.

           Looks out.

                                 JESSICA
                        Shit.

           It's too far down. Nothing to hold onto. Dumb idea.

           Besides, it's too late anyway.
           Rob's stumbles in. Gun pointed at her.

                                 ROB
                        Why you gotta make this so hard on 
                        yourself?

           He slowly moves toward her. Gun in one hand, syringe in the 
           other.

           Jessica swallows. Prepares for what's coming.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        You go to rehab one time, think 
                        you're better than everyone and cut 
                        me out like I'm nothing.

           He's a few inches away. So close she could smell the apple 
           butter on his breath.

           Jessica squeezes back against the window frame. Her hand 
           searches from something, but there's nothing.

           Rob puts the gun to her temple. Leans in. Cocks it.

           CLICK-CLICK.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Like I said, the problem between us 
                        is you think you're better than me. 
                        Always have.

           His hand starts to shake. 

           Something's not right.

           Rob wipes his brow, drops the syringe.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        God dammit. 

           Breathes hard.

           And then...

           His hand goes to his chest, like something's wrong with his 
           heart.

           The gun stays trained on her head, but shakes, too.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Something's wrong.

           A glance between them. He reads her eyes. 
           Guilty eyes.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        What did you give me, Jessica?!

                                 JESSICA
                        I gave you three grams of your 
                        shitty cut meth... the stuff you 
                        locked me up with while my babies 
                        were alone and cold and in 
                        danger... while I rotted away 
                        inside a pantry, you asshole. 
                            (then)
                        You're OD'ing.

           Rob's breathing comes in ragged staccato. 

           Gun drops from his hand. 

           But he leans into Jessica, slaps his hands around her neck 
           like a zombie, disabled but intent on harm.

                                 ROB
                        You're nothing. 

           She fights him, pushing back, slapping at his face. He's weak 
           and erratic. She has a shot.

                                 JESSICA
                        I'm not nothing.

           They fight against the window --

           -- flipping positions, with Rob's back to the open air.

           Then, as if having a heart attack, he slumps down, the window 
           pane catching him. 

           He sits there, clutching his chest.

           He looks up her, as if realizing he's going to Hell anyway 
           and wants to get in one last jab. 

                                 ROB
                        You're not better than me. You'll 
                        see.

           Jessica answers with a --

           -- KICK TO THE GUT. 

           He springs back through the window. Too weak to even grab for 
           anything.
           And plummets down.

           A SOFT THUD on the wet earth below.

           Jessica exhales. 

           Looks out of the window. 

           Rob's lifeless body on the cold ground.

           She grabs the window and pulls it closed with a GUTTURAL 
           GROAN.

           And unlike before, the old, sticky window shuts all the way 
           to the bottom, even with her injured hand which springs back 
           in pain, close to her chest.

           Oddly, she seems stronger now.

           Then Jessica finally gives Rob a response, but he won't hear 
           it. He's not the one who needs to hear it anyway.

                                 JESSICA
                            (to herself)
                        I am better than you.

           EXT. UNDER AN APPLE TREE - DAY

           A repeat of the first scene, but a little different. 

           LITTLE BOOTS stomp the icy ground, apple tree leaves in 
           various stages of rot.

           It's deeper into fall.

           A little leftover snow confirms it.

           A small GLOVED HAND reaches under some leaves. Pulls out a 
           hiding APPLE. 

           Little boots scamper away.

           INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Lainey emerges from the apple orchard, headed for the house. 

           We move on ahead of her.

           The for-sale sign is gone. But the Ford Escort is still 
           there, broken window fixed.

           Neat pile of leaves raked in the yard.
           Hole in the front porch is patched.

           Two pumpkins frame the door. Halloween must be close.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, a cheery fire CRACKLES in the fireplace. 

           There's furniture, not brand new, but comfortable.

           DOWN THE HALL

           MUSIC. 

           Not Metallica. Sounds like pre-schooler top hits. Barney or 
           The Wiggles. What a good mom would reluctantly play for her 
           kids and then complain about later at a mom's night-out.

           We get to the pantry, just before the kitchen.

           Door is permanently removed. 

           But looks fully stocked in there. Lots of food. Tall stack of 
           baby formula. Crucifix has been glued back together and put 
           back up in its spot.

           We head into the --

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           On the floor, barrels of apples. Apples in every corner, on 
           the kitchen table, counter-top. 

           A serious harvest.

           On the stove, a massive pot. Apple butter simmering away.

           Jessica assertively stirs it. Shakes off the wooden spoon. 
           Replaces the lid.

           Quick stretch of her fingers and assessment of her right 
           palm. All healed now. Just a small scar left.

           She's got an apron on, like something her Nana would wear, 
           over jeans and a sweater. Her hair is tied back in a low bun. 
           She glows with some newfound quiet confidence.

           The baby sits at the high chair, banging a toy around. Happy.

           Jessica kisses his cheek, but gets distracted when --

           -- Lainey rushes in with the apple.
                                 LAINEY
                        I found another one! It was hiding!

           Jessica smiles, her eyes sparkle with affection.

                                 JESSICA
                        Let's take a look at it.

           Lainey hands the apple over. 

           Jessica carries it to a spot on the counter, next to the 
           sink. There, a cutting board covered in apple peels. A bowl 
           of sliced apples next to it.

           She grabs a paring knife and starts peeling.

           Lainey props herself up on a chair next to her.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I got news. The cafe in town 
                        wants to order another twenty jars 
                        of Nana's butter. They're servin' 
                        it on their pecan waffles. Isn't 
                        that cool?

           Jessica explodes with pride as she relays the news, but 
           Lainey's focused on that one apple.

                                 LAINEY
                        Is it good? Is it good?

           Jessica isn't sure what she means.

                                 JESSICA
                        Hmm?

                                 LAINEY
                        Is the apple good? 

           Jessica examines the peeled side of the apple. She spots some 
           dark brown.

           Rot.

           No biggie. She slices it away.

                                 JESSICA
                        Just a little brown here. We'll  
                        cut it out. Use the good parts, 
                        remember?

           Lainey smiles, like salvaging this one apple meant everything 
           to her.
           As they sing along to the dumb kiddie song and slice more 
           apples...

           We move across the counter-top...

           Past the BOWL of apple chunks awaiting transformation...

           To a BUCKET mounded with discarded brown apples and rotting 
           chunks taken out of the others...

           And then to the big pot, simmering the apples down and 
           changing them into something completely new.

           Next to it, a stack of JARS FILLED WITH APPLE BUTTER 
           featuring new labels: "Nana's Award-Winning Apple Butter."

           And then...

           On the old yellow refrigerator, Nana's RECIPE CARD affixed 
           with a plain magnet. 

           We scan down the list of ingredients written in her neat 
           cursive: apples, sugar, brandy, cinnamon, cloves, etc. and 
           simple cooking instructions...

           And then down to a special note at the bottom, marked with an 
           asterisk.

           *If the apples have turned, don't throw them out unless 
           they're completely rotten. Otherwise, cut out the bad spots 
           and keep the good parts. Not many people know this secret, 
           but these apples make the best apple butter.

                                                             FADE OUT.
