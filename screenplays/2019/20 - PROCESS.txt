                                     THE PROCESS

           INT. THE MULTIPURPOSE ROOM - DAY

           Rows of black folding chairs face an elevated platform.

           The walls are oppressively grey. All we hear is the 
           ubiquitous buzz of the ceiling lights.

           There are no windows, no sunlight streaming in.

           Its oppressive sparseness makes us think we are, perhaps, in 
           an empty governmental office after hours...

           But there are a dozen or so people in the room.

           They are all wearing identical, unisex uniforms. Half air 
           hostess, half nautical. These are the VOLUNTEERS.

           Some standing by the walls, some sitting behind black desks. 
           They are all staring ahead, focused. No small talk. Gearing 
           up for something important.

           We track through them, towards the DOUBLE DOORS. The only 
           exit to this cement box.

           INT. CORRIDORS - DAY

           The doors lead to a long, wide corridor gaping at us like an 
           open mouth.

           We fall into the corridor, passing by closed doors that might 
           open to anything. Offices maybe? Or classrooms? But there are 
           no signs anywhere. Nothing to orient us.

           The end of the corridor spills out to more corridors. We 
           float down. More offices. More closed doors...

           It feels like we’ve stepped into a maze, getting swallowed 
           into the bowels of an endless building, and just as we’re 
           wondering if we’re lost here forever...

           We see SUNLIGHT on the beige carpet.

           A melodic VOICE chimes in. At first distant, growing nearer:

                                 VOLUNTEER 1 (O.S.)
                        Hello, my name is Anna and I’m so 
                        glad you’re here today! Please 
                        follow me!

           We brush by this VOLUNTEER, and see that she’s leading a 
           MIDDLE AGED MAN inside, rolling a suitcase behind him.

           And an open glass door leads us outside:
           EXT. CONCRETE BUILDING - DAY

           The building stands tall and strangely alone.

           We’re somewhere outside of Los Angeles, in a nondescript 
           industrial area, under the searing California sun.

           Herds of people stream into the building, escorted by the 
           wide-smiling volunteers. We overhear a nearby conversation:

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        “The Process may cause participants 
                        to experience brief, temporary 
                        episodes of mild psychosis--" Thank 
                        God it’s only mild psychosis.

                                 KIRSA
                             (O.S.)
                        Peter, it’s just fine print.

                                 PETER
                             (O.S.)
                        “And some participants have 
                        experienced unexplained suicidal or 
                        destructive behavior--”
                             (beat)
                        This is the kind of shit they have 
                        to play after a drug commercial in 
                        case people off themselves.

           We see them now, tucked into a corner, hunched over a few 
           pieces of paper. It's a health waiver.

           They’re a study in contrast: She’s KIRSA REIN, graceful, a 
           queen in a past life, 38 years old. She's in her sleek power 
           suit, tastefully made up. She doesn't do casual.

           He’s PETER REIN, 31, effortlessly hot but lacks any semblance 
           of grace, with his visible tattoos and wild facial hair. He's 
           wearing old jeans and a fitted t-shirt.

           She’s picking lint and hair off of him as they talk.

                                 KIRSA
                        I’m going to go out on a limb and 
                        say I’m pretty sure we’re not going 
                        to kill ourselves.

                                 PETER
                        Doesn’t sound like a pleasant 
                        experience, is all I’m saying.
                                 KIRSA
                        They’re not going to waterboard us. 
                        They are a business, they have Yelp 
                        reviews. They want repeat 
                        customers, they want money.

                                 PETER
                        They’re a cult, man. You can’t know 
                        what they want.

           He says that a bit too loud. Kirsa looks around.

           She realizes they are the last ones left out here. A MATERNAL 
           VOLUNTEER, 60’s, waits for them by the door.

           Kirsa smiles at her, then turns back to Peter, her voice low:

                                 KIRSA
                        I know. I don’t get it either. But 
                        Arthur’s obsessed with this thing. 
                        It's all he talks about. And I’m 
                        THIS close to making partner and if 
                        I have to spend a weekend here to 
                        assuage his worries that I'm not 
                        living a “truthful" life, I'm 
                        willing to do that. I know it's not 
                        fair to you but I just need you to 
                        be on my team. Please.

           He thaws.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        Just think of it as a three day 
                        couples get away. We'll have a room 
                        to ourselves. Nary a screaming 
                        child in sight.

           He smiles, welcoming the possibility.

                                 PETER
                        Beautiful, you know I’d love to but 
                        I can’t get hard anymore without 
                        the Spongebob theme song blasting 
                        in the background. I just can’t.

                                 KIRSA
                        I know it by heart. I’ll sing it.

                                 PETER
                        Oh God.

           She leans into him.
                                 KIRSA
                        I’ll serenade you with it.

           He’s laughing now. She kisses him, laughing too.

           Once their laughter subsides, he SIGHS. He has a deep, loud 
           SIGH where his entire body exhales out.

           He puts the waiver over his knee and signs it.

           He hoists up an old, tattered backpack onto his shoulders and 
           she straightens up her small roller bag.

           They walk to the Maternal Volunteer and hand over their 
           waivers. She brightens up at once like a robot switching on.

                                 MATERNAL VOLUNTEER
                        Hello, my name is Mallory and I’m 
                        so glad you’re here today! Please 
                        follow me!

           She says the words with the exact sing-song cadence as the 
           first Volunteer we heard.

           Once they step in, the Maternal Volunteer closes the doors 
           and LOCKS them. Both Kirsa and Peter take notice.

           INT. CORRIDORS - DAY

           Kirsa and Peter follow the Volunteer down the winding 
           corridors. We stay with them for an uncomfortably long time 
           as they are swallowed into the labyrinth. It becomes more 
           claustrophobic with each step.

                                 PETER
                        So, like, what will we be doing?

                                 MATERNAL VOLUNTEER
                        I can’t explain it to you see, it 
                        would be like explaining a joke! 
                        You have to experience it full on.

                                 PETER
                        Can’t you give us a hint?

                                 MATERNAL VOLUNTEER
                        How about this: Do you ever wish 
                        you came with an instruction manual 
                        for your body and your mind?

                                 PETER
                        An instruction manual? Like for a 
                        dishwasher?
           He’s fucking with her. Kirsa can’t help breaking a smile but 
           throws him a “cut it, please” glance.

                                 MATERNAL VOLUNTEER
                             (serious, thankful)
                        Exactly. But for us. All of us.

           She looks at them, intense. They manage a nod or two.

           They turn a corner and face the MULTIPURPOSE ROOM.

           The participants are lined up at the desks, signing in. Some 
           are already sitting in the black chairs, chatting.

           INT. THE MULTIPURPOSE ROOM - DAY

           Peter and Kirsa are the last ones to sign in.

           TALL VOLUNTEER, 50-something with leathery skin, almost seven 
           feet tall, sits behind his desk, staring right up at them. He 
           doesn't smile like the other volunteers.

           Peter and Kirsa are aware of his gaze. They exchange 
           uncomfortable glances.

           Kirsa gives him her form. The Tall Volunteer scans it.

                                 TALL VOLUNTEER
                        Arthur Cunningham referred you to 
                        us?

           His voice is dead flat. Monotone.

                                 KIRSA
                        Yes. He gave us the tickets.

           Tall Volunteer looks through a stack of name-tags.

           A male, gay millennial CHIRPY VOLUNTEER appears next to them.

                                 CHIRPY VOLUNTEER
                        Oh my God, Art sent you?! How do 
                        you know him?

                                 KIRSA
                        I work with him at his law firm.

                                 CHIRPY VOLUNTEER
                        You’re so lucky. A bunch of us did 
                        our intro course with him and he 
                        really transformed.

                                 KIRSA
                        Yes. He... really did...
                                 CHIRPY VOLUNTEER
                        We had Aiden leading us, I’m pretty 
                        sure you guys have him today. He's 
                        the founder of all this, a real 
                        miracle worker. He's just so great 
                        at...
                             (pointing at his head)
                        Getting in there and cleaning out 
                        the cobwebs.
                             (sees someone behind her)
                        Excuse me, I need to go set stuff 
                        up. But oh this is going to be so 
                        amazing for you! I know it!

           Kirsa tries to morph her face into a convincing smile.

           He walks off. Peter leans into Kirsa, whispers:

                                 PETER
                        I sort of like my cobwebs...?

           He's half joking but she can see he's freaked out.

           Before Kirsa can reply, the Tall Volunteer extends two 
           brochures and a pair of name tags to them.

                                 KIRSA
                        Thank you.

           He points to a straw basket filled with cellphones.

                                 TALL VOLUNTEER
                        Your phones.

           Peter and Kirsa share a glance.

                                 PETER
                        Uhh... Look man, we have a four 
                        year old at home. Phones are sort 
                        of mandatory.

                                 TALL VOLUNTEER
                        Complete transformation requires 
                        complete commitment.

                                 KIRSA
                        Can we keep them if we switch them 
                        off? We'll have breaks, I assume--

                                 TALL VOLUNTEER
                        You have agreed to the Process. 
                        This is part of that agreement.

           Peter pulls her back, leans in.
                                 PETER
                             (whispering)
                        Kirs, this place has more red flags 
                        than a Chinese Armada. Seriously,  
                        we can still bolt.

           But Kirsa overhears:

                                 CHIRPY VOLUNTEER (O.S.)
                        ... yeah, she works with Art...

           She turns to see the Chirpy Volunteer talking to the others. 
           They all smile and wave at Kirsa as if she's a celebrity.

           She whispers back to Peter.

                                 KIRSA
                        It's too late. We can’t.

           She texts something quick then puts her cellphone into the 
           basket.

                                 PETER
                        Really?

                                 KIRSA
                        It’s okay. My parents will be happy 
                        to get some quality time with Sam.

           Peter full body sighs. Puts his phone into the basket.

                                 TALL VOLUNTEER
                        Leave your bags here, we will take 
                        them to your rooms.

           Peter flashes a frustrated smile as he drops his backpack to 
           the ground, hard. Kirsa lets go of her rolling bag.

           They look around for a chair to sit on. Thankfully, there are 
           two empty ones next to each other. They move to the chairs--

                                 TALL VOLUNTEER (CONT’D)
                        You can’t sit together. You need to 
                        focus on your own selves for--

           Peter whips around, his frustration boiling over:

                                 PETER
                        Yeah? That also part of our 
                        "agreement"?

                                 KIRSA
                             (reigning him in)
                        Peter.
           He turns back to Kirsa but he's coiled.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        Please just...

                                 PETER
                        Dial down the hate and make you 
                        look good?

                                 KIRSA
                        Try to give it a chance. Maybe 
                        you’ll take something out of it.

           He scoffs at that. Still annoyed at this whole thing. 

           He spots an empty chair at the other end.

                                 PETER
                        Alright, I'll catch you on the 
                        flipside. Hold onto your cobwebs.

           He's about to walk away when--

                                 KIRSA
                        Peter.

                                 PETER
                        What?

                                 KIRSA
                        Thank you for being on my team. 
                        You're the best.

           He can't help but smile. Kisses her.

                                 PETER
                        Actually, you're the best. 
                        Scientifically. As you know, I 
                        studied bestology in college.

                                 KIRSA
                        I'm going to have to disagree. I 
                        have a PHD in bestology. From CERN. 

                                 PETER
                        CERN? That lab with black holes?

                                 KIRSA
                        Yep. That one.

           A VOLUNTEER brushes by them and pops them out of their 
           bubble. Kirsa sees all Volunteer are taking their places at 
           the edges of the room, their backs to the wall.
           Other people have noticed the change too. Conversations hush 
           down. An excited, nervous energy grips the room.

           Peter gets it's his time to leave. A quick kiss, and he walks 
           away to the other end of the room.

           Kirsa sits down, watches him go.

           Something BANGS behind her and makes Kirsa JUMP in her seat--

           It’s the DOUBLE DOORS. They're closed now. The Tall Volunteer 
           stands before them. He puts a KEY into the lock and turns it. 
           The doors lock with a heavy CLICK.

           He pockets the key and sits down behind his desk.

           Kirsa looks at the closed, and now locked, doors.

                                 AIDEN (O.S.)
                        Why the fuck are you here?

           She sees the MAN on the stage, AIDEN CAUL. He’s big with 
           broad shoulders, dressed all in black. He might be in his 
           50’s or maybe older, but there is a ferocity to him that 
           makes you believe he can kill a bear with his bare hands.

           He stomps around the platform, his eyes on the audience.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Come on, boys and girls. You can do 
                        it. I believe in you.
                             (shouting louder)
                        I said, WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU HERE!?

           After a long beat, A YOUNG WOMAN with a SHAVED HEAD 
           enthusiastically raises her hand. Aiden points at her.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Why are you here?

                                 SHAVED HEAD
                        Enlightenment!

                                 AIDEN
                        Enlightenment.
                             (walking to her)
                        What's your name?

                                 SHAVED HEAD
                        Aspen.

                                 AIDEN
                        Aspen. What does that mean? 
                        Enlightenment.
           Shaved Head nervously smiles under his intense gaze.

                                 ASPEN
                        Finding our center in the world 
                        and, like, empower ourselves 
                        through that knowledge. And live in 
                        gratitude and fulfillment.

           Aiden waits for a beat. Then turns to those around her.

                                 AIDEN
                        Anyone understand any of that crap?

           The leading question gets no response from the crowd.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Me neither. Sit down.

                                 ASPEN
                        I’m sorry, I can clarify--

                                 AIDEN
                        What the fuck do you want, a medal? 
                        Sit down.

                                 ASPEN
                        No but I can, I know what--

                                 Aiden
                        SIT THE FUCK DOWN!!!

           Aspen sinks into her chair, scared.

           Nothing moves for a long beat.

           Then someone in the crowd SIGHS.

           Kirsa knows that pronounced sigh. It’s Peter.

           Aiden’s head snaps to Peter.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        You have something to say? What’s 
                        your name?

           Kirsa tenses, her eyes on Peter.

                                 PETER
                        It’s on my name-tag

           Aiden leans over Peter and RIPS away his name-tag. Crumples 
           it and drops it to the ground.
                                 AIDEN
                        I don’t see a name tag.

                                 PETER
                             (annoyed, not intimidated)
                        Why are you so rude, man?

                                 AIDEN
                        Because I have to be. Because if 
                        I’m nice, you will go back to your 
                        nice, dead life. I only have THREE 
                        DAYS to resuscitate your aliveness. 
                        THREE DAYS to TRANSFORM your ENTIRE 
                        FUCKING LIFE and this is the ONLY 
                        WAY I know how.

           He disengages from Peter, starts stalking through the room.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        If it makes you feel more 
                        comfortable, I don’t like shouting 
                        at you. But I do it because
                             (even LOUDER)
                        YOUR! FUCKING! LIVES! ARE AT STAKE!

           He stomps back to Peter.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        What is your name?

           Peter sighs again, but sees Kirsa glancing at him.

                                 PETER
                             (relenting)
                        Peter.

                                 AIDEN
                        Why the fuck you are here, Peter?

                                 PETER
                             (not sure, guessing)
                        Transformation...?

                                 AIDEN
                        Transformation into what?

                                 PETER
                        I don’t know, man.
                             (can’t help himself)
                        Into one of those wonderful 
                        volunteers you got back there?

           A few people snicker at that. Kirsa shakes her head, not 
           pleased. Aiden is stonefaced.
                                 AIDEN
                        I’ve been leading classes for seven 
                        years, Peter. One thing never 
                        changes: Class clowns turn out to 
                        be the saddest people in the room.

           Peter doesn’t know how to reply to that. It shuts him up.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                             (to the room)
                        What’s the difference between a 
                        caterpillar and a butterfly?

           Nobody answers. Not after what happened to those who did.

           Kirsa tightens in her seat. Aiden is coming her way.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. My bad. It’s a big room, 
                        I should speak up.
                             (SHOUTING)
                        WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A 
                        CATERPILLAR AND A BUTTERFLY?!

           Aiden locks eyes with Kirsa. Kirsa looks away, but it's too 
           late. He looms over her.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        What’s your name?

                                 KIRSA
                        Kirsa.

                                 AIDEN
                        Kirsa. What is the difference 
                        between a caterpillar and a 
                        butterfly?

           Kirsa takes a long beat.

                                 KIRSA
                        They're the same thing but 
                        transformed.

                                 AIDEN
                        Go on.

                                 KIRSA
                             (after another beat)
                        The caterpillar doesn't become a 
                        different thing when it's a 
                        butterfly. It's still what it is. 
                        More beautiful, but still the same.
                                 AIDEN
                        Yes. Good. Very good.
                             (to the crowd)
                        Transformation doesn't mean you 
                        will become a different person. It 
                        means you will become more You.
                             (eyes pointing at Kirsa)
                        Did you see that? She didn't spew 
                        out a buzzword. She dug deeper.
                             (singling her out)
                        Thank you, Kirsa.

           She nods back politely, pleased she aced the question. People 
           around her lean in to check out who she is.

           Aiden takes a moment. Starts shouting again:

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        To turn into a butterfly, the 
                        caterpillar disintegrates into a 
                        soup of its own organs! Then it 
                        EATS ITSELF to transform into a 
                        butterfly. It's disgusting but it's 
                        the only fucking way.

           He paces towards the platform, maintaining intense eye 
           contact with those near him.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        You think I’ve been rude? Harsh? 
                        That’s nothing. You will hate me in 
                        the next three days. I will hurt 
                        you. I will psychically bleed you. 
                        I will make you piss your pants, I 
                        will make you vomit. Your entire 
                        being will resist, you will want to 
                        run out of here, you will want to 
                        slug me. Memories you’ve been 
                        repressing for decades will come 
                        out and the pain will be so fucking 
                        bad you will understand why you've 
                        repressed them in the first place.

           Kirsa holds his gaze. Takes that in.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        But when we're done... You will all 
                        be butterflies.

           There is genuine wonder on his face when he says that. Almost 
           as if he's... sexually turned on.

           He climbs to the platform. Looks over everyone. Intimate.
                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                             (lighter)
                        You're probably thinking... Jesus 
                        Christ. This shit sounds intense. 
                        What did I get myself into?

           That draws a wave of smiles. Some laughs.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Folks, ninety-nine percent of 
                        people who attend this class report 
                        they experienced a profound and 
                        lasting difference in the quality 
                        of their lives. It’s not magic, 
                        it’s technology and this technology 
                        works. I have experienced it, 
                        whoever recommended this class to 
                        you has experienced it. You will 
                        experience it.

           He starts pacing around, pumping everyone up. Kirsa can feel 
           the energy of the room change. People like this Aiden.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Give me three days. It’s a fucking 
                        weekend for a permanent shift in 
                        your life. It’s the best investment 
                        you will ever make. All I’m asking 
                        from you is to do it how it’s 
                        supposed to be done. To commit to 
                        it with your entire body and mind 
                        and being. Are you open to that? 
                        Are you going to do it?
                             (pumping them up)
                        Do you believe in the possibility 
                        of a better life? A more truthful 
                        life? If you’re willing to full-on 
                        commit to that life, raise your 
                        hand right fucking now!

           One by one, everyone’s hands go up. Kirsa raises her hand 
           too, more out of obligation than anything.

           She looks at Peter. His hands are on his lap.

           She sees Aiden scanning the crowd. He sees Peter -- the only 
           one who doesn’t have his hand up -- and walks towards him.

           Her eyes catch Peter’s. They bore into him. Do it.

           He gives out a long sigh, then raises his hand.

           Aiden glares at Peter anyway... but then turns to the crowd.
                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Well done. I'm proud of you.
                             (beat)
                        It’s time for a quick break. I 
                        encourage you to talk with our 
                        volunteers and learn about their 
                        transformations.

           It feels weird to have him stop talking. Nobody moves.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                             (lighter)
                        I’d get up if I were you. You’re 
                        not going to have many of these.

           He’s charming again. Some people laugh.

           Kirsa stands up, looking for Peter, but Peter is not where he 
           was sitting a moment ago.

                                 MATERNAL VOLUNTEER (O.S.)
                        Kirsa! How are you?

           Kirsa smiles at her but she's still looking for Peter.

                                 KIRSA
                        Good. That was great. How are you?

                                 MATERNAL VOLUNTEER
                        I’m truthful and grateful to share 
                        this experience with you.

           Kirsa nods a few times at that, not sure where to take the 
           conversation... but she sees Peter.

           He’s at the far corner of the room, talking to a particularly 
           ATTRACTIVE VOLUNTEER in her late-twenties.

           The Attractive Volunteer LAUGHS at something Peter said.

           Something in Kirsa stirs.

                                 KIRSA
                        Excuse me. I’ll be back.

           She beelines towards Peter...

           ACROSS THE ROOM

           Kirsa hears them as she gets near:

                                 PETER
                        Is The Process for-profit? Yes or 
                        no? Simple question.
                                 ATTRACTIVE VOLUNTEER
                        It is, but none of the leaders are 
                        in it for the money. Most of them 
                        took huge pay cuts from their old 
                        jobs to come work with us.

                                 PETER
                        I’m gonna go ahead and silently nod 
                        at that but I don’t know if it's 
                        gonna be a truthful nod.

           Attractive Volunteer chuckles at that.

           Kirsa notices she’s even better looking up close: Her skin is 
           porcelain, her face is perfectly symmetrical. Her coiled 
           snake earrings and short hair give her an alternative look 
           that matches Peter’s. They could easily be a couple. Hell, 
           they look more like a couple than Kirsa and Peter.

           She notices Kirsa. Sparks up. Aggressively happy.

                                 ATTRACTIVE VOLUNTEER
                        Kirsa, I’m Maya! I’ve been wanting 
                        to talk to you.

                                 KIRSA
                        Any particular reason why?

                                 MAYA
                        Arthur told me you were coming.

           Kirsa's body language changes at the mention of Arthur.

                                 KIRSA
                        How do you know Arthur?

                                 MAYA
                        We’re doing AW together!

                                 KIRSA
                        AW?

                                 MAYA
                        Advanced Wisdom. It’s a third-tier 
                        leadership course. We’re training 
                        to be a course leader. Like Aiden.

                                 KIRSA
                        That’s great. Congratulations.
                             (re: Peter)
                        I hope he’s not giving you too much 
                        trouble. He likes being a rebel.
                                 MAYA
                        I don’t mind it at all, I was the 
                        rebel in my intro course.

           She smiles, broad. As if to say: "And look where I am now."

                                 PETER
                        Well, fingers crossed.

           Maya chuckles again. Either genuinely charmed by Peter or 
           acting charmed to sell him on the program, Kirsa can't tell.

                                 AIDEN (O.S.)
                        Everyone back to your seats!

           Aiden is up at the platform again. Ready to command.

           People start shuffling back. Kirsa mouths a quick "I love 
           you" to Peter. He returns the gesture.

           Maya steps up to Kirsa. Too close.

                                 MAYA
                        I’ll be here the entire weekend.
                        Let me know if you need anything.

           Her tone is comforting. But Kirsa is not comforted.

           Kirsa walks back to her seat, at the other end. She glances 
           back and sees Maya escorting Peter to his seat.

           INT. MULTIPURPOSE ROOM

           The lights have been dimmed.

           Everyone has their eyes closed. Aiden is on the platform, 
           sitting in a chair.

           From the way people are concentrating, we can tell they’ve 
           been at this for a while. He’s mid-sentence:

                                 AIDEN
                        ... then you land and you’re home.

           His voice is low. Hypnotic.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        It's the house you grew up in. It 
                        feels almost sacred. Even if it was 
                        a bad place sometimes, this is 
                        where you learned happiness. Find 
                        that happiness. Stay there.

           Kirsa has her head hung, eyes closed.
                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        You’re safe. Visualize the child 
                        you were. A happy child. Hopeful. 
                        This is before the time you knew 
                        you could be harmed.

           Aiden stands up. Slowly starts pacing.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        From a time when all hopes and 
                        dreams were possible.
                             (long beat)
                        I want you to ask yourself one 
                        question: Am I happier now, as an 
                        adult, or was I happier as a child?

           He descends from the platform.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        You know the answer. You knew 
                        before you asked it. It's in your 
                        gut. It used to be better. And that 
                        child... That child is disappointed 
                        in who you have become. You've lost 
                        something, haven't you? And you are 
                        not okay anymore. Not like you 
                        were. You’re a goddamn mess.

           Now this voice morphs into something cruel. It gradually gets 
           higher in volume until he’s full on shouting.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Look at that child. You had so much 
                        promise. But you turned out to be a 
                        DISAPPOINTMENT. You FAILED 
                        yourself! You gave up on yourself! 
                        You LET YOURSELF DIE!

           A man to Kirsa’s right cracks, starts sobbing. More people 
           start crying. Whimpering like children.

           Kirsa opens her eyes, weirded out. Not willing to go with it, 
           but keeping her head down, weathering it out.

           Aiden is now shouting at the top of his lungs.
                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        WHY? Because you got HURT and 
                        instead of DEALING WITH IT you 
                        started AVOIDING and LYING and that 
                        stuck, and that’s why YOU AVOID 
                        BEING TRUTHFUL AND LIE and you SAY 
                        IT’S OKAY when you feel like YOU’RE 
                        IN SO MUCH PAIN YOU WANT TO JUST 
                        FUCKING DISAPPEAR, but that CHILD 
                        knows and you KNOW and YOU CAN’T 
                        AVOID IT ANYMORE! YOU KNOW!

           More people are crying. Ugly, guttural crying. It’s a 
           cacophony of raw pain.

           Kirsa is absolutely still. Her heart is beating fast. A sick 
           anxiety blossoming in her chest.

           Aiden climbs onto the platform and CLAPS his hands.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Open your eyes. Look at me.

           Kirsa lifts her head, looks around. People wipe their eyes 
           and noses, red-faced. 

           Kirsa glances over at Peter, who looks dazed.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        I SAID LOOK AT ME.

           He points to someone in the back.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Stand up.

           Kirsa, and everyone else, turn to find a woman in her 40’s, a 
           SOCIALITE type, who is still sobbing, make-up running.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Why does your life not work?

                                 SOCIALITE WOMAN
                        ... I don’t know.

                                 AIDEN
                        You know. You fucking know.

           She starts breaking down.

                                 SOCIALITE WOMAN
                        I don’t know if I love my husband.
           She starts crying. Vocalizing the words gave them weight she 
           couldn’t carry. Aiden looks at her, emphatic.

                                 AIDEN
                        We’ll figure it out together, okay?

           She nods back, her hands intertwined across her chest as if 
           in a prayer. Sits down.

           He walks up to a big chalkboard at the front of the room, and 
           starts writing on it: “PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS”

           He points to a devastated OFFICE DRONE in an ironed white 
           shirt sitting in front of Kirsa. He stands up.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Why does your life not work?

           A long beat. Then he spits the words out all at once.

                                 OFFICE DRONE
                        I see prostitutes and I’m going to 
                        stop but I can’t and my wife 
                        doesn’t know. I have to stop.

           He looks at the people around him, feels ashamed. Sits down 
           and starts rocking back and forth in his chair.

                                 AIDEN
                             (softly, comforting)
                        We will fix that. Trust me.

           The Office Drone stops rocking and looks up at Aiden. Nods, 
           wanting to believe Aiden so desperately.

           Aiden goes to the chalkboard and writes down: “ADDICTION.”

           Kirsa leans forward and looks towards Peter. His eyes are on 
           Aiden, listening intently, one with the crowd--

                                 AIDEN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Kirsa. Why does your life not work?

           She snaps to Aiden. All eyes snap to her.

           She stands up after a beat. Tries her best.

                                 KIRSA
                        ... I have a fear of failure.

                                 AIDEN
                        Go on.
                                 KIRSA
                        I can take more responsibility at 
                        my work. I practice family law at 
                        large firm and I want to make 
                        partner but... But I always hold 
                        myself back for some reason.

           Aiden walks to the edge of the platform, staring her down. 
           Obviously dissatisfied with her composed answer.

                                 AIDEN
                        Go on.

                                 KIRSA
                        That's... that's it.

                                 AIDEN
                        Kirsa. Did you do the exercise?

                                 KIRSA
                        Yes.

                                 AIDEN
                        It didn’t work for you?

                                 KIRSA
                        It did.

                                 AIDEN
                        Kirsa, everyone in this room can 
                        tell you’re not being truthful.
                             (giving her an out)
                        Because sometimes it doesn’t work.

           A beat. Kirsa decides to take it.

                                 KIRSA
                        I couldn’t quite get into it. Not 
                        because of the exercise itself--

                                 AIDEN
                        You were open to it? You committed?
                             (Kirsa nods)
                        Then you don’t have to elaborate.

                                 KIRSA
                             (relieved)
                        Thank you.

                                 AIDEN
                        As I said before, this course 
                        doesn’t work for one person out of 
                        a hundred. You must be that person 
                        in this room.

                             (to the Tall Volunteer)
                        Give her a full refund, please.

           She's paralyzed for a beat.

                                 KIRSA
                        I don’t want to leave.

                                 AIDEN
                        If this simple visualization 
                        exercise didn’t work for you, I 
                        don’t think you’re going to get 
                        much out of the rest of the course.

                                 KIRSA
                        I’ve been getting a lot out of it.

                                 AIDEN
                             (final)
                        Trust me, Kirsa. You should leave, 
                        there’s no use wasting either of 
                        our time. I wish you the best.

           The Tall Volunteer stands up. Waiting for Kirsa.

           Kirsa stammers, not sure what to do. Peter looking at her. 
           Maya at the corner of her eye, observing her.

                                 KIRSA
                        I will commit. Let me stay.

           Aiden takes a long look at her.

                                 AIDEN
                        Suit yourself. I’m not going to 
                        have you dragged out. But don’t 
                        blame me or the Process if the next 
                        two days are torture to you. I 
                        warned you. You ignored it.

           Without even waiting for her to sit down, Aiden points at 
           someone new as if their conversation never happened:

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        You. Why does your life not work?

           Kirsa slowly sits back down. Admonished. A little humiliated.

           INT. MULTIPURPOSE ROOM - LATER

           People are exhausted. Kirsa too.

           An older man sits down.
           Aiden writes something new onto the chalkboard: “SELF DOUBT”. 
           It's been filled up to the edges: "EGO," "RAGE," "TRAUMA," 
           and more. He can hardly scribble the new one in.

           Aiden points to Peter, the last one to go.

                                 AIDEN
                        Peter.
                             (beat)
                        I did not forget about you. Tell 
                        us. Why does your life not work?

           Peter stands up. A beat. Kirsa watches him.

                                 PETER
                        Drugs.

           He sits back down. Aiden takes a beat.

                                 AIDEN
                        Are you in recovery?

           Peter nods "yes" without standing up. Aiden knows he's 
           getting as much as he's going to get out of him.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Well... That's progress.

           Aiden underlines "Addiction." 

           He stands back, looks at the board.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                             (to everyone)
                        And to think before you came here, 
                        you all thought you were doing 
                        good. What a bunch of fuck-ups you 
                        all turned out to be.

           People around Kirsa smile. It’s cathartic. Above all, Aiden 
           is saying: You’re not alone.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to let you go to bed now.
                        BUT, before you sleep, I want you 
                        to do some simple homework: There’s 
                        going to be a piece of paper in 
                        your rooms. On the left side of 
                        that paper, I want you to write the 
                        first words you have spoken in this 
                        life.
                                 (MORE)
                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Then draw a line to the right side 
                        of the page and write down the last 
                        words you think you will speak 
                        before you die if you keep living 
                        the way you've been living. If you 
                        don’t solve these problems you got. 
                        Do not be a fucking coward. Be 
                        truthful. If it’s not hard, if it’s 
                        not uncomfortable, that’s how you 
                        know you’re lying.
                             (soothing, almost tender)
                        You owe it to yourself.

           Kirsa clocks the people around her nod, taking in the lesson. 
           She’s a bit creeped out by how in sync they are.

           The Tall Volunteer unlocks the doors and swings them wide 
           open. People stand up, file out.

                                 CHIRPY VOLUNTEER (O.S.)
                             (directing people)
                        If you're A to L, please come with 
                        me. If you're M to Z...

           He keeps talking as Kirsa looks around for Peter.

           She catches Aiden’s eyes. He is standing on the platform, 
           strangely motionless, looking straight at her.

           She looks away and blends into the crowd, escaping.

           INT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT

           A crowd surrounds Kirsa. Together, they march down the dark 
           nondescript corridors, following the volunteers.

           No windows, clocks or mirrors.

           She’s looking for Peter in the crowd.

           He comes up behind her.

                                 PETER
                        Hey, beautiful.

           She hugs him. Kisses him.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Everything copacetic?

           She leans against him as the answer to that.
                                 KIRSA
                             (venting)
                        I feel like I’m being punished 
                        because my life works. Excuse me 
                        for loving my husband and not 
                        sleeping with prostitutes.
                             (whispering to him)
                        And it is a little too cult-y.

                                 PETER
                        Eh.
                             (she’s surprised by that)
                        It is intense but it’s basically AA 
                        for sober people.

                                 KIRSA
                        Do they mass hypnotize you in AA?

                                 PETER
                        No. But, you know, some people need 
                        that shit.

                                 KIRSA
                        What people? People who sleep with 
                        prostitutes?

           That was too loud. She slinks a bit, checks to see if anyone 
           heard her. They haven't.

                                 PETER
                        When you're in that kind of haze, 
                        sometimes you need someone to knock 
                        you down to see which side is up.

                                 KIRSA
                             (whispering)
                        What they need is therapy, not an 
                        unqualified autocratic dictator 
                        screaming at them for hours.

                                 PETER
                        I don't know, man... He's obviously 
                        trained in some way. Plus, the 
                        people in the program who helped me 
                        the most are not therapists. I'd be 
                        surprised if they even graduated 
                        from high school, you know?

           She looks up at him, a little on edge.

                                 KIRSA
                        So anyone can tell you what to do 
                        and you'll just do it?
                                 PETER
                        I should apparently, if it's you 
                        doing the telling.

           She slides out under his arm.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Look, all I'm saying is that it 
                        might be good for some people. 
                        Maybe not for us but, I mean, Trent 
                        fucking Reznor did this thing and 
                        loved it. If a stone cold genius 
                        benefited from it, you know...

                                 KIRSA
                        Did Maya tell you that?

                                 PETER
                        What?

                                 KIRSA
                        You were talking. I assumed.

                                 PETER
                        I read it on the little pamphlet 
                        thing. What are you saying?

                                 KIRSA
                        Nothing. Just...

           She goes quiet, embarrassed by her insecurity. 

           He stops her. Looks at her. They wait for the crowd to 
           continue marching, leaving them with some privacy.

                                 PETER
                        I'm telling you, we can still 
                        totally bolt if you want. I'm still 
                        on your team.

           She takes it in with a small smile. He perks up at that.

           They start walking again, catching up to the crowd.

                                 KIRSA
                        No. I need to stay. Last thing I 
                        need is this asshole telling Arthur 
                        I'm a lost cause.

                                 PETER
                        Cool. Well. Let me know if I can 
                        improve your stay. Wink-wink.

           He rubs her back suggestively and wiggles his eyebrows.
           Silly but also adorable. Makes her crack up.

                                 KIRSA
                        I need to finish the “homework” 
                        first. But then...

           She gives him an impish smile.

                                 PETER
                        Wow. You brought the...?
                             (she nods)
                        Groovy.

           Their bliss is invaded by the Tall Volunteer.

                                 TALL VOLUNTEER
                             (pointing to a door)
                        This is your room.

                                 KIRSA
                        Do I get a key or...?

                                 TALL VOLUNTEER
                        No.

           She opens the door, it’s unlocked. Peter follows her in.

                                 TALL VOLUNTEER (CONT’D)
                             (to Peter)
                        Your room is down the hall.

                                 PETER
                        We’re staying together.

                                 TALL VOLUNTEER
                        All rooms are singles.

                                 KIRSA
                             (getting frustrated)
                        We’ll figure out a way to share the 
                        bed. Thank you.

           The Tall Volunteer steps towards Kirsa, cranes his neck down. 

                                 TALL VOLUNTEER
                        Your homework requires solitude.

                                 KIRSA
                             (not backing down)
                        We'll put on headphones.

           It's suddenly tense. Peter sees it.
                                 PETER
                        Maybe he’s got a point.

                                 KIRSA
                        What?

                                 PETER
                        I mean, we’re doing this thing, 
                        might as well do it full on.

                                 KIRSA
                        “Full on”?

                                 PETER
                        When in Rome... We're here, let’s 
                        see if we can get something out of 
                        it, you know?

           Kirsa can’t believe her ears.

                                 TALL VOLUNTEER
                             (approving)
                        Peter, this way to your room.

           Peter hugs her goodbye, whispers into her ear:

                                 PETER
                        Just play along. I’ll see you in 
                        your room in an hour.

           He gives her a quick wiggle of the eyebrows. She's overcome 
           with relief. She smiles.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Good night.

                                 KIRSA
                        Good night.

           Kirsa watches as Peter is marched down to a room at the end 
           of the corridor by the Tall Volunteer.

           Despite Peter's assurances, she still seems unsettled.

           INT. WOMEN’S BATHROOM

           It’s cramped. She goes for the sink. Washes her face.

           Realizes there are no mirrors on the walls.

                                 OLDER WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Each of us paid six hundred 
                        dollars. Is a bathroom with mirrors 
                        too much to ask?
           Kirsa raises her head and sees the Older Woman, in her late 
           60’s, fashionable, putting moisturizer on her face.

           Aspen, the woman with a shaved head from earlier, chimes in.

                                 ASPEN
                        I know, right? It’s like Orange is 
                        the New Black in here.

           The conversation is a breath of fresh air to Kirsa.

                                 KIRSA
                        It’s worse. The warden on that show 
                        is nicer than what we got.

           The other women chuckle, agreeing.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        I’m Kirsa. You may remember me from 
                        out there. Public Enemy #1.

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                             (amused)
                        Lori.

                                 ASPEN
                        I'm Aspen. I think I'm on his shit 
                        list too.

           Off Kirsa, happy to have made some allies.

           INT. KIRSA’S ROOM - MAYBE DAY, MAYBE NIGHT

           Kirsa enters in.

           The room has no windows. It’s cramped. It wasn’t meant to be 
           lived in, it was an office space once. Feels like a cell.

           She sits down. Takes in her surroundings.

           On a desk is the blank piece of paper Aiden mentioned and a 
           pen that sits next to it.

           She takes it... draws the line.

           She has no idea what to write down.

           INT. KIRSA’S ROOM - LATER

           She has scribbled down a dozen things ("I wish I was more 
           truthful." "I love my husband too much?" "Go fornicate with 
           thy bottom, you quack.") but they're all scratched out.

           She pushes away from the desk, frustrated. Looks at the door.
           Wondering where Peter is.

           She grins. Has an idea. Walks to her suitcase.

           EXT. CORRIDORS

           Kirsa slinks out of her room. She waits. Listens.

           It’s pitch dark and silent. Not a soul.

           She’s wearing a dark nightgown and BLACK HEELS.

           She takes a few steps but the heels make too much noise. She 
           takes them off and holds them instead.

           She reaches Peter's door. Puts the heels back on.

           Takes a deep breath, ready to make a blazing entrance--

           When the door abruptly opens and Maya steps out.

                                 MAYA
                        Kirsa! Are you here to see, Peter?

           She scans Kirsa. Notices her heels.

                                 KIRSA
                             (thrown)
                        ... I was going to, yes.

                                 MAYA
                        I’m sorry, he can’t right now. He’s 
                        meditating on the homework.
                             (before Kirsa can ask)
                        I’m helping him out with it.

           Something about Maya’s demeanor makes Kirsa want to grab her 
           by the throat, but she takes a beat. Adjusts her tone.

                                 KIRSA
                        Helping him out how?

                                 MAYA
                        Getting him to be open to the 
                        possibilities of transformation.

                                 KIRSA
                        He asked for your help?

                                 MAYA
                        No. But I needed it when I did my 
                        intro course. He needs it too.
                             (before Kirsa can reply)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAYA (CONT’D)
                        Are you done with your own 
                        homework?

                                 KIRSA
                        ... I’m working on it.

                                 MAYA
                        You should go back to your room, 
                        then. You shouldn’t be out here.

           She delivers that with a friendly smile but it has the tinges 
           of a warning.

                                 MAYA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and Aiden is hard on everyone. 
                        He told Arthur to leave in our 
                        first day too. It was demoralizing 
                        for him back then but we laugh 
                        about it now.

           Is she being genuinely supportive? Is she invoking Arthur’s 
           name to make Kirsa comply? Kirsa can't figure it out.

           She turns away and starts walking back to her room. Her heels 
           hitting the ground, echoing in the silence. 

           She glances back and sees Maya by Peter’s door, watching 
           Kirsa. The contours of her body visible in the darkness like 
           a ghost. She whispers, trying to not wake anyone up but it’s 
           unquestionably eerie:

                                 MAYA (CONT’D)
                        Good night, Kirsa.

           Kirsa reaches her room and gets in.

           INT. KIRSA’S ROOM

           She shuts the door. Composes herself.

           Takes off her heels.

           INT. KIRSA’S ROOM - LATER

           On her desk is a clean piece of paper with one line: "I wish 
           I was more open to guidance."

           Kirsa stands by the desk, removing her makeup. She's in PJ's.

           She checks the door. The lock doesn’t turn, the door is 
           permanently unlocked. No privacy.

           From her luggage, she takes out a MOUTH GUARD and a SLEEPING 
           MASK. She lies down on the bed.
           She starts to breathe in a particular pattern: Inhales for 
           four seconds, holds her breath for seven seconds, then 
           exhales for eight seconds.

           Falling asleep is a challenge to her, an ordeal...

           But she's doing it... drifting off...

           AND SOMEONE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR, THREE TIMES like the start of 
           a fucking SWAT raid and the door is swung open.

                                 CHIRPY VOLUNTEER
                        Wake up everyone! WAKEY-WAKEY!

           Kirsa jumps from the bed. Takes off her mask. How long did 
           she sleep? Did she sleep at all?

           She can hear all the Volunteers going down the corridor, 
           BANGING on doors and SHOUTING.

                                 MATERNAL VOLUNTEER (O.S.)
                        It's TIME! Wake up!

           Kirsa straightens up in bed. Groggy.

           She steps out. Gently closes the door, trying to reclaim some 
           semblance of privacy.

           She goes to her roller bag near the bed. Zips it open.

           Inside are some clothes and other travel things. But she goes 
           straight for a little pocket inside the lid.

           She freezes. There’s nothing there under the nets.

           She takes a beat as panic coils through her.

           She palms the other pockets of the bag. Then rifles through 
           the clothes. Whatever she’s looking for is obviously fucking 
           vital. And it’s not there.

           Her heartbeat raises, she reflexively checks it, then 
           immediately regrets it. It's POUNDING.

           She charges out of the room.

           INT. CORRIDORS

           It’s still dark. People are waking up, mumbling. It looks 
           like someone pulled the fire alarm at a hotel.

           And then there’s Kirsa, exploding out of the room, more 
           animated than we’ve ever seen her.
           She goes to the first person she sees in a Volunteer’s 
           uniform who ends up being... Maya.

                                 MAYA
                             (brightens up)
                        Kirsa!

                                 KIRSA
                        There are things missing from my 
                        roller bag.

                                 MAYA
                        Oh, I’m so sorry to hear that. 
                        What’s missing?

                                 KIRSA
                             (she doesn't want to say)
                        Where is Peter?

                                 MAYA
                        He already went down. He wanted to 
                        get a head start on his 
                        transformation.

           A beat.

                                 KIRSA
                        Do you people go through our bags?

                                 MAYA
                        Well, there’s a security check. 
                        Some people try to sneak in phones. 
                        But I assure you--

                                 KIRSA
                        It’s not a goddamn phone.

                                 MAYA
                        Okay. But... What is it? I can’t 
                        help you unless you tell me.

           It pains Kirsa to admit her weakness. Especially to her. But 
           she’s desperate, she has to.

                                 KIRSA
                        My Paxil.

                                 MAYA
                        Is that some kind of medication?

                                 KIRSA
                        For anxiety.
                                 MAYA
                        Oh. Mind-altering substances are 
                        not allowed during the Process.

                                 KIRSA
                        It’s medicine, not LSD.

           Maya cocks her head a little. “If you say so.” Not 
           contradicting Kirsa but also not giving her anything.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        Did they take my pills from my 
                        suitcase? Because I need them.
                             (dreading to say it)
                        Paxil withdrawals are... bad. Even 
                        if I miss a single day. I have a 
                        strict regimen, I take a pill first 
                        thing in the morning which means I 
                        haven’t taken it in a...
                             (realizes the severity)
                        What time is it?

                                 MAYA
                        It’s the beginning of the second 
                        session.

                                 KIRSA
                        This is serious. What’s the time? I 
                        need to know how long it’s been 
                        since I’ve taken my last pill.

           Maya takes a beat. Smiles. No menace in her voice.

                                 MAYA
                        I’ll look into it for you, I 
                        promise.

           With that, she starts walking away, attending to others.

           Kirsa squeezes her knuckles white.

           INT. THE MULTIPURPOSE ROOM

           The lights above have been dimmed for today. More intimate.

           A desk nearby has a bunch of plastic cups filled with what 
           looks like a green smoothie.

           Kirsa comes in. She is approached by the Maternal Volunteer 
           who hands Kirsa a cup of the drink.

                                 MATERNAL VOLUNTEER
                        Breakfast! Try it, it's yummy.
           Kirsa takes it with a silent nod. She's about to walk away--

                                 MATERNAL VOLUNTEER (CONT’D)
                        Kirsa, sweetie, I want to talk to 
                        you about a possibility.

           She launches into an obviously rehearsed sales pitch.

                                 MATERNAL VOLUNTEER (CONT’D)
                        Some spots opened up in next week's 
                        advanced transformation classes and 
                        if you sign up right now, you can 
                        get twenty percent off. I've done 
                        those classes and trust me, this 
                        deal is a steal!

           Kirsa sees that the other smiling Volunteers are giving the 
           same pitch to the tired people streaming in.

                                 KIRSA
                             (trying to get away)
                        I'll think about it.

           Maternal Volunteer's smile fades for a second but then comes 
           back with a vengeance.

                                 MATERNAL VOLUNTEER
                        If you wait, the spots might fill 
                        and you might miss what could be 
                        the best experience of your life!

                                 KIRSA
                             (getting frustrated)
                        Thank you, maybe later.

           A sudden manic desperation takes over the Maternal Volunteer.

                                 MATERNAL VOLUNTEER
                        Dear, why do you think you're 
                        resisting? What do you think is 
                        stopping you from committing full 
                        on to your transformation?

                                 KIRSA
                             (finally snapping)
                        I don't know. My brain?!
                             (walking away)
                        Excuse me.

           The Maternal Volunteer steps back, whispers something under 
           her breath at Kirsa, perhaps a curse, and latches onto the 
           next tired, defenseless person coming into the room.
           Kirsa finds Peter in the chair he was sitting yesterday. Bags 
           under his eyes, he hasn't slept at all. He waves at her.

           Kirsa is about to beeline to him but the door CLOSES and 
           Aiden ascends to the platform, surveying his flock.

           People start taking their places. It's about to begin.

           Kirsa brightens when she sees an empty chair next to Lori and 
           Aspen. She walks towards them. 

           Lori is sipping from her “breakfast,” her face scrunched.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                             (sitting down)
                        How much would you pay for a 
                        Starbucks right now?

                                 LORI
                        My Lord. Do not tempt me.

                                 ASPEN
                        Oh no, I think we might be 
                        "transforming" into basic bitches.

           They share a laugh.

           INT. MULTIPURPOSE ROOM - LATER

           Lori looks down, wiping a tear, distraught.

           She's on the platform, sitting across Aiden.

           Kirsa is watching them. It's dead silent. Tense.

           Aiden holds up Lori's “last words” paper. His finger on the 
           line from the first words to the last.

                                 AIDEN
                        The thing is Lori, you’re much 
                        closer to this...
                             (the “last words”)
                        ...than to this.
                             (her “first words”)
                        I’m not saying that to hurt you, 
                        you know that. It’s just the truth.

           Lori forces a smile but she’s hit by that.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Time is a resource and you don’t 
                        have the resources to live 
                        unconsciously anymore.
                                 (MORE)
                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        You need to call your son and tell 
                        him the truth. You need to tell him 
                        you love him. If you still think 
                        that way about him being gay... 
                        Don’t talk about that. He’s your 
                        son. His sexuality is, what, a 
                        small part of him. He’s your 
                        fucking son. You love him more than 
                        anyone else can ever love him.

                                 LORI
                             (voice breaking)
                        I do. I do.

                                 AIDEN
                        Say it after me: It’s too late for 
                        me. I need to fucking live.

                                 LORI
                             (a hoarse whisper)
                        It’s too late for me. I need to... 
                        live.

           She starts to cry in the way only old people do.

           Kirsa shudders in her seat, uncomfortable.

                                 AIDEN
                        Lori. Lori?
                             (gently, charming)
                        Lori, that’s not what I said, was 
                        it? You missed a word there. Starts 
                        with F? I say it a lot?

           A gentle laughter rises from the audience around Kirsa.

           Lori breaks out a smile too.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        It’s fuck, Lori. You can say fuck. 
                        We’re all friends here.

           A supporting laughter from the crowd, some people clap to 
           show their support. They want Lori to do it.

           Kirsa sees Aspen, next to her, is clapping too. Into it.

                                 LORI
                        I need to...

                                 AIDEN
                             (starting over for her)
                        It’s too late for me...
                                 LORI
                        It’s too late for me. I need to...
                             (meek)
                        fucking live.

                                 AIDEN
                        Again.

                                 LORI
                        I said it!

                                 AIDEN
                        You gave birth to four children and 
                        you squeak like a mouse!? I don’t 
                        fucking buy it!

                                 LORI
                        It’s too late for me. I need to 
                        fucking live.

                                 AIDEN
                        Again!

                                 LORI
                        It’s too late for me--

                                 AIDEN
                        Shout it! Top of your lungs!

                                 LORI
                             (shouting)
                        It’s too late for me and--

                                 AIDEN
                        LOUDER!

                                 LORI
                        AND I NEED TO FUC--

                                 AIDEN
                        NO! FROM THE START!

                                 LORI
                        IT’S TOO LATE FOR ME--

                                 AIDEN
                        LOUDER! LOUDER!

                                 LORI
                        IT’S TOO LATE FOR ME AND I NEED TO 
                        FUCKING LIVE!

           The words echo in the room and she starts bawling.
                                 AIDEN
                             (lovingly)
                        Get up. Get up.

           She does and Aiden embraces her. Tears in his eyes.

           Thunderous applause rocks the room. Everyone gets up on their 
           feet. Kirsa follows suit out of obligation.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        See how strong she is, folks? 
                        Vulnerability is a strength. Don’t 
                        let anyone tell you otherwise.

           Two Volunteers come up and escort Lori back down the stairs.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        If you want to find Lori during the 
                        break or after the session and tell 
                        her how brave you think she is... 
                        you should. She deserves that.

           Lori nears her seat. Aspen gets up and gives her a hug.

                                 ASPEN
                        You’re very brave.

           Lori smiles through the tears. 

           Kirsa tries to smile at her but catches Lori looking back at 
           Aiden. He’s her God right now. 

           Kirsa looks around her. Everyone’s faces are shining with 
           that ecstasy. He’s all of their God.

                                 AIDEN
                        Alright, who’s next?
                             (pointing)
                        Peter. Yes, you. Come up. Everyone 
                        give him a hand, will you?

           Peter stands up, uncomfortable. Trudges up to the stage as 
           everyone applauds.

           Everyone except Kirsa.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Share with us, Peter.

           After a beat, Peter starts reading.
                                 PETER
                        My first word was: “Moose.” Or at 
                        least that’s what my mama used to 
                        say. I said moose before I said 
                        mom, and she was so mad. She never 
                        forgave me for it.

           A few people in the audience chuckle.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Last words... I wrote down: “Shit.”

                                 AIDEN
                        Poetic.

                                 PETER
                        I meditated on it a lot. I wasn’t 
                        being lazy. It felt right.

                                 AIDEN
                        Why “shit”?

                                 PETER
                        It’s ending, you know? There are 
                        things I still want to do but I 
                        don’t have the time.

                                 AIDEN
                        Why don’t you do them now?
                             (Peter seems confused)
                        The things you want to do, why 
                        don’t you do them now?

                                 PETER
                             (after a brief pause)
                        I am doing them, I just want to do 
                        more of--

                                 AIDEN
                        Why’d you pause?

                                 PETER
                        I considered your question, I 
                        didn’t pause--

                                 AIDEN
                        Peter. Everyone in the fucking room 
                        saw you pause before you answered.

           Peter shrugs. Avoiding it.
                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Fine, let’s do it your way: 
                        Everyone who saw him pause, raise 
                        your hands.

           Kirsa watches as everyone raises their hands. She doesn’t.

           Aiden scans the crowd, shows the result to Peter.

           Peter takes it in.

           Kirsa sees Aiden is looking straight at her. She now knows 
           she’s a player in this peculiar game.

           Aiden directs his attention back to Peter.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Do me a favor, Peter. Rate your 
                        life out of ten.

                                 PETER
                        Seven, eight. Decent.

                                 AIDEN
                        That’s not decent, Peter. That’s a 
                        B- if it’s an eight. C- if it’s a 
                        seven. That’s decent?

                                 PETER
                             (attempt at humour)
                        I sucked at school, man. C- would 
                        have made my mama thank God.

           He’s good at it, some people chuckle but Aiden rolls through.

                                 AIDEN
                        What’s missing? Why not a ten out 
                        of ten?

                                 PETER
                        Nobody is at a ten.

                                 AIDEN
                        You were never at a ten?

                                 PETER
                        When my son was born, maybe.

                                 AIDEN
                        Then it creeped down to seven?

                                 PETER
                        Don't say that like that's a weird 
                        thing. That's how life works.
                                 AIDEN
                        You're at a C- and you’re an expert 
                        on how life works?

           Now Peter is getting pissed off.

                                 PETER
                        Your life is a ten? A+? Being 
                        you’re the life expert and all?

                                 AIDEN
                        Of course it is.

                                 PETER
                             (fuck you)
                        Right. ‘Cause you’re the butterfly.

                                 AIDEN
                        Peter, how hard did your mother hit 
                        you when she beat you?

           All the air is sucked out of the room.

           Peter is thrown by the sudden pivot, he’s paralyzed.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        You talked about her twice. First 
                        time, she was getting mad at you 
                        for something beyond your control. 
                        Second time, you sounded relieved 
                        she wasn’t angry. Am I wrong?

                                 PETER
                        ...I don’t want to talk about that.

                                 AIDEN
                             (without missing a beat)
                        You have a son. Are you married?

                                 PETER
                        ... yeah.

                                 AIDEN
                        Rate your marriage for me.
                             (Peter is still paralyzed)
                        Is it “decent”? Six, seven. C-? C+?

                                 PETER
                             (barely a whisper, still 
                              thrown)
                        ... Ten.
                                 AIDEN
                        It was the conviction in your voice 
                        that really sold that.

           Peter straightens up. Looks at Kirsa, then back at Aiden.

                                 PETER
                        She’s the best goddamn thing that 
                        ever happened to me. Ten.

           If he’s lying, he’s great at it. He glances at Kirsa again 
           and she nods at him, steeling him up against Aiden.

                                 AIDEN
                             (changing tracks)
                        You’re a photographer.
                             (re: Peter's surprise)
                        I Googled you. I Google everyone, 
                        by the way. I do my homework, too.

                                 PETER
                        Yearbook photographer. I do high 
                        school yearbooks.

                                 AIDEN
                        That’s an important distinction?
                             (Peter shrugs)
                        It is. You’re not an artist.

           Peter shrugs again, and Aiden... laughs.

           It takes everyone by surprise, including Kirsa.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Here I am digging for some deep... 
                             (his voice trails off)
                        Peter, you’re just an average Joe 
                        who hates his fucking job.

                                 PETER
                        I don’t “hate” my jo--

                                 AIDEN
                        All who think Peter hates his job 
                        raise your hand.

           Again, everyone in the room raises their hands except Kirsa.

           The room has relaxed now with Aiden laughing. Even Peter 
           chuckles at the result.

           But Kirsa is getting pissed. Her hands rubbing against each 
           other, almost manic, cracking her fingers.
                                 PETER
                        What do you want me to say. It’s a 
                        job, man. You hate it sometimes--

                                 AIDEN
                        No. Stop resisting. You hate it all 
                        the goddamn time.
                             (Peter is silent)
                        Do you know why? Because it’s a 
                        betrayal of your being. You gave up 
                        on your calling.

                                 PETER
                        I didn’t give up anything. Don't 
                        make it sound dramatic. I just... 
                        wasn’t that good at it.

                                 AIDEN
                        Tell me what you mean by that.

                                 PETER
                        I mean not everyone gets to be... 
                        you know. Some people become 
                        craftsmen. No shame in that.

           Aiden takes a beat. Then looks at a Volunteer near the door.

           The Volunteer switches OFF the lights. A PROJECTOR whirls up.

           A white curtain rolls down behind them. Aiden and Peter 
           become silhouettes against it.

                                 AIDEN
                        I wasn’t going to start on false 
                        narratives until tonight but this 
                        is such a perfect example.

           Aiden stands up, back to lecture mode.

                                 Aiden (CONT’D)
                        What he said, that bullshit about 
                        some people becoming craftsmen... 
                        that’s his false narrative. That’s 
                        what he tells himself to make sure 
                        his dreams stay impossible and far 
                        away. Hurts less that way.

           He turns back to Peter.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        It’s the answer you have when you 
                        ask yourself why you gave up. Which 
                        you do. Every. Fucking. Day.
           Peter doesn’t answer.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Often, these false narratives don’t 
                        feel false. We think we have a firm 
                        grasp on the truth of who we are, 
                        but that’s not true. We are all 
                        unreliable narrators of our own 
                        lives.

           A few people around Kirsa have “a-ha” moments, they nod 
           meaningfully. Some even tear up in the intimate darkness.

           Behind Aiden and Peter, a PHOTOGRAPH lights up the room.

           It’s a younger PETER, looking straight at the camera. He has 
           dark STRINGS attached to his hands that go down to smaller 
           versions of him, controlling them like marionettes.

           It’s evocative. Warm colors, dark iconography. But Peter 
           sinks down into his seat, embarrassed.

                                 PETER
                        I thought I deleted this shit.

           Aiden stands up, looks at the photograph.

                                 AIDEN
                        You think this is bad?

                                 PETER
                        It's just empty and edgy. It's like 
                        My Chemical Romance in photographic 
                        form.
                             (waving at the Volunteer)
                        Seriously, can you turn it off?

           But more photographs appear behind them. All self-portraits 
           from the same series: Peter dosing a smaller version of 
           himself on fire. Peter ripping angel wings off of a smaller 
           version as if he’s plucking wings off of a fly.

                                 AIDEN
                        These are beautiful. Even you have 
                        to admit: these show great  
                        potential.

                                 PETER
                        Everything and everyone has 
                        potential. Potential doesn't mean 
                        shit if it doesn't become 
                        something.
                                 AIDEN
                        Why didn't it become something?

                                 PETER
                        I don't know, man. Life.

           He glances at Kirsa for a split second, then looks away.

           Kirsa stews in worried silence.

                                 AIDEN
                        Peter. You're not dead. Whatever 
                        you had, you still have it.

           Peter can’t help but look up at his past work. Dwarfed by the 
           life he left behind.

           Aiden turns to the crowd.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        "I wasn’t good at it," he says. "It 
                        doesn't mean shit" he says. He 
                        needs to be right. He needs to be 
                        shit. Otherwise it means he's 
                        responsible for his own hell.
                             (appealing to the crowd)
                        What do YOU say, folks? Is this guy 
                        talented or what?

           People start clapping. It starts slow but soon everyone is on 
           their feet and THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE is shaking the room.

           Peter is shocked. Not the reaction he expected at all.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        See the truth, Peter. Hear the 
                        truth. They’re not lying.

           He leans into Peter, as if he’s sharing a secret.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        The thing is, this isn’t only about 
                        your aliveness. Do you understand?

           Peter look up at him curiously.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Are you prepared for the day you’re 
                        going to have to tell your kid to 
                        give up on his dreams?

           And that just breaks Peter. He tears up.
                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        You know from personal experience 
                        that unhappy parents make unhappy 
                        children. Do you want to do that to 
                        your kid? Do you want him to have 
                        the kind of life you hate?

                                 PETER
                        ... no.

                                 AIDEN
                        Are you going to continue your C- 
                        life, Peter? Or do you want more?

                                 PETER
                        ... yes.

                                 AIDEN
                        Yes, what?

                                 PETER
                        Yes. I want more.

           Everyone starts CLAPPING like mad again. Standing up, showing 
           their utmost support for Peter and his transformation.

           Kirsa is still. What the fuck is happening to her husband?

                                 AIDEN
                        You want more, you have to take it.
                             (to a volunteer)
                        Let’s get this man a phone.

           Maya walks up and takes out her phone: a black smartphone 
           with ornate snake decorations at its edges.

           She gives it to Peter. On the phone's screen is a number, 
           ready to be dialed with a simple tap.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        I want you to call your work and do 
                        what needs to be done.

                                 PETER
                        What?

                                 AIDEN
                        You know what you have to do.

                                 PETER
                             (after a beat)
                        You want me to quit?
           Kirsa grips the sides of the chair. Her eyes boring into 
           Peter's but they don't look at her anymore.

           They look up at Aiden.

                                 AIDEN
                        I want you to wake the fuck up. I 
                        want you to commit to your 
                        transformation.

           Aiden leans even closer. His voice drops to an intimate 
           whisper, reverberating through the room.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                             (so fucking sincere)
                        You said your last word on this 
                        earth is going to be “shit”.

           Peter looks down at the phone in his hands.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Because you know you're wasting it.

           Peter’s eyes are drilling into the phone.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Tell me I’m wrong. Tell me “Aiden, 
                        you’re talking outta your asshole 
                        and you’re making me do this.”

           Peter looks up. Resolute.

                                 PETER
                        No. You're not wrong.

           Absolute silence as he dials the number, lifts the phone--

           And Kirsa stands up.

                                 KIRSA
                        Peter. Hang up.
                             (beat)
                        Peter. Hang up now!

           All eyes turn to her. Including Aiden and Peter’s.

           Peter hangs up at once. Snapping out of his reverie.

           Aiden’s eyes mark Kirsa. They are brimming with wrath.

           He turns to the Volunteer by the door. Signals.

           The projector whirls to a stop. The lights come up.
           Aiden stands. Looking down at Kirsa.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        I'm sorry, but I had to say 
                        something. I'm his wife.

                                 AIDEN
                             (barely contained rage)
                        Here, you are Kirsa and he is 
                        Peter. You are individuals. If you 
                        cannot sit still and listen, you 
                        have to leave the room until his 
                        exercise is over.

                                 KIRSA
                        I was only trying to help. He was 
                        making a mistake and--

                                 AIDEN
                        If you are still committed to your 
                        transformation, leave the room and 
                        someone will let you know when you 
                        can come back in. If you are not, 
                        talk to any of the volunteers for a 
                        refund and go home.

           Everyone stares at Kirsa. It's humiliating and intimidating.

           Maya approaches her.

                                 MAYA
                        Come with me, Kirsa.

           Kirsa simmers, then seeing she has no choice, starts to leave 
           her row. People drag their chairs back to let her pass as if 
           she's radioactive. Even Aspen and Lori.

                                 KIRSA
                             (powerless, to Peter)
                        Promise me you won't quit your job.

           Peter nods weakly. She glares at him, wanting more than that.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah. I promise. I won't.

           Maya escorts her to the double doors in complete silence.

           The Tall Volunteer unlocks the door for her. Holds it open.

           Behind her, Aiden sits down across from Peter.
                                 AIDEN
                        Let's talk more about your 
                        marriage, Peter. Truthfully.

           Kirsa shoots one final look at them before the Tall Volunteer 
           escorts her out, shuts the door and locks it again.

           INT. CORRIDORS

           He leads her down the dark hallways.

           We stay with them for an uncomfortably long time.

           Kirsa gets more scared and tense with each step.

           Then the Tall Volunteer stops.

           INT. EMPTY ROOM

           There is nothing here except for a single bulb dangling from 
           the ceiling, emanating blindingly bright light.

           The door unlocks. The Tall Volunteer signals for Kirsa to 
           step in. She does, shielding her eyes.

                                 KIRSA
                        How long am I going to be here?

                                 THE TALL VOLUNTEER
                             (closing the door)
                        Until his exercise is over.

                                 KIRSA
                        Wait, do you know what time it is?

           He doesn't answer. Closes the door, then locks it.

           Kirsa keeps shielding her eyes. Leans against a wall.

           INT. EMPTY ROOM, LATER

           Kirsa is pacing like a mad woman, picking at the sides of her 
           nails. We don't know how long it's been. She doesn't either.

           In silence, the light bulb BUZZES.

           She looks for a light switch on the walls, but there is none.

           The light bulb BUZZES even LOUDER somehow. As if the buzzing 
           is coming from inside her skull.

                                 KIRSA
                        Shut up. Please.
           She stops. Swallows. She's having trouble breathing.

           She takes DEEP BREATHS but the BUZZING persists and in a few 
           seconds, her DEEP BREATHS quicken. Anxiety taking over.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        You can breathe. If you're 
                        speaking, it means you can breathe.

           It does little. She goes to the door, tries to open it. 

           It's locked. Of course. She BANGS on it.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        Is anyone out there?

           No answer.

           The BUZZING is still there. She looks up at the light bulb, 
           shielding her eyes, then takes off her jacket, wraps it 
           around her hand and reaches for the bulb.

           She unscrews it, delicately but urgently.

           It works. The room goes completely DARK and SILENT.

           But her breathing quickens even more. It sounds worse, 
           somehow, when it's the only sound.

           She tries to calm herself, taking slow, measured breaths.

           Except she hears people TALKING now, in a neighboring room.

           She nears the wall. The voices are muffled.

                                 PERSON 1
                        This square is red.

           Now a chorus of people speak up. Ritualistic:

                                 EVERYONE
                        That is true.

           Kirsa puts her ear onto the wall. The voices get clearer.

           She recognizes them:

                                 MAYA
                        Mallory, you failed to sign up a 
                        single person for the advanced 
                        transformation class.

                                 EVERYONE
                        That is true.
                                 MAYA
                        What else is true?

           A long, somewhat ominous beat.

                                 VOLUNTEER #1
                        You smell like a disgusting old 
                        person.

                                 MATERNAL VOLUNTEER (MALLORY)
                        That is true.

                                 VOLUNTEER #2
                        You couldn't sign up your kids. 
                        Your own children hate you.

                                 MATERNAL VOLUNTEER
                             (her voice breaking)
                        That is true.

                                 MAYA
                        Even the people who love you don't 
                        like you.

           Maternal Volunteer chokes down a sob.

                                 MAYA (CONT’D)
                        Is that true or false?

           Maternal Volunteer doesn't answer or maybe won't answer.

           A loud SLAP silences her.

                                 MATERNAL VOLUNTEER
                             (giving in)
                        That is true. It's true.

           She unravels. Breaks down, sobbing.

           Kirsa steps away from the wall, seriously freaked out.

           INT. EMPTY ROOM - LATER

           Kirsa is sitting on the ground, hugging her knees.

           The door opens. The light makes her wince. 

           The Tall Volunteer fills the doorframe.

           He looks up at the dangling cord that used to be connected to 
           the light bulb, but doesn't say anything.
           INT. CORRIDORS - LATER

           Kirsa, disheveled and spent, walks side by side with the Tall 
           Volunteer as if she's his prisoner.

           INT. MULTIPURPOSE ROOM - LATER

           The door opens and Kirsa steps in. 

           People are sitting. Their eyes on her.

           Aiden is on the platform. A chair across him.

                                 AIDEN
                        Kirsa. Come up. Sit.

           She walks towards the platform, slowly, as the door BANGS 
           behind her, making her jump. People's eyes trail her.

           She sees Peter in the crowd, sitting at his chair. He catches 
           her eyes. He looks drained. They all look drained.

           Kirsa notices the Maternal Volunteer and Maya, leaning 
           against the wall at the back, standing side by side.

           They both brightly smile at her. 

           Kirsa is so frazzled she doesn't know if she heard them 
           earlier or if she imagined it.

           She steps onto the platform.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Sit. Please.

           She does. Aiden takes a seat across her.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        We talked for a little while with 
                        Peter and one thing became crystal 
                        clear: He loves you.

           Kirsa straightens up, surprised at how warm Aiden sounds.

                                 KIRSA
                        I love him too.

           She says that while looking at Peter. He smiles back.

                                 AIDEN
                        How did you meet?

                                 KIRSA
                        He hasn't told you?
                                 AIDEN
                        He did.

                                 KIRSA
                        So then why?

                                 AIDEN
                        I'd love to hear it from you too. 
                        And the non-bullshit version, 
                        please. We know what you usually 
                        say to people. We already went down 
                        that road with Peter. So, just give 
                        us the truth.

           Kirsa takes that in. When she starts speaking, she is 
           vulnerable. Maybe because of the exhaustion. Maybe because 
           Peter's love is the only anchor in this mad place.

                                 KIRSA
                        I met him in the hallway of a 
                        courthouse. I was there to 
                        represent a client, and he was 
                        waiting for his trial. He had 
                        stolen a laptop from a coffee shop 
                        to... well, to feed his heroin 
                        addiction. He was trying to get 
                        clean, then. But he wasn't when he 
                        stole the thing. He looked like a 
                        man who was too tired to cry and 
                        too sad to sleep.

           She looks at Peter. He's watching her. Nods her to go on.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        The owner of the laptop was a 
                        wedding photographer. Peter went 
                        into the computer, and saw all 
                        these photographs of a couple who 
                        had gotten married the day before. 
                        They were all going to get lost 
                        forever if he sold it to someone. 
                        So he went back to the coffee shop 
                        and tried to track this guy down. 
                        That's why he got caught, because 
                        he was trying to do the right 
                        thing. Again, this was before he 
                        was clean too. Imagine the will 
                        power and selflessness that must 
                        have taken. The simple goodness in 
                        that. It made me fall for him. I 
                        wanted to help him.

           A long beat.
                                 AIDEN
                        So, in a way, you rescued him?

                                 KIRSA
                        I don't know about that. But I saw 
                        him, this wonderful person who was 
                        lost and afraid, and he needed 
                        stability, and love.

                                 AIDEN
                        You make him sound like a cute 
                        little puppy.

                                 KIRSA
                        Excuse me?

                                 AIDEN
                        You talk about Peter like a dog you 
                        rescued from the pound.

                                 KIRSA
                        Seriously?
                             (beat, then to Peter)
                        You got nothing to say about all 
                        this?

           Peter says nothing.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                             (rising frustration)
                        Do you think I treat you like a 
                        cute little puppy dog?

           No answer from Peter.

                                 AIDEN
                        He can't speak. He took a temporary 
                        vow of silence. If he speaks, he 
                        will be removed. Here, you are 
                        individuals, not husband and wife--

                                 KIRSA
                             (curt)
                        I know.
                             (beat)
                        Okay, then, is that how he said he 
                        feels, or is that your 
                        "professional opinion"?

                                 AIDEN
                        It's what he showed me. No matter 
                        what I said, he refused to make 
                        that call to his boss.
                                 (MORE)
                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Even though he wanted to. Because 
                        he promised you. You have him on a 
                        short leash.

           Kirsa puts on a tight-lipped smile. Aiden is trying to get to 
           her, and she's not going to let him.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        You punish him to keep him there. 
                        In his little place where he can't 
                        get away from you.

                                 KIRSA
                        And how am I punishing him?

                                 AIDEN
                        He's living a C- life and you're 
                        not letting him transform. That is 
                        the definition of punishment.

                                 KIRSA
                        The only thing I've done today is 
                        stop him from making a huge life 
                        decision without thinking it 
                        through--

                                 AIDEN
                        Do you always make Peter "think 
                        things through" whenever he 
                        disagrees with you? Does he need to 
                        "think things through" until he 
                        does agree with you?

           Kirsa scoffs at that, not even dignifying it.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        I see. You think you know what's 
                        best for him.

                                 KIRSA
                        Maybe I do. Because I've known him 
                        for years, you've known him for a 
                        day. I'm his wife.

           Aiden stands up, turns to the crowd. Lecturing, using Kirsa 
           as an example:

                                 AIDEN
                        “I’ve known him for years. I’m his 
                        wife.”
                             (points to Kirsa)
                        Kirsa’s belief that time is how we 
                        know someone is ignorant.
           Anger bubbles in Kirsa by Aiden’s dismissal of her.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        We don’t talk, really talk, with 
                        the people closest to us, do we? We 
                        speak, but most of the time it’s 
                        nothing authentic, nothing 
                        truthful.
                             (raising his hand)
                        Raise your hand folks if you feel 
                        that the people who think they know 
                        you--your partner, your mother, 
                        your father, your brothers and 
                        sisters--they don’t really know 
                        you.

           Every person in the audience raises a hand. 

           Peter doesn't, but averts his eyes when Kirsa looks at him.

           Aiden gets to his feet, towering over her.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Kirsa thinks she knows her husband. 
                        But we listened to Peter speak. He 
                        has made himself known to us and--

                                 KIRSA
                        This is ridiculous.
                             (turns to Peter)
                        You're just going to let him talk 
                        about us like this? Or is this how 
                        you actually feel?

           Peter's eyes are boring into the ground.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        Peter! Look at me!

                                 AIDEN
                        Bark, Peter! Roll over, Peter!

           Kirsa whips around to Aiden, furious.

           A beat. She laughs in nervous anger. Disbelief.

                                 KIRSA
                        Oh my God! I knew this would be 
                        crazy but this is crazy.

           Aiden is calm. Not reacting to her outburst.
                                 AIDEN
                        Let's talk about why Kirsa is 
                        punishing Peter--

                                 KIRSA
                        Punishing? I saved his life. I 
                        helped him get clean, I helped him 
                        get a job--

                                 AIDEN
                             (to the crowd, lecturing)
                        "I saved his life." That's Kirsa's 
                        false narrative. That's what she 
                        tells herself when she is 
                        challenged about their 
                        relationship.

                                 KIRSA
                        It's the truth!

           He whips back around at her and leans into her, close.

                                 AIDEN
                             (raising his voice)
                        No. The truth is that you're tired 
                        of justifying your mistake.
                             (pointing at Peter)
                        You never meant to be with him, did 
                        you? Maybe a quick fuck but have a 
                        child with him? A life with him?

           Her eyes find Peter, betrayed by his silence.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        How long have you known Peter?

           Kirsa doesn't answer.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                             (louder)
                        How long?

                                 KIRSA
                        Four years.

                                 AIDEN
                        How old is your son?

           Kirsa just glares at Aiden.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Four.
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        You got together, got married and 
                        had a child in the same year. Life 
                        rushed you along and you gave in. 
                        You told yourself and your family 
                        it was fate.  They must have told 
                        you it was a mistake for you to 
                        marry a junkie but you said, no, 
                        it's not.
                             (a whisper that slithers 
                              through the room)
                        But now you know they were right 
                        and you were wrong. Look at what 
                        you're stuck with. With a child 
                        that derailed your career! With a 
                        husband you have to take care of! 
                        That’s why you punish Peter! 
                        Because you made a mistake and you 
                        HATE yourself for it!

           Her eyes flare and she PUSHES Aiden back so hard that Aiden, 
           a giant of a man, STUMBLES BACK.

           Kirsa glares at him, shaking with primal rage.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        If you thought I was wrong, you 
                        could have just told me I’m wrong. 
                        Why do you think you pushed me 
                        instead, Kirsa?

                                 KIRSA
                        Fuck you. You’re insane. This whole 
                        thing is insane!

           She rushes down the stage towards Peter.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        Come on. We're leaving.

           She grabs him by the arm. She pulls him up out of his chair.

           He lets her. They charge down towards the doors. 

           Aiden watches them... Then smiles.

                                 AIDEN
                        I told you folks, didn’t I? You 
                        will resist. You will hate me, you 
                        will want to hit me... I said it.

           Across the room, Kirsa and Peter get to the doors and she 
           pulls at the handle... except it doesn’t turn. Locked.

           Kirsa snaps at the Tall Volunteer, who is standing nearby.
                                 KIRSA
                        Open the doors.

           The Tall Volunteer looks up at Aiden for instructions.

           Aiden descends from the platform. Slowly, he walks towards 
           Kirsa and Peter, every step echoing in the silent room.

                                 AIDEN
                        I told you that you will kick and 
                        scream. You'll want to leave. The 
                        truth can do that to you.

           Kirsa white knuckles Peter’s hand, standing tall.

                                 KIRSA
                        We’re not prisoners here. You have 
                        to let us go.

           Aiden reaches them... Walks past them, towards the Tall 
           Volunteer. He takes the KEY from him.

                                 AIDEN
                        If any of you want to leave, this 
                        is your chance. You will get a full 
                        refund, no questions asked. 
                        However, if you choose to stay, 
                        that means you’re committing to 
                        stay until you are truly 
                        transformed. Is that understood?

           People stir in the crowd. An OLDER MAN speaks up:

                                 Older Man
                        You mean until Sunday?

           Aiden wait for a somewhat ominous beat before:

                                 AIDEN
                        This introductory class runs from 
                        Friday to Sunday.

           He says it with some ambiguity, but the Older Man sits down.

           Kirsa’s eyes are burning into the door, every cell in her 
           body commanding her to get the fuck out.

                                 KIRSA
                        Open the door.

           Aiden turns to her and Peter. Scans them.

           Then inserts the key into the door and turns it.
           He swings the doors wide open.

           Kirsa launches out, holding Peter, but Aiden stops them.

                                 AIDEN
                        Peter. One more thing, before you 
                        go.

           Aiden walks up to Peter and SLAPS him across the face, hard. 

           There are GASPS from the audience. 

           The Volunteers are not fazed at all. They've seen it before.

                                 KIRSA
                        Get your hands off him!

           But Aiden lunges at Peter and puts his hands at the sides of 
           Peter’s head, as if he’s going to wring his neck.

                                 AIDEN
                        That hurt? That fucking hurt?
                             (Peter nods, scared)
                        That’s temporary pain, Peter. It’s 
                        nothing. You won’t remember what it 
                        felt like in ten minutes. But you 
                        stay in this job buddy, you stay in 
                        this life? You’ll know real fucking 
                        pain. Slow, life-long pain that 
                        will fucking rot whatever’s left of 
                        your fucking soul and your kid’s.

           And with that, he gently lets go of him.

                                 KIRSA
                        Peter. Peter, we have to go.

           But Peter starts sobbing.

           Kirsa hugs him, trying to contain his unraveling.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        Peter?
                             (to Aiden)
                        You assaulted him! That’s battery!

           Peter takes a deep breath, composing himself.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        Peter, come on, let’s go back home.

           Peter looks up at Aiden.
                                 AIDEN
                        You can speak now. You are released 
                        from your vow of silence.

           Peter steels himself. Turns to Kirsa.

                                 PETER
                        I can’t leave. I’m sorry.

                                 KIRSA
                             (holding it together)
                        Peter, I know it feels hard right 
                        now but it’s because of this place. 
                        He’s brainwashing us and he's good 
                        at it. Once we get home, you will 
                        feel so much bett--

                                 PETER
                        No.
                             (vomiting the words)
                        This is how I always feel. You’re 
                        just seeing it for the first time.

           Kirsa’s face falls, devastated.

           Aiden pulls Peter up. Grabs his shoulders.

                                 AIDEN
                        You’re so brave, Peter.

           He embraces him, then escorts him back into the room.

                                 KIRSA
                        Peter.

           Kirsa powerlessly trails them.

                                 AIDEN
                        Isn’t he so brave, folks? That took 
                        guts, didn’t it?

           People start to clap but--

                                 KIRSA
                        This psycho hit him and you’re 
                        cheering? Think for yourself, he 
                        will hit you too! We all need to 
                        leave!

           It seems to snap some people out of their reverie but Aiden 
           nips it in the bud.
                                 AIDEN
                        They committed to staying until the 
                        end of their process, Kirsa.

           The subtext is clear: Nobody is allowed to leave.

           Kirsa can sense people are unnerved by the way Aiden declared 
           that but not enough to stand up to him.

           Aiden turns to Kirsa now, his arm still draped around Peter.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        You have not. Will you?

           She looks at Peter.

                                 PETER
                        You don’t have to stay, Kirs. You 
                        got your shit together. Go home. 
                        I’ll see you in a few days.

           She knows “in a few days”, he is going to be a pod person.

                                 KIRSA
                        I can't leave you here.

                                 AIDEN
                        Well, then, Kirsa. Are you 
                        committed?

           She looks between Aiden and Peter.

           Kirsa steels herself. Makes her choice.

                                 KIRSA
                        I'm not leaving.

                                 AIDEN
                        I need to hear you are committed.

           A long beat. She looks straight at Peter.

                                 KIRSA
                        I'm committed.

           It’s clear what she means: I’m committed to you.

                                 AIDEN
                        Congratulations. Now, sit your ass 
                        back down and shut the fuck up.

           Aiden tosses the key back to the Tall Volunteer.

           Kirsa watches Peter wipe tears, embarrassed.
           The Tall Volunteer SLAMS the doors shut and LOCKS them.

           INT. MULTIPURPOSE ROOM - LATER

           Kirsa's skin is wan, her eyes sunken, the Paxil withdrawal 
           really starting to drown her in nausea. Her head is in her 
           hands. The ceiling feels lower, the lights murkier.

           She snaps out of it when everyone START CLAPPING and get on 
           their feet. Aiden, on the platform, is hugging Aspen.

           Kirsa doesn't get up or clap. She winces at the sound.

           Aspen comes over and is embraced by Lori.  

           Everyone sits down.

           Aiden walks to the edge of the platform.

                                 AIDEN
                        You've all done great work here 
                        today. You are alive. Isn't it 
                        fucking great, being alive?

           A THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE. Kirsa presses her palms into her ears.

           Aiden waits for it to die down. Warm again. His voice softer.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        I know it wasn't easy but you 
                        persevered. If anything, you now 
                        know you are stronger than you 
                        thought you were.

           People around Kirsa nod meaningfully.

           Aiden pulls up an empty cork board.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        At your rooms, you will find one of 
                        these and a collection of pictures. 
                        I want you to use them to show us   
                        what your transformed life will 
                        look like. You will pin them onto 
                        your board. You will bring the 
                        board with you to our next session 
                        and present it to us as a totem to 
                        your aliveness and we will unleash 
                        your life onto you.

           He stops for a long beat. Stares everyone down.
                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Make sure you believe in it. You 
                        might have to bleed for it.

           He doesn't elaborate what he means by that and people in the 
           room are too drained to ask.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Go now. Get some sleep.

           The Tall Volunteer UNLOCKS the doors. Swings them open. 

           People stand up and make their way towards their rooms.

                                 THE CHIRPY VOLUNTEER
                        You know the drill, if your last 
                        name starts with A to H, you're 
                        with me...

           It gets loud and crowded really quickly.

           Kirsa catches a glimpse of Peter in the outgoing herd. He's 
           walking to the doors, Maya buzzing alongside him, chattering 
           into his ear. Pouring poison into his weakened mind.

           Other volunteers descend upon the vulnerable people like 
           vultures. They pass by Kirsa, barely giving her a glance.

           The Maternal Volunteer approaches Aspen, and Kirsa overhears:

                                 MATERNAL VOLUNTEER
                        Oh, Aspen, I'm so happy for you. 
                        What a breakthrough. I thought you 
                        might be interested in signing up 
                        for the next class...

           Kirsa pushes past them, tracking Peter in the crowd...

           But she can't find him.

           INT. CORRIDORS - LATER

           The silent herd of people march in creepy unison.

           The lights above are dim. Kirsa searches their faces in the 
           darkness for Peter, one after another. No luck.

           She passes by a Volunteer standing besides Lori as she fills 
           the Advanced Transformation class form on a clipboard.

           People start streaming into their rooms.

           Kirsa beelines towards Peter's room.
           INT. PETER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kirsa bursts in.

                                 KIRSA
                        Peter--

           But Peter's not there. Maya is. She's making the bed.

                                 MAYA
                        Oh, I'm sorry, it's just me. We 
                        moved Peter to another room.

                                 KIRSA
                        ... Why?

           Maya tucks in the bedsheets.

                                 MAYA
                        We had to separate you. We knew 
                        you'd visit him. You're too close.

                                 KIRSA
                        He's my husband.

                                 MAYA
                        Here, he's Peter and you're Kirsa. 
                        Two individuals focusing on your 
                        own transformations--

           Kirsa makes a sound that's half-laugh, half-scream.

                                 KIRSA
                        Does he know you hid my Paxil? I 
                        imagine he'd have trouble 
                        "focusing" if he knew that.

                                 MAYA
                        I didn't hide your Paxil, Kirsa. We 
                        looked everywhere, you probably 
                        forgot to bring it.

           Maya turns back around to finish smoothing the blankets.

           Kirsa clocks the PHONE protruding out of Maya's back pocket.

                                 KIRSA
                        I need to know he's okay.

                                 MAYA
                        He is okay. He is better than he 
                        has ever been.
                                 KIRSA
                        How would you know? You've met him 
                        yesterday.

                                 MAYA
                        You get to know people quick here.

                                 KIRSA
                        I don't know what that means. Does 
                        it mean you tried to fuck him?

           Maya stops. That bland smile still on her face.

                                 MAYA
                        Kirsa, you sound a little paranoid.

                                 KIRSA
                        Do I?! Maybe MY FUCKING ANTI-
                        ANXIETY DRUGS COULD HAVE HELPED 
                        WITH THAT!?!

           After the outburst, she's breathless for a second. She sits 
           onto the bed, sinks in.

           Maya gingerly sits next to her.

                                 MAYA
                        Arthur was the same way. He saw the 
                        worst in people. It must be because 
                        of what you do. You see people at 
                        their worst. Even good people must 
                        get nasty when they're going 
                        through a divorce.

           Kirsa looks at her. Gazing into her fucking soul. 

           Then she nods.

                                 KIRSA
                        I'm sorry. You're right.

           She embraces Maya.

           Maya is surprised but accepts the hug.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        My job is basically destroying 
                        people's lives.

           That's an oddly threatening thing to say but she says it in 
           such a... peaceful tone. Maya can only smile back.
                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        I should go back to my room. I have 
                        homework.

                                 MAYA
                        Sure thing. See you next session!

           She's happy Kirsa is getting on with the program.

           INT. CORRIDORS -

           Kirsa walks towards her room. But it's different now, she 
           doesn't seem lost. She knows exactly what she's doing.

           INT. KIRSA'S ROOM

           She comes in and closes the door.

           She pulls out Maya's PHONE.

           She dials a number. It rings.

           She sees the corkboard on the desk and a collection of 
           printed pictures. They're all abstract: An empty house with a 
           Sun shining inside it. Two naked people embracing each other 
           inside a flying globe of water...

           The person on the other end picks up the phone.

                                 KIRSA
                        Hey, it's Kirsa. I need you to do 
                        me a favor and run me a name: Aiden 
                        Caul. C-A-U-L. Founded an 
                        organization called The Process. 
                        It's an emergency. 
                             (listens)
                        No, I don't. Sorry, they don't let 
                        us know the time while we're here--
                             (listens)
                        Wait, what day is it? ...No, 
                        that's-- but I slept. It can't be 
                        Friday, we came here Friday 
                        morning.

           She takes a glance at the phone screen. 

           It is Friday Night, 11:43 PM.

           She starts pacing, angered by this manipulation.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        These fuckers. They've been messing 
                        with our sleep schedule.
                             (listens)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        No. I'm fine. Did you get the name? 
                        I want everything on him. Just say 
                        it's for a potential client. I need 
                        all the dirt you can get. 

           After a beat, the person on the other end responds.

           A smile blooms on Kirsa's face.

           INT. KIRSA'S ROOM - LATER

           KNOCK KNOCK, deafeningly loud, and the door swings open.

           It's the Chirpy Volunteer--

                                 CHIRPY VOLUNTEER
                        Rise and shine!! It's time for--

           He's surprised to see Kirsa is already up. Make up on, 
           armored in her power suit.

                                 KIRSA
                        Thank you.

           She picks up her cork board and strides by a somewhat puzzled 
           Chirpy Volunteer.

           INT. CORRIDORS - LATER

           People are groggily following the Volunteers down the hall.

           Kirsa is wide awake, alert.

           Other people, including Aspen and Lori, give her a wide 
           berth. They know she's the enemy.

           She sees Maya scuttling from one Volunteer to the next--

                                 MAYA
                        I can't find my phone. Did you see 
                        it anywhere?

           Kirsa can't help but crack a satisfied smile.

           INT. MULTIPURPOSE ROOM -

           She's one of the first ones here. 

                                 AIDEN (O.S.)
                        You look like you finally 
                        committed.

           He's on the platform, beaming down at her like a prophet.
                                 KIRSA
                        You're right. I am committed.

           She sits down in her seat.

           INT. MULTIPURPOSE ROOM - LATER

           Peter is among the late stragglers. Kirsa watches him take 
           his seat and start slurping his green smoothie.

           The Tall Volunteer SLAMS the doors and LOCKS them.

                                 AIDEN
                        Alright, how is everyone feeling?

           People mostly grunt back.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Like shit, huh?
                             (that draws some laughs)
                        You're meant to. It means you're 
                        doing hard work. I know you feel 
                        like death but trust me, you're 
                        more alive than you've ever been.
                             (a beat, deliberating)
                        Let's start with something 
                        different. Wake you all up.
                             (points to Kirsa)
                        Come up. Let's talk.

           People are taken aback. Not sure whether to applause or not.

           She raises from her seat.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead. Give her a hand.

           They obey but it's still smattering, hesitant.

           She climbs the platform. Sits down across Aiden. Faces him.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        What do you have for us?

           Kirsa turns her board to the audience and to Aiden.

           At the center is a photograph of her, Peter and baby Sam 
           together. It's surrounded by the abstract photographs.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        That's your family.
                                 KIRSA
                        Peter and our baby Sam. I had the 
                        photograph in my wallet.

                                 AIDEN
                        You put them at the center.

                                 KIRSA
                        Sorry, is that corny? My son is the 
                        center of my universe. It becomes 
                        that way when you have a kid.
                             (light banter)
                        Do you have children? I realized, 
                        you know us better than most people 
                        in our lives but we don't know 
                        anything about you.

           The audience stirs. They are definitely interested.

                                 AIDEN
                        You're deflecting. This isn't about 
                        me. This is about your aliveness.

                                 KIRSA
                        This is going to be about you, a 
                        little bit at least.

           After a tense beat, she points to a picture of light shining 
           through the clouds onto two blurry men on a beach.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        This powerful, blinding light is 
                        this program, the Process. The man 
                        on the left is Peter. And this man 
                        is you, his therapist. 
                             (pointing)
                        You're the one on the right because 
                        that one looks like a doctor.

           Aiden is catching onto what she's doing.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        You are a doctor, right?

                                 AIDEN
                        I never said I was.

                                 KIRSA
                        I'm sorry. I was-- What we do, it 
                        feels like a form of therapy and--

                                 AIDEN
                        It's not therapy.
                                 KIRSA
                        You're not a therapist? I assumed.

                                 AIDEN
                        Kirsa, it feels like we're talking 
                        about everything except you.

           She leans in now. A declaration of war.

                                 KIRSA
                        Why don't we ever talk about you? 
                        You take away our phones, lock us 
                        in rooms, we even let you hit us. 
                        But we have no idea who you are.

           The crowd is eagerly waiting to see where this goes.

                                 AIDEN
                        Kirsa, ever since the beginning of 
                        this class you have been 
                        slandering, deflecting, resisting--

                                 KIRSA
                        You've done the same. And I know 
                        why. I know who you are.

           Aiden's eyes narrow.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        You're an abusive, disgraced 
                        therapist who drove his last 
                        patient to commit suicide.

           An older woman in the audience actually GASPS.

                                 AIDEN
                        If you know of that incident, you 
                        also know I was cleared.

                                 KIRSA
                        Criminally. They still took away 
                        your license for patient abuse. 
                        Because of your experimental 
                        therapy "technology" which is 
                        basically what we have been doing 
                        here. Isn't that true, Aiden?

                                 AIDEN
                        He was a troubled man.

                                 KIRSA
                        Five of your ex-colleagues 
                        testified that the Process was the 
                        reason Warren Rich killed himself.
                                 AIDEN
                        They did.

           She pulls out her trump card: Maya's phone. On it is the 
           photograph of a young man in his 20's. Thin with big eyes.

                                 KIRSA
                             (going in for the kill)
                        Are you using the techniques you 
                        used on Warren Rich on us?

           He glances at the phone for a second but then looks away.

           She turns the phone towards the crowd.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        This boy put his trust in Aiden and 
                        he killed him. We should not make 
                        the same mistake.

           She gives the phone to someone in the front row.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        Scroll down and you can read all 
                        about it.

           People gather around the phone. Peter. Aspen. Lori.

           A sense of unease overtakes the room. Volunteers look at each 
           other, confused about what they should do.

           Aiden sits motionless for a long beat, then stands up.

           He walks towards Kirsa and she steps aside, afraid of him, 
           but he goes past her, into the crowd.

           He extends his hand to Aspen, who hands the phone over to 
           him. He looks down at the photo.

           Kirsa thinks maybe he's going to smash the phone or something 
           but he turns it towards the crowd. Walks through the rows, 
           making sure everyone sees Warren's face.

                                 AIDEN
                        When Warren was twelve, he drank an 
                        entire bottle of Drano. And when 
                        that didn't kill him, he jumped 
                        from a sixth store window onto 
                        concrete. He couldn't talk after 
                        that, which made things worse. He 
                        came into my care after his sixth 
                        suicide attempt.

           Suddenly, he's almost at the edge of tears.
                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        That is not an excuse. He was in my 
                        responsibility. I should have done 
                        better by him.

           He continues to hold the phone towards his flock.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        I was a young man, the Process was 
                        primitive and I didn't trust 
                        myself. When Warren pushed back 
                        against the Process, I decided to 
                        stop and go back to what we'd tried 
                        before... More therapy.

           He lifts his hand up.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        How many of you have been to 
                        therapy and got nothing out of it? 
                        Just a guy, sitting across you like 
                        a fucking Buddha, nodding to every 
                        thing you say but has nothing to 
                        say back to you other than vague 
                        aphorisms and thin platitudes?

           Hands go up. Slowly but surely. He got that one right.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Warren is the reason why I expanded 
                        the Process. Because I saw that 
                        providing him with gentle guidance 
                        and coping strategies was not 
                        enough.

           He pauses for a long while. Making sure everyone takes a look 
           at Warren's face, to see what he has lost.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        If I need to push you to 
                        resuscitate your aliveness, I WILL. 
                        I don't want you to cope, I want 
                        you to live. You are free to ask 
                        for your money back or call me a 
                        quack after we're done with your 
                        graduation. But until then, you are 
                        mine.
                             (final)
                        I lost him. I will not lose you.

           He gives the phone back to Maya, then declares to the crowd:
                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Let's take a quick break. I will be 
                        here to take all the questions you 
                        might have.

           People scuttle towards Aiden, surrounding him. Their savior. 
           Now even more fascinating than before.

           Kirsa is left on the platform. Powerless and alone.

           She sees Peter emerge from the crowd, walks towards her.

           Maya is on his heels but he turns around, strict:

                                 PETER
                        I want to talk to her alone.

           Maya wants to argue but he's resolved. He walks up to Kirsa.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Hey. You're alright?

           She shakes her head. No.

           INT. MULTIPURPOSE ROOM - LATER

           Kirsa and Peter are huddled up in a corner.

                                 PETER
                        Your Paxil? The fuck.

                                 KIRSA
                        I've been trying to tell you but 
                        they've been keeping us apart.

                                 PETER
                        Well, fuck, how are you holding up?

                                 KIRSA
                        Like I'm under a heavy, invisible 
                        blanket of needles.

                                 PETER
                        Jesus.

           He embraces her. She takes it in. Feels validated. At home.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        You saw this coming.
                             (shaken)
                        You stayed because of me. I pulled 
                        you into my shit again.

           She doesn't correct him.
                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I regretted staying the moment you 
                        decided to stay, you know.

                                 KIRSA
                        Why?

           He doesn't go on for the longest time.

                                 PETER
                        Aiden was right about a lot of 
                        things. My mother, you know. How I 
                        feel about my work at the studio--

                                 KIRSA
                        You don't hate your work, Peter--

                                 PETER
                        I do. He was right on that. He 
                        allowed me to come out and say it.

                                 KIRSA
                        He attacked you--

                                 PETER
                        Kirs, can I finish?

           Kirsa backs down. Nods; go on.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        He was right about everything when 
                        it came to me.
                             (beat)
                        So I was like... What else is he 
                        right about, you know?

                                 KIRSA
                        He was wrong about plenty things.

                                 PETER
                        I guess. He was wrong about one 
                        thing at least. You saved my life. 
                        That’s the truth.
                             (beat)
                        That’s why I could never ask why we 
                        got married so quickly. I think I 
                        was afraid you’d tell me.

           He sheds the weight. This was a long time coming.

                                 KIRSA
                        I married you because I love you.
                                 PETER
                        Man, I was so not marriage material 
                        back then.

                                 KIRSA
                        To me, you were.

           He lifts his head a little. Wanting more.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        Do you remember when you helped 
                        Lauren move out of her place?

                                 PETER
                        Lauren... Lauren my ex?

                                 KIRSA
                        She got you addicted to poison. She 
                        hurt you so bad. But you helped her 
                        when she needed you. You got her 
                        into the program. You never, ever 
                        called her a bitch or a cunt, which 
                        is so rare, trust me. You didn't 
                        hate someone you had so much cause 
                        to hate and most people are so 
                        petty and terrible. Every day I see 
                        them spend thousands of dollars 
                        just to screw over their exes. Over 
                        some worthless trinket they don’t 
                        even want. But you... You don't 
                        hurt people even when you're hurt. 
                        I wanted to be with you, Peter. How 
                        can I not? You're the best.

           She's so sincere it almost makes him cry.

                                 PETER
                        Why the rush though? Why did we get 
                        married so quick?

                                 KIRSA
                        I wanted to lock your ass down, you 
                        idiot.

                                 PETER
                             (smiling)
                        My ass. That’s the reason?

                                 KIRSA
                        You bet your ass it is.

           He laughs. She smiles, things are back to their old normal.

           She takes his hand in hers. He kisses her.
                                 AIDEN
                        Alright, recess over. Let's work.

           He signals to the Volunteers and they start folding up the 
           chairs, carrying them away to the corners.

           Kirsa and Peter watch. With anticipation. With dread.

           Aiden turns towards the two of them.

           He walks towards where Peter was sitting and pulls up his 
           cork board.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Peter. Is this yours?

           Peter looks at Kirsa. Unsure what he should do.

           Aiden walks up to them. People are starting to form a circle 
           around them, curious.

                                 PETER
                        Why?

                                 AIDEN
                        Tell us about it.

           Peter again looks at Kirsa, Aiden reads his hesitation.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Fuck it, you know what it's about. 
                        You did the work. I can tell.
                             (beat)
                        Everyone come with me. Peter, you 
                        go over there.

           He points across the room, towards the doors.

           Aiden starts to walk to the other end of the room. People 
           follow their shepherd. 

           Kirsa stays with Peter, holding his hand. Aiden sees it.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Kirsa, he's not going to float away 
                        if you let go of his hand.

           Kirsa doesn't reply.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        What do you think is so wrong with 
                        him that you don't trust him to 
                        make his own decisions?
           Peter turns to Kirsa, hushed:

                                 PETER
                        Go. Let's just get this over with.

                                 KIRSA
                        No. He's being vindictive, he's 
                        punishing me through you.

                                 PETER
                        He's going to do that either way.

                                 KIRSA
                        Peter, he's a bully. He's not going 
                        to magically stop. We have to stand 
                        up to him together. 

           Aiden has lost his patience by now:

                                 AIDEN
                             (to the Volunteers)
                        Do it.

           Six Volunteers SWARM Kirsa and Peter.

           Kirsa and Peter resist but they are forcefully separated, 
           each dragged to the opposite ends of the room.

           The crowd watches, impassive. More fascinated than anything.

           The Volunteers leave Kirsa before Aiden, then flutter away 
           back to their positions. 

           She doesn't even look at Aiden, she walks by him and blends 
           into the crowd.

           At the other end of the room, the Volunteers leave Peter near 
           the doors, next to the Tall Volunteer.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Peter!

           Aiden walks to a wall near the crowd and hangs Peter's board 
           onto a nail there. Looks over it.

           It's filled with a myriad of pictures to the edges. Peter 
           really worked hard on whatever this is.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        You did this board truthfully, I 
                        can tell. I don't know what these 
                        mean, but you do. This is what you 
                        want your new life to be.
           He turns around and faces Peter down across the room.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        So come and get it.

                                 PETER
                        What?

                                 AIDEN
                        Nobody is going to just give it to 
                        you. You need to come and get it.

           Peter is not sure what's going on but starts walking 
           tentatively towards his board to get it over with.

           Aiden turns to the crowd.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Keep him away from his board.

           Now they're confused too.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                             (to Peter)
                        See, this is not some bullshit 
                        Oprah vision board. You need to 
                        fucking fight for it if you want 
                        your life to change. Your life 
                        won't change just because you feel 
                        bad about it. Addicts know drugs 
                        are bad for them but it doesn't 
                        stop them from using. You know 
                        that, Peter. So, if you want to 
                        start living, you need to fight. 
                        You will only change when the pain 
                        of staying the same becomes larger 
                        than the pain of changing.
                             (to the crowd)
                        You are the obstacle. You are the 
                        pain. Unless he has it in him to 
                        break through you, then he will 
                        never change. Do it for him.

           People in the crowd exchange glances. Then a BIG MAN steps 
           forward, followed by two other men. 

           Aiden stands to the side.

           Kirsa is at the back, watching. Doesn't want to engage.

           Peter bumps into the three men and they push back. He tries 
           to side-step them but they won't let him.

           Peter laughs. This is silly.
                                 PETER
                        Yo gang, I'll give you a dollar 
                        each if you let me through?

                                 AIDEN
                        Your jokes won't work. We all saw 
                        you, Peter. We know who you are.

                                 PETER
                        No, actually, you don't.

                                 AIDEN
                        We know you're unhappy. We know 
                        your dreams matter to you. We know 
                        you want to start living again.

                                 PETER
                        By touching a board?

                                 AIDEN
                        You need to start somewhere. Go.

           Peter does another attempt at crossing through the men but 
           it's half-assed. They push him back again with ease.

                                 PETER
                        Okay guys, stop it. This is stupid.

           He folds his arms over his chest, giving up.

                                 AIDEN
                        Do you enjoy being pushed around? 
                        Do you like not trying? Maybe 
                        that's why you liked drugs. Your 
                        life sucks but it's not because of 
                        you, it's because of the drugs. 
                        Perfect, easy scapegoat.
                             (pointing at Kirsa)
                        You know she controls you because 
                        you cede control over to her.

           Peter raises both hands into the air and flips Aiden off.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Did you want to come here and try 
                        out the Process, Peter?

                                 PETER
                        You kidding me? Fuck no.

                                 AIDEN
                        But you're here. She made you.
                                 PETER
                        Yeah, that's called a compromise. 
                        It's something grown-ups do when 
                        they're in a relationship.

                                 AIDEN
                        Compromise only works if both sides 
                        are telling the truth. Otherwise, 
                        it's manipulation. Would you agree?

           Peter is silent. Kirsa stirs. Where is this going?

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Your wife told you Arthur, her 
                        boss, gave her two tickets: one for 
                        her and one for you. You had to 
                        come, or risk being rude to her 
                        boss. Is that correct?

                                 PETER
                        Are you telling me it's not?

                                 AIDEN
                        Arthur only gave her one ticket. 
                        She bought yours. It wasn't a 
                        compromise. It was manipulation. 
                        She made you come here.

           Peter shakes his head: no. No fucking way.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Why don't you ask her?

           Peter finds Kirsa through the crowd. 

           The crowd parts for a clearer look at her.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        Ask her.

                                 KIRSA
                        We're not your playthings. We're 
                        not going to--

                                 PETER
                        Is what he's saying true?

                                 KIRSA
                        You're playing his game, Peter.

                                 PETER
                        I want to play. Answer me.
                                 KIRSA
                        We'll talk about it when we get 
                        home. Okay?

           Peter starts laughing in disbelief.

           He starts pacing and ends up bumping against one of the men 
           who are keeping him from getting to the board.

                                 PETER
                        Dude if you push me one more 
                        fucking time, I swear I will cave 
                        your face in.
                             (yelling at Kirsa)
                        What are we DOING HERE, Kirsa?

                                 KIRSA
                        I'm sorry.

                                 PETER
                        Why would you lie to me!? What the 
                        fuck is wrong with you?
                             (better question)
                        What the fuck is wrong with us?

                                 KIRSA
                        There's nothing wrong.

                                 AIDEN
                        I'll tell you what is wrong: She 
                        doesn't respect you.

                                 PETER
                        Shut your fucking mouth, man!

           But then, he looks to Kirsa for an answer. He wants one.

                                 KIRSA
                        I'm sorry. You know you would've 
                        come anyway. I didn't want to 
                        argue. That's all.

                                 PETER
                        "That's all"? That's your defense? 
                        You're supposed to be a lawyer!

                                 KIRSA
                        Peter. Think, he's trying to get 
                        into your head--

                                 PETER
                        And here I was, feeling fucked up I 
                        made you stay!
                             (someone pushes him back)
                                 (MORE)
                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        What did I say before?! Do you want 
                        me to fucking hit you?

           Aiden nears Peter. The mood is tense but he's calm.

                                 AIDEN
                        Remember how you told us she 
                        doesn't trust you with women? I 
                        think it's a clue.

           He's next to him now. He has his ear.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        She's projecting. She wonders if 
                        she made a mistake by marrying you, 
                        so she thinks you have the same 
                        doubts. She thinks you're always 
                        looking for a way out.

                                 KIRSA
                        That's not true at all. 

           Peter glances between Kirsa and Aiden. Stuck in the middle.

                                 AIDEN
                        She doesn't trust you, Peter. 
                        What's a relationship without 
                        trust? What's a relationship 
                        without respect--

           Peter loses it, lunges towards the three men. To shut Aiden 
           up. To keep himself from hearing Aiden.

                                 PETER
                        All I need to do is touch the 
                        fucking board? I'll touch the 
                        fucking board! Let me through!

           They push him back. But this time, he pushes back. Hard.

                                 AIDEN
                             (to the crowd)
                        They need help. He's waking up.

           Additional men and women join in, helping to keep Peter away.

                                 PETER
                        Let me THROUGH!! LET ME THROUGH!

           He's in it now, elbowing his way, flailing his limbs, trying 
           to make a way for himself, boring a way through--

           Someone in the crowd hits the ground. A young man gets 
           elbowed in the face and steps back, holding his nose.
           Peter is still pushing through sweat and tears but the crowd 
           is still a barrier-- Peter pushes and pushes--

                                 AIDEN
                        Physical pain is temporary, Peter! 
                        Transformation is forever!

           The back of Peter's right hand gets caught in someone's belt 
           and the skin bleeds and the blood blends with the sweat--

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        YOUR LIFE DOESN'T WORK ON ITS OWN! 
                        YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT WORK!

           Peter falls to the ground but gets up and continues pushing 
           with abandon-- He lets out a loud GRUNT as he lunges into a 
           LARGE MAN and they both fall and finally he pushes THROUGH 
           the crowd and he's face to face with--

           Kirsa.

           The only one left between the board and him.

                                 PETER
                        Get out of my way.

                                 KIRSA
                        Peter.

           She puts up her hands, trying to calm him down.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        You said it yourself. This is 
                        stupid. You're going to touch a 
                        cork board because he's making you?

                                 PETER
                        Move, Kirsa.

                                 KIRSA
                        You can't see what's happening? 
                        He's manipulating you. Peter!

           Peter charges for the board behind Kirsa.

           She steps into his path, blocking him.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        Peter--

           Peter side-steps her, still going for the board--

           She digs her fingers into his shirt, grabs him and--
                                 PETER
                        LET GO OF ME!

           He pushes her away and he doesn't realize how powerful he is, 
           how angry he is, and he THROWS her to side--

           She hits the ground with a loud SMACK.

           She's stunned. On the ground. Blood running down her nose.

           Suddenly, the crowd erupts into APPLAUSE.

           Kirsa looks up to see Peter. He's holding his cork board. He 
           even smiles a bit, relieved.

           And then his eyes meet hers, and slowly, it sinks in what 
           he's just done.

           Kirsa looks away. Notices all eyes are on her. The 
           participants. The Volunteers. Aiden.

           She climbs to her feet, her heart beating at her throat.

           Peter catches up with her.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Kirsa. Kirs. I'm so sorry.

           She charges towards the doors. Peter on her heels.

                                 KIRSA
                             (to the Tall Volunteer)
                        Open the doors.

                                 TALL VOLUNTEER
                        You committed to staying until the 
                        end.

           Her heart is beating like it's a living thing trying to claw 
           out of her chest and she SCREAMS--

                                 KIRSA
                        LET ME GO!!

                                 TALL VOLUNTEER
                        You committed.

           And Peter catches up, tries to put his hand over her shoulder 
           but she tears away from his grip, tries her best to be 
           composed as she commands the Volunteers to--

                                 KIRSA
                        OPEN THE--
           But she can't even finish the finish the sentence. The words 
           are choking her, she's WHEEZING and she CAN'T STAND.

           She slowly sinks into the ground, on her hands. She starts to 
           cry, in the midst of a full blown anxiety attack. Paralyzed.

           She tries to get up but her vision begins to wobble and tilt. 
           Her limbs go weak, and she can only look up at the ceiling 
           and Peter comes into view, his face aching with concern--

                                 PETER
                        Shit, she's-- She's having an 
                        anxiety attack.

           People start crowing around Kirsa. Her vision is fading away 
           but she can see Aiden, leaning in, his face inscrutable:

                                 AIDEN
                        It's okay, Peter. She'll be okay.
                             (leaning down onto Kirsa)
                        We'll take good care of her.

           Her vision goes dark, wanting to scream but unable to, 
           Aiden's words ringing in her head as she passes out.

                                                                 FADE TO:

           INT. KIRSA'S ROOM

           It's a dreamy transition as Kirsa opens her eyes. She's 
           groggy as hell, holding her head.

           Her vision comes back slowly...

           She's in the cramped room she was staying in but it has been 
           cleared of all her possessions.

           It's dark. Silent. She's in a teal hospital gown.

           She climbs out of the bed but her limbs are heavy and she 
           stumbles towards the wall. Something is wrong. 

           Undeterred, she presses on. Labors her way to the door.

           She's about to reach it... And it opens.

           It's Maya, holding a green smoothie. She's not in her 
           Volunteer uniform but wearing a dark shirt and jeans.

                                 MAYA
                        You're up!

                                 KIRSA
                        Where... What's going on?
           Kirsa can hardly stand up. Maya puts the smoothie onto the 
           bedside table, then helps her stand.

                                 MAYA
                        Let's get you back to bed.

           Kirsa has no choice but to give in.

                                 KIRSA
                        Where am I?

                                 MAYA
                        You're in your room.

           Maya fluffs Kirsa's pillow and straightens the sheets like a 
           nurse before putting Kirsa into the bed.

                                 KIRSA
                        ... Where is Peter?

                                 MAYA
                        Oh, he went back home. He's taking 
                        care of Baby Sam. I'll tell him you 
                        woke up.

                                 KIRSA
                        ... He left?

           Maya hands over the smoothie to Kirsa. She's famished, she 
           takes a sip from it. Winces, but drinks more.

                                 MAYA
                        Yeah, he graduated the other day!

                                 KIRSA
                        When?

                                 MAYA
                        You're still in the class, Kirsa! 
                        You know I can't tell you that.

                                 KIRSA
                        What... What day is it?

           Maya smiles in response.

           Kirsa takes a long beat. Looks at Maya's civilian clothes.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        Is the course over?

                                 MAYA
                        Not for you.
                                 KIRSA
                        ... no?

                                 MAYA
                        You committed to staying until you 
                        transformed. You remember.

           Kirsa puts the smoothie down. Shocked at the implication.

                                 KIRSA
                        Maya, listen to me. I want to 
                        leave. If you stop me, it's a clear 
                        cut case of kidnapping and 
                        imprisonment. In California, that's 
                        sixteen to twenty years in prison.

                                 MAYA
                        But you committed.

           Her voice is serene, angelic.

                                 KIRSA
                        Let me go.

           She tries to get out of the bed, pushing Maya, the smoothie 
           drops to the ground--

                                 MAYA
                        Kirsa, you need to be in bed.

                                 KIRSA
                        Please. Let me go. LET ME GO!!

           She tries to stand up but falls to the ground. Tries to claw 
           her way back up but she's powerless.

           She looks at the smoothie, oozing into the floor.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        What... what... was in that...

           Maya pulls Kirsa up to the bed.

                                 MAYA
                        Just some natural stuff to help 
                        your body get rid of the drugs you 
                        put into it all these years. It 
                        will help you regain your 
                        equilibrium.

           Kirsa can't speak now. Her body sinking into the bed.
                                 MAYA (CONT’D)
                        Don't worry. It's all organic and 
                        plant based.

           Kirsa's fading away, she strains her eyes to fight against 
           the incoming darkness but everything is fading...

           Her eyelids slowly droop, in a slow motion blink--

           INT. KIRSA'S ROOM

           Eyes open, she's suddenly laying face-up in her bed. Groggy, 
           nauseated.... And possibly high on something. Everything is 
           tilted, wobbly, dreamy.

           Kirsa holds her aching head, confused.

           She tries to get out of bed--

           But the door opens and Aiden walks in. Scans her face.

                                 AIDEN
                        Easy. You're fine. You're safe.

                                 KIRSA
                             (slurring)
                        What do you want from me?

                                 AIDEN
                        You are here because there are no 
                        distractions and you can meditate 
                        better on your exercises.

                                 KIRSA
                        I don't want to do any more 
                        exercises. I want to go home.

                                 AIDEN
                        You will. Soon.

           He takes out a pen and grabs a note pad from the desk.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        For your next exercise, I want you 
                        to write down what you want your 
                        obituary to be. How you want people 
                        to remember you.

           He offers them to her. She doesn't take them.

                                 KIRSA
                        Someone will know I'm missing.
                                 AIDEN
                        You have to face this head on. 
                        There is no way out except through.

                                 KIRSA
                        When they know I'm missing, they'll 
                        come for you. They'll know I'm--

                                 AIDEN
                        Peter already knows. Arthur already 
                        knows. They're both supporting you.

           He leaves the pen and paper onto her lap.

                                 KIRSA
                        You're lying. Peter wouldn't--

                                 AIDEN
                        He has transformed, Kirsa. He knows 
                        how powerful that is and he wants 
                        you to experience it too.

                                 KIRSA
                        I don't believe you.

                                 AIDEN
                        Truth doesn't change depending on 
                        whether if you believe it or not.

                                 KIRSA
                        I don't believe you! I DON'T 
                        BELIEVE YOU!

           She throws the pen and paper back at Aiden, losing control, 
           and tries to claw at his face-- Except she starts shaking, 
           anxiety gripping her again, her body betraying her at the 
           worst moment, her heart pounding, choking on her words....

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        I don't... believe...

           Aiden hushes her as he tucks her back into the bed.

                                 AIDEN
                        It's okay, Kirsa. You're having 
                        another anxiety attack. It will 
                        pass. All this will pass.

           He stays with her, hushing her, consoling her as she has her 
           attack and she can only look at him with absolute horror in 
           her eyes-- She blinks and--
           INT. KIRSA'S ROOM

           Suddenly, she's sitting in a chair. Disoriented. Her vision 
           still fuzzy and stretched.

           There's a notepad and a pen on the desk in front of her. The 
           same ones Aiden gave her earlier.

           She looks past them. Defiant.

           She can see the door if she cocks her head to the right.

           She takes a deep breath. Very, very carefully steps up.

           It's hard. She's wobbly but she's going to get out of that 
           fucking door one way or another--

           Her legs fail her, she collapses but covers her face with her 
           hands as she hits the ground. She crawls on her elbows.

           She's by the door now. She reaches for the door knob and 
           pulls herself up. It takes everything in her power just to 
           stay standing, her legs wobbling--

           She turns the knob and pushes--

           Except it doesn't turn. It's locked.

                                 KIRSA
                        It wasn't locked-- NO--

           She frantically tries to turn the knob but it doesn't work 
           and she collapses to the ground again and lets out a CRY.

           The door opens. It's Maya.

                                 MAYA
                        What are you doing out of bed?

                                 KIRSA
                        Don't fucking touch me.

                                 MAYA
                        (pulling her up)
                        Kirsa. You should do your exercise.

           Kirsa tries to resist but Maya is stronger. Like a play 
           thing, Kirsa is hauled and deposited into the chair.

                                 MAYA (CONT’D)
                        There you go. I'll be leaving now 
                        and you will too if you focus on 
                        finishing your exercises. Okay?
           Kirsa doesn't reply. Maya steps towards the door.

                                 MAYA (CONT’D)
                        Oh and is there anything you want 
                        me to tell Peter? Any message?

           Kirsa's voice is so small.

                                 KIRSA
                        ... Peter?

                                 MAYA
                        He's looking for a new job and Sam 
                        is a handful, so I help him around 
                        the house. He can't cook, can he?

           She says that as if she expected Kirsa to laugh along.

                                 KIRSA
                        ... You've been in my house?

           Maya responds in a flat affect that does not recognize the 
           sheer terror on Kirsa's face:

                                 MAYA
                        It's beautiful! Ah, that garden... 
                        You're very fortunate. I'd love to 
                        have a place like that someday. I 
                        still rent. Ugh.

                                 KIRSA
                        How long... When...

                                 MAYA
                        Sorry, I gotta go. But you should 
                        work on your homework. I'll come 
                        check on you later.

           Maya leaves. Kirsa looks down onto the pen and paper.

           She slowly writes out a word. She nods off--

           INT. KIRSA'S ROOM - LATER

           Kirsa opens her eyes again, now on her hands and knees on the 
           ground. She is staring down at a bucket filled with greenish 
           vomit. She wipes fresh puke off the corners of her mouth.

           She sees Aiden sitting at the foot of the bed, reading 
           Kirsa's "obituary". He seems lost in thought.

           She presses against the ground, balances herself.

           He looks up at her. Then goes back to reading.
           Her legs wobble under her weight but she can stand.

           She tries to appear composed. Stand up straight.

                                 KIRSA
                        I tried to be brave. And open.

           Aiden doesn't react.

           After an agonizingly long time, he gives her back the pad.

                                 AIDEN
                        I'm sorry. I don't believe it.

                                 KIRSA
                        Truth doesn't change depending on 
                        whether if you believe it or not.

                                 AIDEN
                        But this isn't true, is it?
                             (pointing at the pad)
                        She was transformed... She lived 
                        life full-on...
                             (back to her)
                        You don't mean any of this. You 
                        need to dig deeper, Kirsa. You have 
                        to let me get to know you.

           He leaves the pad onto the desk. Turns to leave.

                                 KIRSA
                             (pleading)
                        Aiden. You said the first day, it 
                        doesn't work on 1 out of 100 
                        people. Maybe I'm that person. 
                        Maybe that's what happening.

                                 AIDEN
                        I was guiding you when I said that. 
                        I knew you would stay. 

           All of her composure melts away, leaving a desperate woman.

                                 KIRSA
                        Maya's going to see Peter in my 
                        house. Do you know about that?

                                 AIDEN
                        She's helping with housework 
                        through Peter's transition. He's 
                        part of our family now.

                                 KIRSA
                        You don't understand...
                                 AIDEN
                        You're tired, Kirsa. Maybe you 
                        should go to bed.

                                 KIRSA
                             (starting to cry)
                        Let me go.... Please... let me go.

           Aiden looks at her, then leaves. Locks the door after him.

           She starts crying, heaving, her ears RINGING--

           INT. KIRSA'S ROOM

           Kirsa jolts up in the bed as if waking from a nightmare.

           She looks around the swirling room.

           Her eyes find the pad and the paper.

           They first focus on the pad... then at the pen.

           Her eyelids are heavy again. Everything is out of focus...

           INT. KIRSA'S ROOM - LATER

           And back in focus. She's looking at a gray wall.

           She slowly realizes she's sitting in the chair.

           Maya is washing her hair over a metal bucket of water.

                                 MAYA
                        Then we watched the new episode of 
                        Game of Thrones, which I will not 
                        spoil for you, so don't even ask. 
                        But, seriously, Peter is such a 
                        scaredy cat. There was this, no 
                        spoilers, violent scene and he just 
                        kept looking away. It was so funny.

           Kirsa searches for something under her clothes.

                                 MAYA (CONT’D)
                             (not really hearing her)
                        Anyway, he graduated from his 
                        advanced seminar today. It was SO 
                        powerful. I think he's still in the 
                        building but only third tier 
                        members are allowed onto this 
                        floor, sorry.

           Kirsa tilts her head all the way. Looks up at Maya.
                                 KIRSA
                        How many third tier members are 
                        there?

                                 MAYA
                        Not many. It's a struggle to climb 
                        that high, let me tell you. Even 
                        Arthur isn't there yet.

                                 KIRSA
                        Good.

           She has an intense look in her eyes. From Maya's POV, Kirsa's 
           face is upside down and it makes it especially unnerving.

                                 MAYA
                        Can you put your head down, so I 
                        can...
                             (pointing at the pad)
                        You can work on your exercise.

           She grabs the notepad from the desk. She gives it to Kirsa, 
           looking around for something--

                                 MAYA (CONT’D)
                        Huh. I can't find the pen.

                                 KIRSA
                        I know where it is.

           Maya turns to Kirsa, puzzled--

           And Kirsa STABS her in the FACE with the PEN.

           Maya lets out a PAINFUL SCREAM but Kirsa drops on her and 
           STABS HER AGAIN and covers her mouth--

           She grabs a nearby smoothie and pours it into Maya's mouth--

           Some of the green ooze overflows and mixes with the blood 
           running down her face--

           It's a struggle until Maya's body finally goes limp.

           Kirsa searches her pockets for keys-- Finds a ring of keys--

           She climbs to her feet, her body is still uncooperative-- 

           Kirsa struggles toward the door. Her eyelids droop-- But she 
           SLAPS herself in the face to stay away. Once. Twice. Hard.

           It seems to be working. The pain is waking her up--

           She leans against the walls-- Goes to the door--
           Tries the keys... First one doesn't fit. She tries another-- 
           Hears Maya GRUMBLE on the ground, waking up--

           Kirsa's eyes are closing-- She SLAPS herself-- Doesn't work.

           She STABS HERSELF IN THE LEG with the PEN.

           The pain jolts her awake. Blood runs down her leg.

           She goes back to trying the second key on the door. It 
           doesn't work either. She lets out a long GROAN.

           Behind her she can hear Maya softly CRYING in PAIN. She's 
           holding her face, confused.

                                 MAYA
                        ... Kirsa?

           She shoves the next key into the door and turns it--

           It works. The door opens--

           She charges out-- But collapses to the ground--

           INT. CORRIDORS -

           She STABS HERSELF in the leg again with the pen. 

           Deep, powerful stabs. Pain waking her up. Keeping her alive.

           She can look around now. Pulls herself up.

           Maya is GROANING in the room. Kirsa knows she needs to run.

                                 MAYA
                             (low)
                        Heeelp.

           Kirsa stumbles down the dark corridor, into the maze--

                                 MAYA (CONT’D)
                             (clearer)
                        HELP! SOMEBODY HELP!

           Kirsa spots The Tall Volunteer appear at the other end of the 
           corridor. He sees her. 

           She starts RUNNING now, powered by adrenaline and pain--

           She finds a door, opens it--

           INT. MORE CORRIDORS -

           More labyrinthine corridors.
           She charges down one of the corridors, the footsteps behind 
           her getting closer, every sound echoing in the silent halls--

                                 THE TALL VOLUNTEER
                        STOP HER!

           More footsteps now, her pursuers have joined up with others--

           She STABS herself again, this time burying the pen deeper, 
           TWISTING IT, and she SCREAMS--

           She goes for a door, it's locked-- Another, locked again--

           One opens-- She SPRINTS DOWN--

           INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR

           She's running on fumes now, and it's yet another almost 
           identical corridor-- 

           She's getting nowhere. She STIFLES a SCREAM in frustration--

           She starts crying softly, defeated. Her eyelids drop and she 
           lets them. Surrendering...

           But she sees PETER standing in the darkness-- Peter-- Is it 
           him? Is she dreaming-- No, it is him--

           She sprints towards him. Falls into his arms.

                                 KIRSA
                        Peter!
                             (suddenly alert)
                        They're coming. We need to go, now.

           But Peter says nothing. He just looks at her.

           She is confused. Then anger bleeds through.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        You knew I was here. They said...

           Peter just looks at her. Feeling for her but not speaking.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        You knew and you did nothing. They 
                        weren't lying.

           No answer. Betrayed, she steps away from him. Anger building.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        They drugged me! They imprisoned me 
                        and you let them! You let her...!
           He doesn't answer.

           But that's an answer in itself. Her eyes tear up with ANGER. 
           So much ANGER. Her entire body is shaking. ENRAGED.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        You're weak. You're worthless. I 
                        never should have married you.

           Peter steps back. His face falls.

           Kirsa realizes the gravity of the words she just said. She 
           wants to take them back but it's too late.

           FOOTSTEPS come up behind her but they are measured, not the 
           frantic footsteps of her pursuers.

           She looks back at them, confused.

           Then the doors behind Peter open up and reveal that familiar 
           multi-purpose room-- and all the people in it--

           Everyone streams out of the room, led by Aiden. The 
           Volunteers in their uniforms. Aspen, Lori and the others.

                                 AIDEN
                        Your vow of silence is over Peter.

           Peter doesn't react. It's not like he has anything to say.

           She understands now, she was tricked-- She turns to Peter--

           But one look at Peter and she knows there is no coming back 
           from those words.

           Aiden approaches her.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        You finally spoke your mind, Kirsa.  
                        You are finally truthful. You have 
                        made your first step towards your 
                        transformation. You're so brave.

           Aiden leads everyone to hug her in a circle.

           Kirsa tries to repel them but she has no strength left and 
           they all take turns, hugging her and telling her--

                                 ASPEN
                        Kirsa, you're so brave.

                                 LORI
                        Kirsa. You're so brave.
           And so on... As Kirsa tries to find Peter in the crowd but 
           he's already walking away. Not even looking back for her.

           INT. MULTIPURPOSE ROOM

           Kirsa is back in her clothes and looking lucid.

           She stands by the double doors. They are open.

           Peter stands in front of the platform, on ground level, 
           encircled by the Volunteers and the participants alike.

           He's reading from a paper. It's intimate.

                                 PETER
                        ... Peter died at the age of 
                        eighty-nine. A celebrated 
                        photographer, his self-portraits 
                        have been featured in Tate Modern 
                        and MOMA...

           He looks down a bit, bashful... but the crowd cheers him on 
           with encouragements.

           Peter manages a smile, continues.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        He died peacefully in his sleep, 
                        surrounded by friends and family, 
                        including his son Sam, who made 
                        Peter a proud father and... the 
                        happiest man in the world.

           No Kirsa.

           His voice breaks at the end and everyone hugs him to know 
           he's loved here. Even Aiden gets into the hug.

           Kirsa limps away from the room. Her legs still aching with 
           hurt, her body and soul broken.

           Aiden's eyes track her.

           INT. CORRIDORS

           She's walking away.

                                 AIDEN (O.S.)
                        Kirsa.

           She whips back around, faces him. They are alone.
                                 KIRSA
                        I will sue you. I will take down 
                        this entire organization.

           Her voice is hoarse, raw with rage.

           Aiden's is tender.

                                 AIDEN
                        People have said that to me 
                        hundreds of times. People I pushed 
                        even further than you. None of them 
                        ever sued us. You know why?

           No reaction from Kirsa.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        I gave you so many chances to 
                        leave, Kirsa. I ordered you to 
                        leave. But you didn't. Because you 
                        knew, deep down, you needed to find 
                        out who you really are. And you 
                        did. That's what we gave you. 
                        Nothing less, nothing more.

                                 KIRSA
                        That wasn't me saying those things.

                                 AIDEN
                        Who was it then?

                                 KIRSA
                        You. You drugged me. You said I 
                        hated him again and again until it 
                        took root in my mind.

                                 AIDEN
                        The Process is designed to unearth 
                        thoughts, not create them. It 
                        can't. I wish it could.

                                 KIRSA
                        Bullshit.

                                 AIDEN
                        Being in an altered state gives 
                        people permission to say what they 
                        are really feeling inside.

                                 KIRSA
                        No, no, you did something more. 
                        Some kind of neuro-linguistic 
                        programming or mind control--
                                 AIDEN
                        Kirsa. Those things aren't real.
                             (comforting, simply)
                        I know you are in denial now, but 
                        in time you will see that this was 
                        a good thing.

                                 KIRSA
                        A good thing?

                                 AIDEN
                        Yes. You were incompatible.
                             (beat)
                        Your marriage would have slowly 
                        collapsed over the years, ending in 
                        a bitter divorce that would have 
                        hurt you, Peter and your child. 
                        This hurts too, but you ripped off 
                        the band-aid and it will get 
                        better. It might not feel like it 
                        now, but you will soon realize we 
                        saved you from long years of pain.

           She can't even conjure a reply. Disgusted beyond words.

           He understands this might be goodbye.

           Hoping it's not, he takes out a brochure from his pocket and 
           extends it to her. She takes it.

                                 AIDEN (CONT’D)
                        We can do much more for you. I hope 
                        you sign up for the next course. 
                        I'm teaching that one too.

           After a long look at her, he turns around and walks away.

           She rips that brochure apart. Loud enough so he has to hear.

           INT. EXIT CORRIDOR - DAY

           It's the corridor Peter and Kirsa entered through. 

           The sunlight streams onto the beige carpet.

           Now tables are set up all around. Many participants are 
           signing up for the next class. There are long lines.

           Kirsa sifts through a luggage cart for her roller bag.

           She finds it. It's next to Peter's tattered backpack.

           She grabs her rollerbag and puts the backpack over her 
           shoulders. 
           She looks for Peter in one of the lines and finds him. 

                                 KIRSA
                        Peter.

           He looks like he aged ten years. She offers him the backpack.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        Let's go home.

           He looks at her in disbelief.

           After a beat, he takes the backpack but only offers a cold:

                                 PETER
                        Thanks.

                                 KIRSA
                        We can still fix this. We can go to 
                        therapy, talk through it--

                                 PETER
                        We did talk. I heard you.

           The line goes forward. Peter steps forward. Kirsa follows.

                                 KIRSA
                        I was drugged. You know what that's 
                        like. I wasn't myself.

           Peter doesn't react. Not buying it.

           The line moves up. Peter steps forward.

           Kirsa changes tacks. Pleads with him as others look on. 

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        You can't sign up. If you're going 
                        to find a new job, you need to save 
                        your money, not spend it on--

                                 PETER
                        It's free if you volunteer.

           Kirsa glances at the Maternal Volunteer smiling goodbyes to 
           those who are leaving like an air hostess after a flight.

                                 KIRSA
                        Remember when Aiden kicked me out 
                        when I stopped your from calling 
                        your boss? They put me into a room 
                        and I heard things. These people 
                        don't live a good life.
           He doesn't answer her.

                                 KIRSA (CONT’D)
                        What about Sam, Peter? Have you 
                        thought about that?

                                 PETER
                        They do have a course for children 
                        but he has to be at least seven 
                        before I can sign him up.
                             (re: her horrified face)
                        I'm joking.

           She smiles, at least a part of the old Peter is in there.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        We'll split custody. You're a good 
                        mom. This isn't about that.

           Her face falls. He sounds so final.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Just do me a favor and never tell 
                        him you regretted having him.
                             (speaking from experience)
                        That tends to fuck people up.

                                 KIRSA
                        I'm not-- Of course I don't regret 
                        having him, why would you say that?

           He looks at her but his face is devoid of warmth. Of that 
           easy intimacy they used to share.

                                 PETER
                        I don't know anymore.

           He's not even angry. He's just lost. It speaks to the fact 
           that what they used to have might be now irrecoverable.

           The line steps up and it's Peter's turn and he doesn't look 
           enthusiastic about signing up but it's clear he'd rather be 
           in here with these people than be out there with Kirsa.

           He walks towards the desk... manned by MAYA, of all people, 
           wearing a few bandages on her face.

           She welcomes him with a smile.

           Kirsa, broken and defeated, leaves.

           EXT. CONCRETE BUILDING - NIGHT

           She steps out.
           She sits down onto a nearby ledge, trying to compose herself.

           Footsteps approach her from the direction of the building--

           Is it Peter, coming after her?

           No. It's Maya. She extends Kirsa her phone. She takes it.

                                 MAYA
                        We found this too.

           It's her Paxil bottle. She grabs it.

           She looks at Maya's face. The bandages.

                                 MAYA (CONT’D)
                        I knew it might happen when I 
                        signed up for it. It was worth it 
                        to see you transform--

                                 KIRSA
                             (I don't give a fuck)
                        You destroyed the most important 
                        relationship in my life.

           Maya takes her time. This is a more thoughtful Maya than 
           we've been used to seeing.

                                 MAYA
                        You love him.
                             (no response from Kirsa)
                        You don't have to lose him. This 
                        happens to many couples during the 
                        intro course. I've seen them 
                        survive through it.

                                 KIRSA
                        ... how?

                                 MAYA
                        When they both do the advanced 
                        course and hash things out.

                                 KIRSA
                        My life ended back there and your 
                        priority is to try and recruit me?

                                 MAYA
                        That's not what this is about.

           She stands up, looks at Kirsa. Sincere and empathetic.
                                 MAYA (CONT’D)
                        If you still love him... It might 
                        work. I've seen it work.

           She walks back to the building, leaving the glass doors open 
           for Kirsa if she wants to come back in.

           Kirsa sits there. She can see Peter talking with the 
           volunteers, shaking their hands and embracing them, now as 
           equals, ready to morph into one of them...

           And Kirsa, on the outside, feeling guilty, feeling like she's 
           abandoning him to his fate, a part of her needing him, all of 
           her still loving him... Perhaps thinking of saving him...

                                                           FADE TO BLACK.
