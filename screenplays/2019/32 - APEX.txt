                                                              ON BLACK:

           The bone-rattling sound of a CRASHING WAVE. 

           EXT. BEACH - LATE MORNING

           The tense back of bikini-clad KATE (22, Asian-American, 
           pretty, a wired energy) watching her friends scramble into a 
           SMALL BOAT. 

           CHARLIE (22, white, charismatic and curvy) pauses.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Kate! Sure you don’t wanna come? 
                        Water out there is totally flat!

           Kate hugs herself. She smiles tightly and shakes her head. 

           Another earth-shaking WAVE CRASH. 

           From the boat, JAMES (22, African-American, charming, 
           winningly handsome) holds out his hand to Charlie. She grabs 
           it, steps into the boat and into James’s arms. 

           EXT. OCEAN - EARLY AFTERNOON

           The anchored boat looks small on the open water. The beach is 
           nowhere to be seen.

           Charlie, James, ADRIENNE (22, blonde and unapologetic), and 
           ADRIENNE’S BOY TOY (22, hot and forgettable), all in snorkel 
           gear, PLUNGE into the water.

           BEACH - EARLY AFTERNOON

           Kate paces the beach, looking ANXIOUSLY to the horizon. 
           Biting her nails.

           UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

           SEA TURTLES moving in slow motion; BRIGHT FISH darting. 
           Shards of sunlight lancing through the clear water. The 
           friends swim around the turtles in states of WONDER. 

           BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON

           The sun is low. Kate sits in a beach chair, her book ignored, 
           eyes glued to the ocean. 
           She brightens, RELIEVED: her friends’ boat is back, in the 
           distance. They JUMP OUT many yards from shore, and start 
           swimming in.

           The waves knock them back, WORRYING Kate, but they emerge 
           from the waters -- together -- energized, ALIVE with joy.

           As they walk, sun-drunk and LAUGHING, toward Kate, she notes 
           James and Charlie holding hands, sharing a special look. 

           BEACH - DUSK

           They sit around a FIRE, roasting marshmallows and clutching 
           Tecates. Adrienne shares a gooey marshmallow with Boy Toy. 
           Charlie sits on James’s lap. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Bathroom trek. Who’s escorting me? 
                        James?

           James makes an Only if I absolutely have to face.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Jerk. Adrienne?

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (to Boy Toy)
                        Friends don’t let friends go to 
                        lizard-infested bathrooms alone.

           With Charlie and Adrienne gone, James scoots his chair closer 
           to Kate. 

                                 JAMES
                        Wish you came with us today.
                        We missed you.

                                 KATE
                        Charlie was probably making fun of 
                        me for being a pussy, huh?

                                 JAMES
                             (”yes”)
                        Naaaah. She wouldn’t do that.

                                 KATE
                        Isn’t it enough that I love the 
                        beach? I’ve always hated the whole 
                        concept of open water. It’s 
                        just...so big!
                                 JAMES
                             (laughing)
                        Uh, the ocean? Yeah, pretty big.

                                 KATE
                        How do you know what all’s down 
                        there? Out there with nothing 
                        between you and, and -- what?

           She shivers, hating the very idea.

                                 JAMES
                        You don’t know. That’s kinda the 
                        point. Sometimes the unknown can 
                        be...exciting.

           What’s that? James’s HAND migrating onto Kate’s bare thigh. 
           She notices. He notices her noticing. He doesn’t move it.

           A beat. Is this...happening?

                                 KATE
                             (softly)
                        I wish I were the type of person 
                        who--

                                 CHARLIE (O.S.)
                        Every fucking time.

           Kate whips her face around. Charlie LAUGHS. James’s hand is 
           gone as quickly as it appeared. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re not even sunburned! How?

                                 JAMES
                        Melanin advantage for the win!

           Charlie sits back on James. Kate is DISAPPOINTED, but smiles. 
           She’s not the one who gets the guy. She’s never the one who 
           gets the guy. And ALL THREE OF THEM know it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Kate always plays it safe. Don’t 
                        you, Kate?

           Kate and Charlie LOOK at each other. It’s a complicated look, 
           one that we won’t fully understand until later. The fire 
           FLICKERS on Kate’s face as she forces a smile.

                                 KATE
                        You know me.

                                                              ON BLACK:
           One more wave CRASH, and the title: APEX

           EXT. AGUAS SERENAS RESORT - DAY

           LOWER THIRD: FIVE YEARS LATER

           The entrance to Aguas Serenas eco-resort: all is placid. 
           White sand, blue sky, thatch-roofed buildings, an open-air 
           structure with sheer white curtains blowing in the breeze. 

           A brown PIT BULL sleeps in the brush, next to an old wooden 
           sign reading 

                            BIENVENIDO A AGUAS SERENAS!

           Just the sounds of the lapping shore, buzzing flies, the 
           breeze rustling the palm trees.

           Paradise. 

           A white van RUMBLES in, its noise a disturbance, wheels 
           CRUNCHING, the doors sliding noisily open. 

           Out pour the young, athletic legs of our protagonists (27, 
           for the most part), shiny limbs and bright voices. 

           First, Charlie surveys the scene, hands on hips. Big GRIN.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I knew it. Perfection. Happy 
                        birthday to me!

           Then James exits, loaded with BAGS and SUITCASES. 

                                 JAMES
                        You done good, Charlie! Happy 
                        birthday, babe. 

           She strokes his cheek absently, does NOT take any bags.

           Then Kate steps out and pauses. She’s transfixed -- not by 
           the scenery, by Charlie and James. 

                                 KATE
                             (quietly)
                        James.
                             (then louder)
                        James! Let me help. You don’t have 
                        to carry everyone’s bags. 

           Kate takes a couple bags while Adrienne and GREG (22, white, 
           the kind of boy who absolutely ruled his high school) stumble 
           out. Their faces are kiss-bitten, hair mussed. 
                                 ADRIENNE
                             (giggling)
                        Shit, Charlie. Are we all on a 
                        honeymoon together? 

                                 GREG
                        I thought it was a birthday. 

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Joke, honey. 

           Greg straightens his ASU sweatshirt, then shrugs, starts to 
           strip it off. Adrienne, grinning, puts her arm around 
           Charlie’s shoulders as they watch. Greg is a specimen. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (deadpan, to Adrienne)
                        Oh no, however will we remember 
                        where he went to school.

           No problem: Greg pulls an ASU visor from his back pocket and 
           sticks it on his head.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Adrienne, where did you find this 
                        guy? 

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (“duh”)
                        ASU. 

           Greg helps Kate and James with the bag madness. James heaves 
           one up: it’s very, very heavy.

                                 JAMES
                        Who the hell-- Kate, this yours? 
                        Damn, girl, what’d you bring?

           Kate shrugs, sheepish. 

                                 KATE
                        You know me. Always prepared.

           Charlie steps forward as resort employee PEDRO (40s, male) in 
           a polo shirt comes out to greet them. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ok, bags in a sec. First, photo 
                        time!

           Kate is shaking hands with the resort employee. 
                                 KATE
                             (to Charlie)
                        This is Pedro. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hola, Pedro! Charlie. Foto, por 
                        favor? Es mi cumpleaños. 

                                 PEDRO
                        Ah, feliz cumpleaños! Si, si!

           Kate hands Pedro her phone and Charlie arranges everyone in 
           front of the sign. James pulls Greg’s visor off.

                                 GREG
                        Bro! What’re you--

                                 JAMES
                        No, Greg, man! You’re Wesleyan for 
                        this trip. 

                                 GREG
                             (confused)
                        But I went to ASU. 

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Just pretend, hon. 

                                 PEDRO
                        Uno, dos...

           Charlie takes one step back to situate, landing -- 

           -- directly on the sleeping pit bull’s PAW. 

           CLOSEUP: Snarling, SNAPPING jaws, a violent, primal response. 

           SCREAMING, panic, confusion: James backing up and tripping 
           over the bags, Charlie on the ground, Adrienne’s face in 
           terror, Greg frozen. Pedro’s yelling for quiet. 

           But Kate steps in. 

                                 KATE
                             (controlled)
                        NO! BAD DOG!

           Kate assumes a power stance, positioning herself between the 
           snarling dog and Charlie. A face-off of wills. 

           Kate kneels. The dog quiets. 

           Kate holds out her hand; the dog sniffs. Then she pets the 
           dog gently. Kate’s won the dog over.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Shit! When did you become a dog 
                        whisperer?

           Pedro comes with the leash, distraught.

                                 PEDRO
                        Lo siento. How awful. This is no 
                        introduction to Aguas Serenas!

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ll say. 

           Kate looks up. 

                                 KATE
                        What’s her name?

                                 PEDRO
                        Magda. Her owner died last year. 
                        Now she’s Aguas Serenas dog. 

           Charlie stands up, dusts herself off. James tends to her. 

                                 JAMES
                             (to Pedro)
                        Keep that dog away from us, ok? 

           Charlie pushes James’s hand away.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Too late, James. 
                             (to Kate)
                        Thanks. Didn’t know you had that in 
                        you!

           Kate stands. 

                                 KATE
                        Pit bulls aren’t aggressive by 
                        nature. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, that one obviously was. 

                                 KATE
                        I mean, they don’t have to be, as 
                        long as you don’t provoke them.

                                 JAMES
                        Kate, it was an accident. 
                                 KATE
                        I know, but all you have to do is 
                        own your accident. Animals are much 
                        more intuitive than we usually--

                                 CHARLIE
                             (lightly)
                        Thanks for the lesson, Professor. 

           Kate stops talking -- she’s put back in her place. Adrienne 
           steps in to moderate, assuming the role of tour guide. 

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (cheerily)
                        Ok, ok, start over. Reboot. Welcome 
                        to Aguas Frescas!

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s Aguas Serenas. 

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (in a “commercial” voice)
                        Aguas Serenas! In this quaint, 
                        intimate eco-resort, you’ll have 
                        everything your heart desires. To 
                        your right you’ll see our five-or-
                        four-star al fresco restaurant, 
                        while to your left are the romantic 
                        thatched-roof abodes bearing the 
                        feather beds of your dreams. 
                        Straight ahead lie the crystal-
                        clear waters of Playa del Carmen, 
                        where we’ve gathered to celebrate 
                        the blessed birth of one Charlotte 
                        Marie Kingston.

           Charlie CURTSIES. Adrienne’s so over-the-top silly with her 
           megawatt smile that everyone loosens up.

           Kate gives the pit bull one last pet, and trails behind as 
           they follow Pedro into the resort. There are a few 
           decorations up: bright hanging GARLAND PUFFS and SKULL ART. 

                                 GREG
                        Whoa! I almost forgot it’s 
                        Halloween!

                                 CHARLIE
                             (rolling her eyes)
                        It’s Day of the Dead. Different.

                                 GREG
                        Huh?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Have you ever heard of, like, 
                        Wikipedia?

           Kate, still following, looks at the picture Pedro took, 
           milliseconds before the attack.

           CLOSEUP on photo: Greg and Adrienne, goofy; James with Kate 
           smushed up against him; Charlie, about to take a step back.

           Below them, unseen, the presence of something TREACHEROUS.

           Kate puts the phone down, replacing the photo with the view 
           of gentle, clear waters: calm, serene, peaceful.

           Marring the postcard-perfection is the beach, littered with 
           tons of driftwood, seaweed, palm fronds and branches. A MESS.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Pedro? The beach looks pretty bad--

                                 PEDRO
                        Si, from yesterday. We clean up 
                        today, no problem!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ok, great, ‘cause we were all 
                        excited about how it was before? 
                        And the photos online? That’s kind 
                        of why we chose this place instead 
                        of the place we stayed at before, 
                        so--

                                 PEDRO
                        No problem, no problem! We make 
                        beach beautiful for you. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, the weather is perfect. 
                             (to James)
                        See, babe? I told you not to worry 
                        about the storm. It all worked out.

           Kate catches up to them.

                                 KATE
                        I wouldn’t call it a “storm,” 
                        Charlie. It was a category 2 
                        hurricane as of 24 hours ago.
                                 CHARLIE
                             (nerd voice)
                        “And uh, with a, uh, maximum 
                        rotational velocity of 51.2 miles 
                        per hour, this Cat 2 hurricane, 
                        colloquially referred to as a, uh, 
                        ‘shitstorm’--”

           James is cracking up, Kate smiling wryly. The old gang, back 
           together again.

                                 KATE
                        Sorry, sorry! Just trying to be 
                        factual.

           Charlie slings an affectionate arm around Kate’s neck.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And I mean, you know, thank you, 
                        because what’s a vacation without 
                        facts? I’m so glad you came. 
                             (to everyone)
                        Aren’t we glad Kate came with us? 
                        Even if she did need a little 
                        coaxing.

                                 KATE
                        Charlie, I would never miss a 
                        chance to binge drink with you.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, we got five years of 
                        blackouts to catch up on, so come 
                        on, you’re bunking with us.

           Charlie pulls Kate along to a large BUNGALOW as Kate tries to 
           hide her dismay. But she lets herself be dragged.

                                 KATE
                        Oh, yeah? I figured I was gonna 
                        stay in the little casita--

                                 CHARLIE
                             (undertone)
                        Um, you think I want to hear those 
                        two scream-boning all night?

           On cue, Adrienne gives a PIERCING SQUEAL behind them. 

           Charlie, Kate, and James turn: Adrienne is clutching her 
           untied BIKINI TOP to her chest. Greg easily hoists her over 
           his muscular shoulder. More of Adrienne’s screaming laughter. 
                                 JAMES
                        That Feminist, Gender, & Sexuality 
                        Studies degree, really paying off.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nothing more feminist than our God-
                        given right to fuck hot morons, 
                        sweetie.

                                 KATE
                        Scream-boning sounds...violent?

           Pedro unlocks the bungalow, leading them inside...

           INT. BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS

           Large, breezy, with an open kitchen and a big common area. 
           Wide glass doors open onto a shady patio with outdoor 
           furniture and a massive grill. Just beyond, ocean waves 
           gently slap the beach and hiss back out.

                                 PEDRO
                        Very nice, yes? I will show your 
                        friends to casita now, but call 
                        reception if you need anything!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Gracias, Pedro! And, um, the beach?

                                 PEDRO
                        Yes, no problem! We clean up.

           James and Kate drop the bags while Charlie pokes her head 
           into both bedrooms.

                                 CHARLIE (O.S.)
                        Babe, here’s the queen, bring our 
                        stuff.

           Kate lugs her heavy suitcase into the other room: small, 
           neat, clean. Single bed. She sighs. 

           After heaving her suitcase onto the bed, she opens it up: 
           it’s very neatly packed. 

           REFERENCE BOOKS and MAPS; SWIM-FINS, GOGGLES, SNORKEL, 
           HEADLAMP, a neoprene FANNY PACK, DUCT TAPE, a KNIFE, a 
           COMPASS. Everything looks brand new.

                                 JAMES
                        Whoa.
                                 KATE
                             (jumping)
                        Jesus!

                                 JAMES
                        You like, moving under the sea? 

                                 KATE
                             (smiling)
                        Shut up.

                                 JAMES
                        No, for real, this some Jacques 
                        Cousteau shit going on right here--

                                 KATE
                        Give me a break!

           Charlie PASSES THROUGH the common area. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (calling out to them)
                        No, it’s cool, you guys catch up. 
                        I’ll just carry everything. On my 
                        birthday. 

                                 JAMES
                        Did you hear?

                                 KATE
                        It’s her birthday? No way.

                                 JAMES
                             (gesturing at suitcase)
                        So what’s all this for? You never 
                        even go into the water.

                                 KATE
                        Not the ocean, sure. But you know 
                        how you guys are doing the cenote 
                        cave dive again? I thought maybe 
                        this time...

                                 JAMES
                        Oh, for real? Come with us!

           Outside, Charlie is talking to Pedro, showing him where she 
           wants the beach cleaned. Kate looks out the window at her.

                                 KATE
                             (quieter)
                        I figure it’s the only way to keep 
                        Charlie from hounding me for being 
                        a coward. Like last time.
                                 JAMES
                        She just likes to tease. Doesn’t 
                        mean anything.

           Kate SITS on the bed and gives him A LOOK. They know each 
           other.

                                 KATE
                        I guess you would know. 

                                 JAMES
                        Would I? ...I don’t know. 

                                 KATE
                        What don’t you know? 

           James SITS next to Kate on the bed. 

                                 JAMES
                             (even quieter, closer)
                        How it feels when you’re...not on 
                        the same page anymore. She’s-- 
                        There are problems. With her, with 
                        us. All this time...

                                 KATE
                        I’m sure she’ll just power through 
                        whatever obstacles are in her way. 
                        Shit just bounces right off of her.

                                 JAMES
                             (quietly)
                        There are cracks in everything, 
                        Kate. No one’s invincible. Not even 
                        Charlie. 

           Beat.

                                 KATE
                        Why are you telling me this? 

                                 JAMES
                             (spell is broken)
                        Never mind. It’s fine. We’re fine. 
                        Everything’s fine. Just don’t tell 
                        Charlie I said anything. 

                                 KATE
                        Uh, Charlie and I aren’t really in 
                        the slumber-party-and-secrets phase 
                        of things anymore. Plus, it’s 
                        really not my business.

           Kate begins laying out her gear on the bed, piece by piece.
                                 JAMES
                        Kate--

                                 KATE
                        No, no, it’s ok.

           And it really is: she smiles, relaxed. James picks up a 
           reference book, Exploring Mexico’s Cenotes, and a magazine 
           titled Underwater Speleology. It’s research, all right.

                                 JAMES
                        Same ol’ A-plus, magna cum laude 
                        valedictorian.

                                 KATE
                        First of all, it was Alice Haneda 
                        who was valedictorian and second, 
                        only way to fight fear of the 
                        unknown: minimize the unknown. Oh, 
                        check this out! 

           She pulls a map out, unfolds it: it’s a CAVE SYSTEM, marked 
           up with her notes and highlighted pathways.

                                 JAMES
                        Huh. Is this the one we--

                                 KATE
                        --Ojos Rojos, yeah! I just wanted 
                        to know what I’m getting into. 

                                 JAMES
                             (laughing, tracing a 
                              finger on the map)
                        Where did you even-- Shit, you got 
                        your own itinerary!

                                 KATE
                        Well, there’s a lot of cool stuff 
                        down there. I thought if the guide 
                        doesn’t mind taking some detours--

           She shrugs, suddenly EMBARRASSED. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Last couple years, I’ve been trying 
                        to be more open to new things, you 
                        know? So after we booked our 
                        tickets here, I started getting 
                        ready...
                             (quietly)
                        Anyway, just didn’t want to get 
                        shit on again for skipping out. 
           James reads her mood, taps her on the thigh with his fist.

                                 JAMES
                        Hey, nah, seriously. Proud of you.

           Kate picks up a compass, turns it in her hands to make the N 
           match up with the needle.

                                 KATE
                        Last trip here feels like forever 
                        ago. Doesn’t it?

           Their eyes meet -- and suddenly the air is charged, full of 
           something unspoken but oppressive. Long, long beat.

                                 CHARLIE (O.S.)
                        Wow.

           This time, both Kate and James jump. Charlie’s leaning 
           against the doorjamb, looking like a Sports Illustrated cover 
           in her bikini. She’s silent, ASSESSING. Then she smiles.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t tell us you’re a prepper 
                        now, Kate!

           James jumps up a little too quickly, moves to Charlie and 
           holds her from behind, so they’re both facing Kate.

                                 JAMES
                        Our girl here’s coming with us 
                        tomorrow! To the caves.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Seriously? What about your big 
                        ocean phobia, are you cured?

                                 KATE
                             (softly)
                        Cenotes aren’t the ocean. I’m not 
                        claustrophobic, or anything.
                             (”wait”)
                        Am I?
                             (resolves)
                        No. I’m good. 

           Charlie moves forward smoothly, with deliberation. She picks 
           up the roll of duct tape, twirls it around her wrist.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, sweetie, if you do get 
                        scared...just “stick” with me.
           Charlie smiles, but the air is still TAUT with awkward 
           tension.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Ok, I’m gonna go for a quick dip 
                        before I have to deal with the pig.

           She whirls around and leaves the room.

                                 KATE
                             (to James)
                        The what?

                                                          SMASH-CUT TO:

           CLOSEUP - CHARRED FACE OF A SUCKLING PIG

           PULLING OUT: the piglet’s sizzling away on the patio grill...

           EXT. BUNGALOW - PATIO, TWILIGHT

           Island music on the stereo, sunset rays: EVENING MODE warming 
           up. Everyone’s got First Night of Vacation vibes. Charlie 
           dances alone, margarita in one hand, cigarette in the other.

           Kate and James play CHESS on a tiny travel set at the patio 
           table; Adrienne is making an Instagram story of Greg doing 
           back flips on the sand.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Babe, can you check on the pig?

           James jumps to obey. Charlie drifts over; she’s clearly tipsy 
           but still on her game. Kate glances at the grill, grimaces.

                                 KATE
                        Did we really need a whole pig?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nothing but the best for you 
                        assholes! And it cost a pretty 
                        peso, too, believe me. 
                             (beat)
                        Don’t tell me you’re a vegetarian 
                        now, Kate!

                                 KATE
                        No, it’s just, I mean...it has a 
                        face.
                                 JAMES
                             (to Charlie)
                        It’s done. I guess? I don’t fuckin’ 
                        know, smells good.

           Charlie drains her glass, returns to the grill. James sits 
           back down as Charlie gives a shrill two-finger WHISTLE.

                                 CHARLIE
                        All right, all right! Everybody! 
                        Dinner is served!
                             (in a flawless Miss Piggy 
                              voice)
                        And the star of the show is moi, a 
                        slender yet succulent swine in her 
                        prime!

           Adrienne hoots as Greg dizzily shotguns one more beer. Kate 
           picks up her rook, thinking about where to go.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                             (to James and Kate)
                        Guys, move the board, come on.

           Kate starts to comply, but James stops her.

                                 JAMES
                             (to Charlie)
                        One sec, I got her just where I 
                        want her!

           Charlie, annoyed, comes back to the table, glances at the 
           board for two seconds, then decisively moves Kate’s bishop.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s Kate in three, babe, can we 
                        set the table now?

           She flounces to the kitchen to get plates. James studies the 
           board, registers the moves, then groans.

                                 KATE
                             (amused)
                        Remember when we just like, assumed 
                        she was dumb? Because, you know, 
                        tits?

                                 JAMES
                        Mmm, trophy wife body, first wife 
                        brain! Learned that from Jay-Z. 
                             (then faux-kindly)
                        Hey, though. You don’t look all 
                        that bright yourself, ok? No, I 
                        mean it--
           Kate, laughing, chucks a pawn at him.

                                 KATE
                             (looking beyond him)
                        Speaking of which...

           Greg comes panting up to them like a happy, drunk puppy, 
           somehow already sunburned.

                                 GREG
                        You guys see my moves out there? 
                        Still got it!

           Adrienne runs over, hops onto his back: he carries her weight 
           like it’s nothing. She kisses him on the cheek.

                                 ADRIENNE
                        C’mon. Mush, mush!

           Kate and James watch as she rides him into the kitchen.

                                 JAMES
                             (admiringly, earnestly)
                        She is my hero.

           BUNGALOW - PATIO, NIGHT

           The table is set: hurricane lamps and pillar candles lend a 
           SOFT GLOW to the food and everyone’s face. Soft, indistinct 
           music blends with the muted surf and a distant wind-chime. 
           Everyone’s relaxed, drunk, happy, hungry.

           At the head of the table, Charlie stands, weaving slightly.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Guys, guys. Ok, so before we dig 
                        in! Way back in May, when I first 
                        started planning my birthday and 
                        mentioned coming back here to 
                        James, he was like-- James, what 
                        were you like?

                                 JAMES
                        I was like, “Babe, yo, that’d be 
                        straight-up liiiiit! But like, 
                        remembrance of things past is not 
                        necessarily remembrance of things 
                        as they were.”

                                 CHARLIE
                        Stop showing off, babe, we’ve all 
                        read--
                             (a glance at Greg)
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                        No, he was all, “Waaah, let’s just 
                        throw a party in the city, waaah!” 

                                 JAMES
                             (nodding to others)
                        Truth, truth, that is what I said.

                                 CHARLIE
                        But I wanted to bring us back here, 
                        because-- Well, to be honest, I’ve 
                        never been happier than I was then. 
                        Senior spring. No, no, like, I’m 
                        happy now, too -- babe, don’t make 
                        that face! -- it’s just...

           Charlie takes a huge gulp of her margarita.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I miss that time in our lives so 
                        much. I miss all of you so much. 
                        And like, who knows how much longer 
                        we’ll be able to just drop 
                        everything and get away like this. 
                        God knows it’s been too long since 
                        the last time.

           She looks at Adrienne, James, and ends on Kate.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I love you guys. You’re the only 
                        friends who’ve always let me be my 
                        best self. The only ones who really 
                        know me. Thank you for...for coming 
                        here this weekend, and letting me 
                        relive all that. Even if it’s just 
                        for a few days.

           Long pause. Is Charlie actually getting WEEPY? Without anyone 
           noticing, Kate reaches out and puts her HAND on top of 
           Charlie’s hand. They share A MOMENT. 

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (through cupped hands)
                        Take your top off!

           Light laughter, as James stands and grabs Charlie from behind 
           in a hug. She looks embarrassed.

                                 CHARLIE
                        All right, all right, I’m drunk.
                             (gesturing at piglet)
                        Let’s tear into this bitch.
           BUNGALOW - PATIO, 30 MINUTES LATER

           The moon is high in the night sky, leaving a silver smear on 
           the ocean. 

           VARIOUS SHOTS of everyone drinking and laughing; Charlie is 
           shoving meat into her mouth with an exhibitionist, Skinny-
           Girl-Pigging-Out flair. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Kate, you have to try the cheek! 
                        You’ll love it.

                                 KATE
                        Um, hard pass.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I insist. 

           Charlie tears off a giant hunk off the pig’s face with her 
           fingers. It glistens in her outstretched hand.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re up for trying things you’re 
                        not normally comfortable with, 
                        right? So go ahead.

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (lazily)
                        Shit’s getting real Lord of the 
                        Flies around here, is that strictly 
                        necessary, Charlie?

                                 GREG
                        Shit, I’ll eat it!

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Shh, shh.

           Kate reaches out, takes the meat. She hesitates, then shoves 
           it in her mouth all at once. Chews.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well?

                                 KATE
                             (reluctantly)
                        It’s good.

           Charlie sits on James’s lap. Leans forward, rips off the 
           PIG’S TAIL, puts it in her mouth like a tiny cigar to chew 
           on. She’s so sexy and disgusting at the same time.
                                 CHARLIE
                        There’s one thing I know for sure 
                        in this life, and it’s fuck 
                        vegetarians, Kate.

                                 KATE
                             (laughing, exasperated)
                        Oh my God, I’m not a vegetarian! 
                        Forgive me for caring about 
                        animals, and global warming, and, 
                        you know, the Earth. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Give me a break.

                                 KATE
                        Hmm, you’re a climate change denier 
                        now? Interesting.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, no, I’m not denying anything! 
                        I’ll be the first to say we’re 
                        utterly fucked as a species.

                                 KATE
                        Okaaaay...

                                 CHARLIE
                        So: why bother? Look, Kate--

           Charlie comes and sits on Kate’s lap, strokes her hair.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        In a hundred years, all the major 
                        coastal cities are gonna be 
                        underwater. Just a string of 
                        gorgeous, real-life Atlantises, up 
                        and down the seaboard. But Earth?

           Charlie stands. She whirls around and around, gesturing at 
           the starry, moon-lit sky, the ocean waves.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Earth’s gonna be fiiine! The tides, 
                        the jet-streams, fires and floods 
                        and earthquakes and volcanoes, 
                        they’re outlasting us. And all the 
                        animals strong enough, or smart 
                        enough, or fucked-up enough to 
                        outlive us: they’re gonna be fine.
                                 KATE
                             (wryly)
                        So, we should take what we can get 
                        while we can? Fuck everything?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, Kate. Because guess what: 
                        nature don’t give a fuck about us.

           Charlie sticks the whole pigtail in her mouth, sucks all the 
           meat off of it and pulls out the bones. Grins at everyone.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Yummy.

                                                                CUT TO:

           BEACH - BONFIRE, 1 HOUR LATER

           The moon is higher and smaller in the sky; the bungalow glows 
           in the background. 

           Adrienne and Kate, drunk, share a cigarette by the bonfire, 
           watching the others in the distance: Greg is trying to teach 
           James how to do a flip, while Charlie helpfully criticizes.

                                 ADRIENNE
                        So. Are you surviving?

                                 KATE
                        Sure. I mean, it’s paradise, right?  
                        How’re things with you and li’l 
                        Greggy?

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Hmm, how to put this. Ok, so 
                        imagine you’re eating a cake but 
                        it’s like, 5% cake and 95% icing--

                                 KATE
                        Ok, gross--

                                 ADRIENNE
                        --BUT, but, but! You love icing, 
                        you never get sick of it, you can’t 
                        get enough icing, you’re like, an 
                        icing fiend--

                                 KATE
                        Ok, I get it!
                                 ADRIENNE
                        --and all you want to do is fuck 
                        icing, all day, every day.

                                 KATE
                        That does sound amazing.

           They watch James trying to help Charlie do flips on the sand.

                                 ADRIENNE
                        She’s really happy you’re here.

                                 KATE
                             (scoffs)
                        We hadn’t talked in, like, a year 
                        when I got the invite. 

                                 ADRIENNE
                        People get busy--

                                 KATE
                        We live in the same city, Adrienne. 

                                 ADRIENNE
                        It happens. 

                                 KATE
                        Yeah, well, a lot happens. 

                                 ADRIENNE
                        I’m happy you’re here. I think 
                        it’s...important.

                                 KATE
                        What do you mean, important? Why?

           Adrienne shrugs, a little smile on her face. Charlie falls in 
           the distance, and James tends to her. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                             (softer)
                        It does feel nice to be together 
                        again. I’ve missed this feeling, 
                        too. Not as much as Charlie, maybe, 
                        but still.

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (watching James and 
                              Charlie)
                        You know, I always thought you and 
                        James would end up together.

                                 KATE
                        That’s crazy.
                                 ADRIENNE
                        You guys were always Jim and Pam-
                        ing it in the cutest way, it was 
                        always that, will they or won’t 
                        they thing, until...

           Beat. They watch James and Charlie KISSING, backlit by the 
           moonlight. Kate lies down on the sand, Adrienne follows.

                                 KATE
                        Yeah, well. It was “they won’t.”

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Are you ever like, mad, or--

                                 KATE
                        No, no way. James needs someone 
                        like Charlie. Strong personality. 
                        Or whatever.

           Long silence between them, as Charlie laughs in the distance.

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (lightly)
                        Not really about what James 
                        needs...

                                 KATE
                        It was all a long time ago.

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Ok. Ok. You seem...different.

                                 KATE
                             (laughing)
                        Uh-oh. Different how?

                                 ADRIENNE
                        For one, you called Charlie a 
                        climate change denier. Old Kate 
                        woulda...

                                 KATE
                        ...eaten the entire pig if she 
                        asked me to?

                                 ADRIENNE
                        I was gonna say, would’ve become 
                        the pig, if it made Charlie happy. 

           Adrienne puts her cigarette out, glances at Kate.
                                 ADRIENNE (CONT’D)
                        That’s why it’s important you’re 
                        here. Because--

           Adrienne is interrupted by Charlie running over to them, 
           drunk, laughing, James just behind her.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What are you two plotting over 
                        here?

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Oh, just talking politics, Israel 
                        and Palestine, the usual--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Come on, we’re going skinny-
                        dipping!

           Adrienne stands up and wipes sand off her butt.

                                 ADRIENNE
                        I’m in. 

           Charlie holds her hand out to Kate. Kate shakes her head.

                                 KATE
                        I’m good here. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Come onnnn! Please? For me?

           An uncomfortable beat.

                                 ADRIENNE
                        If she’s good, she’s good, Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ok, ok. Let’s all go tragically 
                        drown. But naked!

           Bikinis and trunks DROP to the sand. Kate watches their 
           bodies disappear into the DARK, CHURNING WATER. 

           Linger on Kate’s face, watching intently, fearful despite 
           herself. The sounds of waves CRASHING, WIND over the sand, 
           crackle of dying fire. The sound of the world, and she’s 
           alone in it. 
           BEACH CHAIRS - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Kate and Charlie sit on wooden chairs, looking up at the 
           night sky. Charlie’s hair is wet, and she wears a thin silk 
           robe. Kate is in shorts and a tank top. 

           They pass a joint back and forth. When they talk, it’s 
           quietly and patiently, as old friends. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Pedro--
                             (holds up the joint)
                        --is the best. Period.

                                 KATE
                        Pedro is 100 percent the best.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Let’s marry Pedro.

                                 KATE
                        Let’s.

           They each take another puff.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                             (tenderly)
                        It was a nice toast.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Was it?

                                 KATE
                        I’m sorry I haven’t, um, seen you 
                        in a while. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I mean, James and I did move to 
                        Harlem. Bushwick might as well be 
                        Baltimore. I get it.

                                 KATE
                        Yeah. Bal-ti-more. I live in 
                        Baltimore. 

           Charlie rests her head on Kate’s shoulder -- a quick burst of 
           warm affection that’s very Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m so glad you’re here, Kate. 
                        Doesn’t this feel so nice? 
                        Familiar.
                                 KATE
                        It really does.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Five years goes by so fast.

                                 KATE
                        Sure. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        ...when you’re having the best sex 
                        ever. 

           A beat. Charlie starts laughing, and Kate joins in. 

                                 KATE
                             (laughing, high)
                        Shut the fuck up. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Never! I will never shut the fuck 
                        up!
                             (beat)
                        I’m glad you came.

                                 KATE
                        You said that already, stoner.

                                 CHARLIE
                        But I am.

                                 KATE
                        And I know.

           The tone is still light, even though they’re getting a little 
           intense. Waves crash.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Kate, come on. Give me something.  

                                 KATE
                             (smiling)
                        I’m here. I ate the pig. I took the 
                        twin bed. Isn’t that the something? 

           Charlie stands and grabs a NEARBY STICK. She starts drawing 
           HUGE LETTERS in the sand in front of Kate. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        See, what you don’t get is that all 
                        of this, this whole thing, isn’t 
                        about you. 
                                 KATE
                        No, no, I know. It’s about you, 
                        birthday girl! 

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, fucker. 
                             (wipes brow)
                        It’s about this. 

           Charlie points to the letters. Kate STANDS to get a better 
           look. Charlie has drawn C + K in the sand. Kate is obviously 
           touched. She stares at it and seems to DRIFT OFF somewhere. 
           Then she SNAPS back. 

                                 KATE
                        I mean, you could have put the K 
                        first. 

           Charlie laughs and POKES Kate, who’s smiling. This is old 
           Kate and Charlie. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        This is very sixth grade of you. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        What can I say? You inspire sixth 
                        grade me. 

           Suddenly, a WHOOSH. A WAVE washes up over their feet, 
           surprising them, and SMEARS Charlie’s drawing. Now it’s 
           illegible. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck.

                                 KATE
                        Well.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (looking down at her smart 
                              watch)
                        No, I mean. Fuck. I think it’s my 
                        birthday right now.

           Kate does a PLAYFUL LITTLE DANCE on the C + K smear, ruining 
           it some more. The mess of it is between her toes now. She 
           looks up at Charlie and GRINS.

                                 KATE
                        Happy fuckin’ birthday, babe.
           INT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           Distinct sounds of SEX, only vaguely muffled through a thin 
           bungalow wall. It’s Charlie and James. 

           Kate rolls over in the dark, trying to shut it out. 

           Close on her eyes: watery with RAGE, getting more and more 
           frustrated, and red, the feeling swells and SWELLS until--

           Kate sits up, SLAMS the wall so hard a piece of it falls off.

                                 KATE
                             (with unleashed fury)
                        SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!!!

           Suddenly: Kate is lying back on the bed, the wall intact, 
           nothing disturbed. The sounds of sex continue. 

           Her rage is real, but her expression of it was imagined. 

           Kate screws her eyes closed and the pitch of James and 
           Charlie’s cries rise until--

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. PATH TO OJOS ROJOS CENOTE - EARLY AFTERNOON

           The loud SCREECHING of a flock of birds suddenly taking 
           flight from a tree, as though fleeing something invisible. 

           Kate looks up, startled.

           The group is hiking on a path through sparse trees, sweating 
           and fighting flies. The women wear bikini tops and shorts, 
           the men are in trunks. Kate has her NEOPRENE PACK on.

           Charlie turns, gestures to Greg’s ASU trunks.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Is ASU paying you?

                                 GREG
                        Huh? No...I bought these?

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Honey, don’t listen to her. She’s 
                        just got PAC-12 jealousy.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (to no one)
                        Pack what?
           Greg and James whoop and holler to hear how far their voices 
           go -- until they are silenced: the path opens up...

           OJOS ROJOS OPENING - CONTINUOUS

                                 KATE
                        Holy shit.

           The entrance to OJOS ROJOS feels prehistoric: a cave opening 
           up from darkness, like something alien emerging from below. 
           It’s filled with crystal clear, neon-blue water, eerily 
           still. A rickety wooden platform leads into the water.

           It is beautiful.

           It is menacing. 

           Kate is shaken to her core.

           Charlie walks up to her and puts an arm around her neck.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Breathe, Kate. We’re gonna be right 
                        here with you. 
                             (trying to distract Kate)
                        Now, should we sing to me here or 
                        wait ‘til we’re inside? I think the 
                        acoustics will be better in the 
                        caves.

           MIGUEL (22, slender, chill, friendly) jogs over to the group.

                                 MIGUEL
                             (searching)
                        Charlie? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s me. It’s my birthday.

           Everyone groans good-naturedly, Charlie gives a What? look.

                                 MIGUEL
                        Ah! Feliz cumpleaños. Me llamo 
                        Miguel. I’ll be your cenote god 
                        today.

                                 KATE
                             (to Adrienne)
                        Did he say “god”?

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Guide. Jesus, you’re not dead yet. 
                                 CHARLIE
                             (whispering)
                        Also, there is no god. 

                                 MIGUEL
                        Now. Who has been to cenote before?

           Everyone raises their hand except Kate.

                                 MIGUEL (CONT’D)
                        Are you good swimmer?

           Kate opens her mouth but can’t answer.

                                 ADRIENNE
                        She’s a fine swimmer. In a pool.

                                 JAMES
                        She’s a little...open-water-shy.

           Miguel takes Kate’s hand and walks her to the wooden 
           platform.

                                 MIGUEL
                        No open water today. Very closed! 
                        Look, you can see the bottom. 10, 
                        15 meters here. Nothing there but 
                        rock. Some fishes. And see, see the 
                        divers! The divers are a-ok. You 
                        will be a-ok with me. 

                                 KATE
                        What about when it’s dark?

                                 MIGUEL
                        Ah! But see, you have your light. 
                        Here, we do orientation.

           On Kate, still looking uncertain.

           PICNIC TABLE - MOMENTS LATER

           While everyone squeezes into their awkward WETSUITS and 
           FLIPPERS, Miguel lays the ground rules.

                                 MIGUEL
                        First rule. If you breathe in water 
                        through snorkel, is bad, come up. 
                        Second rule. Follow me always. Use 
                        flashlight. Watch your head.

           Kate examines the small underwater flashlight around her 
           neck. 
                                 MIGUEL (CONT’D)
                        Stalactite is everywhere. Do not be 
                        surprised by scuba diver. They come 
                        to explore the deep underwater 
                        caves. Very magical. But us, we 
                        stay on surface, unless you know 
                        how to snorkel dive. 

           Kate practices breathing with the snorkel, struggles with her 
           goggles.

           Nearby, a HANDSOME DIVER (35, heavily tattooed) is pulling on 
           a sporty sleeveless suit. Kate smiles at him. He smiles back.

                                 MIGUEL (CONT’D)
                        Try to control breathing. If you 
                        become panic, tell me. If you 
                        become too cold, tell me. If you 
                        become hurt, tell me. I am your 
                        god. This trip is maximum one, 3 
                        hours, with water break in one 
                        cave. I carry water. 
                             (mostly to Kate)
                        Do not worry. I know cenote system 
                        like my own house. I was born in 
                        cenote.

                                 GREG
                        You were born...there?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Seriously, Greg. 

                                 KATE
                        One thing, Miguel. Please.

           Kate gets her new map from her pack and lays it out on the 
           picnic table.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Will we be going to all six caves? 
                        And do we come back via the same 
                        route in reverse? Also, do you 
                        carry first aid supplies? What if--

                                 MIGUEL
                        Yes, ok, all six caves, señorita. 
                        But you must leave some to mystery, 
                        otherwise where is fun?

           Kate sighs. She returns the map to her waterproof pack. 

                                 KATE
                        Ok. 
           She does a check of the rest of her supplies: underwater 
           FLARES, a KNIFE, GAUZE, DUCT TAPE, ROPE, and a WHISTLE. 

                                 MIGUEL
                        We have life jacket, but is 
                        optional. Swimming only with 
                        flippers, very easy.

           Kate quickly grabs a life jacket. Charlie starts to say 
           something, but Adrienne shakes her head: No, Charlie. 

           As everyone walks toward the entrance platform, Kate stays 
           behind, buckling her life jacket.

           Handsome Diver comes over. He shoots a dreamy grin at Kate. 

                                 HANDSOME DIVER
                        Wow, really...prepared, there.

                                 KATE
                             (sheepish)
                        I-- I’ve never done this before.

                                 HANDSOME DIVER
                        I’ve done these caves seven times. 
                        Trust me, you’ll be fine.

                                 KATE
                        Seven times? You keep coming back!

                                 HANDSOME DIVER
                        They keep being totally fucking 
                        beautiful. 

           He looks at her pointedly and Kate flushes.

                                 HANDSOME DIVER (CONT’D)
                        I almost didn’t make it this time. 
                        Planned the dive for Wednesday, but 
                        they closed it after the hurricane. 
                        Just opened back up today... 
                             (beat)
                        You’ll have fun, I promise.

                                 KATE
                        Ok.

                                 HANDSOME DIVER
                        Look, we’ll be on about the same 
                        track. Whenever you feel scared, 
                        just look down. I’ll wink up atcha.

           He FLASHES his headlamp three times: blink blink blink. 
                                 KATE
                             (surprised)
                        Aww, that sounds nice. Thanks. 

           The diver winks and walks toward the platform. Adrienne walks 
           back to Kate, takes her hand and squeezes it.

                                 ADRIENNE
                        It’s like every single time someone 
                        hits on you, you’re shocked. 

                                 KATE
                             (flustered)
                        Was he hitting on me?

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (taps Kate’s pack)
                        No, Kate, I’m sure he was just 
                        wondering what brand of whistle you 
                        prefer to use while snorkeling.

                                 KATE
                             (enthusiastically)
                        Ooh! I switched from basic 
                        stainless steel to these brass ones 
                        from Acme, they are tops. 

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Sometimes I think you’re the 
                        dumbest person I love. And I love 
                        Greg.

           Adrienne walks away. Kate thinks a beat.

                                 KATE
                        Wait, you love Greg?

           ENTRANCE CAVE - AFTERNOON, MOMENTS LATER

           A body CRASHING into the crystal clear water and sinking, 
           before popping violently up.  

           It’s Charlie, grinning, GASPING. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Feels amazing.

           James follows, then Greg and Adrienne. Treading with their 
           flippers, they call to Kate.

                                 JAMES
                        You got this!
                                 GREG
                        Swim, baby, swim!

                                 MIGUEL
                        ¡Venga!

           Kate grips the hand railing as she walks down the underwater 
           steps. She hesitates at the last step. Looks at her friends’ 
           expectant faces.

           She JUMPS. 

           FLASH: Kate and Charlie sitting on a DOCK somewhere. Charlie 
           slips into the water like a fish. From the water:

                                 CHARLIE
                        You make me feel strong. 

           BACK TO CAVE:

                                 MIGUEL
                        Fantástico. Ok, group. Swim around, 
                        get comfortable...

           FOLLOW very closely on Kate: the sound narrows to only her 
           environment, water SLOSHING, shallow BREATHS, fast HEARTBEAT. 

           We feel her struggle. Not to stay afloat, but to stay calm. 

           She looks down at her flippered feet, and the bottom appears 
           so far away. Ahead of her: the DARK MAW of the next cave.

                                 KATE
                             (whispering to James)
                        I don’t think I can do this. 

           James takes her hand underwater. 

                                 JAMES
                        Hold on. Let’s swim a slow lap. 

           Together, they take a slow spin around the edges of the cave, 
           Kate occasionally trailing a free hand along the rock wall.

           Charlie TRACKS them -- pretends not to watch, but sees all.

                                 MIGUEL
                        All right, ok, everybody good? 
                        ¡Vámonos!

           Natural as a sea creature, he slips into the next cave. 
           Charlie casts a BRIEF LOOK back at Kate and James but, 
           unwilling to show any kind of insecurity or neediness, 
           follows Miguel and disappears.
                                 JAMES
                        It’s gonna be great. I promise.

           Kate hesitates -- then trails James into the darkness.

           CAVE #1 - CONTINUOUS

           Magnificent, huge, creepy, dark. LIGHTS bobbing and flashing 
           against the rough walls. ECHOES of laughter, whispers. 
           Adrienne and Greg goof off, spitting water at each other.

           Kate, bobbing in the water, gets DIZZY -- spits out her 
           snorkel, starts GASPING. A panic attack. She RIPS her goggles 
           off as Miguel and James come close, make soothing sounds.

                                 KATE
                        I’m-- I’m so dizzy, I can’t--

           Charlie drifts nearby. Is she worried, or annoyed?

                                 MIGUEL
                        Ah, pick one place, look, look at 
                        one place... Focus...

           Kate complies, staring across the cave at the entrance to the 
           next one. She calms down.

                                 JAMES
                        There you go. Breathe.

           Charlie puts a hand on Kate’s back. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (quiet, soothing)
                        Think of the story you’ll get to 
                        tell when you get home. The 
                        Instagrams. The Instagrams! 

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (to Charlie)
                        For fuck’s sake--

                                 KATE
                        No, actually, it’s, it’s helping...

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Kate, you’re not even on Instagram. 

                                 KATE
                             (a little smile)
                        Yeah, but think of Charlie’s 
                        Instagram!
                                 CHARLIE
                        See? My ‘grams save lives, 
                        Adrienne. 

                                 KATE
                        Sorry, sorry! Go -- I’m ok, go.

           Embarrassed at the fuss she’s made, Kate puts her goggles 
           back on and PLUNGES her face underwater... It’s dark...

           WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!

           Something massive! Drifting, a BLACK SHADOW, distorted by 
           rippled water!

           No...just one of a cluster of THREE DIVERS, swimming by like 
           SEALS...

           Kate can make out more bodies in the CRYSTAL CLEAR water at 
           different depths, including one or two who seem so distant -- 
           their little TWINKLY LIGHTS far away in the shadowy deep.

           A blue-lit TRIO, way deep down, look like ASTRONAUTS 
           exploring the dark abyss of space. Or like ALIENS themselves. 

           One of the furthest lights flashes right at Kate: blink blink 
           blink. The wave of an arm, barely visible.

           Kate POPS up from the water, giant smile on her face--

           WHOA. James is right there. 

                                 JAMES
                        Got yourself a little diving buddy?

           Kate shrugs, a bit embarrassed. Is he jealous?

           Charlie swims between them, her back to James, finally 
           staking her territory.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You all good now, Katie-K?

           You can never tell whether Charlie’s being nice, or a bitch.

                                 KATE
                        Yeah, thanks.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (to James)
                        Want a ride to the next cave, babe?

           She gets James on her back, starts swimming away.
                                 JAMES
                             (hooting)
                        Let the reparations begiiiin!

           It’s cute. Too cute. Kate looks away.

                                 MIGUEL
                        Everyone, please, over here.

           They gather at the entrance to the next cave, where Miguel 
           waits.

                                 MIGUEL (CONT’D)
                        Next cave is very special, but we 
                        must be very quiet. No splashing, 
                        no noise. ¿Comprende?

                                 GREG
                             (whispering)
                        What’s “comprende”? I don’t--

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Shhh.

                                 MIGUEL
                        Kate, please, with me.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Make way, everyone! Special 
                        treatment for Katherine, Duchess of 
                        Fear!

           Kate swims over, embarrassed.

                                 MIGUEL
                             (to Kate)
                        Path to next cave, is very -- ah, 
                        very--

                                 KATE
                        Very what? Miguel?

           Miguel puts his two palms very close together: Narrow.

                                 MIGUEL
                        Is fine. Just stay close. Use 
                        snorkel.

                                 KATE
                        Wait--

           Miguel gently grabs her hand and off they go...
           NARROW TUNNEL BETWEEN CAVE #1 AND CAVE #2

           Boy, is it close in here. The passage is as narrow as a 
           hallway, an aisle, a coffin...

           Miguel’s next to Kate, but he occasionally has to swim a bit 
           ahead of her (because, again, it’s NARROW). Behind her 
           goggles, Kate is FIGHTING PANIC again. Before she can freak--

           Miguel STOPS, turns. Puts his finger to his lips as a 
           reminder: Shhhh.

           Kate swivels, briefly BLINDS Adrienne with her lamp, then 
           gives her the sign: Shhhh. Pass it on.

           She follows Miguel, only her head poking above the water, 
           into the next cave...

           CAVE #2 - CONTINUOUS 

           A HUGE cave: super high ceiling, where a small hole lets a 
           RAY OF SUNLIGHT stream down. But wait -- why do the walls 
           look so weird...

           They’re rippling with nested BATS.

           Hundreds of them. Guano streaks all the walls, and the rocks. 
           From Kate’s reaction, it REEKS in here.

           Miguel ushers each person in, gesturing for silence.

           Kate spins around in awe, staying as quiet as possible. 
           There’s something she LOVES about this cave; she’s suddenly 
           happy she came. What if she had missed this? 

           WIDE from above: We see the line of heads, single file, 
           cutting through the center of the cave, headed to the far 
           exit...

           Miguel swims into the next passage. Charlie, Adrienne, and 
           James are close behind. But Greg -- well, he can’t resist: he 
           swivels around and gives a PIERCING WHISTLE.

           The air fills with leathery WINGS, panicked SQUEAKS, flying 
           RAT BODIES...

           Charlie and Adrienne SCREAM and splash through the passage to 
           the next cave. Greg and James laugh and follow. 

           But Kate -- surprisingly -- lingers, only her eyes poking 
           above the surface. There’s something beautiful about a SWARM 
           in movement together.
           PASSAGE BETWEEN CAVE #2 AND CAVE #3

           Again, the rocky passage NARROWS -- even narrower than the 
           last, with a LOW CEILING to boot. 

           There are some sticky moments, a couple spots where the men 
           really have to SQUEEZE and PUSH themselves through. The group 
           is a little ahead of Kate... a little further now... Damn, 
           it’s dark...

           The passage widens enough for Kate to PUSH FORWARD and swim 
           to catch up--

           Something JERKS HER BACK in the darkness.

           Kate’s eyes WIDEN and she THRASHES around, her light swinging 
           wildly around the rocky space--

           Oh. Her neoprene pack is caught on something. Whoops. She 
           yanks herself free and rushes to catch up with everyone.

           We linger as the water settles. Dark. Forbidding. Silent.

           CAVE #3

           When Kate enters this cave -- large, unremarkable -- 
           everyone’s floating, relaxing. She pulls her goggles up.

                                 MIGUEL
                        Ah, Kate! All good, si?

                                 KATE
                        Good, yeah, great.

                                 MIGUEL
                        Everyone: this is the skeleton 
                        cave. Bones at the bottom.

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Human? Animal?

                                 MIGUEL
                        Both.

           Greg grabs Adrienne and swings her around in the water.

                                 GREG
                             (pirate voice)
                        “You best start believing in ghost 
                        stories, Miss Turner...yer in one.”

           As Adrienne giggles, Charlie swims over to Kate.
                                 CHARLIE
                             (undertone)
                        What are the odds that Greg has 
                        ever seen a non-Disney movie?

           Now he’s singing “Just keep swimming” from Finding Nemo.

                                 KATE
                             (undertone)
                        Slim to none.

           They smile at each other. Suddenly Charlie SHRIEKS, kicks, 
           stares into the water--

                                 CHARLIE
                        What the fuck was--

           James POPS up, his grin dazzling white in the darkness. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                             (laughing)
                        Asshole!

           She starts chasing him through the water. Kate sighs. Alone 
           again. She puts her goggles back on, slowly swims around, 
           staring into the black depths.

           For a long time, nothing. Then, many yards below: a tiny 
           blink blink blink.

                                 ADRIENNE
                        I wish I had a picture of this 
                        shit. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, God, didn’t you see? Kate’s 
                        phone is waterproofed to the 
                        apocalypse degree.

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (to Kate)
                        Seriously? You’re a genius. Take a 
                        picture of us!

           Kate pulls out her waterproofed PHONE while Adrienne and Greg 
           arrange themselves on some high rocks.

           Greg inexplicably puts a flipper in his mouth. Adrienne lets 
           the snorkel dangle from hers. 

           SNAP. Kate takes the photo. 
           Greg swims over to a submerged ledge, starts showing off some 
           underwater handstands. Charlie swims over to him, not one to 
           miss out on some friendly competition. 

                                 ADRIENNE (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna need that phone, Kate. I 
                        have to document this but I don’t 
                        want to subject you to any of it. 

                                 KATE
                        Knock yourself out.

           Kate hands her the phone; Adrienne swims to Greg and Charlie.

           James scoots closer to Kate on the rock. They watch Adrienne 
           and Charlie take a cute selfie with Kate’s phone, then giggle 
           as they make Miguel take a selfie with them, too.

                                 JAMES
                        Always. Be. Influencing.

                                 KATE
                        Hashtag, muy auténtico.

           From the corner, Charlie whoops. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (pointing to Greg’s 
                              crotch)
                        Hey, Kate! Do your maps have this 
                        on it? 

           Not understanding, Kate pulls a laminated map out of her 
           pack, peers at it. James palms it down. 

                                 JAMES
                        She was kidding. 
                             (to the group)
                        You guys might be half the assholes 
                        if you had a third the knowledge 
                        Kate has!

                                 CHARLIE
                             (cheerfully)
                        Cool speech, bro! 

           James speaks quietly to Kate, as the cave echoes. 

                                 JAMES
                        I like your maps.

                                 KATE
                        At least someone does. 
                                 JAMES
                        Cut her some slack. It’s her--

                                 KATE
                        --birthday, I know, I heard. 

           As if on cue, Adrienne and Greg start SINGING “Happy 
           Birthday” to Charlie, who’s doing a perfect handstand--

           --but Adrienne breaks off with a SHRIEK. A Something’s Wrong 
           kind of shriek. 

           She’s swimming away furiously, yelling. Charlie and Greg are 
           also backing up. 

           Kate withdraws her feet from the water. James stands.

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (breathless)
                        It’s-- They’re -- dead!

           WIDE from above: we see the cave is FULL of DEAD FISH 
           floating on the surface. 

           Closer now: it’s not just fish, but WEIRD OCEAN LIFE -- 
           JELLYFISH like plastic bags, NEON FISH that shouldn’t be 
           here, tiny SQUID, an OCTOPUS, even a GULL. All dead.

           A panic sweeps through the group, except for Miguel. 

           He treads in the center of the cave, and as chattering in the 
           group increases, FOCUS IN on Miguel. Trying to comprehend. 
           Sound narrows to his feet and arms treading water. 

           SNAP BACK to Kate. She’s got her map out again. 

                                 KATE
                        There’s a cave that opens up to the 
                        Gulf, just ahead of us.

                                 MIGUEL
                        Si, si. But opening is very high.

                                 KATE
                        Maybe the storm flooded ocean water 
                        into here? But saltwater animals 
                        can’t survive in fresh water. So, 
                        they died, and the underwater 
                        currents made the bodies collect 
                        here--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Wow, thanks, Sherlock. Let’s get 
                        the fuck out of here. 
           Miguel makes for the exit to the cave. It’s definitely time 
           to fucking go. One by one, they EXIT through a passage.  

           From ABOVE, the Skeleton Cave is empty now. 

           Except. 

           With slicing menace. 

           A barely visible, MASSIVE SHADOW glides past underwater. 

           WIDE TUNNEL PASSAGE 

           Led by Miguel, the group swims through a WIDE TUNNEL with 
           other tunnels branching away from it. 

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Where do these go?

                                 MIGUEL
                        Cave system is complicado.

                                 KATE
                        That one up there is the one I was 
                        talking about. That leads to the 
                        ocean. Maybe we could--

                                 MIGUEL
                             (tight voice)
                        No time today. 

           As they pass that branch, Kate LOOKS at it a beat. 

                                 GREG
                             (a beat behind everyone)
                        Wait...why were there human bones 
                        in that last cave?

           Miguel stops swimming and turns to face them. His face is 
           serious. Suddenly, it’s very quiet. 

                                 MIGUEL 
                        The caves, they are master. We are 
                        just guest. If you do not breathe 
                        right, or swim right, done. If you 
                        do not respect the cave: done. 

           Miguel turns abruptly and swims on. 

                                 GREG
                        Did I ask the wrong question? 
           CAVE #4

           They enter the serene LEDGE CAVE. 

           It’s a smooth, inverted bowl with nothing to hold on to, no 
           rocks, nothing except a NARROW LEDGE running an arm’s length 
           above the water line, all the way around. 

           Greg reaches up and starts doing pull-ups on the ledge, 
           facing the wall. Kate and Charlie share an eye-roll...but 
           then look back to Greg. It is kinda hot.

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Let me try!

           Adrienne, barely able to reach the ledge, tries to do a pull-
           up and fails, splashes back into the water. 

                                 ADRIENNE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck it, I don’t need muscles, I 
                        have a masters. 

                                 GREG
                             (grunting)
                        That’s right, baby.

                                 JAMES
                        I could do that if I wanted to, but 
                        I’m busy.

           Charlie swats him with some water. 

                                 GREG
                             (earnest)
                        C’mon, James, you can do it!

           While James tries, Miguel looks around, still inspecting, 
           investigating. What is he looking for?

           Charlie’s at one side of the smooth cave wall, treading. Kate 
           swims over to join her. 

                                 KATE
                        This is wild. 

                                 CHALRIE
                        Right? I feel like we’re really 
                        inside the earth. 

           Kate flashes her lamp at Charlie briefly. She grins. 

                                 KATE
                        Are we technically spelunkers now?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Fuck yeah, we are. 

           This is a nice moment.

           SUDDENLY: Kate feels something bump against her flippered 
           foot. She lets out a YELL, JUMPS and SPLASHES, getting 
           Charlie in the face.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        What? What? More dead stuff? 

           Kate, WHIMPERING a little, tries to SCRAMBLE up the wall, but 
           she can’t get a hold. Adrienne swims over. She’s breathing 
           heavy. She’s freaked out. 

                                 ADRIENNE
                        You’re okay. You’re okay. 

                                 KATE
                        No, it’s not -- I mean, I’m not 
                        having a panic attack. I felt 
                        something! Against my foot. 

                                 JAMES
                             (from afar)
                        Prolly your hunky tattooed diver 
                        man!

           Adrienne puts her goggles on and peers down into the water. 
           She comes back up.

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Nothing. There’s nothing. But maybe 
                        we dragged some crap in from the 
                        dead animals cave... 

           Kate and Charlie shudder. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Kate, gimme your knife. 

                                 KATE
                             (small voice)
                        I felt something. 

           Kate hands over her knife. Charlie takes it solemnly -- then 
           starts STABBING at the water, GRINNING at Kate. She’s 
           stabbing at nothing, of course. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        See? I handle it.

           Close on the knife thrusts. Little VIOLENT splashes of water.
           CAVE #5

           Again from ABOVE, we see our group swim into a cave that 
           finally, really, looks like a cave: STALAGMITES protrude from 
           the water, STALACTITES hang from the LOW CEILING. Water 
           DRIPS. Some of the sharp rocks GLITTER.   

                                 MIGUEL
                        Cuidado. Very sharp, go slow.

                                 KATE
                             (softly)
                        Wow. 

           This cave demands the respect Miguel spoke of. They whisper. 
           They swim very, very SLOWLY to avoid getting scratched up. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Some of these are, like, 200,000 
                        years old. They grow super-slowly. 
                        Like, centimeters per millennium. 

           Kate reaches out to touch a sharp one, and at the last minute 
           pulls her hand away. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        We’re like...in living history. 

           Kate looks down and shines her underwater flashlight on the 
           stalagmites around her. So many, like a FOREST OF ROCK. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        The maps didn’t really get into--

           A SHOUT. Adrienne again. 

           UNDERWATER: we see a tiny RIBBON OF BLOOD unfurl from 
           Adrienne’s calf. 

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Shit!

           Next to her, Greg’s breaths get shallow. Kate swims over and, 
           with James’s help, HOISTS Adrienne onto a rock. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (to Greg)
                        You ok there, Hemsworth?

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (wincing)
                        Oh, fuck, right -- he has this 
                        thing. About blood. 
                                 GREG
                             (gasping)
                        And... asthma...

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?

                                 GREG
                             (coughing now)
                        And asthma! 

           Kate gets out GAUZE and DUCT TAPE from her neoprene. 

                                 KATE
                             (to no one and everyone)
                        Aren’t you glad I brought my 
                        prepper stuff now? 

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Fuck nature. 

           Kate inspects: it’s a FAIR-SIZED scrape, oozing watery blood. 
           She starts patting it dry with some of the gauze. 

                                 JAMES
                        Seriously, man, asthma? Do you have 
                        your inhaler?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Where would he keep his inhaler? 
                        Kate’s psycho bag is full.

           Greg’s face is reddened. PANIC is setting in. The group is 
           dissolving into DISARRAY. 

                                 GREG 
                        Is it done? The blood? 

                                 KATE
                             (to James and Charlie)
                        Can you guys calm him down?

           Kate has made a little gauze pad, and is fastening it to 
           Adrienne’s leg by wrapping her whole calf in duct tape. 
           Adrienne grits her teeth.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                             (to Adrienne)
                        Can you swim? I dried you off 
                        pretty good so the tape should 
                        hold.
           This is Kate shining, taking care of things. Adrienne’s 
           grateful for the tenderness while Charlie and James awkwardly 
           try to calm Greg. 

           Miguel stands on the tallest rock he can find. 

                                 MIGUEL
                        Company policy is, return if 
                        injury. We go back now. 

           Charlie CLIMBS up next to him. She puts a hand on his arm.

                                 CHARLIE
                        We’re almost to the end. Reconsider 
                        your policy. 

           Miguel looks wary. Greg is calming down. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Look, our girl is fine. Captain 
                        America over there is fine. We’re 
                        all fine. 
                             (to Adrienne and James)
                        And this last cave is a cannot-
                        fucking-miss, you guys, remember?

           Kate stares at her. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Whattaya think, Kate? Ms. Maps? 
                        It’s the best one, and you’ve never 
                        seen it. You have to see it. 

                                 KATE
                        If Miguel says we should go, maybe 
                        we should go? Don’t you think? 
                        Like, Adrienne’s bleeding, she’s 
                        held together with literal duct 
                        tape--

                                 CHARLIE
                             (exasperated)
                        Honestly, it was just a scratch! 
                        Adrienne, right?

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Your concern is truly touching, 
                        Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’ll add ten minutes to our trip, 
                        tops.
                                 KATE
                        But seriously, shouldn’t we listen 
                        to the only expert here...?

           She looks helplessly at James...who is NO HELP at all.

           Miguel starts to speak but is cut off by Charlie. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (in Spanish, dead serious)
                        The next cave. Now. Or I will 
                        report you. 

           Miguel, now threatened, climbs down from the rock. He is a 
           man without a care now: It’s your fuckin’ grave, gringa.

                                 GREG
                             (cracking)
                        What? What’s happening?

                                 MIGUEL
                             (to Adrienne)
                        Your choice.

           Adrienne sighs. Charlie swims over with a pleading look.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You don’t have to get me anything 
                        else! Coming with me to the last 
                        cave can be my present--

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (exasperated, relenting)
                        Bitch, this whole trip is your 
                        present! I took time off work! 
                             (to Greg)
                        Greg, hey, it’s ok. No more blood.

           Adrienne gives her legs an experimental kick. Everyone waits, 
           Charlie with a cartoonish hopefulness. Kate’s frustrated -- 
           but not enough to protest again.

                                 ADRIENNE (CONT’D)
                             (sighing)
                        All right. But let’s make it fast.

           Miguel swims toward the cave exit and the others follow. 
           After Greg, Adrienne -- grim-faced -- brings up the rear.

           PASSAGEWAYS TO CAVE #6

           They move quietly, tensely. Charlie’s annoyed, Miguel’s 
           pissed. The passageways Miguel takes keeps branching off.  
                                 KATE
                        Didn’t we just make two right 
                        turns?

           But no one answers. Just silent swimming. They take another 
           turn and CREEP through a passageway as it narrows.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                             (trying)
                        There’s a whole...system. 
                        Underneath. 

           And deep below: blink blink blink. We see it. Kate doesn’t. 

           It’s super-narrow, a single-file kind of situation, with 
           stalagmites poking up through the water. Everyone’s BREATH is 
           labored, close. 

           A brief, high YELP from Greg. 

           Close on Greg’s face, crushed up against the ceiling of the 
           passageway. His lower body THRASHES. He’s a big guy. STUCK. 

                                 GREG
                             (gasping)
                        Guys? I can’t -- I’m -- help -- I 
                        can’t move -- Something’s got me--

           There’s no turning around for anyone, it’s so tight. 
           Everyone’s TALKING at once, trying to figure it out. 
           Eventually Miguel DIVES UNDER all of them. 

           While he’s under, it’s deadly silent but for the knocking of 
           water against the cave walls, and close, wet breathing. 

           Finally, Miguel POPS up next to Greg.

                                 MIGUEL
                        Just foot! Ok now. Is ok. 

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Just breathe, ok? 

                                 JAMES
                        These fuckin’ stalagmites are all 
                        under us. 

           Greg breathes slowly, and one by one, they move on. 

           Underwater, Adrienne’s swim fins flick, barely touching 
           SOMETHING IN THE DARK. Then gone. 
           CAVE #6

           Wow, Charlie wasn’t kidding: this cave is breathtaking. 

           As our group swims in, there’s a sense that everyone’s 
           thinking, Ok, this was worth it. It’s a reprieve from the 
           tenseness.

           The cave GLOWS with PHOSPHORESCENCE. Everyone swishes their 
           hands and fins to make FAIRY SPARKLES in the water. MAGICAL.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (to Kate, in fake-Kate 
                              voice)
                        “Thank you for forcing us to come 
                        to the last cave, Charlie.” Oh 
                        yeah, no prob, guys, here to help.

           But she’s grinning, and Kate reluctantly smiles back. Over by 
           Adrienne, Greg pulls out his dick underwater (offscreen), 
           waves it around:

                                 GREG
                             (to Adrienne)
                        Whoooooo, I’m a unicorn! My jizz is 
                        magical!

           She laughs. In his dumb Greg way, he’s helping her relax. 
           Everyone’s feeling more normal. Except Miguel, still alert. 

           FROM FAR, FAR BELOW: We look up at our happy gang, their 
           bodies tracing sharp shadows at the distant surface.

           A deeply beautiful yet utterly foreboding image.

           Charlie and Greg are having an underwater somersault 
           competition, with Adrienne as the judge. James swims over to 
           Kate again. They speak in an undertone.

                                 JAMES
                        So, you glad you came today?

           Kate lets a beat stretch out.

                                 KATE
                             (quietly)
                        What was that, back there?

                                 JAMES
                        What’re you talking about?

                                 KATE
                        I needed you to back me up. 
                        Adrienne needed you to back us up.
                                 JAMES
                        Don’t make this into a big thing--

                                 KATE
                        No, it’s just kind of like, if the 
                        world doesn’t conform to Charlie’s 
                        needs, she pulls a meltdown out of 
                        her back pocket until she gets what 
                        she wants. Even if her friend is 
                        literally bleeding...

           James shrugs, looking into the water. What’s he supposed to 
           say? He doesn’t have the balls to stand up to Charlie. But no 
           one else does either.

           WHOA! Charlie POPS up from underwater, just in front of them.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I won.

                                 JAMES
                        Huh? What’s that?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I beat Greg. Over there. Weren’t 
                        you watching?

                                 KATE
                        He didn’t need to. You always win.

           Charlie and Kate trade smiles that have miles of meaning 
           under the surface.

                                 MIGUEL
                             (firmly)
                        We go now.

           Everyone turns. Miguel is at the entrance to the cave.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Where are all the divers, Miguel? I 
                        haven’t seen them in here.

                                 MIGUEL
                        Not many people this far in.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (triumphantly)
                        We’re not “many people,” my friend.

                                 MIGUEL
                        But we go now. Vámonos.

           From his face, he’s DEEPLY UNEASY.
           PASSAGEWAYS TO CAVE #5

           The gang’s pretty tired. It’s that point where you’re like, 
           Ugh, shit. I forgot how long it took us to get here.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I can’t wait to suck down a giant 
                        marg. Adrienne, how’s your leg?

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (”Now you care?”)
                        Fine.

           Miguel keeps putting his face underwater, like he’s looking 
           for something. 

           Or looking OUT for something...

                                 ADRIENNE (CONT’D)
                        Actually... My legs are cramping up 
                        a little. Can we take a break 
                        before that insane cave with all 
                        the rocks?

           They’re close to the entrance to the stalagmite cave.

                                 MIGUEL
                        Yes, short break. Very short, si?

           Kate swims over to Adrienne.

                                 KATE
                        Hey. Do you want my life vest? I 
                        don’t really need it.

                                 ADRIENNE
                        God, I know I should say no, but 
                        yes, that would be amazing. Thanks.

           Life vest on, Adrienne floats on her back with a big sigh. 

           Kate DIVES into the water to look for her hot scuba buddy.

           Very dark, very deep. She turns off her headlamp: now it’s 
           BLACK. She tries blinking her own light: blink blink blink.

           Darkness...then, way, way down: blink blink--

           Behind her mask, Kate frowns. She swims a little deeper, her 
           headlamp illuminating nothing but blue water--

           A RED CLOUD surrounds her.

           Confusion, then horror: OH GOD-- BLOOD--
           Kate SCREAMS an underwater scream, air bubbling out, her 
           headlamp swinging WILDLY in the RED MURK. A small THING 
           floats past, she instinctively grabs it, thrashes up...

           Kate BREAKS the surface GASPING and screaming, COUGHING. 
           BLOOD sloughs off her. Everyone turns.

                                 JAMES
                        Hey, hey, what’s wrong?

                                 KATE
                        Look--!

           She holds up the THING: it’s a TORN HEADLAMP. She’s shaking 
           uncontrollably.

                                 JAMES
                        What is that?

                                 KATE
                        It’s ripped up-- The diver-- there, 
                        there’s all this blood, he’s hurt 
                        or something--

                                 GREG
                        BLOOD?!

           He’s already scrambling over to the lone rock jutting into 
           the cave, pulling himself onto it. Adrienne looks confused, 
           Charlie annoyed.

                         ADRIENNE
                                                          JAMES
           Babe, it’s ok, wait, 
           everything’s ok, hang on--
                                              Don’t go losing your shit 
                                              again, big man--

                                                         MIGUEL
                          CHARLIE
           Everyone, calm the fuck down!
                                              Kate, please, can you--

           Miguel takes the torn headlamp from her. Everyone shuts up, 
           except for Greg, who’s starting to wheeze already.

           Miguel examines the ripped elastic and shattered glass.

           Silence. Then--

                                 MIGUEL (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        Tiburon.

                                 GREG
                             (screaming)
                        MY AUNT LIVES IN TIBURON! THAT 
                        MEANS SHARK! THERE’S A FUCKING 
                        SHARK IN HERE!
           What an inconvenient time for Greg to finally know something.

           Everyone flattens themselves against the cave walls (except 
           skeptical Charlie), starts yelling and screaming: ad-libbing 
           disbelief, fear, anger. With the ECHOES, it’s total insanity.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m sorry, but there is not a shark 
                        in this freshwater cave system!

                                 KATE
                        Actually, there are sharks that can 
                        survive in fresh and salt water--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t actually me, Kate! How would 
                        a shark even get into these caves? 
                        Did it call a fucking Lyft? 

           Kate, as always, subsides into silence. Greg, gasping, is 
           pulling SHIVERING Adrienne up onto the tiny rock with him. 
           There’s barely enough room for them both. 

           Now Miguel and Charlie are ARGUING in quiet, rapid Spanish. 
           Kate’s trying to follow, but her high school Spanish is no 
           match. James is looking helpless (what’s new).

                                 MIGUEL
                        Enough. We go, now, fast. Rápido.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Wait, wait. WAIT! What are we going 
                        to do, race through all those 
                        stalagmites and get shredded?

           Everyone looks at her like, You got any better ideas? So she 
           tries a different tack.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Also, am I the only one who cares 
                        that there might be a freakin’ 
                        diver who’s hurt down there? Not 
                        from a shark, but clearly something 
                        happened to him. 
                             (to Kate)
                        I mean, he’s your little buddy, 
                        don’t you want to see if he’s--

                                 MIGUEL
                        No! Diver did not hire me, you hire 
                        me. I keep you safe.

           Unseen by anyone, a tiny THREAD OF BLOOD, no thicker than a 
           hair, trickles down from Adrienne’s duct tape bandage.
           Charlie is screaming at Miguel in Spanish (something not 
           woke, you can be sure of that).

           Kate looks at James: Do something! James is like, Look at 
           her, you can’t talk to her when she’s like this.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Look, I don’t think we should just 
                        rush out of here like crazy people, 
                        someone’s actually going to get 
                        hurt if we do that--

                                 MIGUEL
                        ¡Cállate! Everyone, follow me. We 
                        go.

           He swims to the entrance to the next cave, looks back. They 
           all look at Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (steely)
                        No one is leaving yet. We stick 
                        together. Miguel, here’s the plan--

                                 MIGUEL
                        Fuck you.

           To everyone’s surprise, even Charlie’s, he turns and swims 
           away. He’s GONE.

           A long silence, except for Greg trying not to hyperventilate. 
           Everyone stares at Charlie. She recovers quickly.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ok, well, fuck that guy. We know 
                        the way back. Hell, Kate has like, 
                        five maps! And I was keeping track, 
                        too, by the way. Let’s not panic, 
                        for fuck’s--

           SPLASH! 

           The diver’s HAND and TATTOOED ARM shoots up in the center of 
           the cave, breaking the water, waving: HELP!

                                 KATE
                        Oh my God, that’s him!

           She swims over as fast as she can, GRABS his hand to PULL HIM 
           UP...

           It’s just a bloody arm.

           Everyone. Fucking. SCREAMS.
           CAVE #5

           The stalagmite cave again. They swim slowly, to avoid getting 
           sliced. And holy shit, has the mood ever changed.

           We see each GRIM FACE in order: Charlie in the lead, slim and 
           graceful; James close behind, looking back for Kate, who is 
           angry and scared; Adrienne, exhausted and pale as hell, next 
           to Greg, who is OPENLY WEEPING as he swims.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (hissing)
                        Greg, I swear to God, if you don’t 
                        fucking stop blubbering--

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Charlie, can you just--? Please.

           Kate drops back a little to talk to Adrienne.

                                 KATE
                             (whispering)
                        Are you ok, Aid?

           With a shock, Kate sees how frightened Adrienne is.

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (whispering)
                        My leg...I think the tape’s a 
                        little loose? And maybe... I’m 
                        still bleeding? Oh, God, Kate... 
                        Don’t tell Charlie, ok--

                                 KATE
                             (whispering)
                        Shh, it’s ok. We’re gonna get out 
                        of here, all of us. Together.

           On Charlie: She can hear everything. Her face hardens.

           Swimming... Swimming... Swimming...

           Suddenly -- everyone seems to realize at once: Why can’t we 
           hear Greg?

                                 ADRIENNE
                        Greg?

           Silence.

                                 ADRIENNE (CONT’D)
                             (alarmed)
                        GREG!
           Her voice ECHOES.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (hissing)
                        Shut up! Do you want it to hear us?

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (out of her mind)
                        FUCK YOU, CHARLIE! GREEEEEEG!

           A huge, wheezing GAAAAAAAAASP! From the side of the cave.

           James is first to reach Greg, cowering behind a stalagmite. 
           He’s deep in an ASTHMA ATTACK, looking utterly TERRIFIED.

                                 GREG
                        Please... I’m sorry... just... 
                        just, don’t... leave-me-here...

           He’s staring at Charlie -- because he’s talking only to her. 
           Greg may be dumb, but even he knows who’s in charge.

                                 JAMES
                        Hey, hey, big man! What are you 
                        talking about? I’m counting on you 
                        to Aquaman our way outta this shit.

           Greg’s really trying not to cry. He squeezes out a smile.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Jesus Christ. Give him the life 
                        vest, Adrienne. I’ll drag his ass 
                        out of here myself.

           They strap the vest on Greg (even maxing out the straps, it 
           barely fits). He floats on his back and Charlie dutifully 
           starts pulling him by the scruff... carefully, carefully... 

           Painfully slow. Painfully suspenseful. 

           Now James takes over Greg duty, letting Charlie swim ahead 
           again.

           But ok. They’re past the worst of it now, almost to the 
           entrance of CAVE #4 (inverted-bowl ledge cave)--

           Adrienne, who’s fallen behind, SCREAMS.

           Everyone turns.

           IT’S A FIN.

           Oh, God -- it PASSES Adrienne... ZOOMS toward the others, 
           cutting the water clean like a knife, which is AWFUL... 
           Then it disappears. Which is so much worse.

           No one breathes. Not even Greg. The world may have stopped 
           spinning, for all they know.

           As if by MAGIC, Greg is WHIPPED into the nearest rock 
           formation. CRUNCH: his skull, bashed.

           Everyone SCREAMS.

           The shark, underwater, has him by the LEGS -- we track Greg’s 
           LIFE-VESTED upper body as it’s DRAGGED all around the cave, 
           SMASHING into stalagmites, RICOCHETING violently from one to 
           the next, flesh RIPPING to shreds against the rocks. 

           Absolutely HORRIFIC and GORY! Everyone’s screaming!

           Barely conscious, close to DEAD, Greg SWISHES past Adrienne-- 

           She GRABS him, screaming -- and now ADRIENNE is pulled along, 
           too, back toward the others -- until Greg is finally DRAGGED 
           UNDERWATER, taking Adrienne under with him.

                           JAMES
           Fuck!
                                                          KATE
                                              Adrienne, noooo!

           Charlie looks stunned. Now what?

           But Adrienne POPS up, spluttering, RIGHT IN FRONT of them.

           Crying, she struggles to go BACK to Greg, somewhere 
           underwater, but James and Kate drag her into the next cave...

           CAVE #5

           ...where Charlie has already pulled herself onto the NARROW 
           LEDGE. She kneels sideways -- one leg in front of the other -- 
           reaches a hand down.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (to James and Kate)
                        Hurry, you push, I’ll pull. 

           Working together, they get Adrienne onto the ledge. Then 
           Kate’s pushed/pulled up. Finally, James. 

           The ledge is too narrow to sit on, but the sloping bowl 
           ceiling means they can’t stand comfortably, especially with 
           their clumsy flippers.

           But ok. They’re safe. For now--
           Except, oh, God: Adrienne is a bloody mess. Her arms and legs 
           are SHREDDED from hanging on to Greg while he was pinballed. 
           She looks like fucking Carrie in a cave. And she is in SHOCK.

           Kate is crying as she tries to comfort zombified Adrienne. 
           She gets gauze out of her neoprene pack, starts dabbing, 
           but... Jesus. What’s the point?

                                 KATE
                             (lying)
                        They-- ok, these are pretty 
                        shallow, actually? I think they’ll, 
                        like, scab over... Let’s wait for 
                        the water to dry and see what--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sharks can smell a drop of blood in 
                        a lake. It’s not going to work.

                                 JAMES
                        C’mon, guys, let’s--

                                 KATE
                        So now you’re a shark expert, 
                        Charlie? We’ll tape her up--

                                 CHARLIE
                        That shit doesn’t work, and you 
                        both know it. 
                             (to Adrienne)
                        Your leg was bleeding back there. 
                        Yeah, I heard you two whispering 
                        about it. 
                             (beat)
                        You basically left a little trail 
                        of bloody breadcrumbs. And look 
                        what happened.

           A stunned silence. This is going too far, even for Charlie. 
           Something SNAPS inside Kate.

                                 JAMES
                        Jesus, Charlie. 

           Looks like James grew a pair, finally. But when Charlie CUTS 
           A LOOK at him, he looks away, silent. 

                                 KATE
                             (razors in her voice)
                        You’re blaming her? We could’ve 
                        turned around when she first cut 
                        her leg and none of this would’ve 
                        even happened. If it’s anyone’s 
                        fault, it’s yours. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        Because I’m supposed to know a 
                        fucking shark would be—-

                                 JAMES
                        Shhhhhh!

           A FIN blades through the water, entering the cave. As the 
           group watches, FROZEN, the fin cuts a slow circle around and 
           around, looking for its prey. 

           Very quietly, Adrienne starts to GIGGLE. A little louder. Now 
           it’s a LAUGH. Then hysterical HOWLING. She’s lost it.

                                 ADRIENNE
                        It’s -- it’s like a cartoon! I 
                        can’t -- what if it’s just, like, a 
                        guy, wearing a fin hat on his, his--

           She’s dissolving into mania. No one moves. The fin circles. 
           Adrienne melts into CRYING. 

                                 ADRIENNE (CONT’D)
                        Greg was so sweet, you guys. Like, 
                        really sweet. Oh my God, he talked 
                        to his mom every night, she--

                                 CHARLIE
                             (hissing)
                        Be fucking serious for once in your 
                        life, Adrienne. 

           Adrienne starts to WAIL. Charlie SHOUTS at her.

                     CHARLIE (CONT'D)
           Shut the fuck up! Do you want 
           to get us killed? Stop it! 
           Shut up shut up shut up!
                                                          JAMES
                                              Come on, guys. Both of you. 
                                              Just take a breath. Ade, I’m 
                                              so sorry. Charlie, give her a 
                                              minute. Just one minute.

           Enough is enough. Kate opens her mouth and SCREAMS a primal 
           scream, one that fills the entire cave, her neck veins 
           throbbing. She is DONE with Charlie.

                                 KATE
                        SHUUUUT UUUUUUUP!!!!!

           The fin slips underwater, out of sight. 

           Charlie turns to Kate. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (dangerously)
                        What did you say to me? 
           Kate’s still vibrating with newfound rage. It looks 
           unfamiliar on her, and maybe she’s even a little scared of it 
           still, but she’s leaning into it. 

                                 KATE
                        You are not...always...the decider.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (scream-whispering)
                        Then who is? You? James? When have 
                        you ever decided something in your 
                        entire miserable life? You, who 
                        can’t commit to a job or a man or 
                        anything, because you’re afraid of, 
                        what? Failure, rejection? God, 
                        Kate. Life will be much easier if 
                        you accept it. You’re the kind of 
                        person who is just. Fucking. 
                        Average. I mean, hell. The last 
                        time you decided to really go for 
                        something, God, that had to be 
                        about five years ago, right?
                             (to James)
                        Right?

           SOUNDLESS FLASH

           Five years ago. Lightning fast images: James’s hand on Kate’s 
           bare thigh. Her tiny room on the beach. Darkness. Mouths open 
           to the shape of moaning. 

           BACK IN THE CAVE

           Oh, shit. Now it’s out there. Charlie knows something. 
           Something true. The mix of RESPECT and RESENTMENT on her face 
           reveals her, finally. Even Adrienne quiets. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        You thought I didn’t know.

           SOUNDLESS FLASH

           James’s hand pulls at a sheet. Moving up his leg, his ass, 
           his lower back. 

           On Charlie: smoking a cigarette on the beach, in the dark. 

           BACK IN THE CAVE

                                 JAMES
                        Let’s all just take a breath.

           But no one is paying any attention to James. 
                                 KATE
                             (evenly)
                        I thought those were “your best 
                        days”? It doesn’t even matter, 
                        Charlie. A quick fuck behind your 
                        back? It changed nothing. You 
                        stayed exactly who you were, and I 
                        stayed exactly who I was, and that 
                        was just perfect, wasn’t it? That’s 
                        exactly the way you wanted it. 

           A beat. The sound of water lightly sloshing. 

           Charlie’s SHOCK at being spoken to this way subsides into 
           shrewd calculation. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You know why he did it, right?

           Silence. James opens his mouth but says nothing.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                             (thickly)
                        He felt sorry for you. Scared of 
                        the water, left behind all day. 
                        Poor little thing. 

           SOUNDLESS FLASH

           James’s face as he pauses before leaving her room. Something 
           like regret and lust, intermingled.

           Kate alone in that room, staring up at the ceiling. Looking 
           shocked at herself, but happy -- and feeling her POWER, for 
           once.  

           BACK IN THE CAVE

           Now, here in this cave, Kate’s remembering what it felt like 
           to have that brief taste of SECRET DOMINANCE over Charlie.

                                 KATE
                        You weren’t expecting me to do 
                        that, were you? Not little mousy 
                        Kate. But you were wrong. Just like 
                        you’ve been wrong all day today. 
                        ‘Cause, ACTUALLY, there is a shark 
                        that can survive in both salt and 
                        freshwater. It’s called a bull 
                        shark and it adapts, Charlie. It 
                        kills -- that’s what it’s built to 
                        do -- and it adapts.
           Adrienne WHIMPERS, breaking the tension. Kate inches toward 
           her and pulls out some more DUCT TAPE.

                                 CHARLIE
                        This is a waste of time. We should 
                        be getting the fuck out of here. 
                        But we can’t tow her around. 

                                 ADRIENNE
                             (crying)
                        I’m right here! 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m sorry, babe. Look, we can send 
                        help. The shark can’t get you up 
                        here. 

                                 ADRIENNE
                        You want me to...wait here? Stand 
                        here and...wait?

           The idea is cold and absurd. It hangs in the air. 

                                 ADRIENNE (CONT’D)
                             (small)
                        I don’t want to die.

           It’s a plea to a tribunal.

           The FIN reappears, cutting through the pool. The splitting of 
           water is the only sound. It heads OUT OF THE CAVE, toward the 
           entrance of the cenote system. 

           A little sigh. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Now. Now we move. Give me the map, 
                        Kate. I’m getting us out of here. 

           Kate, newly full of rage and power, gives her a LOOK. 

                                 KATE
                        No. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           NARROW TUNNEL 

           Miguel swims steadily through INKY BLACK water, opaque as 
           oil. His lamp DIMLY LIGHTS the way. The ceiling is LOW AND 
           TIGHT, he can’t even lift his head all the way above the 
           water. The sound of BREATHING echoes off the cave walls.
           This is a tunnel we haven’t seen before.

           Something else is different: Miguel, so sure, who grew up in 
           the cenote, who knows these caves inside and out, is AFRAID. 

           Suddenly he STOPS: What was that? A swishing of water. 

           A few silent TEARS fall down his face. He can’t help it. It 
           wasn’t supposed to be like this. 

           He continues. Here, the tunnel gets so narrow he has to dive 
           underwater to go through. A big BREATH, then he DIVES. 

           DARKNESS. He can’t see anything. We can’t see anything. 

           And then suddenly, fuck, the blunt FACE of the SHARK. Coming 
           straight at him.

           Miguel SCREAMS underwater. Disoriented, he turns and swims, 
           furious, as fast as he can.

           Finally he POPS UP above the surface, gasping, little screams 
           escaping. But, oh God, the place he’s popped up in, it’s so 
           NARROW, he can barely move--

           He’s STUCK. His upper body is WEDGED between two cave walls. 
           We move down to see his legs are THRASHING under the water. 
           No foothold, no leverage.

           And going straight toward those thrashing legs -- the SHARK.

           Close on Miguel’s face at the moment of attack. A blood-
           curdling SCREAM. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           CAVE #5

           Miguel’s SCREAMS carry. The group looks up at once. His agony 
           resonates. It’s a catalyst to spring them into action.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Give me the map, Kate. Now. 

                                 KATE
                        You don’t know how to read these 
                        maps.

                                 CHARLIE
                        How would you know what I can and 
                        can’t do?
                                 KATE
                        Oh, sure. You, who absolutely 
                        skewered me for these maps when we 
                        came into this, this hellhole--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t be petty. It doesn’t look 
                        good on you. 

                                 KATE
                        Unlike you, I don’t care what 
                        doesn’t look good on me. So you can 
                        stop trying to put me in my place 
                        with shit like that.

           Furious about not getting her way for once, Charlie STANDS 
           fully and walks on the narrow ledge toward Kate and Adrienne. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m not dying in these caves. 

           Charlie LUNGES toward Kate and her maps. 

                                 KATE
                        Charlie, stop!

           But Charlie doesn’t stop. She CHARGES ahead and tries to 
           wrestle the maps out of Kate’s hands. In the scuffle, Charlie 
           topples Adrienne. Adrienne starts to SLIP, and Kate grabs 
           onto her, the maps falling into the water. 

           Despite Kate’s grip, blood-soaked Adrienne PLUNGES into the 
           pool with a DEAFENING SPLASH.

           She pops back up, gasping.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        It’s ok. It’s ok. We heard it way 
                        out there. Just get out of the 
                        water, Adrienne. Hurry. 

           Adrienne, a little stunned, swims back to the wall. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Good girl, yes, great. 

           Adrienne tries to PULL HERSELF UP on the ledge -- no, of 
           course she can’t do it now, bleeding and weak! She couldn’t 
           do it before! She’s CRYING in fear and frustration.

           Kate CROUCHES, REACHES for her, but she can barely stay 
           balanced on the ledge herself, much less pull Adrienne up--
           There it is. A SHARK FIN, cutting the surface of the water.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                             (urgent)
                        Now, Adrienne. Now. 

           But Adrienne’s look is BROKEN. Tears spill down her face.

                                 ADRIENNE
                        I can’t. I can’t.

                                 KATE
                             (quickly)
                        No! Shut up and listen to me! Turn 
                        around. When it’s close enough, you 
                        punch it square in the nose. In the 
                        nose, Adrienne. Ready?

           Solemnly, Adrienne turns. The fin blades steadily toward her. 
           She breathes, tries to find resolve. The shark LIFTS out of 
           the water, and we see its DEAD EYES and GAPING MOUTH--

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        NOW!!!!

           With everything she has, Adrienne PUNCHES the shark in the 
           nose. The shark retreats!

           A beat of shock, and then ELATION. James and Charlie CHEER. 
           What a turn of events! Maybe they can beat this asshole. 

           With no time to waste, Kate LEAPS into the water and starts 
           PUSHING Adrienne up. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                             (to James)
                        Help me!

           James kneels and leans down to GRAB Adrienne as Kate PUSHES. 
           Charlie tries to help, too, but James loses Adrienne’s arms. 

           She FALLS back onto Kate.

           For a second, Kate is plunged underwater, where she opens her 
           eyes. In the thick distance, she sees the SHARK. It’s PISSED. 

           Kate and Adrienne are treading in the water, GASPING. 
           Quickly, Kate reaches into her neoprene, grabs the KNIFE. 
           Gets herself set.

           This is Kate and Adrienne versus the shark, woman versus 
           vicious, predatory nature. 
           The shark DARTS straight at Kate. Kate SCREAMS and PLUNGES 
           the knife directly into the meat of the SHARK’S EYE. 

           The shark JERKS away, taking the knife with it.

           But it’s not done yet.

           Underwater, the shark chomps Adrienne’s legs in its MASSIVE 
           MOUTH and yanks. Adrienne SCREAMS and SCREAMS: it echoes so 
           loudly that Charlie covers her ears. 

           The screams land on her friends’ faces, tortured as they 
           watch, utterly helpless. Adrienne is dying.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        No!

           Kate SWIMS toward Adrienne and the shark, but she can’t get 
           close -- too much thrashing. 

           Adrienne is DRAGGED away, popping above water then going back 
           under, CLUTCHING futilely at the smooth stone walls. 

           Then both the shark and Adrienne are gone. 

           Kate’s breath, thick with tears. Silently, she cries.

           The others stand there, stunned. Frozen. Finally:

                                 CHARLIE
                             (shaky, panicked)
                        This is fucked. 

                                 JAMES
                             (disbelieving)
                        She’s...she’s...

                                 CHARLIE
                        We-- We have one goal. To get out 
                        of here. One. That’s it. 

                                 JAMES
                        How did that...she and Greg are...

                                 CHARLIE
                        We have to get out. Anything else 
                        is pointless.

                                 KATE
                        Pointless to you. 

           Through silent tears, Kate gathers up her maps, floating 
           around in the water. 
           Folds them deliberately, puts them in her pack. Then, like a 
           fucking SUPERHERO, she REACHES and clutches the ledge with 
           ONE HAND and then the other. 

           She PULLS herself up onto the ledge, all by her goddamn self. 

           SOUNDLESS FLASH

           Timed to each new step Kate makes getting up on the ledge:

           Charlie’s face, smiling. [knee]

           Wider: Charlie standing on a beach in a white dress. [step]

           Now Charlie opens her mouth. [step]

           She’s laughing? Or screaming? [stand]

           BACK TO CAVE

           Wobbly as a newborn deer, Kate fully STANDS. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to the next cave, and 
                        then we’re going to find the ocean 
                        outlet. The cave with the hatch 
                        that opens to the sea. The faster 
                        we can get out of these caves, the 
                        better.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s insane. You have no idea how 
                        far up the opening is, how far away 
                        from shore we’d be! Miguel said--

                                 KATE
                        I know exactly how far we’d be. I 
                        know the maps because I studied 
                        them. Because I’m not fucking 
                        stupid and reckless. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        No. We keep pushing forward. In the 
                        next passage, there’s a tunnel that 
                        splits off, a shortcut to the 
                        entrance. We should take it. 

                                 KATE
                        A secret shortcut tunnel? Really?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Miguel told me, Kate. In Spanish.
                                 KATE
                        Oh, oh, oh. Miguel told you in a 
                        language none of us understand, at 
                        a moment none of us heard. Gotcha. 

           Silence.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Well, my map doesn’t have a 
                        shortcut on it. So have fun. James? 
                        You coming with me?

           They both turn to James. He’s like, Oh shit.

                                 JAMES
                        You all are not making me be the 
                        tiebreaker here.

                                 KATE
                        Are you kidding me right now? 
                        Charlie’s the one whose decisions 
                        got us in this mess--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fuck you, Kate.

                                 KATE
                        --but now you’re gonna trust her to 
                        get us out?

           He looks back and forth between them, then DIVES underwater.

           He pops up again at the entrance to the passage, looks back, 
           then swims out.

           Charlie and Kate glare at each other before following.

           WIDE TUNNEL PASSAGE

           James is clinging to an outcropping of rock. Along the 
           passageway, TUNNELS branch off to the left and right.

                                 JAMES
                        Ok. Let’s decide. Ocean tunnel, or 
                        shortcut tunnel? Kate, bring out 
                        the maps--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Enough with the goddamn maps.

           She swims about a dozen yards to the left, to the opening of 
           a tiny, dark TUNNEL.
                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        This one. We take it straight to 
                        the first cave, bypass everything 
                        in between.

                                 KATE
                             (incredulous)
                        Are you crazy? We have no idea if 
                        that thing branches off, gets too 
                        low, nothing--

                                 CHARLIE
                        You said it yourself, Kate. We have 
                        to get out of here as soon as 
                        possible. I’m giving you that 
                        option now. So do you want to get 
                        out, or do you want to get your own 
                        way? Which is it?

           Kate turns helplessly to James. 

                                 JAMES
                             (quietly)
                        Look, Kate--

                                 CHARLIE
                        By all means, guys, take your time.

                                 JAMES
                        You know she’s not going to come 
                        with us. And I can’t let her go on 
                        alone. 

                                 KATE
                        So, I’m being punished...for not 
                        being the stubborn asshole?

                                 JAMES
                        Please don’t splinter the group. 
                        I’m begging you. Do this for me.

           Kate stares at him, then turns to look ahead on the right, at 
           the LARGE, more welcoming passage leading to the ocean cave.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ok, chums. See you on the other 
                        side. Or not.

           She slips into the tiny opening, and is gone.

                                 KATE
                        She fucking knows we’re going to 
                        follow her. I can’t stand it.
                                 JAMES
                             (quietly)
                        I hate it, too.

           They both swim after her.

           CHARLIE’S TUNNEL

           Close on Charlie: For once, we see her uncertainty, her fear. 
           This place is tight as fuck, she doesn’t actually know where 
           she’s going, and now she’s responsible for whatever happens.

           She hears the other two behind her.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (with false cheer)
                        Now, don’t lose your buddy.

           She turns and shines her lamp on their faces: both PISSED.

                                 KATE
                        You didn’t have a problem with 
                        leaving a buddy behind before. What 
                        changed? 

           This HURTS. But Charlie isn’t going to break, goddammit.

                                 CHARLIE
                        She was my friend, too. I saw her 
                        die, just like you did. 
                             (beat)
                        Buck up, we’re almost out of here.

           In her voice, there’s an edge of INSANITY. They’re all 
           skimming that razor-thin line.

           Uh-oh. A BRANCH: one tiny tunnel to the left and one tiny 
           tunnel to the right.

                                 KATE
                        Show us the way. If you know. 

           Charlie hesitates before shooting to the right.

           Now it’s an even narrower tunnel... Lights bobbing... 

           The rocky ceiling is just six inches above the surface of the 
           water...

           Uh-oh. A ROCK WALL blocks the way.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Before you shit yourselves, let me 
                        just take a look.

           Charlie plunges underwater to check out the passageway while 
           Kate glares at James.

                                 KATE
                        Who could have predicted.

                                 JAMES
                        Kate--

                                 KATE
                        Our best friend just died in front 
                        of us and she’s treating this like--

                                 JAMES
                        Just let her do it. Please.

                                 KATE
                        God. You’re such a nice guy, but 
                        doesn’t it get old? Begging for 
                        people to treat you with respect?

           He’s stung -- and angry. Charlie splashes back up.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (panting)
                        So, it’s fine. The water is high, 
                        but there are little pockets of air 
                        on the way to the open tunnel.

                                 KATE
                        No. We turn around, right now.

                                 CHARLIE
                        This is exactly how Miguel 
                        described it to me. We’re really, 
                        really close.

           Before they can protest, she’s gone.

                                 KATE
                        There’s no way that Miguel--

                                 JAMES
                             (curtly)
                        Enough talk. We’re wasting time.

           He’s gone. Kate’s frustration is close to bubbling over.
           NARROW TUNNEL

           The narrow corridor is now ENTIRELY UNDERWATER, except for 
           tiny AIR POCKETS every 15 feet or so. They swim single-file, 
           stop in a pocket, take a DEEP BREATH, then swim to the next.

           Each pocket meeting is TENSE, utterly cramped, and stressful. 
           They’re all terrified.

           During one long underwater swim, Kate looks down: the floor 
           of the cave DROPS AWAY to nothingness, then is SUPER CLOSE 
           again. She’s in a little underwater tube, a death pipe.

           The next pocket is extremely shallow and small. Kate POPS UP 
           to see Charlie and James glaring at each other, panting.

                                 KATE
                             (gasping)
                        I don’t know how much longer I can 
                        do this.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I looked ahead -- I think after the 
                        next two, it opens up again.

                                 KATE
                        I hope you’re right.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s wider underwater, too. We can 
                        go together.

                                 JAMES
                        Everyone ready?

           They PLUNGE DOWN.

           Swimming through darkness, the floor abruptly rises. Kate 
           LIGHTLY SCRAPES her leg on the rocky surface. A few BUBBLES 
           blow out of her mouth when she notices. 

           As she swims, Kate reaches her hands out to measure the side 
           of the tunnel. Her fingers catch on the edge of a WINDOW-LIKE 
           OPENING, barely big enough for a thin human to slide through. 
           Looking ahead, the irregular window openings go on for the 
           visible length of the tunnel.

           Her hand brushes against something -- she turns to look with 
           her lamp. 

           It’s the KNIFE HANDLE. 

           Oh shit. It’s sticking out of the SHARK’S EYE: the shark is 
           GLARING and CHARGING and BITING through one of the windows. 
           Kate SCREAMS underwater. Bubbles and muffled sound escape. 
           The shark’s face POUNDS at the not-big-enough opening.

           Charlie and James turn, but Kate motions for them to swim 
           swim swim!

           The shark is still GNAWING and HAMMERING at the rock edges. 
           As the group swims through the tunnel, now FURIOUSLY, the 
           shark TRACKS them on the other side, charging and biting 
           through the openings. 

           The worst game of Whac-A-Mole ever.

           In one opening, one of the shark’s TEETH snags on the strap 
           of Kate’s neoprene. She’s STUCK. 

           But the shark YANKS and YANKS, so Kate grabs what she can 
           from the pack and unsnaps the strap, leaving it in the 
           shark’s mouth.

           It CHARGES. This window is a bit bigger: more of its head 
           gets through. Struggling, Kate KICKS the shark in the face, 
           and it BITES HER FEET -- she’s STRUGGLING, panicked -- 

           But it’s just her FLIPPERS. She reaches down, peels them off 
           her feet, and the shark DISAPPEARS with them.

           Now the group is on top of each other, RUNNING OUT OF BREATH, 
           pushing and swimming and frantic, and they JUST make it to 
           the next air pocket.

           But it’s so tiny. Their three faces mashed into a pocket the 
           size of shoebox. They GASP panicked breaths. Are they running 
           out of air? They need to get it together.

           There are no words. They have to push on.

           BACK UNDERWATER, the openings are narrower, but closer 
           together, wide slits. They see the shark TRACKING them on the 
           other side of the wall... 

           HUNTING.

           Charlie and James are ahead...

           The shark CHARGES at a weak slit, and the rock CRUMBLES! The 
           tip of the shark’s face is BLOCKING Kate’s way!

           Kate sees James turn back -- but then he’s pulled away by 
           Charlie. They’re leaving her behind.

           Kate’s eyes narrow. That bitch.
           The shark is CHOMPING, snapping and thrashing, more rock 
           crumbling away. It’s mere inches from Kate’s body. 

           She makes a decision. 

           She grabs the KNIFE HANDLE and YANKS it from the shark’s eye. 
           Stunned, the shark WHIRLS away. 

           Kate zooms past the gaping hole. Charlie and James’s legs are 
           ahead, they’re already in the air pocket, can she make it? 

           IN THE POCKET: On Charlie and James, gasping, staring at each 
           other. Is it just the two of us now?

           Kate BURSTS the surface, and the other two SCREAM. She GASPS 
           for life. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        What-- What is that?!?

           Kate holds up her trophy: the knife...but at the pointed end 
           hangs a bloody, PULPY SHARK’S EYE.

           She YELPS and drops the knife. We follow its journey down 
           through the water, into the death depths. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                             (almost crying)
                        God, Kate, I, I thought you were 
                        dead--

                                 CHARLIE
                        We both did, I can’t believe you 
                        got away! Jesus, you’re such a 
                        badass.

           A beat while they catch their breaths, but Kate is FURIOUS. 
           She was almost abandoned!

                                 KATE
                        “Badass”? Don’t you mean bait?

                                 JAMES
                        Stop it! What’s the plan now? We 
                        don’t know where the fuck that 
                        thing is or if it’s finding a way 
                        into the tunnel so it can get us 
                        from below, or--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ok ok ok ok, let’s keep going.
                             (close to hysterical)
                        There’s no other choice! We have 
                        to!
           Kate shares a grim look with James. It’s true. There’s no 
           turning back.

           Kate quickly STASHES what she took from her neoprene in the 
           side strap of her bikini bottom: FLARE, MAP, and ROPE.

                                 KATE
                        On the count of three? One... Two..

           They PLUNGE once more.

           Swimming in the darkness -- the floor drops away again -- 
           it’s too deep to see the bottom...

           Side by side they swim, running their hands along the ceiling 
           that’s still right above them. Man. This is a long one.

           The passage NARROWS again, pushing the swimmers together. 
           They BARELY fit abreast when the passage finally opens up, 
           and they POP UP, gasping--

           --and SCREAM when their lamps shine on the gory vision right 
           in their face. 

           Miguel’s PALE UPPER BODY, chewed to the ENTRAILS, jammed in 
           that rock passage, his DEAD FACE twisted toward them. His 
           lamp still shining.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                             (enraged)
                        FUCK!

           They press themselves against the wall, as far away from 
           Miguel as possible.

                                 JAMES
                             (whispering)
                        That means... It was in here...

           Kate looks down, but it’s just ENDLESSLY BLACK. The map has 
           come loose from her bikini bottom and it DRIFTS out of sight.

           A long, scary moment.

           The shark BURSTS up from below.

           It’s TOTAL CHAOS -- lights flashing everywhere, screams 
           echoing, GNASHING JAWS, kicking and flailing legs -- 

           Kate, closest to Miguel, grabs his dead arm and JAMS it into 
           the snapping jaws. The shark GLOMS on and starts SHAKING IT 
           like a dog with a chew toy. The arm finally RIPS OFF Miguel’s 
           body and the shark DISAPPEARS with it.
           Holy shit. Even Kate is stunned: Did I really just do that?

           They all stare at each other. That was a really skinny little 
           arm. It’s not going to last long.

           Charlie’s on the right, near another tunnel opening. She 
           looks at them...then fucking TAKES OFF. 

           You know what they say about sharks: You don’t have to be 
           able to out-swim them -- just your pals. 

           Kate and James look at each other, stunned, before taking off 
           after her. PUSH IN and HOLD on Miguel’s horrible corpse face, 
           staring right at us.

           CAVE #3

           A light coming up through the water. Charlie breaks the 
           surface, looks around wildly: Where am I?

           James and Kate swim through, too, and they all cling to the 
           walls, panting hard.

                                 KATE
                             (to Charlie)
                        What the hell was that?

                                 CHARLIE
                        We had to get out of there. So I 
                        got out of there.

                                 KATE
                        Was that what it was, Charlie? Is 
                        that all?

                                 CHARLIE
                        What are you implying?

                                 KATE
                        Just that I’m getting pretty tired 
                        of seeing the back of you as we’re 
                        all trying to escape with our 
                        fucking lives.

                                 JAMES
                        GUYS! Where the hell are we?  

           Kate sees the fish floating on the surface of the water -- 
           even more ominous now. The specter of death hangs over them.
                                 KATE
                             (quietly)
                        We’re just one cave over from where 
                        we were before. The skeleton cave.

           James spins around wildly. He turns to the back of the cave, 
           where there’s a large opening, and points.

                                 JAMES
                        You mean, that’s the passageway we 
                        were in before we went, went 
                        through--

                                 KATE
                        Charlie’s Tunnel o’ Nightmares? 
                        Yeah.
                             (points to far opening)
                        That way’s the bat cave.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Let’s-- Let’s go out the same way 
                        we came in, then. Tunnel to the bat 
                        cave, some more swimming, then the 
                        first cave. Then we’re almost, 
                        almost out--

           Suddenly, Charlie seems like she’s about to break: They’re so 
           fucking close to getting out of this nightmare.

                                 KATE
                        Wait -- shh.

           They listen: faint squeaking and flapping.

                                 CHARLIE
                        The bats.

                                 JAMES
                        Why they freaking out?

           Kate swims gently, silently over to the far side, to the 
           tunnel leading to the bat cave.

                                 KATE
                        Wait here.

           James and Charlie stare at her. She’s so brave, suddenly!

           She slides her way through the narrow rock passage. 

           When she sees the entrance to the bat cave, she clicks her 
           headlamp off. It’s PITCH BLACK now, and the squeaking sounds 
           louder. There’s loud SPLASHING, too. 
           She stealthily peeks into the bat cave...

           CAVE #2

           Illuminated by the late-afternoon light from the opening at 
           the top is a PRIMEVAL scene. Bats are swarming the air, thick 
           as insects. Squeaking, swooping...

           The enormous shark LEAPS out of the water, CHOMPING bats out 
           of the air, sending them SWIRLING. It lands with a GIGANTIC 
           SPLASH that sends water back against Kate, who’s FREAKED.

           CAVE #3

           Kate is swimming FAST back into the skeleton cave.

                                 KATE
                        Go go go, it’s behind us, let’s go--

           They’re all swimming now back to the passageway they were in 
           earlier, Charlie and James ahead, Kate trying to catch up.

           They keep having to brush dead fish and marine life out of 
           the way, it’s disgusting and horrible. 

           From Kate’s perspective, it looks like James and Charlie are 
           yet again ABANDONING her. She tries to swim faster--

           --and swims directly into ADRIENNE’S TORSO. Bloody at either 
           end, but clearly her bikini top, her flat tummy, the BELLY 
           RING still intact. 

           Charlie and James TURN when they hear Kate’s CHOKED CRY.

                           JAMES
                                                         CHARLIE
           Shit shit shit shit shit
                                              Fuck! Come on!

           Kate looks over Adrienne’s torso to James and Charlie. In a 
           the silence, she sees it in their eyes, almost in the 
           reflection of their eyes: the SHARK has entered their cave. 

           Close on Kate’s own eyes, narrowing. RACK FOCUS to the shark 
           fin gliding towards her.

           Charlie and James dart into a NARROW CREVICE in the wall, 
           screaming for Kate. She’s swimming, and swimming, and 
           swimming, but so is the shark...

           20 feet from the crevice. 

           10 feet...
                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Get in, get in!

           Kate WEDGES herself in with them, JUST in time. 

           The shark breaches the water, dead fish dropping off it, and 
           LUNGES madly at Kate: its THICKENED BODY, its U-shaped mouth 
           full of TEETH, its remaining BLACK EYE -- so close up. 

           The attack is stopped by the rock, but just barely: Kate is 
           flush with the opening. The shark keeps attacking, swimming 
           away and RUSHING back, water SLOSHING into the crevice--

           Charlie’s scream-crying now, finally. For herself.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                             (hysterical)
                        We can’t beat it, we can’t beat it, 
                        oh my God, we can’t beat it--

           They all shriek again at another attack. But Kate is PISSED. 

                                 KATE
                        Shut up, Charlie, shut up -- let me 
                        focus --

           The shark has swum away to make another run. It’s SPEEDING 
           back... rushes forward with unhinged jaw--

           IN SLO-MO: Kate unsnaps the top of the UNDERWATER FLARE and 
           THROWS it into the shark’s OPEN MOUTH. 

           As she does this, she lets loose a SOUND -- something like a 
           scream but more guttural, coming from deep inside. The scream 
           loosens TEARS from her eyes. The act changes her.

           She is surviving.

           In the briefest second, she locks eyes with the shark, one 
           black eye to one brown eye. There is an understanding. 

           They are both surviving. 

           The shark CRASHES back down, JERKS back toward the bat cave. 
           It’s WRITHING, the FLAME from the flare glowing underwater, 
           speeding away, then...blackness.

           A long silence. The water turns flat and still again.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, my God. You did it.
                                 JAMES
                        Did-- Did you just kill a 
                        motherfucking shark?

           Kate swims out of the crevice, slowly. No sign of the shark.

                                 KATE
                        I’m not so sure it--

           Charlie WHOOPS, her arms around James.

                                 JAMES
                             (off Kate’s skepticism)
                        Kate, can you please count your 
                        wins.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You sent fire down its throat. Even 
                        if it’s not dead-dead, it’s 
                        seriously fucking ill. Let’s go! 
                        We’re so close.

           She and James start swimming back toward the bat cave. 

                                 KATE
                        Stop. I don’t think it’s safe. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (incredulous)
                        Are you serious?

                                 KATE
                        I saw the shark heading back toward 
                        the bat cave. I want to go back to 
                        the ocean tunnel.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh my God. Isn’t it enough that you 
                        killed the damn thing? You still 
                        have to have your own way on this? 
                        You’re obsessed.
                             (points to bat cave)
                        The exit we know for sure is that 
                        way.

                                 KATE
                        You don’t know everything.

                                 JAMES
                        Is this really the best time to--
                                 KATE
                        Yeah, James, it is, because I’m 
                        trying to stop your girlfriend from 
                        making a big fucking mistake. Even 
                        if you can’t stand up to her--

                                 CHARLIE
                             (record-scratch)
                        You’re so pathetic. 

           FLASH: Kate, sitting alone on the beach years ago, waiting 
           for her friends.

           BACK TO CAVE

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        You still can’t get over losing 
                        him. 

           Close on Kate’s face, breathing heavily, taking this in. 

           Then FLASH: James leaving her room. The door CLICKS closed. 
           Kate sitting up. A look of worry. She STANDS, suddenly, 
           roughly. The sheet falls from her body.

           BACK TO CAVE

                                 KATE
                        Losing and winning, that’s the way 
                        Charlie’s world works, right? Funny 
                        thing, though, for you to win, I 
                        have to lose. Someone has to. You 
                        always needed me because there had 
                        to be someone on that step below 
                        you. You feed on weakness.
                             (beat)
                        But guess what. That’s not gonna be 
                        me looking up at you anymore. 
                        That’s over.

           She gives a WITHERING LOOK at James.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        I know what I saw, and I don’t 
                        think it’s dead. You do whatever 
                        you want, but I’m done trying to 
                        convince you.

           Kate starts swimming back toward the passageway that leads to 
           the ocean outlet cave. Alone.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fine, good luck! See you on the 
                        beach! Come on, babe.
           Charlie starts swimming, but turns back when James doesn’t 
           follow. He’s staring after Kate.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        James. James, come on.

           She all but snaps her fingers at him. 

           But he’s not looking.

                                 JAMES
                        Kate, hold up!
                             (to Charlie)
                        I believe her. We should go with 
                        her.

           Kate waits at a distance.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Absolutely not! Babe, baby -- look, 
                        we just go through this dumb bat 
                        cave, then the other one, and we’re 
                        out of here. Climb right up the 
                        steps. We can send people back for 
                        Kate, she’ll be fine.

           Now James is incredulous.

                                 JAMES
                        Uh, you get that this isn’t about 
                        me picking her over you? This is 
                        about me thinking there might still 
                        be a fucking shark swimming around 
                        in here! 
                             (uncharacteristically 
                              sarcastic)
                        Let’s. Get. Away. From. It.

           Charlie looks at Kate, who is stony-faced, unreadable.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Unbelievable. 

           She keeps swimming toward the bat cave.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Whatever, losers. Ride off into the 
                        sunset, see if I care.

           Right before she enters the exit tunnel, she turns around to 
           face them.
                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                             (to Kate)
                        You know what’s really sad, Kate? I 
                        didn’t need you around. I wanted 
                        you.

                                 KATE
                             (drily)
                        That’s even worse, Charlie.

           BLOOP: Charlie is YANKED underwater.

           Now she’s back up, THRASHING! She’s KICKED her way out of the 
           shark’s mouth. She’s swimming furiously toward horrified 
           James and Kate...

                                 CHARLIE
                             (labored)
                        I. Won’t. Go. Like this!!!

           UNDERWATER: part of the shark’s mouth is RAW and BURNT. Its 
           exposed gums and teeth are a disgusting wreck. Its empty eye 
           socket is gaping tissue and blood, but the shark is still 
           headed straight for Charlie’s KICKING LEGS...

           Above the surface: we see Charlie being dragged out toward 
           the bat cave by her leg.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Help me!

           James reaches out but Kate stops him -- there’s no point.

           VARIOUS

           Charlie’s SCREAMING as she’s dragged through the next 
           tunnel... 

           Then towards the bat cave... 

           CAVE #3

           Back on James and Charlie as they hear distant screams. Dark 
           water LAPS through the open tunnel.

           A beat. Horrified silence... And one last, dying SCREAM.

           Then filling their vision, BATS: a dense CLOUD of them, 
           rushing through the tunnel and shrieking into their cave, as 
           if this is Charlie’s essence escaping. 
           Kate and James dive underwater. The bats rush into the wide 
           tunnel passageway that holds the ocean outlet cave, as if 
           they know it’s a way out.

           First, James pops up. Kate lingers underwater. Close on HER 
           EYES, which close softly. Then she slowly surfaces, the water 
           slicking off her like a gentle baptism. 

           The final two look at each other. Their THIN BREATH and 
           VULNERABLE BODIES are all that remain.  

           James opens his mouth to speak but--

                                 KATE
                        This way. 

           She swims and after a beat, James follows. It’s what he does 
           best. 

                                                         CONTINUOUS TO:

           WIDE TUNNEL PASSAGE

           They swim. 

           From above, breaststroking, frog legs kicking, exhausted and 
           urgent, they look like animals they are -- living organisms 
           fighting their way back to the top of the food chain...

           OCEAN OUTLET CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           This cave is smaller, almost tunnel-like but for the sloped 
           tall walls -- and a large, almost perfectly CIRCULAR OPENING 
           about ten feet above the waterline. 

           Kate climbs onto a small rock. We see the sinews of her body, 
           which has carried her this far. She gazes up at the opening, 
           temporarily safe: so close to freedom, and a new unknown.

           James joins her, sitting slumped. Legs dangling into the 
           water.

                                 KATE
                        So that’s where we need to go--

                                 JAMES
                        Can, can we hold on a second?

           She looks down. He’s DISTRAUGHT.
                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Charlie’s gone, Kate. She, just, 
                        she’s just--

                                 KATE
                        Gone. Yeah. Like Greg, and 
                        Adrienne, and Miguel--

           She almost breaks. But instead, she squats down and looks 
           into James’s eyes.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                             (gently)
                        But we’re still here. And once we 
                        get out, we can take all the time 
                        we need to...figure out how to live 
                        with this. We can have all the time 
                        in the world.

                                 JAMES
                        And therapy.

                                 KATE
                        God. Yeah. Like, so much therapy.
                             (beat)
                        You ready to do this with me?

           James nods.

           Kate swims over to the wall right underneath the hole, 
           explores.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Here. 

           She stands on a narrow UNDERWATER LEDGE several feet beneath 
           the hole. James climbs up next to her. The top of his head is 
           still a good four or five feet below the opening.

                                 JAMES
                             (frustrated)
                        ARRRGH! We’re so fucking close!

                                 KATE
                        Here. Let me balance on your 
                        shoulders.

           He steadies himself on the ledge, his feet trying to stay 
           stable underwater, and she climbs on his shoulders, knees 
           around his jaw. Then, precariously, she STANDS.

           Now she can PULL herself up, peek her head out. 
           This is it. She’s outside of the cave system, if only half of 
           her head. Late-afternoon sun, pelicans flying overhead, and 
           AIR: fresh air that tastes like freedom.

           BOOM: A wave crashes seismically. 

           Kate pulls herself up further, getting a boost from James. 
           She looks down. 

           Oh, no.

           Below the hole is a SHEER 25-FOOT DROP down a VERTICAL ROCK 
           FACE. Waves crash against the wall -- then the water slides 
           back to reveal BARE, STONY ground. Low tide.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck.

                                 JAMES
                        What? 

           Kate jumps into the water, then climbs back onto the ledge. 

                                 KATE
                        It’s just rocks below. A death 
                        drop. 

                                 JAMES
                        God. What the fuck?!

           He’s very upset. To have come this far--!

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Can you climb down? What about the 
                        rope?

                                 KATE
                        It’s not long enough. 

           Kate fingers the rope tied to the side of her bikini. 

                                 JAMES
                        Someone will come for us. Someone 
                        will see we haven’t--

                                 KATE
                        No one’s coming. Not for a while, 
                        anyway. 
                             (thinks)
                        We’ll wait. Not for people, for 
                        high tide. It’ll be just after 
                        sunset. Hopefully the water level 
                        gets high enough for me to jump 
                        into.
                                 JAMES
                        What if it doesn’t?

                                 KATE
                             (exasperated)
                        Then I guess I break my legs and 
                        drown, and you die by shark, James! 
                        I don’t know, this is our best 
                        shot.

                                 JAMES
                        I should be the one to go.

                                 KATE
                        How are you going to get up there?

           They both look at the little patch of sky. So close.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        It has to be me. I’ll swim to 
                        shore, get help. You just stay 
                        alive until then.

           It’s decided. They sit on the rock, and wait, alone together.

                                                                CUT TO:

           OCEAN OUTLET CAVE - LATER 

           In the twilight-darkened cave, Kate’s eyes are fluttering 
           closed and open. Closed and open. Water DRIPS. A bat 
           SCREECHES somewhere. 

           DREAM FLASH: Dusk. Charlie stands on the beach in a white 
           dress, back to us. The wind blows. Torches light the way. We 
           approach, footstep by footstep. We are so close. The waves 
           crash.

           QUICK FLASHES: A series of images.

           James’s hand on Kate’s leg. 

           Adrienne grinning. 

           Charlie’s mouth laughing, but her eyes menacing. 

           Adrienne screaming and thrashing in the water. 

           Greg gasping.  

           Miguel holding Kate’s hand under water.

           In the dark: Blink. Blink. Blink. 
           Adrienne laughing, then sobbing. SOBBING. 

           James above Kate in bed. Kate’s hands on his biceps. Gasping. 
           Sobbing. Gasping. A cry.

           DREAM FLASH: Closer and closer to the back of Charlie. A hand 
           reaches out -- it’s Kate’s hand -- and spins Charlie around. 
           But where her face should be is only a BLACK HOLE. Screams 
           and cries and sobs and screams, echoing, and we PUSH IN on 
           the black hole...  

           And then there is the sound of gentle WEEPING. 

           BACK TO CAVE: Kate’s eyes SNAP OPEN. 

           James is crying quietly. Kate readjusts herself on the rock. 

                                 KATE
                        What? Come on. It’s not even time 
                        yet. We’ll get out. Just another 
                        hour or two...

           James shakes his head.

                                 JAMES
                        It’s not that. 

                                 KATE
                        What is it? The fact that our best 
                        friends are dead? 

           James doesn’t think this is levity. 

                                 JAMES
                        You don’t know we’ll get out.

                                 KATE
                        No, I don’t. But I have to believe 
                        we can.

                                 JAMES
                        But you don’t know, which means we 
                        might die in here. Of starvation, 
                        or hypothermia or whatevertheFUCK 
                        that monster is, wherever it is. 
                        Just waiting for us. We might die. 
                        And I was thinking oh, ok, so I 
                        might die.

                                 KATE
                        It just now occurred to you?

                                 JAMES
                        Will you please let me finish?
           Kate leans back against the rock wall.

                                 KATE
                        Sorry. 

                                 JAMES
                        So I might die. We might. Because 
                        Adrienne did. And she was 
                        so...good. You know? She was just 
                        good. And I was thinking, you know, 
                        all those years, five years I spent 
                        with her. With...Charlie. Who 
                        wasn’t good. I swear, I didn’t know 
                        it, Kate. I didn’t know how Not 
                        Good she was! She was competitive, 
                        yeah, sure. She must have been mad 
                        at me about the cheating. For 
                        years! And that was partly why she 
                        treated me the way she did, and why 
                        she never wanted to go out of our 
                        way to see you--

                                 KATE
                        Don’t blame Charlie’s behavior on 
                        me and cheating. 

                                 JAMES
                        I know. I know, I’m not trying to 
                        do that. I’m just trying to say...I 
                        don’t know what happened. 

                                 KATE
                        To what?

                                 JAMES
                        To my life.  

           James is really upset. Kate looks on him with mild disdain.

                                 KATE
                        I think Charlie happened to your 
                        life. To all of our lives.

                                 JAMES
                        I’m -- fuck! I -- can’t die this 
                        way. You know? 

                                 KATE
                        Then don’t die.  

                                 JAMES
                        I’m trying. 
                                 KATE
                        I’m trying, actually. 

                                 JAMES
                        I’m freaking out, Kate. 

                                 KATE
                        You don’t think I am, too? Adrienne 
                        clawed for me. Greg is...ground 
                        meat. And Charlie, Charlie...I just 
                        didn’t have a Charlie to fucking do 
                        everything for my entire adulthood, 
                        so I have to do it on my own. 

                                 JAMES
                        That’s just -- mean, Kate.

                                 KATE
                        How is that mean? How am I being 
                        mean to you? You, who apparently 
                        slept with me because you felt 
                        sorry for me? 

                                 JAMES
                        That was a story Charlie told 
                        herself to make it ok. You can see 
                        that, right? A way for her to save 
                        face, and make it about anyone but 
                        her. 

                                 KATE
                        Such clarity. You should have life 
                        or death crises more often. 

                                 JAMES
                        This is really how you want to 
                        leave it with us? How you want to 
                        talk to me, here, now? 

                                 KATE
                        I’m sorry. No. But, after this...I 
                        don’t want to “anything” with you, 
                        James. 

           James’s face falls. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        You want me to care about you 
                        wasting your life with Charlie but--

                                 JAMES
                        No, but you’re not understanding--
                                 KATE
                        Oh, I’m understanding, quite well. 

                                 JAMES
                        I just meant it’s not about you, 
                        it’s about me!

                                 KATE
                        No, James. It’s about me. 

           It’s her turn to talk. She’s frustrated, but tired, too.  

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck. If you wanted to change your 
                        life, James, you had five years to 
                        make the right decisions. But no. 
                        You stayed with her. And I think 
                        you stayed with her because you’d 
                        rather be led by someone who’s bad 
                        than be alone in the chaos. You 
                        were afraid. And now that she’s 
                        gone, you’re completely lost, 
                        casting around for the next thing 
                        to hang onto.

           James, open-mouthed, is withered. Kate is practically talking 
           to herself at this point. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        But that’s how it is. I’ve always 
                        known that. All those years ago, I 
                        mainlined Charlie’s poison, too, 
                        played that stupid game of win or 
                        lose. I’m the one she wanted to 
                        make sure she was always a notch 
                        above. I should have seen, early 
                        on, that she was afraid of me. 
                        Because I was...strong. Always 
                        stronger than her. 
                             (gently)
                        I didn’t come here hoping your 
                        seesawing dick would point my way. 
                        I came here because we all have --  
                        had -- history. 
                             (a beat)
                        But it’s not you I need to make it 
                        right with. It’s just me. Myself.
                             (”this is it”)
                        I’ve always been enough.

           Water drips. Outside, a gull squawks. Kate’s face is hard and 
           proud in its newfound voice and strength. 
           This is who she is now.

                                                               FADE TO:

           OCEAN OUTLET CAVE - EARLY NIGHT

           The sky framed in the hole to the ocean is clear and inky 
           black, punctured with a few stars. The sound of the waves 
           below is louder than before. Closer.

                                 KATE
                        It’s time. 

           James, a deadened man at this point, stirs, then follows Kate 
           to the underwater ledge. He takes his position, and she 
           scrambles up his body. Her knees hug his jaw. His eyes close. 
           First one foot, then the other, on his broad shoulders.

           Like a machine, Kate PULLS herself all the way out of the 
           hole, sits. She looks down. 

           The water is covering up the rocks, but is it enough? The 
           ocean looks like an angry mouth ready to swallow her up. 

           From JAMES’S POV: Kate stands on the precipice, framed 
           against the night sky.

           On Kate: The deadly cave she came from behind her; the vast, 
           terrifying ocean ahead. She peers at the DISTANT SHORE, the 
           twinkles barely visible. I can do this. 

           She turns to give one last look at James, gazing up at her, 
           scared and trusting. He’s weak, pitiful, standing alone in 
           that dark hole of death. But he’s not evil. 

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck it! You’re coming with me!

           She’s the goddamn apex now.

           Kate gets the rope from her bikini bottom, ties it around her 
           waist, gets down on her stomach, leans back into the hole. 

                                 JAMES
                        You’re too high up!

                                 KATE
                        Motherfucker, I swear to God, if 
                        you just try, we can both get out 
                        of here!

           She dangles the free end of the rope three feet down.
           James sets his face: Kate’s fierce energy is contagious. 

           With everything he has, James JUMPS. His hand catches the 
           rope, and Kate counterbalances, leaning back. Kate’s and 
           James’s eyes meet. They’ve fucking done it. 

           James’s feet scramble for a hold against the wall to take off 
           some of the weight. Now he’s pulling/climbing up... 

           The rope strains.

           And strains.

           Uh-oh. 

           In a lightning quick moment, the rope snaps -- and like a 
           fucking pro, Kate reaches her other hand out and grabs 
           James’s wrist.

           Using all her strength, every bit she stuffed down for years 
           and years, she PULLS up and GROANS. She’s using her FULL 
           WEIGHT to pull back. He’s dangling free now...one hand GRABS 
           the bottom of the opening...

           But the shark has other plans. 

           It slides through the tunnel, LEAPS out of the water, and 
           SNAPS James up to the waist! James SCREAMS, and Kate SCREAMS 
           as she’s YANKED forward, almost back into the hole.

                                 KATE (CONT’D)
                        JAMES!!!

           The shark jerks its head once, twice, and just like that, 
           James’s lower body is GONE.

           The shark DISAPPEARS back into the depths, having claimed its 
           last victory.

           EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Kate, still holding on to James’s wrist, goes FLYING backward 
           with the top half of him -- falling, falling, falling --

           Plunging flat on her back, into the ocean. 

           UNDERWATER: Darkness. Churning water, bubbles. 

           Kate’s hand, still wrapped around a dead man’s wrist.

           James. Wide-open eyes, seeing nothing.

           Kate. Anguished eyes. Crying. 
           Her hand, letting go. What’s left of James is PULLED away by 
           the waves, engulfed in darkness.

           She GASPS back up to the surface. The sound of the waves, her 
           breath, it’s WILD up here.

           She’s PUSHED back into the wall by the waves: OOF.

           She must survive.

           She SHOVES off with her legs as hard as she can, swims fast 
           and hard through the choppy water, gasping for air, CRYING, 
           screaming in RAGE and FRUSTRATION and FEAR...

           Pausing for a breath, floating in the dark water, she turns 
           to look back.

           Oh man. She’s only come 10 or 12 feet. 

           Ahead of her, the coastline glimmers, then disappears, 
           glimmers, disappears as the waves go up and down. So, so far.

           All around her, the dark ocean. Her biggest fear. 

           She’s really crying now, sobbing. She’s been through so much. 
           And now she’s really alone. But she still has further to go.

           Still crying, she starts swimming in the pitch-black waters.

           We follow her slow progress, water occasionally splashing in 
           her face... 

           Sometimes she’s doing a few yards underwater... 

           The water seems ALIVE, aggressively fighting her progress...

           Always the shoreline ahead, never looking closer, sometimes 
           looking further.

           Pull UP and OUT: she’s a tiny pale dot swimming in an inky 
           black expanse. 

           FADE TO BLACK.

                                                              ON BLACK:

           The deep roar of the ocean. Distant, faint screams.

           BEACH - NIGHT

           A shallow wave, licking the shore. Shushing back. Innocent.

           Tilting up to the dark surf: In the distance, a pale form...
           Emerging like a GHOST, trudging to land, it’s KATE (in a grim 
           echo of the opening scene, when her friends swam laughing 
           back to shore).

           Kate COLLAPSES onto her knees...then FACE-PLANTS. Water 
           washes over her. She’s a piece of refuse from the sea.

           She looks up.

           Staring down at her: the face of a DEAD CHILD. 

           Wait -- it blinks. 

           It’s a curious young girl, her face painted like a 
           beautifully decorated SKULL. She runs away.

           Kate forces herself to sit up. From Kate’s POV: a hazy, 
           unclear vision of SMOKY FIRES, the horizon TIPPING dizzily.

           Again: faint screams.

           Kate staggers to her feet, her lips dry and cracked, her eyes 
           hollow. She moves toward the fires, LURCHING like a zombie...

           It’s a Day of the Dead celebration, with bonfires, and 
           clusters of people with GORGEOUSLY PAINTED skeleton faces. 

           People aren’t screaming in terror, they’re laughing and 
           shouting with friends.

           The revelers, mistaking Kate for a tourist out for a late-
           night swim, usher her in, as though welcoming her into a 
           beautiful vision of HELL: skeletons all around her, grinning, 
           drunk and happy, bonfires everywhere. Children scampering.

           Someone, somewhere, sings a song in Spanish, accompanied by 
           guitar.

           Kate drifts along, HALF-DELIRIOUS. Someone puts a CROWN OF 
           FLOWERS on her head.

           She moves toward a clutch of WOMEN putting finishing touches 
           on their face-paint, using a big cheap MIRROR propped up on 
           the sand.

           The women turn to her, smiling, like the underworld’s 
           handmaidens, and let her into the group. Kate moves forward 
           to the mirror as though in a dream.

           A PRETTY SKELETON WOMAN offers up a container of greasepaint, 
           but Kate shakes her head no.

           She stares in wonder at her reflection: she looks like a 
           stranger to herself.
           Her friends are dead.

           So is the person Kate used to be.

           But maybe that’s not a bad thing.
