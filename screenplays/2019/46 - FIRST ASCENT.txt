           EXT. BIG ROCK WALL - DAY

           Chalk-stained fingers crimped in tiny rock holds.

           Climbing shoes smeared against granite.

           Blaze blue eyes seething with obsession.

           HILLARY HALL (35) is climbing a big rock wall. Only two 
           hundred and fifty feet up. Two thousand left to go. She’s in 
           her element. No ropes. No protection. No fear. The only thing 
           between her and certain death is the strength of her fingers. 

           She climbs past a tiny Go Pro camera fastened to the rock. 
           Blows it a kiss. Finds her footing on a nickel sized perch. 

           Catches her breath. Resting on the face. Get it back. 
           Breathe. Music spills out of her wireless earbuds. She 
           glances at the spectacular views. Breathes it in. 

           Down below, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE are gathered at the base of 
           the wall. Watching this tremendous feat of athleticism. 
           Satellite news vans. A line of REPORTERS throwing live shots. 

                                 REPORTER
                        Hillary Hall, the Gretzky of 
                        Granite, is attempting to break the 
                        free solo speed record, climbing 
                        all two thousand feet of sheer 
                        granite without ropes... 

           TOURISTS with binoculars and cameras. Everyone trembling with 
           suspense. Filming with their iPhones.

           High above, Hillary takes out her phone to check the timer: 
           thirty two minutes and counting. She’s making good time. 

           She tries to put the phone away, but it slips through her 
           fingers.

           Tourists GASP as the phone bounces down the wall and is 
           swallowed by the canopy of trees below. 

           Hillary laughs it off, pebbles rain. The music in her earbuds 
           turns choppy and dies. She plucks them out and lets them 
           fall, too. They’re a crutch anyway. 

           She gives the MINIATURE SILVER PITON she wears on a cord 
           around her neck a good luck kiss and blasts off! 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A documentary crew filming Hillary from a parallel summit. 

           NEIL (30s), a chiseled adventure filmmaker, and JEN (40s), a 
           scrappy cameraperson. Neil is trying to film Hillary with a 
           massive telephoto lens. Jen is flying a drone.
                                 NEIL
                        I think I’m gonna faint.

                                 JEN
                        Just pretend she’s tied in.

                                 NEIL
                        I can’t believe I let her talk me 
                        into this.

                                 JEN
                        Better it’s you. If it wasn’t you, 
                        it’d be someone else.

                                 NEIL
                        Where’s my Tums, do you have 
                        another Tums?

                                 JEN
                        You ate ‘em all.

           Neil looks back through the lens. Gets on his walkie. 

                                 NEIL
                        Ernie. She’s coming. Are you set?

                                 ERNIE (WALKIE)
                        Not gonna lie, I’m nervous as hell.

                                 NEIL
                        Good. You stay nervous. Once you’re 
                        not nervous, you’re fucked.

                                                              BACK TO: 

           HILLARY. Stemming up the corner, smearing toes against 
           granite. She knows this rock by heart, she’s rehearsed it a 
           hundred times, and she has the sequence dialed. Reach left. 
           Toe here. Find the hold. Breathe... 

           She climbs up to ERNIE (30s), filming from a fixed line. He’s 
           big enough to bear hunt with a branch. She takes a breath. 

                                 HILLARY
                        You want another take? I could make 
                        it look like it’s hard for me.

                                 ERNIE
                             (nervous)
                        You don’t have the acting chops... 

                                 NEIL (WALKIE)
                        Are you fucking kidding?! Don’t 
                        talk to her, don’t distract her!

                                 HILLARY
                        Is that Neil? 
           Hillary latches on to a crimp, swivels towards Neil’s 
           mountain. She can’t see him but she knows he’s there. Waves. 
           Kodak courage. 

                                 NEIL (WALKIE)
                        Tell her to quit showing off and 
                        climb...

                                 HILLARY
                        Tell him to take another Tums. I’m 
                        ahead of schedule.

                                 JEN (WALKIE)
                        You’re doing great! Focus!

                                 ERNIE
                        I’ll see you at the top, kid. 

           He films her as she blasts past him, sprinting up the rock. 
           Giving it all she’s got. Climbing higher. Once she gets to 
           the crack, the wall is hers. It’s fist jams all the way.

           She pastes her foot on to a ripple. Crimping creases with her 
           fingers. Reaching for the hold. Pulling herself up.

           Hillary makes her way to the lighting-bolt crack above. It 
           splits the rock and zigzags to the top of the pitch. Passes 
           another Go Pro. They’re all over the rock. She perches on a 
           tiny foothold. Takes a breath. Breathes in the world. 

           It’s all downhill from here. She reaches for the crack -- 

           But slips! Gasps. Dangling from one hand. Rock dust rains. 
           Hillary’s gasping. Desperate. SCREAMS wafting up from below. 

           Neil is fumbling with his walkie.

                                 NEIL
                        Hurry! Go, Ernie!

           Ernie chucks the camera, and snaps into action. Click. Click. 
           He’s jugging up the line, panicking, pulling on a mechanical 
           ascender, thirty feet away.

                                 NEIL
                        Faster!

           Jen snatches the walkie from Neil.

                                 JEN
                        BE CAREFUL!

           All of Hillary’s weight on her fingertips. Knuckles whiten. 
           She looks down. And for the first time in her life she’s 
           afraid of heights.
                                 ERNIE
                        I’m coming, Hill! 

           She tries to pull herself up. Feet scraping the wall for 
           friction. She can hear the fans freaking out down there.

                                 ERNIE
                        Grab the line!

           Hillary’s arm is shaking. Pumped and flushed. Fear pops out 
           her eyes. Grasping for Ernie’s fixed line. But it’s just too 
           far. She’s searching for another hold. Anything. Reaching.

           Fingers slipping. Lactic acid humming in her forearms. 

           Ernie’s working the rope. Click. Click. Twenty feet below. 
           But Hillary knows it’s over. She can’t hold on anymore. Tears 
           fall down her face and sting her eyes, extinguishing the fire 
           within. She screams. More rage than fear.

                                 NEIL (WALKIE)
                        Ernie! Climb!

           Hillary finds the grace to close her eyes and breathe. 

                                 HILLARY
                             (resigned)
                        I can’t.

           Her eyes SNAP OPEN. And instead of being evicted... 

           She lets go. Falling on her own terms. 

           Ernie kicks off the wall. Tries to catch her and -- WHAMMM!! 
           The impact snaps his arm like a stick. 

           Jen screams in horror as Hillary falls into the void. Like 
           the statue of a climber, gripping the wind, the forest 
           growing beneath her feet. This is when the rope would catch 
           her. But the tug never comes. Because there is no rope. There 
           never was. 

           Neil is screaming. Veins bulging. Split flying. The free fall 
           reflected in the lens of HIS CAMERA. 

           Tourists turn away in horror. Mothers shielding the eyes of 
           screaming children. Live newscasts cutting to commercial.

           Gray rock blurs by. WHAMM!!! She catches an outcrop, 
           shattering both legs. Bounces off the wall. Falling still. 
           Seconds left to live. She surrenders to gravity. To nature.  

           As the forest rushes up and eats her alive.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. VAN - DAY

           Hillary opens her eyes. Shooting confused looks around. Wipes 
           the sleep from her eyes. The old sizzle is gone. 

           She sits on a small cot in a dark, cramped Ecoline van. She 
           kicks her feet over the side. Breathes. This is a mobile 
           climbing base camp. Built-out. Even a small kitchen. She 
           rises. Stiff as a board. 

           Her piton necklace is dinged and scratched. She gives it a 
           good luck kiss. The first of many morning rituals. Next, she 
           pops her pills.

           And then she’s doing pull ups on a crimp training board.  
           Angry purple surgery scars bisect her neck. Fleshy bumps from 
           the metal screws tent the skin in her knees. A screw is loose 
           again. She fingers it. Winces. Pushes it back into place. 
           Continues with her set.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - YOSEMITE VALLEY - DAY

           Buttes and spires soar in the background. Hillary throws open 
           the door of her van. Emerges into the light. We finally see 
           the hardened skin graft that traverses her brow and descends 
           to her ear like a little mask.

           She limps up her driveway and into her small house on a 
           secluded cul de sac. Shuffles past the trash can where THE 
           BROKEN CEILING FAN has been haphazardly discarded. Strange.

           She’s about to open the door. Stops. Looks up at the second 
           story window. Smiles. Jumps on to the portico, shimmies up. 
           Leaps on to the awning. Pulls herself up on to the roof, 
           enters through the window. 

           INT. HILLARY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Sleek, clean edges. Cold and empty. No decorations. Nothing 
           on the walls. Like she never bothered to move in.

           Hillary moves quickly to the bathroom, passing framed 
           magazine covers leaning against the wall. Action shots of 
           Hillary on rock walls. Climbing Magazine. Hillary Hall: “The 
           Gretzky of Granite.” 

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Hillary takes a shower. A ROPE BURN wrings her neck. Fresher 
           than the surgery scars. 

           On the floor, a waterlogged magazine. Rock & Ice. A photo of 
           a broken Hillary with a cane at the hospital rehab, staring 
           into the camera. “The High Cost of Vertical Living.” 
           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Hillary pulls her clothes out of the suitcase on top of her 
           empty dresser and gets dressed. There’s an old wheelchair 
           tucked in the corner. 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Two frayed photos on the fridge. Hillary, Neil, Jen and Ernie 
           on a snowy mountain peak. Like family. Happier times. On the 
           counter, a haunting pile of medical bills -- PAST DUE.

           Hillary sits sipping hot tea. Pulls out her atlas. Her dining 
           room table is covered with maps of China. Topos. Photos. A 
           leather bound climbing journal. Months of planning. 

           Research. Scattered news articles. Old and yellowed. “LOCAL 
           ROCK CLIMBERS MAKING ‘FIRST ASCENT’ IN CHINA.” Under the 
           headline, a photo of two men -- MARK HUDSON and PAUL 
           HERNANDEZ. Climbing partners. Arm-in-arm. Big smiles. 

           Hillary grabs the phone. Trying to work up the courage. 

           EXT. DARRAN MOUNTAINS - NEW ZEALAND - DAY

           Neil stands on a mountain peak. The stunning view of the New 
           Zealand surrounds him. Ernie and Jen are checking their 
           equipment. A CLIMBER is harnessing up. 

           Neil’s phone rings. Unknown number. He answers. 

                                 NEIL
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT: Hillary grimaces, and hangs up on him. She throws 
           her phone. It skips across the carpet. She looks at it. 

           Picks it up again, and dials. Neil answers.

                                 NEIL
                        Who is this?

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s Hill. 

           Neil sucks in a surprised breath. Hillary bites her lip.

                                 NEIL
                        Jesus. Hill. How are you? 

           Neil’s team is ready to shoot, and calling for him. He holds 
           up a finger. He’s been waiting for this call for a long time.

                                 HILLARY
                        I’m great! I’m good! I’m okay. Hey, 
                        it’s windy, are you--
                                 NEIL
                        --Darran Mountains. We’re on a 
                        shoot for Patagonia. 

                                 HILLARY
                        I realize this is out of the blue. 
                        I was meaning to call you back.

                                 NEIL
                        You changed your number.

                                 HILLARY
                        I changed a lot of things. 

                                 NEIL
                        Are you okay?

                                 HILLARY
                        One hundred percent. 

                                 NEIL
                        You disappeared.

                                 HILLARY
                        ...I’m back.

                                 NEIL
                        What do the doctors say?

                                 HILLARY
                        They say what doctors say. It’s all 
                        good now. I’m climbing again.

                                 NEIL
                        Of course you are.

           Ernie is watching Neil. He’s put on some weight since we last 
           saw him. His eyes have dulled. Jen nudges him. 

                                 JEN
                        It’s her.

           Ernie shudders. Neil moves away for privacy.

                                 HILLARY
                        Listen, I’m calling cuz I found an 
                        epic. A four thousand foot big wall 
                        in China. This beautiful crack 
                        system. It’s a legit first ascent. 
                        Virgin rock. No one knows about it.

                                 NEIL
                        You’re bouncing off the walls, 
                        aren’t you?
                                 HILLARY
                        They said I’d never walk again let 
                        alone climb.

                                 NEIL
                        That’s the price to play when you 
                        climb without ropes. 

                                 HILLARY
                        You can say I told you so if it 
                        will make you feel any better.

           She takes a sip of hot tea. A SHARP PAIN rockets through her 
           body. Her hand goes limp, and she spills the tea down her 
           shirt. She jumps up, swallowing a scream. 

                                 NEIL
                        What do you want, Hill?

           She pulls out a bottle of pills. Chews one down. 

                                 HILLARY
                        ...I want to finish the film. We 
                        can pivot, we’ll make it an against-
                        all-odds type thing.

           She’s pacing, flapping her numb hand, trying to get it back. 

                                 NEIL
                        Hillary Hall’s fall and rise? 

                                 HILLARY
                        See?! You make me better. I need my 
                        old climbing partner. You’re the 
                        only one I trust on my rope...

                                 NEIL
                        Pitch it to the North Face, they 
                        got a million guys.

                                 HILLARY
                        I don’t want to sell anything, I 
                        don’t want to answer to anyone. I 
                        want you and Ernie and Jen and 
                        that’s it.

                                 NEIL
                        Who’s gonna pay for it?

                                 HILLARY
                        You. I’m selling you my life rights. 

           Neil is hesitant. But the wheels are turning. 

                                 NEIL
                        One condition.
                                 HILLARY
                        Anything.

                                 NEIL
                        I’m the filmmaker, you’re the 
                        subject. I’m going to ask you 
                        questions and you’re going to 
                        answer them. Nothing’s off limits.

           She GUFFAWS obnoxiously. Her hand is finally back to normal. 

                                 NEIL
                        I’m serious. 

           She hesitates. This is scarier than a 200 foot free fall. She 
           looks up at a hole in the ceiling. RED WIRES DANGLE.  

                                 NEIL
                        Are you there? 

           She looks over at the wall. A homemade poster tacked up.

           A GIANT BIG ROCK WALL printed on several sheets of paper to 
           form a collage. DÌYÙ SHAN. Four thousand feet of sheer 
           granite. A cave one thousand feet near the summit, like a 
           screaming mouth. Cracks like wrinkles. Spires jut up on 
           either side like horns. If the devil has a face, this is it.

                                 NEIL
                        Do we have a deal or not? 

                                 HILLARY
                             (terrified)
                        I’m an open book.

                                                                CUT TO:

                                F I R S T   A S C E N T

           EXT. SICHUAN PROVINCE, CHINA - DAY

           Rural China. Steep terraced rice fields. Limestone landscapes 
           filled with toiling farmers and lumbering water buffalo. In 
           the distance, mountain peaks stretch into heaven. 

           WOOSHH!!! A small battered van roars past. 

           INT. VAN - DAY

           LI (70s), a chain-smoking local with leathery skin, is 
           driving the crew through the stone slab streets of his 
           ancient mountain village. The van screams and wheezes.

           Neil, Hillary, and Ernie are squeezed in back. A little too 
           close. It’s a bumpy ride. Jen’s in front readying her camera. 
           Hillary studies satellite images of the mountain, making 
           notes in her journal, oblivious to the beauty that surrounds. 
           Her jacket is hiked to hide her rope burn.

                                 NEIL
                        Aren’t you hot?

           She shakes her head, no. Ernie has got his ear buds in, 
           leaving a voicemail. 

                                 ERNIE
                        ...Hey, babe. It’s me again. We 
                        landed. The turbulence was crazy. I 
                        thought we were gong down for a 
                        minute. Anyway. You should be home 
                        from work by now. Just... I’m 
                        calling. Call me back. Can we talk 
                        about this? Please.

           He hangs up, rips his earbuds out. Solemn. 

           Hillary looks up. Surprised to find a camera in her face. Jen 
           is swiveled in the passenger seat, shooting.

                                 HILLARY
                        Do we have to film everything? I 
                        look like shit... 

                                 NEIL
                        Camera never turns off.

           Neil swipes her hair away from her face. It was hiding her 
           skin graft from the camera. She rips away from his touch.

                                 HILLARY
                        Stop. What the are you doing?

           She quickly covers it back up with her hair.

                                 NEIL
                        Relax. It makes you look badass.

           She considers. And then pulls back her hair, revealing the 
           skin graft for camera. She glances at Ernie. He’s texting 
           madly, thumbs flying across the screen.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        What is it about a first ascent?

           Hillary spikes the lens. On edge. 

                                 HILLARY
                        You don’t waste time, do you?

                                 NEIL
                        Deal’s a deal.
                                 HILLARY
                        Well. For one thing. A first ascent 
                        is hard to come by these days.

                                 ERNIE
                             (sighs)
                        Yeah, you gotta go to China.

                                 LI 
                        You’re not the first.

           They all look at Li. Jen is filming him now.

                                 NEIL
                        ...What?

                                 LI (CONT’D)
                        Men came. Americans. Years ago. 

                                 NEIL
                        Are you sure?

                                 LI
                        I drove them myself.

                                 ERNIE
                        Uhhhh... Hill?

                                 NEIL
                        You said this was virgin rock...

                                 HILLARY
                        No. I said it was a first ascent. 

                                 LI
                        They were arrogant men.

                                 NEIL
                        Did they make it to the top?

                                 LI
                        There was a bad storm. They were 
                        never found.

                                 HILLARY
                        See? Still a first ascent. The fact 
                        that people have tried and failed 
                        is all the better. 

                                 ERNIE
                        Wow. 

                                 HILLARY
                        I didn’t mean it like that. I mean. 
                        You know what I mean.
                             (to Neil)
                        Don’t put that in.
                                 NEIL
                             (to Li)
                        Hold on, but is it safe?

                                 HILLARY
                        Of course it’s safe. They made a 
                        bad call, these guys. I mean, check 
                        the fucking weather. Really.

                                 LI
                        Many have tried... 

                                 HILLARY
                        More the merrier. 

           Li blows out an angry plume of smoke. 

                                 ERNIE
                        Hillary. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Relax! It’s five-twelve climbing at 
                        best, it’s like sending Freerider 
                        on El Cap, it’s our sweet spot.

                                 LI
                        They say that mountain doesn’t want 
                        to be climbed.

           The team is thoroughly spooked by this. They exchange looks. 
           WHAMM! They hit a pothole and slam into each other. 

                                 HILLARY
                             (to Li)
                        Listen, we’re not like those other 
                        guys. We climb clean, we keep 
                        things in balance. Being a good 
                        steward of the rock is just as 
                        important as the ascent itself. 

           Li takes a greedy drag, watching Hillary in the mirror. It 
           creeps her out. A sharp pain shoots down her arm. She gasps.

                                 NEIL
                        What’s wrong?

                                 HILLARY
                        Nothing. Just... the altitude. 
                        We’re so high up.

                                 NEIL
                        We’re about to get a lot higher...

           Ernie gasps, remembering something. He quickly rips off his 
           left boot and sock, and shakes out a hidden DIME BAG OF WEED. 

           They all eye him.
                                 ERNIE
                             (shrugs)
                        It’s medicinal. For my anxiety. 

           They’re heading for an endless gray forest.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           The road ends at a base of a dark and gnarled forest. A 
           trail. Fenced in. A gate is chained and padlocked.

                                 LI
                        This is as far as I go.

           They all climb out. Li helps them unload their gear. 

                                 LI
                        Just follow the trail. I’ll be back 
                        in four days. Radio me when you’re 
                        coming out.

           Hillary pays him. He counts it. It’s a lot of money. 

                                 HILLARY
                        We’ll see you in four days.

           Guilt flashes in his eyes.

                                 ERNIE
                        How long’s the hike?

                                 LI
                        Don’t know...

                                 NEIL
                        Sir? Would you mind signing this 
                        release? To use your image in our 
                        documentary?

           Neil hands him the release. Li stares at it.

                                 NEIL
                        It’s pretty standard stuff.

           Li considers. And then he takes his glasses out, and pops 
           them on. Signs the paper on Neil’s back.

                                 NEIL
                        You’re gonna be a star!

           Li shoots him a pitiful look, jumps back in the van, and 
           peels away like he can’t get out of there fast enough. 
           Hillary watches him vanish over the horizon. 

           Turns to the hand painted sign hanging on THE FENCE. It has a 
           slew of shouting Chinese characters and a crude drawing of a 
           stick figure with an X through him. It probably says BEWARE.
                                 ERNIE
                        How do we get through?

           Hillary opens her backpack full of tools. Pulls out a pair of 
           bolt cutters. Snips the chain right off the gate. 

                                 ERNIE
                        I had a feeling.

           The gate CREAKS open. The wind picks up. They look toward the 
           dark forest. It’s breathing. Alive. 

                                 JEN
                        Can I just say, before we start, 
                        you know I speak for all of us when 
                        I say that we are honored to be a 
                        part of this. You’re so strong. 
                        Everything you went through, you 
                        know, coming back from all that, 
                        it’s really inspirational, 
                        overcoming advers--

                                 HILLARY
                        --Jen. Stop. I love you, but please 
                        don’t patronize me.

                                 JEN
                        Uh.

                                 HILLARY
                        I’m a rock climber not a little 
                        china cup. I don’t want you guys 
                        walking on egg shells around me or 
                        anything like that. Alright?

                                 JEN
                        Oh, totally, I didn’t mean--

                                 HILLARY
                        --I plan to bust my ass for the 
                        next four days, I expect the same 
                        from all of you.

                                 JEN
                        Copy that.

           Neil chews a Tums. Ernie’s cell phone RINGS. He answers. 

                                 ERNIE
                        Hello? Baby-- Hold on. No, hold on. 

           Distraught, Ernie hurries off for privacy. A frantic, 
           whispering argument. 

                                 HILLARY
                        What’s with him?
                                 JEN
                        Monica broke up with him again.

                                 HILLARY
                        What’d he do now?

                                 JEN
                        He went to China.

           Hillary messes up her face. Shoots Ernie a look, as if his 
           condition might be contagious. 

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           The forest is ominously quiet. No breeze. As the team 
           bushwhacks, the path is getting narrower. Straining as they 
           lug equipment. Massive haul bags on their backs. Hillary is 
           limping. Pretending everything is okay. 

           Jen approaches Neil and Ernie. Hillary’s out of earshot. 

                                 JEN
                        And? On again or off again?

                                 NEIL
                        No. Nothing. I’m the director, 
                        she’s the subject. That’s it. 

                                 ERNIE
                        Are you sharing a portaledge?

                                 NEIL
                        Absolutely not. 

           They look at him. Not buying. 

                                 NEIL
                        Do you know what it’s like 
                        competing against a mountain? The 
                        mountain always wins. 

           Up ahead, Hillary stops to catch her breath. 

                                 ERNIE
                        She’s already struggling.

                                 NEIL
                        Please. She has the most endurance 
                        of any climber I’ve ever seen. 

                                 JEN
                        I saw her climb a hundred pitches 
                        in a single day.

                                 ERNIE
                        What about mentally? I heard she 
                        lost her vertical hold.
                                 NEIL
                        I’m keeping an eye on it. 

                                 ERNIE
                        Is she gonna do any soloing?

                                 NEIL
                        No. I told her... I won’t be around 
                        it. She’s using ropes from now on. 

                                 ERNIE
                        I don’t have another El Cap in me, 
                        man. I still have nightmares.

                                 JEN
                        It’s a second chance for all of us.

                                 NEIL
                        It’s is gonna be a great film. 
                        People might even see it. I mean 
                        real people, not just climbers.

                                 JEN
                        She’s a great character.

                                 ERNIE
                        That’s what she is, a character. 
                        It’s all an act with her.

                                 NEIL
                        No. This is warts and all. 

                                 ERNIE
                        Does she know that? 

           Neil shoots them a look. Hillary snaps back into character.

                                 HILLARY
                        Move out! We’re burning daylight!

           EXT. RIVER - DAY

           A raging, swollen river blocks their path. A fixed line 
           across the river -- the Tyrol traverse. 

           Jen is filming as Hillary crosses, using her feet to push off 
           the anchor tree. She gains some momentum, pulling herself 
           across, inch by inch. Hair scrapes the raging water. 

           EXT. STONE FOREST - DAY

           The team moves through a stunning forest of rock. Towering 
           stalagmite pillars, 100-feet tall. They stay close, sticking 
           to the trail for fear or getting lost in the rocky labyrinth.
           Suddenly, A CHINESE CLIMBER darts out from behind a spire 
           startling the team. Ropes slung over his shoulders. Pitons 
           dangling. Carrying a pack. He looks lost. Sweat-stained.

                                 HILLARY
                        Are you okay?

           The man locks eyes with Hillary. And then he starts YELLING 
           at her in Mandarin.

                                 NEIL
                        Do you need help?

           The man does an about-face, and stumbles away, weaving 
           through the spires, losing himself in the maze. They exchange 
           looks. Shrug it off, and keep moving.

           EXT. DÌYÙ SHAN - DAY

           They emerge through a clearing to reveal --

           The wonder that is DÌYÙ SHAN. A behemoth blade of vertical 
           granite nestled beside a rainbow speckled waterfall. Three 
           quarters of the way up, THE CAVE. Like a ravenous mouth.

           They drop their gear and crane in awe of it. A secret rock 
           climber’s paradise. 

                                 NEIL
                        It’s stunning. Cracks for days.

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s perfect. 

                                 JEN
                        It’s a dream.

           A sharp gust of wind blasts through the canyon like a moan, 
           swaying the canopies around them. Ernie lowers the camera.

                                 ERNIE
                        I don’t like it.

           They look at him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           They move past an ancient shrine, conquered by moss and 
           vines. A faded YIN YANG symbol carved in stone.

           A millennia’s worth of OFFERINGS laid on the ground 
           throughout the valley. A plate of old coins, ancient stone 
           votives, clay pottery, carved statues of lions and dragons. 
           Withered silk and jade flapping in the breeze. 

           The team moves through the vast sea of treasures, trying not 
           to disturb them. Jen is filming it all. 
                                 HILLARY
                        Offerings.

           The closer they get to the mountain, the stranger the 
           offerings become. 

           They navigate small stacks of sun-bleached animal bones. Like 
           trail markers of some kind. Some of them almost look human...

           Ernie is creeped out. 

           EXT. BASE CAMP - DAY

           Ernie stands before an old basecamp. A fire ring. Tents 
           collapsed, worn, and withering. 

                                 ERNIE
                        I found their basecamp.

           The rest of the team approaches, Hillary taking up the rear.

                                 JEN
                        I wonder who they were...

                                 HILLARY
                        Paul Hernandez and Mark Hudson. It 
                        happened fifteen years ago. Paul 
                        was a first ascensionist, Mark was 
                        a sport climber from Yosemite.

                                 NEIL
                        Hold on. You knew about this?

                                 HILLARY
                        Sure. That’s how I found this 
                        place. I mean, what do you think 
                        I’ve been doing for the past two 
                        years? Research. Looking for virgin 
                        rock...

                                 NEIL
                        I mean, were you gonna tell us?

                                 HILLARY
                             (shrugs)
                        I’m telling you now.

           He chews a Tums.

                                 HILLARY
                        Neil. It’s safe. There’s nothing to 
                        worry about. I’m telling you it was 
                        a freak accident with these guys.

                                 ERNIE
                        Shit. Their portaledge is still up.
           Ernie points to an old PORTALEDGE TENT dangling twenty six 
           hundred feet above. Hanging on for dear life. Rusty. Sun-
           swept and flapping in the wind. A loose pole clanking. A 
           haunted house on a rock wall.

                                 JEN
                        Must be where the storm hit.

                                 HILLARY
                        It rained for five days, they were 
                        just stuck up there.

                                 NEIL
                        Sitting ducks.

                                 HILLARY
                        Lucky for us it’s nothing but sun.

                                 JEN
                        Should we say a prayer or 
                        something?

                                 HILLARY
                        Do you know any?

                                 ERNIE
                        I know grace.  

                                 NEIL
                        Now I lay me down to sleep.

                                 JEN
                        How about a moment of silence?

                                 HILLARY
                        Yeah. Good. Silence. 

           They all hold hands. Close their eyes. Silence. And then a 
           bird of prey SHRIEKS above, murdering their silence, and 
           making them jump. They all laugh at the scare.

           EXT. BASECAMP - DAY

           Black diamond tents erected. Triple trad racks. All their 
           gear is laid out on blankets for inventory. So much stuff. 
           Endless stacks of coiled rope. Slings, and carabiners. Cams, 
           hexes and haul bags. Solar panels for charging batteries. 

           Neil is studying the rock through a scope. Checking it 
           against the detailed satellite maps spread out on racks. 
           Their route is planned, and scouted. 

           Jen films. Hillary hams it up for the camera. 
                                 HILLARY
                        Welcome to Dìyù Shan. Four thousand 
                        feet of sheer granite, that’s 
                        higher than the Twin Towers stacked 
                        on top of each other. We’re 
                        climbing it the purest way. Every 
                        pitch blind, with no idea what’s in 
                        store. Neil and I found the 
                        cleanest route with the least 
                        amount of interruption.

           Jen films Neil, looming over the maps, tracing their route 
           with his finger. 

                                 NEIL
                        We open up here, ninety degrees 
                        going up the corner to the crack 
                        system. A thousand feet to this 
                        ledge. We’ll establish the first 
                        portaledge camp there.

                                 ERNIE
                        Looks like good clean rock, too. 

           Ernie sets his drone free. Zzzzzzzzzz! It flies up the rock. 

                                 ERNIE
                        Come see. All we gotta do is climb. 
                        No real janitorial work. 

           They all huddle around the monitor watching the drone climb. 
           Checking out the features. All the way to the top.

                                 HILLARY
                        Yup. Here comes pitch twenty. This 
                        is the point of no return. It’s two 
                        thirds of the way. Once we reach 
                        twenty six hundred feet, the only 
                        way out is up. 

           The drone approaches the PORTALEDGE. They all cringe. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Can you get closer, Ernie?

           The drone hovers at the entrance. They all look.

                                 ERNIE
                        It’s empty.

           But there’s something staining the side. A RED SMEAR.

                                 ERNIE
                        Is that blood?

                                 NEIL
                        Jesus. 
                                 ERNIE
                        I bet it was an avalanche that 
                        killed ‘em. I bet the storm shook 
                        those rocks loose. Look at the 
                        fracture lines, it’s a house of 
                        cards...

                                 JEN
                        Are we taking the trail down? 

           She shows them THE TRAIL on satellite topo map. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Right down the back, easy.

           The drone keeps climbing. Ernie finds the mouth of THE CAVE.

                                 ERNIE
                        Oh. Hello.

           EXT. CAVE - DAY

           Zzzzzzzzz. Dark. Drippy. The small white drone buzzing at the 
           mouth like cicadas. Hovering, as if afraid to enter. 

           Ernie presses the control. The drone creeps inside the cave. 
           Zzzzzzzzzzz. Ernie is watching on the monitor. Darkness. He 
           turns on the drone light, illuminating it. 

           Swirls of ancient dust. Shadows play on the wall. WOOSH! 
           Something skitters past. He squints. But nothing. A trick of 
           the light. Zzzzzzz-- The buzzing stops abruptly. The monitor 
           goes black.

                                 ERNIE
                        Fuck.

           He cranes up at the cave. 

                                 ERNIE
                        Hey, Jen? It cut out. It’s in the 
                        cave. I can’t get a... I lost 
                        control.

                                 JEN
                        It’s out of range, maybe.

                                 ERNIE
                        Shit. It’s not coming out. I just 
                        bought that one, too.

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s alright, I’ll get it for you 
                        when we get up there. 
           They stare up at the cave. Hillary peels her eyes. Thinks she 
           sees a FIGURE standing in the dark. So high. Watching them.  
           But she blinks it away. Her mind’s playing tricks.

                                 JEN
                        You bring the spare? 

                                 ERNIE
                        Two is one, and one is none. 

           INT. TENT - NIGHT

           Hillary unzips her jacket. Studies her neck in a small 
           compact. She starts applying make up to cover her rope burn.

           EXT. BASECAMP - NIGHT

           Hillary sits before the fire staring directly at us. It’s 
           unsettling. Behind her, the rock glimmers in the moonlight.

                                 HILLARY
                        A first ascent’s about being 
                        somewhere no one’s ever been. The 
                        puzzle of it, having the vision to 
                        see the line. Having no knowledge 
                        of what’s ahead. Pushing your 
                        limits. Plus, there’s a certain 
                        respect involved.

           Reveal the lens she’s staring at -- like she’s a hostage, and 
           it’s the barrel of a gun. Neil and the guys behind it. This 
           is an interview session. 

                                 NEIL
                        How so?

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s your route. You name it. 
                        There’s something about being 
                        first. Achieving something no human 
                        has. You know, the Taoists thought 
                        mountains were a sacred place. A 
                        means of communication between 
                        heaven and earth. A bridge between 
                        the two. They say the rock is a 
                        great pillar, holding up the 
                        heavens. It’s a place where 
                        immortality can be found. And 
                        that’s true in some ways. You’re 
                        first. You live forever up there 
                        somehow. A legacy. 

                                 NEIL
                        Are you looking for something to 
                        leave behind?
                                 HILLARY
                        What do you mean?

                                 NEIL
                        I mean you’re lucky to be alive. 

                                 HILLARY
                        And I just want to be as alive as I 
                        can be from now on. 

                                 NEIL
                        What was it like... when they told 
                        you you’d never climb again?

                                 HILLARY
                        What do you think it was like?

                                 NEIL
                        Well, how did it feel?

                                 HILLARY
                        I’ve always been climbing... since 
                        you and I were kids in Yosemite. I 
                        never stopped before. 

                                 NEIL
                        Yeah. It must have been terrifying.

                                 HILLARY
                        I was never scared on a mountain. 
                        Even without ropes. I was scared on 
                        the couch. I’d been going hard for 
                        twenty years without stopping. And 
                        suddenly I’m laid up. Nothing to do 
                        but think...

                                 NEIL
                        What were you thinking about?

                                 HILLARY
                        Walking again. And then climbing 
                        again. And if I ever would...

           She snaps back into character.

                                 HILLARY
                        But here I am! Two years later. 
                        Sending an epic. Proving everyone 
                        wrong as usual. 

                                 NEIL
                        What would your life look like if 
                        you weren’t climbing?

                                 HILLARY
                        I hate this. 
                                 NEIL
                        We had a deal.

                                 HILLARY
                        What would it look like? I wouldn’t 
                        look like anything. If I don’t 
                        climb, I’ll die.

                                 NEIL
                        I heard you went away.

                                 HILLARY
                        Went away?

                                 NEIL
                        Fifty-one-fifty. Committed.

           Jen and Ernie’s ears perk. Hillary gazes into the camera. Her 
           reflection trapped in the lens. 

                                 JEN
                        We gotta be up, why don’t we give a 
                        rest for the night?

                                 NEIL
                        What happened?

                                 HILLARY
                        Nothing, that’s not... I just-- I 
                        had a reaction to the meds. I had 
                        to get ‘em straightened out.

           Hillary rubs her cheek against her shoulder to hide her neck. 

                                 NEIL
                        I’m not judging you. I’m just 
                        trying to understand. 

           She jumps to her feet, knocking over the chair.

                                 HILLARY
                        There’s nothing to understand! I’m 
                        a climber, I fucking climb! That’s 
                        all there is! You know that better 
                        than anyone, Neil, fuck!

                                 JEN
                        Hey, okay, enough. Let’s just call 
                        it a day...

                                 NEIL
                        What are you climbing away from?

           It hits a nerve. In a huff, Hillary hurries away from the 
           cameras, into the darkness. Ernie and Jen look at Neil.
                                 JEN
                        Warts and all.

           Neil pops on a Tums. Hurries after her. Jen turns to Ernie. 

                                 JEN
                        It’s like she’s his mountain. Only he’s 
                        trying to get to the bottom of her. 

           Ernie shoots her a look. Jen makes eyes at him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Hillary stares up at the rock. It looks like a giant 
           tombstone in the night. Perched at the mouth of the cave is a 
           BLACK VULTURE. A grotesque, razor-beaked predator, always 
           watching. It spreads its wings like the angel of death, and 
           blasts off with a shill shriek, flying against the moon.

           The bigness of it terrifies her. She has to look away. Neil 
           approaches. She hides her tears.

                                 NEIL
                        I’m sorry.

                                 HILLARY
                        What the fuck are doing with those 
                        questions?

                                 NEIL
                        I’m just trying to figure out what 
                        this movie’s about.

                                 HILLARY
                        You’re not Werner Herzog, you shoot 
                        climbing porn.

                                 NEIL
                        Whoa. Okay.

                                 HILLARY
                        If you make me look like an 
                        asshole, I swear to Christ I’ll 
                        burn down your life. 

                                 NEIL
                        I’m just trying to make you look 
                        like a human being.

                                 HILLARY
                        Well, stop.

           Hillary storms off.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Jen is packing up the gear. Ernie is frantic. On the phone.
                                 ERNIE
                        Honey, listen, answer your phone, 
                        will yah? Please. It’s expensive to 
                        leave these. Okay? Um, listen, I’m 
                        not gonna have service on the rock 
                        up there, can you call me, please? 
                        I love you. Okay! Love you, bye.

           He drops the phone. The world ripped out from under him. He’s 
           ghost white, and has to take a knee.

                                 JEN
                        Are you okay?

                                 ERNIE
                        She’s with Albert, I know it. 

                                 JEN
                        I think that’s in your head, you 
                        know? I don’t think that’s real.

                                 ERNIE
                        I got fat. I know that. I’m 
                        depressed, I don’t know--

                                 JEN
                        --You’re perfect. You’re Ernie. 
                        Everybody loves you, ya big galoot.

           She puts a hand on his shoulder. He pulls away. His gaze 
           shifts back to the rock wall. Moonlight catches the cracks 
           just right and illuminates the granite. It’s glimmering like 
           a starry night. A hypnotic optical illusion. 

           He has tears in his eyes, staring transfixed. A low hum 
           emanating from the rock. The sound washes over him. 

                                 ERNIE
                        Look at the granite.

                                 JEN
                        Yeah.

                                 ERNIE
                        How it shines. It’s so beautiful. 

           The rock is calling him. He rises and goes to the wall. Jen 
           watches him, a little worried.

           EXT. THE BASE OF THE WALL - NIGHT

           Ernie stands before the wall, wide eyed. It SHIMMERS, diamond-
           like. His eyes glaze over. He is compelled to touch the rock. 
           Feels the warmth. Beating like a heart of stone...
           He looks down at his hand, and the granite sparkle has rubbed 
           off. He blows the residue off. It swirls into the wind like 
           pixie dust. He inhales it, and sneezes.  

           He tries to wipe off the sparkle, but it’s sticky and doesn’t 
           come off. Crystals absorbing into his skin. The shimmer is 
           hypnotic. He stares at his hands like an infant discovering 
           them for the first time.

           INT. TENT - NIGHT

           Hillary is cutting tape with a small knife. She tries to calm 
           the tremor. Her hand is shaking violently, and she hasn’t 
           even started climbing yet.

                                 NEIL (O.S.)
                        Hill?

           She hides her hand, looks towards the flap. Takes a deep 
           breath, fighting tears. Playing strong. 

           EXT. TENT - CONTINUOUS

           Neil sees her shadow play on the tent wall. 

                                 NEIL
                        I just don’t want you to feel like 
                        you’re stuck. We can leave anytime. 
                        And I’ll eat it. You don’t owe me 
                        anything. No one even has to know, 
                        I promise...   

           INTERCUT: They speak through the closed flap. 

                                 HILLARY
                             (not selling it)
                        Nothing’s gonna stop me.

                                 NEIL
                        Just promise me if it gets to be 
                        too much you’ll tell me. 

                                 HILLARY
                        I promise.

                                 NEIL
                        Why don’t I believe you?

                                 HILLARY
                        Because I’m lying.

                                 NEIL
                        Thanks for being honest. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Make sure you’re dialed tomorrow.
                                 NEIL
                        Of course. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Also... I want to say... thanks.

                                 NEIL
                        For what?

                                 HILLARY
                        Coming. Everything. I don’t know...

                                 NEIL
                             (smiles)
                        Let’s do something great. 

           He goes. Hillary collapses with exhaustion. Closes her eyes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A FLASH OF HILLARY FALLING HEAD OVER HEELS -- WOOOOSHH!! 
           HURDLING RIGHT AT US -- WE BRACE FOR IMPACT! 

           INT. TENT - NIGHT

           Hillary snaps awake, bolts up. Sucking a massive breath. 
           Covered in sweat. She hears a rustling outside. And then a 
           shadow falls over her tent.  

                                 HILLARY
                        Neil?

           The shadow moves around the tent. Slow, lumbering steps.  
           Muttering in Mandarin. Hillary’s eyes bug. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Hello?!

           The shadow grows larger and then it melts away. She turns on 
           her lamp, and jumps out of the tent.  Nothing but the 
           screaming nightsong. Everyone is asleep.

           EXT. THE WALL - PRE DAWN

           Headlamps pierce the dark. Four dusty beams walking to the 
           start of the climb. Trail finally meets the wall.

           The sun starts to rise. Hillary cranes in awe of the 
           monolith. The first rays of morning spill down the face, 
           making the granite glitter. It’s magical.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Hillary and Neil step into their harnesses. They tie into 
           each other, connected by a life line. 
           Ernie has the camera on a gimble getting shots of the 
           process. Hillary and Neil fasten their shoes, and chalk up.  
           Wires and cams dangling off their harnesses. 

                                 NEIL
                        Where’s your helmet?

                                 HILLARY
                        I don’t have one.

                                 NEIL
                        You forgot it?

                                 HILLARY
                        I don’t own a helmet.

                                 ERNIE
                        I mean, that’s just so you.

                                 NEIL
                        You’re wearing a fucking helmet. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Still the safety Nazi, I see.

                                 NEIL
                        Ernie, you got an extra?

                                 ERNIE
                        Two is one, and one is none.

           He hands Hillary his helmet. She takes it reluctantly. Looks 
           at it like some revolting artifact.

                                 NEIL
                        You put it on your head and you 
                        push the clip in. You want me to 
                        show you how?

           She huffs, puts it on. Checks her knot.  

                                 NEIL
                        The first lead is yours. 

                                 HILLARY
                        One pitch at a time.

                                 NEIL
                             (into his walkie)
                        Standby, Jen.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Jen is perched on a ledge on the other side of the valley 
           filming with a long lens. 
                                 JEN
                             (into walkie)
                        Copy that.

           BACK TO SCENE: Hillary takes a deep breath. Kisses her 
           necklace. And then --

                                 NEIL
                        It feels good. Being tied to you 
                        again.

                                 HILLARY
                        On belay?

                                 NEIL
                        Belay on. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Climbing.

                                 NEIL
                        Climb on.

           She smiles at him. Touches the rock. Looks up. It seems 
           infinite, and it makes her dizzy.

                                 HILLARY
                        You’re mine.

           Feet push off and she starts climbing. Testing the friction 
           of the granite with her shoes. Finding holds. Fingers trace 
           rock. A slow start, but she’s trying like hell not to appear 
           gun shy for the cameras. 

           Neil belays, feeding her rope. Nervous. Biting his lip. She’s 
           placing gear to protect against falls. 

           Up she goes. Supreme concentration. The meat of her hand 
           swallowed by cracks. A perfect fit, like they were made for 
           each other. The wind whips through Hillary’s hair. Trees 
           crack in the distance. Ravens circle. Cawing. She looks up at 
           the bigness of the rock. The endless up. 

           Suddenly, the birds fly at breakneck speed towards the wall 
           like heat seeking missiles, and break their speed at the last 
           second, vanishing into the cracks where they nest.

                                 HILLARY
                        Did you see that?!

                                 NEIL
                        Beautiful!

                                 HILLARY
                        Did you get it, Ernie?!
                                 ERNIE
                        I got it.

                                 HILLARY
                        Good omen.

           Hillary chalks up. And climbs on. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           One hundred feet up. Working the rock. Slow and steady. Still 
           getting her bearings.

                                 NEIL
                        That’s it! You got this!

           The sun is on the rise, and so is she. Confidence building. 
           She has a unique climbing style, a singular voice, even at 
           half speed, no one climbs like her. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Two hundred feet up. ZZZZZZ. The drone’s constant buzz. 
           Hovering. Always watching. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Don’t get too close with that 
                        thing!

                                 ERNIE
                        Copy!

           Dopamine kicking in. The higher she climbs, the higher she 
           gets -- it’s a drug for her. The dull twinkle of obsession. 
           Ever so often snapping protection into the cracks. 

           She sprints up the rock like a maniac. In her element. The 
           Gretzky of Granite. This is where she belongs. 

           Neil belays, watching her like a hawk. And now she’s going 
           too fast. Flying.

                                 NEIL
                        Slow down! You’re not placing 
                        enough pro!

           Climbing with her entire being. Straddling the wall. Faster. 
           She’s got something to prove. To herself, to the world. 

                                 NEIL
                        Hillary! Efficacy not speed! You 
                        gotta hook your heel on that--

                                 HILLARY
                             (spit flying)
                        --SHUT THE FUCK UP, NEIL! 
                                 NEIL
                        Copy that.

           Hillary hooks her heel anyway, and flies down the corner. 
           It’s getting harder now. Spread-eagled on the blank face, she 
           can feel the cool stone against her cheek. She can hear that 
           eerie rhythmic beating.

           She pumps her fist. Her hand is flaring up. No matter. She 
           gives it a good shake, and fights through the pain. Fingers 
           press gently into the crystals. Her feet dance along the 
           micro-ripples. She’s slowing down. It doesn’t come as easy 
           like it did, she has to work twice as hard.

           Breathes in. The smell of chalky dolomite. It gives her 
           power. She releases the rock, pulls herself against the edge. 

           Grabs a hold, TWEAKS HER NECK. A sharp stab of pain rockets 
           through her body. Her hand dies. The rock spits her off.

                                 HILLARY
                        FALLI--ugh!

           She plummets. Neil braces on belay. The rope goes taut. She 
           falls and her CAM POPS OUT of the crack. 

           WOOOOSSSHHH!!!! She takes a whipper. Plummeting fifty feet. 
           Stomach in her throat.

           Neil reels in the slack through the belay, the force of the 
           fall slams him into the wall. The last nut arrests her fall 
           and she crashes into a ledge. WHUMP!!! Neil holds the rope 
           taut, bleeding from his head, a bad rope burn on his arm. 

           Ernie drops the controller in fear. He can’t look. The 
           horrible memories flooding back. 

           Hillary’s yanked up by her harness and CRACK!!! BASHES HER 
           HEAD ON A LEDGE AND -- 

           BLACK. 

           Wind. A shrill ringing in her ears. A creaky rope.

                                 NEIL (O.S.)
                        Hill?! 

                                                                CUT TO:

           HILLARY’S EYES flutter open and she sucks in a breath.

           She’s hanging upside down in mid air. In and out of 
           consciousness. Her piton necklace dangles across her face. 

           Neil’s voice is getting clearer now --
                                 NEIL (O.S)
                        Talk to me! Are you okay?! Are...

           Neil’s voice is consumed by the RINGING in her brain. A tiny 
           avalanche of pebbles bouncing off her head. Swinging and 
           dazed, she looks up to see --

           TWO BLURRY MEN CLIMBING FIFTY FEET ABOVE HER. Tied together. 
           Trying to get to the top. Hillary’s upside down so they’re 
           climbing the wrong way.

                                 CLIMBER #1
                        Something’s wrong... I think we 
                        should head down...

                                 CLIMBER #2
                        I’m getting to the top. There’s 
                        only up from now on!

           Climber #1 turns and looks Hillary dead in the eyes. 

           It’s MARK HUDSON. He’s long dead. In the throes of rigor 
           mortis, leathery and decomposing, but always climbing. 

           His JAW DETACHES from his skull, and comes hurdling down at 
           her. 

           Hillary gasps, and shields her face. But there’s no impact. 
           When she opens her eyes, the climbers are gone. 

           Hillary conjures a scream so loud it snaps her back to 
           reality. She kicks at the wall like she hates it, and turns 
           herself right side up. She shoots woozy looks around. 

           Ernie is queasy. He takes a knee. Touches the ground. Taking 
           deep breaths, trying not to let the memories overtake him.

                                 HILLARY
                        Is someone else here?!

                                 NEIL
                        Are you okay?! You hit your head!

           She checks for the Climbers one last time. 

                                 HILLARY (CONT’D)
                        I’m fine...

           She looks down at her hand. It’s dead. She sways back and 
           forth, balling it into a fist. 

                                 HILLARY
                             (to herself)
                        Fuck. Don’t do this to me. Not now.
           She reaches into her pocket, grabs a pill and chews it up. 
           She has tears in her eyes. She batts them away before the 
           drone can see. Her hand is limp and worthless.

                                 NEIL
                        Are you--

                                 HILLARY
                        --I’M FINE I SAID!

           She slaps it against the wall, trying to get feeling back. 
           She hides her hand from his view.

                                 HILLARY
                        C’mon, fucker. Fuck. Fuck. 

           Neil tries for a better look. Worried as she flaps her hand 
           wildly. Rubbing it. Scraping it against the stone. She’s 
           trying like hell to hide her plight from the cameras.

                                 NEIL
                        You’re okay, you’re just... you’re 
                        going way too hard, you gotta take 
                        it slow, you’re rusty!

           Hillary’s eyes sizzle with hate. She’s massaging her hand, 
           pumping it like a resuscitation. 

                                 JEN (WALKIE)
                        What’s wrong with her hand?

           Finally, Hillary’s hand comes back to life. She explodes up 
           the rock. Climbing lizard-like. Pushing and pulling. Her eyes 
           pulse with grit. A woman possessed. 

           Three hundred feet. Higher than Lady Liberty’s torch. And 
           Hillary is floating up with ease. 

           Down below, Neil is on his walkie talkie.

                                 NEIL
                        Are you getting this?

                                 JEN (WALKIE)
                        I got it.

                                 NEIL
                        What’d I tell you? She’s a madman.

           Sprinting up a few more moves, perfect climbing. She pulls 
           herself up to the base, and clips into the anchor. 

                                 NEIL
                        Jesus! That was amazing.

           Huffing and puffing. She smiles.
                                 JEN (WALKIE)
                        Hilly! Yer back baby!

           Down below, Ernie sits on the ground, hugging his drone. He’s 
           ghost white and sweating. Trying to keep the memories at bay.

                                 ERNIE
                        It’s happening again...

                                                                CUT TO:

           Hillary builds her belay. Neil climbs. He follows her route, 
           and her every fluid move. He pulls himself up to her.

                                 NEIL
                        Is your hand okay?

                                 HILLARY
                        I slept on it wrong. Your lead.

           They changeover. Another sharp blast of wind. And then a 
           WHIZZING sound. Getting louder. Hillary looks up to see THE 
           LOOSE POLE FROM THE PORTALEDGE spiraling towards her from 
           above like a spear and -- 

           WHAPPP! Catches her across the face before sailing to the 
           ground. It knocks her off the perch. She plummets, tangling 
           in the rope, and slamming into the wall. 

                                 NEIL
                        Shit, are you okay? 

           Her lip is bleeding as she swings there in the breeze. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Perfect.

           EXT. VALLEY - DAY

           Ernie is filming Hillary with the drone. He flies up to the 
           perch where the pole fell from. The broken tent sways in the 
           wind. Hanging by a thread. The drone moves closer to the 
           opening. Movement inside. 

           The drone gets closer. Someone moving in the sleeping bag.

           Ernie falls back. Looks with his own two eyes. He can’t see 
           anything. Looks back through monitor, spooked.

                                 JEN
                        What’s wrong?

                                 ERNIE
                        I saw... there’s someone... I...

           Jen peeks at the monitor. 
                                 ERNIE
                        In the tent. 

                                 JEN
                        I don’t see anything.

                                 ERNIE
                        There’s someone in there! Fuck. 

           A sharp gust of wind and suddenly the tent starts slapping 
           against the rock. 

                                 ERNIE
                        I don’t know... I thought...

           He ZOOMS IN a little more. And then A MASSIVE MONITOR LIZARD 
           POPS out of the tent! Ernie screams, and clutches his heart 
           as the lizard skittles up the wall like nothing, and 
           disappears into a large crack. Jen bursts into wild laughter. 

                                 ERNIE
                        Fuck! FUCK! IT’S NOT FUNNY!

           Jen laughs even harder. Ernie has tears in his eyes. 

                                 ERNIE
                        STOP LAUGHING AT ME!

           Jen stops laughing abruptly. 

           EXT. WALL - DAY

           As Hillary and Neil climb, the sun sinks behind soaring 
           mountains. Blood red hues explode across the world. Van Gogh 
           would be proud. Hillary doesn’t notice. She’s too busy 
           getting to the top. 

           She reaches a perch. Wedges a cam in a crack and tests the 
           hold. Perfect. She clips in. Last anchor of the day. 

           Neil ties his harness to the rope. Hillary belays from above. 
           He climbs. Hillary pulls him up, and hooks him in. 

                                 NEIL
                        Don’t forget to take a look around.

           And she does. Breathes it in. Loses herself in the glorious, 
           otherworldly sunset. Heaven on earth.

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s beautiful.

           She’s crying happy tears. Neil takes out his camera. Framing 
           her against the glory. A stunning image.

                                 NEIL
                        Good first day. How do you feel?
                                 HILLARY
                        Back.

                                 NEIL
                        You look “back.”

                                 HILLARY
                        Thanks. 

           She laughs. She can’t contain it. Her eyes are glittering. So 
           is her face from the smear of sticky granite. 

                                 NEIL
                        Hell of a whipper though.

                                 HILLARY
                        I needed to get it out of the way.

                                 NEIL
                        How’s the rock feel to you? 

                                 HILLARY
                        I can’t get a read on it. 

                                 NEIL
                        I know what you mean.

                                 HILLARY
                        One minute it’s choss, spitting me 
                        off, the next it’s pristine. It’s 
                        got a mind of its own.

                                 NEIL
                        Yeah, like it’s climbing us.

           She shoots him a look.

                                 NEIL
                        You found the great white wall.

                                 HILLARY
                        Nah, she’s just a crag. 

           They hear a low hum as hundreds of wingless silverfish scurry 
           out of a crack in the wall and crawl upwards, scaling the 
           rock with ease. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Show offs.

           Neil laughs. They sit on the perch. Legs dangle. The beauty 
           around them is overwhelming. Miniature old growth forest 
           below. A chorus of wind. 

                                 NEIL
                        You’re a long way from that fucking 
                        wheelchair anyway.
           She laughs. Neil stops smiling. The sweat has melted the make-
           up off on Hillary’s neck. And for the first time, Neil sees 
           her ROPE BURN. It clicks for him. She feels his stare. Moves 
           away to get to work. Neil’s heart breaks for her.

           EXT. BASECAMP - MAGIC HOUR

           Jen and Ernie are carrying their stuff to camp. 

                                 ERNIE
                        This place is all wrong. The 
                        energy. Bad fucking juju, it just 
                        feels so fucked. I feel it in the 
                        air. Like humidity. Everywhere. I’m 
                        telling you I got second thoughts. 

                                 JEN
                        Are you high, Ernie?

                                 ERNIE
                        Yes.

                                 JEN
                        I’m not having this conversation.

                                 ERNIE
                        I got such a headache, you it’s 
                        throbbing big time. I’m nauseous, 
                        I’m all screwed up.

                                 JEN
                        It’s altitude sickness. 

                                 ERNIE
                        I don’t know what I’m doing here. 
                        What am I doing here? Fuck, I want 
                        to bail...

                                 JEN
                        You can’t bail. We’re in China. 

                                 ERNIE
                        I know, but I can want to can’t I?!

           He’s overcome with emotion. Has to sit. 

                                 JEN
                        Look around. It doesn’t get any 
                        better than this. The band’s back 
                        together. And Hillary’s the best in 
                        the world. We’re here, we’re a part 
                        of this amazing project, we get to 
                        climb virgin crag, and you’re 
                        missing it. Just be here.
                                 ERNIE
                        I’ll kill that fucking Albert, too. 
                        With my hands. He works for 
                        Farmer’s Insurance, the fuck. What 
                        does she see in him? He’s not me. 
                        That’s what.

                                 JEN
                        You’re scaring me. Seriously.

                                 ERNIE
                        No, it’s all my fault. I was never 
                        there, I was always here or 
                        somewhere else.  

                                 JEN
                        This is the life we chose, it’s all 
                        or nothing. All the time.  

                                 ERNIE
                        Nothing. I choose nothing then. 
                        This is it for me. I’m done. I miss 
                        her so much I want to die.

                                 JEN
                        Please don’t say that.

                                 ERNIE
                             (sighs)
                        Two is one and one... is none.

           She sits next to him. A little too close.

                                 JEN
                        You love climbing. You need to find 
                        someone who lives in our world and 
                        understands the sacrifice...

           She smiles. Takes his hand.

                                 ERNIE
                        Yeah, cuz it worked out so great 
                        for Neil and Hill.

           Jen’s smile vanishes.

           EXT. WALL - SUNSET

           Hillary is wearing a jacket now, zipped up to her neck. She 
           and Neil anchor in. Hillary pulls off her gear, and gasps. 
           Massive slash marks on her haul bag. She frantically wades 
           through it. Pulls out her portaledge. Slashes through the 
           nylon, too. Worthless.

                                 HILLARY
                        Fuck!
                                 NEIL
                        What happened?

                                 HILLARY
                        Must have caught a razor flake.

           They stare each other down, nervously. Neil swallows. 

                                 NEIL
                        Well. Uh... I have plenty of room.

           Hillary shudders at the thought.

                                 NEIL
                        Head to toe. It’s either that or 
                        one of us is on the ledge.

           Neil goes back to erecting his tent. Hillary fingers the 
           slash marks. And then she chucks the worthless tent, and 
           watches it fall forever.  

           EXT. WALL - NIGHT

           The wall bathes in blue moonlight, casting a ghostly glow. 

           A hanging tent dangles off the rock -- twelve hundred feet up 
           now. The height of the Empire State Building. A red dot 
           against an ocean of granite. The wind picks up, shaking it. 
           It doesn’t look very secure. Fuck.

           INT. PORTALEDGE TENT - NIGHT

           It’s cold. The wind howls through the tent and plays the face 
           of the rock like a broken flute.

           They’re strapped in. Neil finishes eating. Hillary is nursing 
           the skin on her fingertips. Applying cream. 

                                 NEIL
                        I want to talk about the accident. 

           She looks over. Neil is aiming the camera at her. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Jesus, Neil. Give it a rest. 

                                 NEIL
                        Tell me what happened.

                                 HILLARY
                        Now that you have me captive.

                                 NEIL
                        Deal’s a deal.

           The wind shakes the tent. Hillary holds her breath as they 
           sway and rock, trying to steady herself. 
                                 HILLARY
                        I was trying to break the speed 
                        record, I broke everything but the 
                        speed record. I hit a branch on the 
                        way down, it saved my life.

                                 NEIL
                        Why do you climb?

                                 HILLARY
                        I like being high. It’s church. It 
                        feeds my soul.

                                 NEIL
                        Without ropes, I mean. 

                                 HILLARY
                        You know why. 

                                 NEIL
                        Tell me for the camera. 

                                 HILLARY
                             (rote)
                        I’m closest to nature. I’m one with 
                        it. The purest form of climbing. 
                        Complete surrender to what I love 
                        most. I can give it my whole self.
                        And I can do it on my own. I’m by 
                        myself. I don’t need anyone. 

                                 NEIL
                        Some people say it’s Russian 
                        Roulette... 

                                 HILLARY
                        Some people say global warming 
                        isn’t real. Some people say a lot 
                        of dumb shit.

                                 NEIL
                        Do you have a death wish?

                                 HILLARY
                        You don’t get it. It’s about 
                        living. It’s zen. I feel the most 
                        alive without ropes. Everything is 
                        perfect and always was, and there 
                        is no fear, and everything is 
                        heightened and there’s nothing but 
                        right now. This moment now. 

                                 NEIL
                        You’re not afraid of falling?

                                 HILLARY
                        I’m not afraid of anything.
                                 NEIL
                        There’s only one way that ends. All 
                        the great free soloists are dead. 
                        John, Eric. Mike. My friends... 

                                 HILLARY
                        I’m not gonna die. But if I do, 
                        I’ll die doing what I love.

                                 NEIL
                        What about the people you’ll leave 
                        behind? The people who love you? 

                                 HILLARY
                        They’ll get over it.

                                 NEIL
                        Tell me about the scar.

                                 HILLARY
                        What scar? I’m made of scars. 

           She feels the gaze of the lens. Violating. 

                                 NEIL
                        The one you’re trying to hide.

                                 HILLARY
                        Cut.

                                 NEIL
                        That’s my line.

           Suddenly, her guard drops a little. She gets quiet.

                                 NEIL
                        “If I don’t climb, I’ll die?” What 
                        kind of bullshit is that?

                                 HILLARY
                        Turn the fucking camera off.

                                 NEIL
                        You’ve been trying to do it for 
                        years up there without ropes. It’s 
                        the slowest suicide in history.

                                 HILLARY
                             (dark)
                        Wrong. Climbing is what stops me...

           A blast of wind rattles tent. The portaledge lifts, 
           undulating in the wind, like they’re on the high seas. They 
           hang on. The wind stops and the straps tighten. 
                                 NEIL
                        You never tell me what’s going on. 
                        I feel like I know nothing about 
                        you. Really. 

                                 HILLARY
                        We’re not talking about this. 
                        That’s not what this movie’s about!

                                 NEIL
                        What’s it about?

                                 HILLARY
                        Getting to the top!

                                 NEIL
                        What if we don’t get to the top? 
                        What is it then? A snuff film? 

           Hillary rips the camera out of Neil’s hand.

                                 NEIL
                        Hey!

           She opens the flap and chucks it out. The camera falls into 
           the abyss. 

           She just stares blankly at Neil. Wind blasts her hair. Crazy 
           dances in her eyes. He’s stunned.

                                 NEIL
                        Wow. I mean... it’s so fucking 
                        crazy, I’m not even angry...

                                 HILLARY
                        I’ll sleep on the ledge.

           She crawls out of the tent.

           EXT. WALL - NIGHT

           Hillary is crying on a narrow ledge under the portaledge. It 
           barely fits her. She’s so high up, and it’s even more vertigo-
           induing at night. She’s strapped into a harness, secured by 
           anchors. Still, the wind is whipping and it’s nerve wracking. 
           For us, not her.  

           She’s trying like hell to muffle her tears so Neil doesn’t 
           hear. Covering her face. Silent screaming sobs. Veins bulging 
           in her face, covered in snot. Burying her face in her 
           shoulder. She gasps for air. Tears stain the ledge.

           The night sky is brilliant above her. A blanket of shimmering 
           stars. Her beam of light illuminates BATS stalking bugs. They 
           dive bomb and screech. One of them perches above her as if 
           standing sentry. She shudders. 1,000 feet up on a ledge is 
           one thing, but bats...
           Down below, we see Ernie’s fire. A small orange twinkle, 
           1,200 feet below. 

           EXT. BASECAMP - NIGHT

           The fire smolders. Jen goes over their equipment, cross 
           checking everything on her list. 

           Ernie sits by the fire, smoking a weed vape. He’s lost in the 
           flames. He stares at his cell phone, swiping through photos 
           of him and MONICA. He enlarges her face with his fingers.

           He hears the mountain’s windsong behind him. He turns around, 
           and gazes up at the glittering monolith. Campfire playing on 
           his face like he’s in hell. A ground mist at the base makes 
           the rock look sinister.

           Granite starts to sparkle on Ernie’s forehead in harmony with 
           the rock itself. Bits of mica and feldspar. Connected 
           somehow. His eyes glaze. He stares up at the cave above. 

           Sees the black vulture perched at the mouth. He stands like a 
           sleepwalker. His mouth curls into a snarl. 

           His gaze shifts to Hillary’s headlamp. Just a yellow dot 
           above, but she’s there. His eyes narrow with hate. He 
           clenches his fits into a tight ball. Chewing on his lip. 

                                 ERNIE
                        I was always there for her. 

           There’s something sinister in Ernie’s kind eyes. 

                                 JEN
                        ERNIE!

           Jen comes barreling over and beats the fire off him with her 
           jacket. He’s standing too close, and his leaping flames are 
           traveling up his pants.

                                 JEN
                        Ernie! You were on fire!

                                 ERNIE
                        What?! I--

           He shoots nervous looks around the camp. He didn’t even 
           notice. He’s scared. Confused. He looks back to the wall. The 
           pull is strong. 

                                 ERNIE
                             (dark)
                        I feel like I’ve been here before.

                                 JEN
                        What?
                                 ERNIE
                        I’ve dreamed about this place. I 
                        feel like I know what’s coming.

                                 JEN
                        ERNIE!

           He snaps out of it. He’s Ernie again.

                                 ERNIE
                        Huh?

                                 JEN
                        What are you talking about?!

                                 ERNIE
                        Deja vu. You know? I don’t know.

                                 JEN
                        Enough with the weed. You need to 
                        start taking care of yourself.

           She grabs his vape and throws it in the fire. 

                                 JEN
                        And the other one.

           She puts out her hand. He reaches into his pack and hands her 
           the second weed vape. She chucks that in the fire, too. Two 
           is one and one is none.

                                 ERNIE
                        She might as well have died.

                                 JEN
                        Who?

                                 ERNIE
                        Hillary! I mean, she ghosted us, 
                        after everything we went through! 
                        She just disappeared! And I was 
                        just getting use to her being gone 
                        and poof, she’s back with a fucking 
                        epic. And now it’s all happening 
                        again. History repeats.

                                 JEN
                        Listen. This is good for you. Being 
                        here. It’s time you talked to her. 
                        About everything. You need closure, 
                        you both do...

                                 ERNIE
                        Closure. Yeah. Yeah...

           He looks at his sparkly hands. Balls them into sparkly fists.
           EXT. WALL - NIGHT

           Hillary is perched off the ledge, holding on to a rope. She 
           pulls down her pants and starts to pee. 

           The wind changes direction, and some of it splashes back on 
           her. She cringes. Stops. Waits for the wind to shift. It 
           does, and now she’s urinating down the wall. Staining it. 
           It’s awkward, but this is how it’s done. 

           Finished, she pulls up her pants. And then she hears the clap 
           of SHOES against granite. Moving up the wall. Something’s 
           climbing below her. 

           She bolts upright. She sees a something moving in the dark. 
           Shadows crawling up the wall. She shines her headlamp.

           Nothing but a vertical mile of rock and the floor below. Her 
           headlamp starts to flicker. Heavy breathing. Shoes scraping. 
           Closer. Her lamp dies. 

           PITCH BLACK. She gives it a hard swat. Hears someone close. 
           Getting closer. Slaps it harder. No light. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Hello?

           Nothing. A blast of wind almost knocks her off the ledge. 

           She unhooks, and climbs over to the portaledge. Sees 
           something moving out of the corner of her eye. She turns. 
           Right behind her --

           THE OUTLINE OF TWO CLIMBERS. Tied together. Questing up the 
           wall beside her. Backlit against the grapefruit moon. 

           They stop and look at her. Lost in shadow. Cold plumes of 
           breath are the only indication of a face. Hillary’s eyes bug 
           out of her head. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Ernie? Jen?

           She knocks the headlamp back on and there’s no one there. 
           Nothing but sheer granite. Her mind is playing tricks on her. 
           The light dies for good.

                                 HILLARY
                        Fuck.

           She pulls a lighter out of her pocket. Sparks it. Choking 
           flame. It’s sticking. She finally gets it to spark and -- 

           THERE’S A MAN’S FACE INCHES AWAY FROM HER!

           PAUL HERNANDEZ. Covered in blood. Dead eyes looking right 
           through her. A guttural croak escapes his lips.
           The second climber scurries up the stone like a spooked 
           reptile. It’s almost acrobatic, like some sick ballet. 

           Hillary screams and drops the lighter. It skips down stone.

           BLACK. Just her deep breaths. Somewhere, a bat CHIRPS.

           Suddenly, her head lamp TURNS BACK ON! Paul is gone. She’s 
           alone. She lights up the ledge. Nothing. 

           Terrified, she unzips the portaledge and pulls herself in.

           INT. PORTALEDGE TENT - NIGHT

           Neil is asleep and snoring. Hillary is trying not to wake him 
           up. She lies down. Head to toe. She touches the piton around 
           her neck, and counts to ten. Shadows play on the wall of the 
           tent. The wind is screaming outside. It’s bad music. 

                                 NEIL
                        You’re back.

                                 HILLARY
                        Yeah.

                                 NEIL
                        Are you okay?

                                 HILLARY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 NEIL
                        Me too.

           They don’t look at each other, just stare ahead. Hillary’s 
           eyes pulse with fear. 

           EXT. WATERFALL - NIGHT

           Ernie is perched by the stream behind the waterfall, washing 
           the sparkle off his hands. The ground mist simmers.  

           He’s scrubbing. Harder. It won’t come out. He’s muttering to 
           himself. Scrubbing harder. Harder. Scrubbing his skin raw. 

                                 ERNIE
                        C’mon. Fucker. Mother fucker. 
                        Mother fuck. Whore. Fuck.

           He stops scrubbing when he sees a reflection in the water.

           THE CHINESE CLIMBER standing on the rock wall. The man from 
           the stone forest. Even more lost now. He’s perpendicular. 
           Perverting the laws of nature. Gravity has no hold. 

           Ernie whips around. 
           There’s no one there. There’s no one anywhere. 

                                 ERNIE
                        Hello?

           He looks back to his arm. The sparkle is spreading. It burns. 
           Scrubbing too hard. Blood trickles down arms and drips into 
           the water. He scrubs and scrubs. The granite won’t come off.

                                 ERNIE
                        GET OFF ME, YOU FUCK!

           INT. HILLARY'S APARTMENT - DREAM

           Hillary sits at her kitchen table tying her climbing rope 
           into a noose with one hand. The other one is dead. Flopping.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Hillary limps into the kitchen with her cane. Climbs on to a 
           chair. Ties the rope to the ceiling fan. 

           Wraps it around her neck. Kicks off the chair. 

           Her eyes flutter. Rolls back in her head. Her feet kicking at 
           the air as she slips away.

           SNAP!! The force of her neck rips the fan out of the ceiling, 
           EXPOSING RED WIRES, and she crashes to the floor. It breaks, 
           but instead of hitting the floor... SHE FALLS THROUGH IT!

           FALLING DOWN THE BIG ROCK WALL FROM THE OPENING. Like the 
           statue of a climber, gripping the wind. The forest grows 
           below her feet. 

           The ceiling fan is falling with her.

           Neil is screaming. Veins bulging. Split flying. The free fall 
           reflected in the lens of HIS CAMERA. 

           Tourists turn away in horror. Mothers shielding the eyes of 
           screaming children. Live newscasts cutting to commercial.

           Gray rock blurs by. WHAMM!!! She catches an outcrop, 
           shattering both legs. Bounces off the wall. Falling still. 

           The ceiling fan catches on a ledge. Wedges between the rocks 
           and -- THWACK!!!! THE ROPE GOES TAUGHT AND SNAPS HER NECK! 

           She slams into the wall and swings like a 1000-foot gallows.

           INT. NEIL AND HILLARY'S PORTALEDGE - DAY

           Hillary snaps awake, screaming. Stuck between memory and 
           dream. She has no idea where she is. It’s morning in the 
           portaledge. Reality slowly dawns on her. 
           Neil stirs. The dream residue still clouding Hillary’s eyes.

                                 NEIL
                        You okay?

                                 HILLARY
                        Yeah.

                                 NEIL
                        Falling dream?

                                 HILLARY
                        Um... yeah. The worst.

                                 NEIL
                        I’ll make you some coffee.

           She kisses her piton necklace. Opens the flap and sees the 
           mountain -- DÌYÙ SHAN. A mile away somehow. 

                                 HILLARY
                        What the fuck?

           They are suspended in mid-air. Twisting. The world turning 
           around them in 360 degrees. Whatever is holding them lets go.

           And they fall. WOOOOSHHH!!!! Plunging into the abyss. Like a 
           meteor to earth. They tangle in the tent, crashing into each 
           other. An endless free fall! 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Hillary wakes up for real. Screaming! Neil goes to her. 

                                 NEIL
                        Hey, hey, it’s okay. 

           She catches her breath. Looks around. Giggles. Guffaws.

                                 NEIL
                        Falling dream?

                                 HILLARY
                        The worst.

                                 NEIL
                        I’ll make you some coffee.

           She shudders at these words. Deja Vu.

           EXT. PORTALEDGE - DAWN

           Hillary emerges from the tent with her coffee. Traverses on 
           to the ledge. She’s alone. She takes out her compact and 
           starts covering her rope burn. Her eyes widen when she sees -- 
           HER LIGHTER perched on a rock. As if back from the dead. 
           Spooked, she winds up and hurls it back into the void.

           EXT. BASECAMP - DAY

           Jen emerges from her tent. She finds Ernie perched on the 
           rock. Staring at the wall. Watching Hillary begin her climb. 
           She looks like a speck from down here.

                                 JEN
                        Hey. Did you sleep out here? I was 
                        looking for you.

           Ernie looks at Jen. Exhausted. His skin is raw.

                                 JEN
                        Where were you?

                                 ERNIE
                        Here. 

                                 JEN
                        Are you okay? 

                                 ERNIE
                        I was just trying to remember this 
                        dream I had. It was right there and 
                        now it’s gone. I hate that...

                                 JEN
                        We should get going. 

           But Ernie is just staring at the wall. Angry.

                                 JEN
                        What are you looking at?

                                 ERNIE
                        Hillary.

           A mosquito bites him. He SLAPS his neck hard. 

                                 ERNIE
                        Jen?

                                 JEN
                        Yeah?

                                 ERNIE
                        Am I okay?

                                 JEN
                        Ernie.
                                 ERNIE
                        I mean, I’m fine. I just mean... do 
                        you get the feeling like we’re not 
                        supposed to be here? Like something 
                        doesn’t want us here?

                                 JEN
                        No. I don’t.

                                 ERNIE
                        ...Me either.

           Ernie starts chewing on his nails, confused. The sleeves of 
           his long shirt are stained with blood. He looks back at 
           Hillary.

           EXT. WALL - DAY

           Hillary and Neil climb. She has steel fingers now. Getting 
           into a flow. Confidence returning. They have a shorthand and 
           make a great team. 

           Hillary is in the lead now. She stuffs her hand in a crack, 
           feels something weird inside. Wet and callous. 

                                 HILLARY
                        There’s something in here.

                                 NEIL
                        Shhh. Do you hear that?

           A shrill SHRIEK. And then -- WOOOOSHHH!!! A COLONY OF 
           SCREAMING BATS EXPLODE OUT OF THE CRACK! They crash into 
           Hillary’s chest, hundreds of them, and they keep coming like 
           the rock is vomiting them out. 

           Hillary cries out as they tangle in her hair, screeching, 
           scraping her scalp. A horrible geyser of leathery wings 
           slapping against her face like they hate her guts.

           The force of impact sends her falling, but the rope catches 
           her, and she swings in the air, watching the last straggler 
           flutter out of the crack. 

           Hillary catches her breath. Neil climbs over to her. Sees 
           that she’s bleeding, and scratched. Tries to help her, but 
           she pulls away. They look up, spooked. Watching the bats 
           circling the above the rock.

                                 HILLARY
                        I fucking hate bats.

                                 NEIL
                        Looks like it’s mutual. I want 
                        Ernie and Jen up here before we go 
                        any further, I’m really fucking 
                        pissed I didn’t get that on film.
           She shoots him a look.

                                 NEIL
                        You owe me a camera by the way.

           EXT. WALL - LATER

           Ernie and Jen join them on the mountain, jugging up. Jen on 
           camera, Ernie on drone. It’s easy for them. They’re using 
           ASCENDERS not ropes, scaling the rock in half the time.

           They get into position. Jen hangs from an anchor at the end 
           of each pitch. Her rope allows her to track directly behind 
           Hillary and Neil as they climb. They are masters of rigging. 

           Ernie readies his drone. Watching his shadow out of the 
           corner of his eye. Hillary shakes her head, and climbs.

                                 NEIL (WALKIE)
                        Stay at 50 mill... We’ll shoot a 
                        couple verticals... Save the 
                        horizontals.

                                 JEN (WALKIE)
                        God wasn’t messing around when he 
                        made this place, every shot’s the 
                        money shot.

           They’re always hovering. Dangling with cameras. Their ropes 
           are clipped and coiled so they won’t fall into the frame.

                                                                CUT TO:

           They are filming Hillary move up the rock. Jamming her 
           fingers. Widening into fists. This perfect crack is like a 
           ladder to heaven. 

           We BOOM above her to see inch-tall trees sway two thousand 
           feet below. More than the length of five football fields. 
           Hillary’s reaching for her chalk bag. Chalks up. When she 
           turns back --

           The crack she’s been following is gone. In its place, a blank 
           swath, devoid of weakness and slick as porcelain. As if the 
           mountain has somehow altered itself.

                                 HILLARY
                        What the fuck...

           She messes up her face. Searching for the crack. Whipping 
           around, dizzy. 

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s gone. It’s a runout! I thought 
                        it went another hundred feet. 
                                 NEIL
                        You must have got turned around!

           She’s searching for it. Wiping the sweat. Woozy. 

                                 HILLARY
                             (to herself)
                        I could have sworn it...
                             (to Neil)
                        Alright, I’m looking for a new 
                        sequence!

           She traces her dusty fingers along the blank face. Hunting 
           for holds. Feeling for secrets. Perched on one toe. Just 
           friction. There must be something. Anything.

                                 NEIL
                        You got it?!

           She’s hugging the corner. Hand is slipping. Her knee quivers 
           against the rock. The sun comes out from behind a cloud, 
           revealing the shadow of a micro-hold above her. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Gotcha.

           She reaches. Further. Praying to the stone gods. But gravity 
           has other plans. She slips, and takes a whipper, plummeting, 
           stomach in her throat, swinging in the wind like a 
           hypnotist’s watch.

                                 HILLARY
                        FUCK!

                                 NEIL
                        It’s alright. 

           She kicks off in frustration. She tries again. Fumbles. 
           Recovers. Shoes dance up granite. Again, she falls. Sailing 
           over the world. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Damnit! 

                                 NEIL
                        We got all the time in the world!
                             (to Jen)
                        You getting this?

           Jen nods from behind her lens. 

           Ernie lowers the drone controller. Staring at his shadow on 
           the wall. Something’s off. 

           His shadow is slightly out of synch with his movements. 
                                 HILLARY
                        What’s wrong?

           He looks at Hillary. Suddenly -- HER SHADOW FALLS OFF THE 
           WALL WITHOUT HER! Ernie gasps. Watches her shadow fall down 
           the rock.

                                 HILLARY
                        Ernie?

                                 ERNIE
                        Nothing.

                                 HILLARY
                        Are you fucking high right now?

                                 ERNIE
                        No. Of course not, no. Sorry.

                                 HILLARY
                        Focus.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Hillary falls again. Jen kicks off the wall, using her rope 
           as a dolly track for better shots. Ernie is manning the 
           drone. Keeping his distance. Zzzzzzzzz. Hillary tries a 
           different approach. Calculating. Visualizing.  

           She falls. Tries again. Putting the puzzle together. Drenched 
           in sweat. Broken. She sees the cameras trained on her and 
           shudders.

                                 HILLARY
                        This rock is slicker than snot on a 
                        frog.

                                 NEIL
                        You’ll get there.

                                 HILLARY
                        Please... don’t film this.

                                 NEIL
                        This is the good shit. 

                                 HILLARY
                        You’re distracting me. 

                                 NEIL
                        Ignore us. We’re flies on the wall. 
                        You’ll get it next time.

                                                                CUT TO:

           It’s late afternoon now and Hillary’s been at it for hours. 
           Neil is holding the rope. Tired. Trying to stay focused.
           Jen changes her lens. She looks at Ernie across the way. 
           Narrows her brow. He’s scraping his fingers against the 
           stone. The glitter caked into his fingernails. He rubs his 
           face against it. It feels cool against his skin. 

           Jen looks worried, goes back to her lens. Ernie hears the 
           rhythmic humming. Turns to the rock. The brilliant granite 
           sparkle. Like a million shimmering stars. 

           A darkness falls over him. It’s taking hold. His gaping mouth 
           curls into a teeth-gnashing snarl. His kind eyes turn bitter. 
           He glares at Hillary. Hate pulsing. The sparkle spreads down 
           his arms, to his hands. His hands hold the drone controller. 
           Zzzzzzzzzz... 

           Hillary falls again. She’s airborne and -- 

           WHAM! Slams into the wall. She screams in frustration. It 
           echoes throughout the canyon. 

           Hillary’s shaking. The skin on her fingertips peeled and 
           bleeding from the razor stone. Sweat and blood and chalk.

           ZZZZZZZZ!!! SUDDENLY, THE DRONE POPS OUT OF NOWHERE, too 
           close. Scaring the shit out of her and us. She screams as it 
           CRASHES INTO HER AND REELS BACK FOR MORE!

           In a blind rage, she winds up and -- WHAPPP!!! Punches the 
           drone as hard as she can. She nearly loses her balance. The 
           drone sways drunkenly, and squeals away like a spooked 
           animal. ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzz -- crashes into the wall.  

                                 JEN
                        ERNIE!

           Ernie snaps out of his murderous trance. Blinks a billion 
           times. Gasps in horror.

                                 ERNIE
                        Oh fuck. I’m so sorry. I lost 
                        control of it! I--

           He watches the drone plummet to ground, bouncing the rock as 
           it goes. He looks down at the console, horrified.

                                 HILLARY
                        You’re fucking me up, Ernie! You’re 
                        not paying attention! Get your head 
                        out of your ass!

                                 ERNIE
                        No, it-- I don’t know what 
                        happened. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean 
                        it... I just got... I don’t know... 
                                 HILLARY
                        You’re moping around thinking about 
                        Monica! Get out of your head, man! 
                        You’re a liability!

                                 ERNIE
                        I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. 

           Hillary’s hand is sore. Bleeding. Spent. She hangs there, 
           creaking in the wind. A dead weight. Broken.

                                 NEIL
                        Why don’t we call it for the day, 
                        get a fresh start to--

                                 HILLARY
                        I’m climbing.

           Ernie is so confused.

                                 JEN
                        Ernie, what the fuck was that?

                                 ERNIE
                        I’m such a fucking idiot.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Hillary falls even earlier this time. It’s bad. 

                                 HILLARY
                        FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCKING PATHETIC!

           She kicks off the rock like a petulant child. It’s making Jen 
           and Ernie uncomfortable. Neil sighs.

                                 HILLARY
                        Piece of shit... you fuck...
                             (to Jen)
                        Don’t you film this! You’re right 
                        there for all the bullshit and 
                        everything I do great you fucking 
                        miss! Fuck!

           Jen and Neil exchange a look. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Hillary’s clinging to the wall. Breathing heavy. Eyes 
           fluttering. Sweat pouring down her brow.

           She closes her eyes. Swinging. The breeze feels good on her 
           face. Takes a deep breath. Squeezes out a pesky tear that 
           gets lost in a sea of sweat. 
           Creeeeeeeeeakkk... Something twisting above. A tiny avalanche 
           of pebbles bouncing off her head. A fly buzzes around. She 
           wrinkles her nose. The stink.

           Creeeeeeeakkkk... Her eyes snap open. She looks up and sees --

           A vision of HERSELF, LONG DEAD. Ten feet up. Swinging in the 
           wind. Her climbing rope tied around her neck like a noose, 
           dangling from the wedged ceiling fan. She’s stiff. Grayish 
           blue. Tongue jutting and swollen. Fear frozen in her popped 
           out eyes. She’s been here for weeks. Flies feasting on her 
           rot. Wind banging her against the rock. 

                                 NEIL
                        Hill? Are you--

           --Suddenly, Hillary lets out a bird scattering scream of 
           rage. An exorcism of anger. Wafting over China. She screams 
           the vision away. Nothing there.

           She starts to laugh at the rock like an sheer arch nemesis.

                                 NEIL
                        Alright. We’re calling it. 

                                 HILLARY
                        FUCK THAT!! WHERE’S THE DRILL?! I’M 
                        BOLTING THIS FUCKER! 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Hillary rips her bulky power drill out of its case like a 
           gunslinger on a quick draw. She lets it rip -- 

           REEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!! It echoes throughout the valley.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The wind picks up as Hillary starts drilling. Dust flies. A 
           creaking sound undulates up the rock, as if it’s settling.

           Ernie takes his video camera out of his bag. Fires it up. 
           Starts filming. 

           CAMERA POV: He zooms on Hillary as she sticks a tube in the 
           hole and blows out dust. She starts hammering in the bolt, 
           taking her anger out on it. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! 

           A rain of pebbles from above. Ernie pans up the rock, 
           following the pebbles. Up. Up. Too fast. Whips past two 
           climbers. Stops. Pans back down to reveal -- 

           MARK AND PAUL QUESTING UP. Tied together. Forever climbing to 
           the top, and never reaching it. 
           Mark turns and stares into the lens. Jawless. Rotten. Sadness 
           in his sunken eyes.  

                                                               BACK TO:

           Ernie almost drops the camera. Looks with his own eyes. 
           There’s no one up there. He looks back through the lens. No 
           climbers. He rewinds the footage. Nothing but smooth rock. He 
           looks around, so confused. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Hillary hammers the bolts flush. As she grabs her socket 
           wrench, the wall cracks, and SPITS the bolt back out. It 
           bounces off her chest and falls. 

           A small trickle of GRAY WATER fall out of the hole she just 
           drilled, like the rock is alive and crying. It’s unsettling.

                                 HILLARY
                        Shit.

                                 NEIL
                        What’s wrong?

                                 HILLARY
                        I don’t know. It won’t take.

           She picks up a chunk of granite. The sparkling stone turns to 
           black dust in her hand and flies away in the wind. She 
           inhales some, and sneezes. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Mother fucker.

           She drills a bigger hole, but the drill gets stuck. GZZZZZT! 
           She tries to rip it out. It won’t budge. 

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s shit rock. It’s rotten. 

           With a grunt, she pulls the drill as hard as she can, and as 
           if the rock just lets go, the drill flies out of her hands.

                                 JEN
                        Air mail!

                                 NEIL
                        What happened?

                                 HILLARY
                        I don’t know, I--

           --Hillary finally notices her blood soaked hands. Too much.

                                 HILLARY
                        What the fuck--
           She looks back at the rock and BLOOD! Gushing out of the hole 
           where the gray water was. Like a severed artery. 

           She cries out. Loses her grip. The rock spits her off and she 
           plummets. Neil braces on belay. The rope goes taut. Hillary 
           SLAMS into the wall -- WHUMP!! Bounces off. 

                                 NEIL
                        Hill?!

           She sways back and forth, moaning in pain.

                                 NEIL
                        You’re bleeding!

           Dizzy, she looks back at the blood on her hands. But it’s not 
           quite as red as she thought. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Relax, it’s not blood! 

           She looks up at the red liquid oozing out of the hole above. 
           Staining the wall. It slows to a trickle, and stops.

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s just iron oxide! I hit a 
                        deposit with the drill! 

           But she’s not so sure. She wipes it off on her pants. 

                                 NEIL
                        You’re pushing too hard, you always 
                        push it too hard... 

                                 JEN (WALKIE)
                        Should we should call it? 

                                 NEIL
                             (into walkie)
                        We have to have a safety meeting. 
                        Pitch Twenty’s coming up.
                             (yelling up)
                        Hill, why are you bolting?! There’s 
                        a crack right there!

           Hillary looks up. The crack system has miraculously returned! 

                                 HILLARY
                        What the fuck?

           Confused, she looks around, trying to orient herself. 

                                 NEIL
                        What’s wrong?
                                 HILLARY
                        Nothing, I just... I thought... I 
                        must have been turned around. 

           She takes off, climbing up the crack with ease.  

                                 NEIL
                        There you go! You got it!

           She can’t be stopped. 

           Dìyù Shan has met her match. THE BLACK VULTURE is circling 
           above. The sun sneaks behind a cloud creating a play of eerie 
           shadows that stalk down the wall, predator-like.

           EXT. BELAY STATION - DAY

           They’re gathered for the safety meeting. Jen is filming. 
           Hillary is taping up, pretending everything is cool. 

           Ernie is quiet, holding his head. Deep in thought.

                                 NEIL
                        Hill. Listen. We’re worried here. 
                        We got pitch twenty next.

                                 HILLARY
                        So?

                                 NEIL
                        So? It’s the point of no return. 
                        It’s forty repels down, and we’re 
                        short on gear as it is and-- 

                                 HILLARY
                        --I’m not turning back.

                                 JEN
                        But, are you sure you’re up to it? 
                        There’s no shame in turning around.

                                 HILLARY
                        I’m climbing, Jen. Up.

                                 NEIL
                        If we go any further we won’t have 
                        enough gear to downclimb. The only 
                        way out is up.

                                 HILLARY
                        It was always only up for me.

                                 NEIL
                        I’m gonna be honest. I’m not sure 
                        you’re ready. You’re not at your 
                        max. You gotta be at your max to 
                        pull this of.
                                 HILLARY
                        Look, here’s the deal. I’m not 
                        turning back. If you want to leave, 
                        leave. All of you, I don’t need 
                        you. I’ll solo the rest of the way 
                        if I have to. If it takes a month, 
                        I don’t give a fuck. I’m getting to 
                        the top with or without you. I’m 
                        climbing pitch twenty. That’s it.  

           She pulls out a cam. Sticks in a crack. Starts up without 
           him. They watch her go.

                                 JEN
                        Wait. Are you sure?

                                 HILLARY
                        I’m sure.

                                 JEN
                        Ernie?

                                 ERNIE
                             (snapping out of it)
                        Huh?

                                 JEN
                        Are you okay to keep going?

                                 ERNIE
                        Uh... Yeah, I’m cool. 

                                 JEN
                        What’s wrong with you?

                                 ERNIE
                        Nothing. I remember my dream now. I 
                        remember. It was born of fire!

                                 HILLARY
                        What?

                                 ERNIE
                             (distant)
                        I dreamed it was being born. This 
                        mountain. Two hundred million years 
                        ago the continent collided with a 
                        tectonic plate... and woke up the 
                        magma down below... Rivers of it. 
                        Bursting through the crust... 
                        Crystallizing into a perfect 
                        granite slab. Four thousand feet 
                        up. And then us! So insignificant. 
                        Isn’t that wild to think about? How 
                        it makes you feel small? Like none 
                        of this matters, not even Monica? 
                        Not even death?
           They all look at him. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Ernie? What the fuck are you 
                        talking about? 

                                 ERNIE
                        No, I’m just saying--

                                 JEN
                        --Can you climb or not?

                                 ERNIE
                        Of course I can climb! I’m just 
                        saying... isn’t that neat? To think 
                        about? I just thought that was a 
                        cool, uh, dream I had... I’m fine.

                                 HILLARY
                        Climb on.

           Hillary starts climbing. They look at Ernie.

                                 ERNIE
                        What?! 

           Neil eats a fistful of Tums.

                                 JEN
                        You need to talk to her. 

                                 ERNIE
                        I will.

           EXT. PITCH TWENTY - DAY

           A horizontal traverse. The rock is like glass. No features. 
           No weaknesses. Nowhere to put her hands. It’s all about 
           friction. Balance. Trusting her feet. 

           She wipes the sweat off her face, smearing blood and chalk 
           across it. She looks insane, and it’s great. 

           Hillary smears her feet on a flared corner. Impossible 
           positions. Huge exertion. 

           We’re twenty six hundred feet up now. Nearly the height of 
           the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. And only 
           two thirds of the way.

           Hillary is unstoppable. She sets her feet, changes her hands 
           and cranes her head, scouring for a hold. 

           The vulture’s shadow flies up the stone. As it moves towards 
           the sun, its SHADOW GROWS LARGER. Menacing. Too big.

           As Hillary leans back WE PAN DOWN to her harness.
           HER KNOT IS SLOWLY... COMING... UNTIED... 

           As if invisible fingers are prying it loose. 

           It’s only held in place by a pinch of friction now. She fails 
           to notice as she starts her ascent. 

           Ernie, Jen and Neil are oblivious, too. 

           Up she goes. Unprotected. A ticking time bomb. She’s free 
           soloing and doesn’t know it. 

           The rope slipping. She jams her fingers hard in a seam.

           Ernie and Jen are filming from parallel ropes.

           The sun returns from its hiding place, illuminating the rock. 
           It sparkles wildly. We can hear the hum. 

           Hillary jams her hands into the crack and squeezes her fist 
           into a ball to make it fit. She shimmies up, feet moving up 
           the crack in lockstep. The crack gets wider and she has to 
           contort, using her shoulder and elbow, shoving them in.

           She comes to the end of the crack system. Feels for pockmarks 
           like she’s reading a Braille thriller. Palming off rough 
           rock, and smearing her toes. 

           This is the hardest pitch so far, and every time she shifts 
           her weight, the rope is closer to falling.  

           Now she’s splayed across the wall. Full extension. Face 
           smudged flat. Amazing, gymnastic climbing. Unprotected. She’s 
           so high up. The rope barely hanging on. Hillary is placing 
           protection, not realizing it’s worthless. 

           She grabs the flake, but it BREAKS, and her legs swing out. 
           Hanging on tight. She maintains her foothold and regains her 
           balance with her right hand, gripping a small hold. 

           The broken flake is still falling. Vertigo inducing. We see 
           her rope slowly slipping out of her harness. 

           Hillary’s life is quite literally in her hands, crimped on a 
           chip of rock the width of a matchbook.

           And her hand is slipping. She reaches for a little shelf. 
           Loses her footing, and almost falls. No big deal. She thinks 
           the rope will catch her if she does.

                                 HILLARY
                        Whoops.

           Jen is capturing great action shots. She ZOOMS IN. Sees 
           something strange. Hillary is about to do the six foot double 
           dyno jump. Jen ZOOMS IN on her harness. Gasps. 
                                 JEN
                        HILLARY!!!!

           She jumps and lands it, barely. Rocks rain. It’s spectacular. 
           She looks at Jen, pumps her fist, victorious.

                                 JEN
                        YOU’RE NOT--

           Neil pulls the rope to pick up slack and the rope FLIES OUT 
           OF HER HARNESS. Whips down past Neil, through the carabiners, 
           flying down like a spooked snake. 

                                 JEN
                        --TIED IN!!!

           It lands a thousand feet out of sight. Neil’s eyes explode.

           It finally dawns on Hillary. She’s untethered. Her mouth 
           falls open. She’s hugging the wall. Frozen on the tiniest 
           perch. She can see it cracking. Spiderwebbing. 

           It’s going to break. She sees the crack to her right. 

           And just as she lunges for it -- THE PERCH BREAKS! And she 
           jams her fingers into the crack. And now she’s clinging to 
           the wall. Horrified. Gripped. Trembling. 

           She looks down. Nearly faints. In the clutches of vertigo.

           Ernie’s breath is ripped away. He’s only ten feet away. He 
           could reach her. But he’s glued to the rock. 

                                 NEIL
                        Ernie--

           He freezes, wide-eyed. Breathing heavy.  

                                 ERNIE
                        I... I...

           Jen unclips her rope and lets it fall. She’s jugging down 
           from above. Neil is coming up from below. It’s a race. 
           They’re far off.

                                 HILLARY
                             (gritted teeth)
                        Ernie.

                                 NEIL
                        Ernie! Do something!

           But Ernie is stuck there. Paralyzed with fear.

                                 HILLARY
                        Ernie, get the fuck over here!
           He’s whimpering. Horrible memories flooding back. Frozen.

           MEMORY FLASH: Hillary breaks Ernie’s arm with her body, and 
           falls through his clutches to certain death.

           Ernie cries out.

                                 JEN
                        Don’t move, Hill, we’re coming!

           Hillary hears HISSING above. Wide eyed, she cranes to see --

           THE MONITOR LIZARD peeks out of the crack above her. Large 
           and ancient. Beady yellow eyes blinking sideways. Long forked 
           tongue flicking. 

           Hillary screams as the lizard comes out of its hell hole. 
           Skitters down the wall towards her. Claws scrape stone.

                                 HILLARY
                        ERNIE!!!

           Suddenly, Ernie just snaps, smashing his head against the 
           rock, like he’s trying to free himself from the throes of 
           insanity. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! He knocks himself out. WOOOSH! 
           Plummets. The rope catches him. Swinging unconscious like a 
           hypnotist’s watch.

           The lizard is crawling above her head now. So close. She 
           flinches. Holds her breath. Floating above the world with a 
           living dinosaur.

           Hillary’s slipping. Her fingers whitening. Giving out. 
           There’s a perch to the right.

           The lizard’s tongue flicks her face. She screams. Reaches for 
           the hold. It’s just beyond her grasp. Sweaty tears sting her 
           eyes. Arms flushed with lactic acid, pumped and trembling. 
           Her fingers are bleeding from the razor edges.

           Neil is jugging closer. The CLICK of the hardware. Shoes 
           against rock. Click. Click. But not close enough. 

           The lizard crawls away, leaving her be. But that’s the least 
           of her worries. She’s pumping out. She looks down. Down has 
           never been so far. 

           Neil is so close, giving it all he’s got. Her grip is 
           slipping. Her fingers are black and blue and red. 

           Finally Neil arrives. Dangling parallel on a rope, even with 
           Hillary. He kicks off the wall, and swings in.

                                 NEIL
                        JUMP!
           They lock eyes. She trusts him. Just as her fingers give out, 
           she leaps off the wall. Momentarily airborne. He opens his 
           arms for her and WHUMP! They crash into each other. The force 
           sends them flying backwards, knocking hard into the wall. 

           Neil wraps her up, and she slides down his body, planting her 
           face in his navel, holding on for dear life. 

           She kicks off the wall and climbs up his body like a tree 
           trunk. He’s hugging her. Face to face. Total shock. 

           Neil quickly grabs an ascender from his belt and clips it to 
           her harness, and fastens her to his rope. 

           Swinging there as one, safe. Hugging in the breeze. So far 
           up. The basecamp below is just specks and dots. She’s 
           staining his shirt with her tears. Still in shock.

                                 NEIL
                        Shhh. It’s okay. I got you, Hill. 

           She calms. Breathes. Looks at him. His eyes sparkle. Swinging 
           in each other’s clutches.

           They’re about to kiss. HISSSSSSSSSSS!!! It’s the giant lizard 
           -- planted on the wall above them. 

           Hillary screams. The lizard bares it’s razor fangs and --
           WHACK!! It starts whipping them violently with its tail. 

           WHACK! WHACK!! HISSSSSSS!! Neil gets a tail in the face, 
           drawing blood. Hillary screams in anger. She pushes off and --

           WHAPP!! Kicks the lizard off the wall. It plummets a thousand 
           feet to its death. 

           Hillary and Neil watch it VANISH INTO THE VOID. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           LATER. It’s grim. Hillary and Neil are perched on the belay 
           ledge. Ernie and Jen are on the second ledge. Ernie is 
           bleeding. Jen is nursing him back to health.

                                 HILLARY
                        I don’t know what happened. 

                                 NEIL
                        You didn’t check the knot.

                                 HILLARY
                        I swear I did, I thought I-- 
                                 NEIL
                        This is amateur hour, Hill. I 
                        fucking told you, we shouldn’t be 
                        here, you’re not ready, and now 
                        we’re stuck here, and--

                                 HILLARY
                        --I CHECKED THE FUCKING KNOT! 

                                 NEIL
                        If anything happens to you, I’ll 
                        never forgive myself!

                                 HILLARY
                        I FUCKING CHECKED IT! I CHECKED IT!

                                 JEN
                        Can we please... just calm down and 
                        try and keep it together. We’re 
                        here. Now let’s try and make the 
                        best of it and stay safe. Please.

                                 ERNIE
                        It was the mountain.

           They all look at him. He’s trembling. Forever changed.

                                 ERNIE
                        It’s alive. It has a spirit. The 
                        mountain untied her rope. I know it 
                        did... I know it...

                                 NEIL
                        You’re still in shock, Ernie. 

                                 ERNIE
                        No! It doesn’t want us here! It 
                        doesn’t want us to get to the top! 
                        IT WAS THE ROCK, I KNOW THAT NOW!

           Hillary shudders. Because she knows it’s probably true.

                                 ERNIE
                             (breathless)
                        This mountain... is haunted...

                                 HILLARY
                        Every mountain is haunted. And 
                        every climber, too. 

                                 ERNIE
                        You’ve seen them. Haven’t you? Mark 
                        and Paul. They’re still climbing...

                                 NEIL
                        What are you talking about?
           She looks away.

                                 ERNIE
                        I know you saw them. And you don’t 
                        even care. You don’t even care...

                                 HILLARY
                        I forgot to tie my rope, Ernie! I 
                        fucked up, okay?! I was embarrassed! 
                        It was a noob thing to do, but I did 
                        it, and that’s it. Now let’s move the 
                        fuck on, and set up camp before we 
                        fuck anything else up!

           She climbs away.

                                 JEN
                        What do you mean? Mark and Paul... 

                                 ERNIE
                        We’re all gonna die and she doesn’t 
                        care! 

                                 JEN
                        Ernie stop! Stop!

                                 ERNIE
                        We’re never leaving!

           He bursts into tears, and hugs her. She loves it. Neil 
           watches Hillary climb, worried.

                                 ERNIE
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

                                                                CUT TO:

           They climb to the end of pitch twenty. Twenty-seven hundred 
           feet. More than half a mile up the mountain.

           Hillary pulls herself up on to the ledge. But then she feels 
           something. A pebble maybe. Looks at her hand. A HUMAN TOOTH 
           stuck to her palm. She gasps, slaps it away. Climbs to her 
           feet. Gasps. A DECAYED HUMAN JAW rests on the ledge. 

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        He must have landed a whipper 
                        wrong...

                                 HILLARY
                        Real wrong.

           Hillary kicks the jaw off the ledge. She looks up. Just above 
           is Mark and Paul’s ghostly portaledge.
           EXT. MARK AND PAUL’S PORTALEDGE - DAY

           They climb up. The remains of the tent look sinister up 
           close. Windswept and sunburnt. Shredded by time. Their old 
           tent flapping in the wind like a white flag of surrender. 

           Ernie jugs up. Stares at the tent. Terrified.

                                 ERNIE
                        Something horrible happened in there.

           They look at him.

           INT. MARK AND PAUL’S PORTALEDGE - DAY

           Hillary and Neil peek inside the abandoned tent. It’s musty 
           and dusty. Like a monument erected to a tragedy. Sleeping 
           bags. Food wrappers. A Nokia cell phone. 

                                 NEIL
                        Imagine being stuck in here for 
                        five days. Can’t go up or down.

           He shakes his head, and leaves. Flies buzz around. Hillary 
           sees the dried blood splatter above the flap. The gore caked 
           rope tooth knife. 

           And then she sees Mark’s old CLIMBING JOURNAL. She grabs it.

                                 JEN (O.S)
                        Hill?

                                 HILLARY
                             (jumps)
                        Jesus fuck. You scared me. 

                                 JEN
                        Sorry. Listen. Would you do me a 
                        favor and talk to Ernie?

                                 HILLARY
                        About what?

                                 JEN
                        Everything that happened.

                                 HILLARY
                        Everything what?

                                 JEN
                        I mean, the accident. His arm. The 
                        trauma. It really messed him up.

                                 HILLARY
                        It did? 
                                 JEN
                             (surprised)
                        Well... yeah. Clearly...

                                 HILLARY
                        Why? I’m the one who fell.

                                 JEN
                        Just. Please. You know, he just 
                        admires you so, so much. He looks 
                        up to you, really, and... It would 
                        mean a lot...

                                 HILLARY
                        Yeah.

           EXT. THE ROCK CEILING - MAGIC HOUR

           The sun sets. An explosion of color. Hillary powers up the 
           crack toward the overhanging rock ceiling. It’s a flat, 
           horizontal ledge that juts off the rock enough for them to 
           walk on it. A beautiful feature. 

           She surges over the 90 degree lip of the roof, and latches on 
           to the edge. Dangles for a beat on one arm. 

           Starts to pull herself up. Stops when she hears Ernie 
           muttering. She peaks over the edge she sees --

           Ernie standing on the ceiling before the rock. Resting his 
           head against it. His finger tracing the cracks, lovingly. He 
           leans in slowly, and smells the stone. Breathing in a long, 
           dusty whiff. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Ernie?

           He reels back like he’s been caught. He’s slowly coming back 
           to reality. A tear falls down his face. She pulls herself up 
           and now they’re on the ledge, face to face.

                                 HILLARY
                        Are you okay?

                                 ERNIE
                        I did the best I could. I tried so 
                        hard to get there. I really did. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Look. I wanted to tell you. You 
                        know, it wasn’t your fault. I mean, 
                        if you think it was, stop.

                                 ERNIE
                        I dream about you, Hill. I dream I 
                        caught you and everything is 
                        perfect and I’m a hero. 
           SLOW MOTION FLASHES OF ERNIE’S DREAM: Hillary falling from 
           the ledge. Ernie getting there just in time. Catching her in 
           his burly arms. Crowds cheering him down below. Neil and Jen 
           jumping for joy. Ernie smiling so big. Hillary gives him a 
           kiss on the cheek for saving her life. He smiles bigger. 

                                 ERNIE
                        I like those dreams best. But 
                        mostly it’s just falling dreams and 
                        I wake up screaming. No wonder 
                        Monica peaced.

                                 HILLARY
                        You did nothing wrong. It was my 
                        fault. I was arrogant. I thought I 
                        knew that wall by heart. I didn’t 
                        rehearse enough. I thought I could 
                        just do it. I was wrong. And I’m 
                        sorry I put you in that position.

           He’s so broken. She hugs him. The granite catches his eye. 
           Ernie’s nose starts bleeding.

                                 ERNIE
                        She feels us climbing on her face.

                                 HILLARY
                        Ernie, your nose...

           She wipes it for him.

                                 ERNIE
                        We’re not supposed to be here. She 
                        doesn’t want us here.

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s a hunk of granite. It doesn’t 
                        want anything.

                                 ERNIE
                        They’re a part of her now. And 
                        there are others, too. They’re all 
                        here. And we’re next. We’ll be here 
                        forever. You and me, and Jen and 
                        Neil. We’ll live here, too. 
                        Climbing forever. Climbing and 
                        climbing and never getting to the--
                             (gasps)
                        Oh fuck. What is happening to me?

                          HILLARY
                                                          ERNIE
           It’s okay, you’re just--
                                              What is happening to me?!

           He wipes the blood off his face, and then he winds up and 
           PUNCHES the stone, snapping himself out of a trance. He 
           screams in pain, his hand is fucked. Crying.
                                 ERNIE
                        See?! It’s getting into me! It gets 
                        is into things! It’s not a bridge 
                        between heaven and earth, it’s 
                        goddamn purgatory! 

           His blood drips down the rock. He looks down at his bloody 
           fist, and then he looks at her. Rage lights up his face. 

           It makes her shudder.

                                 HILLARY
                        Ernie, you’re my family. You guys. 
                        I want you to know that... 

                                 ERNIE
                        You’re right. This is your fault.

                                 HILLARY
                        C’mon, let’s go down.

                                 ERNIE
                        IT’S YOUR FAULT!

                                 HILLARY
                        Ernie--

                                 ERNIE
                             (growls)
                        I wish you died that day.

           He starts walking towards her. Slowly. Snarling.

           The VULTURE shrieks above. She looks up. It’s circling. He’s 
           itching his arms. Harder. Walking closer.

                                 ERNIE
                        I wish you never hit that branch. I 
                        wish you were dead. 

           Now they’re face to face. He wears hate like a mask. He cuffs 
           his hand around his own neck. It makes her jump.

                                 ERNIE
                        I wish the ceiling fan never broke. 
                        I’d be home now with Monica!

                                 HILLARY
                        How did you... know that...

                                 ERNIE
                        I dreamed that, too! I saw it!

           He balls his hand into a fist. And then it dawns on her.

                                 HILLARY
                        Where’s your harness?
           She sees it in a heap on the rock. His rope coiled. And then 
           he walks past her towards the edge.

                                 HILLARY
                        Ernie.

                                 ERNIE
                        We’ll never get off this rock! 

           He’s about to jump. Hillary tackles him, pulls him back. They 
           crash on to the rock. She lands on her back, Ernie on top. 

                                 ERNIE
                        I WANNA GO HOME!

           He’s trying to break free. She won’t let go.

                                 HILLARY
                        NEIL! NEIL! HELP ME!

           Ernie is struggling. They’re rolling around. Reaching for the 
           edge. All he wants is to get to the bottom. 

                                 ERNIE
                        GET IT OUT! GET IT OUT!

           Ernie punches her, trying to get free. She clamps down 
           tighter. Bleeding from her lip. They’re close to the edge. 
           Infinity below. 

                                 ERNIE
                        GET IT OUT OF ME!!!!

           Ernie is screaming tears. With all the strength he can 
           muster, he breaks free from Hillary’s grasp and takes off for 
           the edge, and just as he’s about to jump --

           Neil POPS over the edge and tackles Ernie backwards. Jen 
           follows. Pile on. The three of them hold him down. He 
           screams. Spit flies. Chest heaving.

           EXT. THE ROCK CEILING - LATER

           Ernie is tied in to the rock with double protection. They’ve 
           tied up his legs to keep him from jumping. He’s shivering. 
           White. Sweating profusely. Feverish. Muttering. They stand 
           around him, hooked in.

                                 HILLARY
                        I didn’t know. I didn’t know he was 
                        in so much pain...

                                 JEN
                        Did you ever ask? 
                             (off her look)
                        It didn’t just happen to you. It 
                        happened to all of us. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JEN (CONT'D)
                        You vanished. And left him to live 
                        with that guilt. Well, he couldn’t. 

                                 HILLARY
                        I didn’t know. 

                                 JEN
                        You’re not a good friend. 

                                 HILLARY
                        I don’t know to say...

                                 JEN
                        We have to go. He’s delirious, he 
                        doesn’t know what’s going on. We 
                        have to go now, we’ll climb through 
                        the night. We need to get him help.

           Ernie is shivering. Shooting confused looks around.

                                 NEIL
                        It’s too late... We’re too tired. 
                        We have to rest. 

                                 JEN
                        What if he tries it again? 

           Ernie screams. Eyes vacant.

                                 NEIL
                        We just have to watch him, there’s 
                        nothing else we can do right now. 
                        We can’t risk anymore mistakes.

                                 HILLARY
                        We can do it, Neil. We can climb 
                        up. Jen, you can stay with Ernie, 
                        we’ll give you all the supplies, 
                        there’s enough for three days. And 
                        then Neil and I will send the last 
                        thousand feet in one push. If we 
                        climb straight through, we’ll get 
                        to the bottom by midnight. 

           THUNDER ROLLS ACROSS THE SKY. Lightning streaks above them 
           like picky fingers. Black clouds unfurl. A vomit of rain.

           Hillary can’t believe her eyes.

                                 JEN 
                        Sunny skies for a week?

                                 HILLARY
                        I checked four reports.

           Jen shoots her a look. 
                                 NEIL
                        Does anyone have service? Can you 
                        call our guy? What’s his name? Li?

           They all check their phones. No service.  

                                 NEIL
                        What about the walkie? See if you 
                        can get someone. 

                                 JEN
                        It’s a walkie, not a radio. It’s 
                        only us... 

           Hillary gets on the walkie.

                                 HILLARY
                        Hello? Is anyone nearby?

           GZZZZT. Silence. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Anyone?! SOS. Emergency. Come in. 

           GZZZT. Nothing. Jen tends to Ernie. Neil turns to Hillary. 
           She looks away, and stares at her shoes, soaking wet. 

                                 NEIL
                        I hope the top is worth it for you. 
                        Because it’s lonely up there. 

           THUNDER. Hillary looks at the rock above Ernie. The cracks 
           look like a SCREAMING FACE in the rain. 

           Spooked, she gets back on the walkie.

                                 HILLARY
                        IS ANYONE THERE?!!!!

           Nothing but a wheeze of static. A blast of THUNDER.

           EXT. PORTALEDGE CAMP - NIGHT

           Blinding rain. Two portaledge tents hanging on the wall. One  
           above the other. Haulbags and supplies dangling. 

           Fifty feet above -- Mark and Paul’s old haunted portaledge.

           INT. NEIL AND HILLARY’S PORTALEDGE - NIGHT

           Hillary is huddled in her sleeping bag, reading through Mark 
           Hudson’s climbing journal. Neil is cooking their dinner on 
           the small propane burner.
                                 MARK HUDSON (V.O.)
                        Eleven pitches in one day. 
                        Beautiful here. Nothing but sun. 
                        5.7 to 5.11A climbing. 

           Turns the page.

                                 MARK HUDSON (V.O.)
                        Pitch twelve insane. Swear I 
                        thought crack system disappeared. 
                        5.14 climbing. Tried bolting. 
                        Chossy. Bolts won’t take. The 
                        blood. Fuck. 

           Her eyes are widening with fear. Her hand trembles.

                                 MARK HUDSON (V.O)
                        Rope untied. Free climbing and 
                        didn’t know it. Am I losing it?  
                        That fucking lizard...

            A shot of pain. She drops the journal, massages her wrist. 

                                 NEIL  
                        What’s wrong with your hand?

           She jumps at his voice. THUNDER LAUGHS.

                                 HILLARY
                        What do you mean?

                                 NEIL
                        I’ve been watching you. Sneaking 
                        pills. Tell me what’s going on.

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s fine.

                                 NEIL
                        You’re lying. 

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s a side effect from the fall, 
                        it’s nothing. Just a little sore. 

                                 NEIL
                        I saw your hand go limp.

                                 HILLARY
                        It fell asleep. It’s fine. The pill 
                        clears it up.

                                 NEIL
                        What aren’t you telling me?

                                 HILLARY
                        Nothing. 
                                 NEIL
                        Did you... see something, Hill?

                                 HILLARY
                        What do you mean? You mean what 
                        Ernie said? Ghosts? Are you fucking 
                        kidding? Neil!

           She slaps the journal shut. Dust makes her sneeze.

           INT. ERNIE AND JEN’S PORTALEDGE - NIGHT

           Ernie is in his sleeping bag, shivering and sweating. Ghost 
           white, dark circles under his eyes. Jen is feeding him bits 
           of salami. She washes his face with a damp cloth.

           Ernie starts wildly scratching his arms. 

                                 ERNIE
                        Get if off me. Get if off.

                                 JEN
                        Get what off?

                                 ERNIE
                        The mountain! Get it off me!

           He shows her his sparkling arms. She lifts a brow. 

                                 JEN
                        It’s just granite. It rubs off. 
                        See? It’s nothing, we all have it.

           Jen puts her arms beside his in compassion. Shows him her 
           dull granite sparkle. Same as his. 

                                 JEN
                        It’s normal.

           Ernie looks down. HIS POV is different -- The glitter is 
           wilder and brighter. A trippy tattoo. Shimmering and humming 
           like it’s alive -- and permanent. 

                                 ERNIE
                        NO! IT’S NOT NORMAL!!! IT’S IN 
                        ME!!! THE MOUNTAIN’S INSIDE ME!!!

           Jen takes his arm. It’s a dull sparkle again. 

                                 JEN
                        It’s just residue!

           Ernie gasps. He starts scratching violently.

                                 ERNIE
                        NO!!
           Ernie’s eyes bug when HE SEES -- 

           THE SPARKLE GETTING BRIGHTER, HUMMING LOUDER -- PETRIFYING 
           BEFORE HIS EYES -- TURNING HIS HANDS TO STONE! CRAGGILY ROCK 
           SNAKING UP HIS ARM LIKE A SPREADING INFECTION! 

           Ernie is screaming wild honking screams. Desperately 
           scratching at his ROCK HARD SKIN, tearing his nails and 
           making his fingers bleed.

                                 ERNIE
                        GET IT OFF!!!!

           Jen grabs him. Shaking him back to REALITY.  

                                 JEN
                        There’s nothing there! 

           Horrified, Ernie looks back down at his arms. No stone at 
           all. Nothing but raw skin and the sticky granite. He’s so 
           confused. Whimpering. Struggling to catch his breath. 

           Jen is scared for him. Hugs him tight. 

                                 JEN
                        Shhhh... It’s okay. We’re gonna get 
                        you home...

           He cries on her shoulder. 

           INT. NEIL AND HILLARY'S PORTALEDGE  - DAY

           They’ve been in the tents for TWO DAYS. Rain pelting the 
           nylon, trying to break in. Leaking into the tent. Neil and 
           Hillary work hard to patch it up. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Neil is napping. Hillary stares ahead. Deep in thought. She 
           glances down at Mark’s climbing journal. Picks it up. 

           Flips to where she left off. Page is dried up and swollen. 
           Mark’s voice is weakening... growing fearful...

                                 MARK HUDSON (V.O.)
                        Pitch twenty tomorrow. Point of no 
                        return. I want to turn back. Paul 
                        says no. He needs the top. This 
                        mountain doesn’t want us here. I 
                        feel it in me. It’s doing something 
                        to me. Something bad... 

           Something falls out. Hillary picks it up. It’s a bookmark 
           photo of MARK HUDSON and his FAMILY. A BEAUTIFUL WIFE and 
           three daughters. Back to the journal. The handwriting is 
           frantic. Stained with blood. The last two sentences:
                            She feels us climbing on her face.

                                 I will be a good steward.

           She lowers the journal and covers her mouth. She opens the 
           flap, and throws it out. It falls to its death. She gets on 
           the walkie.

                                 HILLARY
                        Hey, Jen?

                                 JEN (WALKIE)
                        Go for me.

                                 HILLARY
                        How’s Ernie?

           INT. ERNIE AND JEN’S PORTALEDGE - DAY

           Ernie is sleeping soundly in Jen’s arms. She caresses his 
           hair. She loves it. He purrs. 

                                 JEN
                             (whispers)
                        His fever is breaking. He’s better. 
                        Sound asleep.

           INTERCUT:

                                 HILLARY
                        Is he, uh, tied up?

                                 JEN
                        What do you mean?

                                 HILLARY
                        I just mean, maybe we should keep 
                        him tied up. You know, in case he 
                        tries to jump again or something.

           Jen looks at Ernie. He shivers.

                                 JEN
                        I don’t think he’s gonna try again.

                                 HILLARY
                        Better safe than sorry.

                                 JEN
                        I don’t think that’s necessary. 
                        I’ll keep him nice and safe.

                                 HILLARY
                        Tie him up. Would you just tie him 
                        up please? Thank you. Over and out.

           Neil is stirring. 
                                 NEIL
                        Are you okay?

                                 HILLARY
                        I’m perfect! 

           Jen looks at the rope. Considers. And then she snuggles up to 
           Ernie, the big galoot. She can’t bring herself to do it. He 
           moans in his sleep. Jen smiles, her eyes swell with love.

                                 JEN
                        It’s okay... everything’s okay...

           EXT. DÌYÙ SHAN - DAY

           ANOTHER DAY. The rock looks menacing in the storm. Like the 
           rain is washing away the veneer and only the bad remains.

           INT. NEIL AND HILLARY'S PORTALEDGE - DAY

           Thunder. Neil has their food and supplies splayed. Inventory.

                                 NEIL
                        We have two days of food left. 
                        We’re depleting everything. We 
                        really have to ration. Full on. 
                        Couple tablespoons of the trail 
                        mix. Couple slices of salami a day. 

           Hillary grabs the walkie.

                        I have half a jug.

           She’s wiping his face with a damp cloth.
                                 JEN
                        How long do you think this rain 
                        will last?

                                 NEIL
                        It’s already been three days. It 
                        can’t go on much longer like this.

                                 JEN
                        Copy.

           Neil puts the walkie down. Leaves it on.

                                 HILLARY
                             (mutters)
                        Two more days maybe.

                                 NEIL
                        Huh?

                                 HILLARY
                        Just a guess.

           Neil shakes his bottle of Tums. He’s all out. GZZZZT. A 
           STATICKY VOICE over the walkie.

                                 HILLARY
                        Did you hear that?

           More clear. A VOICE SPEAKING IN MANDARIN!

                                 HILLARY
                        You heard that right?! That 
                        happened?!

                                 NEIL
                        What? Yes. Of course. Answer.

                                 HILLARY
                             (on walkie)
                        HELLO?! COME IN?! EMERGENCY! SOS!

           GZZZZT. They wait. Ears perked. Eyes wide. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Come in! We’re stuck on the 
                        mountain, Dìyù Shan! We’re rock 
                        climbers and our friend is injured! 
                        Send help. Do you copy?! 

           Silence. 

                                 HILLARY
                        HELLO?!!!

           Static.
           Ernie shudders. Chewing on his lip. He hears a tiny avalanche 
           of rock. An then he starts to shudder and wince. He sees a 
           shadow of a MAN circling the tent in the rain. Walking around 
           the entire permitter, like they are on the ground. 

                                 ERNIE
                        ...No.

           The shadow melts into nothingness. Ernie huddles up, afraid.

                                 ERNIE
                        Leave me alone...

           Jen just look at him. 

           INT. NEIL AND HILLARY'S PORTALEDGE - LATER

           The rain is deafening. Beating the tent into submission. The 
           leak is worse. Hillary is getting sprayed. It’s such a small 
           space and yet somehow they keep their distance. Hillary 
           facing away, staring up. Bored. 

           Neil is meditating. She looks at him. He’s all zen and she 
           rolls her eyes. She hears A MOAN outside.

                                 HILLARY
                        What was that? Did you hear that?

           Neil doesn’t respond. Deep in his trance. Very slowly... 
           Hillary unzips the flap. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Ernie? Is that you?!

           She opens it. Expecting a face, but instead -- CRASHH!! A 
           brilliant streak of lightning illuminates the valley. And 
           then back to the dull night.

           Neil opens his eyes, coming back to planet earth. Calm.

                                 NEIL
                        It’s only the wind.

           Hillary huffs, zips the tent back up. Burrows into her bag, 
           and tries like hell to sleep. But who is she kidding? 
           Something isn’t right. She feels it in her broken bones.  

           The walkie is still on. Every so often a BLAST OF STATIC.

           INT. NEIL AND HILLARY'S PORTALEDGE - NIGHT

           ANOTHER DAY. The rain is an infinite drone, maddening and 
           wrong. Too loud to be real. Neil and Hillary are asleep. Neil 
           has his earbuds in, listening to sleep meditations. 
           Positivity spills out of his ears.

           The walkie SQUELCHES. GZZZZT. A WHISPER cuts through static. 
                                 VOICE
                        ...Hello?

           Hillary’s eyes snap open. She bolts up. Neil just snores. 

                                 HILLARY
                             (on walkie)
                        Hello?! Are you there? 

           The voice is distant, detached.

                                 VOICE
                        Hello...

                                 HILLARY
                        You speak English?

                                 VOICE
                        ...Yes. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Oh thank God. We’re stuck, we’re 
                        stuck on Dìyù Shan...

           Silence. And then a scream of static.

                                 HILLARY
                        Hello?!

                                 VOICE
                        I need... help. Please...

                                 HILLARY
                        What? No, we need help, our friend 
                        is sick!

                                 VOICE
                        No. That can’t be it...

                                 HILLARY
                        Please, we need help, we’re stuck!

                                 VOICE
                        We’re stuck. We’re here on Dìyù 
                        Shan. We’ve been here for so long. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Who is this?

                                 VOICE
                        I... I don’t know... I...

                                 HILLARY
                        Ernie?
                                 VOICE
                             (choking up)
                        Oh God... I don’t know... I’m so 
                        confused... 

                                 HILLARY
                        Who is this?!

                                 VOICE
                        This is Paul.

                                 HILLARY
                        Who?!

                                 VOICE
                        I THINK HE WANTS TO KILL ME! 

           The voice starts to cry... SCREAMING TEARS...

                                 HILLARY
                        Hello?!

           Suddenly, THE WALKIE FADES AWAY. Static. And then silence. 
           And then we hear THE CRYING RIGHT OUTSIDE THE TENT! 

           Hillary gasps. Wind picks up. The crying stops. Hillary looks 
           at Neil sleeping like a baby. She grabs her knife. Snuggles 
           into her bag. High alert.

           INT. ERNIE AND JEN'S PORTALEDGE - NIGHT

           Jen is sound asleep. Ernie is all huddled up. Sweating. 
           Rocking. Muttering. He peeks out the mesh vent hole. He sees 
           MARK HUDSON’S PORTALEDGE ABOVE. Lights are on inside. 
           Flickering. A low hum emanating from it. 

           Ernie’s staring transfixed. A darkness falls over him. His 
           gaping mouth curls into a teeth-gnashing snarl. Kind eyes 
           turn bitter. The tent is calling him.

           He looks down at the walkie talkie next to Jen. Picks it up, 
           and throws it out of the tent. Gone. Jen snores. 

           Suddenly, his nose starts bleeding again.

           INT. NEIL AND HILLARY'S PORTALEDGE - NIGHT

           Hillary hears the SCRATCHING. Looks to her right. The outline 
           of A FINGER being pressed. Slowly. Into the flap. Hillary 
           freezes. The finger rips itself away. 

                                 HILLARY
                             (breathless)
                        Neil.

           Neil snores. A hand is pressed into the nylon. Two hands. 
           Pressing. And then a FACE, smushed against the tent. 
                                 HILLARY
                        Neil...

           We see the indentation of a moving mouth. Rubbing a cheek up 
           and down the nylon. Moaning with the wind.  

                                 HILLARY
                        NEIL!!!!!!!!!

           She can’t stop screaming. Neil bolts up. Rips out his 
           earbuds. 

                                 NEIL
                        Hillary?!

           Her headlamp flickers. She looks back at the flap. The 
           indentations are gone. 

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Hill, what’s wrong?

           She’s gasping for breath. Shooting confused looks around.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Hill?!

                                 HILLARY
                        I want to climb.

                                 NEIL
                        What?

                                 HILLARY
                        We should leave. We should climb 
                        now. I want to climb now. 

                                 NEIL
                        What are you talking about, we 
                        can’t climb now. It’s raining.

                                 HILLARY
                        I don’t care. Big whoop. I love 
                        rain climbing, we’re climbing. Get 
                        ready.

                                 NEIL
                        You always push it too far. You 
                        always have.

                                 HILLARY
                        I gotta get the fuck outta this 
                        tent! I’m losing my mind! I’m 
                        seeing shit! I can’t be in here! 

                                 NEIL
                        You shoulda learned to meditate 
                        like I said. 
                                 HILLARY
                        Fuck you!

                                 NEIL
                        It really helps.

                                 HILLARY
                        I’m so scared.

                                 NEIL
                        Scared of what?

                                 HILLARY
                        Everything. 

           She hugs Neil. He holds her, calming her down. They’re face 
           to face. 

                                 HILLARY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to die.

                                 NEIL
                        You sound surprised. 

           It’s true. She does. As if it’s a revelation even to her. 

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        There’s nothing to be afraid of. We 
                        are alone. We’re all alone. 

           THUNDER BOOMS. WHOOSH!! A blast of wind shakes the tent, the 
           wind sends them crashing into each other. MORE THUNDER.

           Hillary gets lost in his eyes. The baby blue kindness. And 
           then she kisses him. He pulls her close and they start to 
           make out. She jumps on him. She can’t take her hands off him. 
           They devour each other, smearing chalk on each others faces. 
           And then --

                                 HILLARY
                        No.

           Pulls out of his arms, and pushes away. Harder. Too hard. 
           Breathing heavy, snarling at him. The frustration is 
           palpable. Neil sighs. Wiping chalk away. 

                                 NEIL
                        I’m getting mixed signals here.

           She catches her breath. She can’t look at him.

                                 HILLARY
                        Where’s your camera?

                                 NEIL
                        You threw it out.
           She digs through his bag. Pulls out her iPhone. No service. 
           Turns on the camera, and hands it to him. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Here. You got ten questions. 

                                 NEIL
                        What do you mean?

                                 HILLARY
                        Anything you want. 

           Neil looks at her. 

                                 HILLARY (CONT’D)
                        Ten questions. 

           He considers. Looks down at the iPhone in his hands. 

           EXT. OUTSIDE - NIGHT

           Ernie is questing through the rain. Obsession twinkles in his 
           eyes. Moving towards the old portaledge. A moth to light.  
           Shadows play inside. A blast of STATIC.

           INT. MARK AND PAUL’S PORTALEDGE - DAY

           Ernie opens the flap. Peeks inside. His eyes light up when he 
           sees -- MARK HUDSON, covered in blood, kneeling over PAUL 
           HERNANDEZ. Mark’s nose is bleeding too. The old walkie talkie 
           thrown beside them. Hissing. Getting louder.

           Paul was just stabbed thirty times. Blood spills down his 
           heaving chest. The life fading from his eyes. 

           A GORE-CAKED ROPE TOOTH KNIFE in Mark’s hand. His skin 
           glitters with blood and granite.  

           The granite sparkle dances in Mark’s eyes. He smiles and 
           offers Ernie the knife. Ernie grips the knife tight and looks 
           at it with reverence. He knows what he must do. 

           The torch is passed.

           INT. NEIL AND HILLARY'S PORTALEDGE - DAY

           The storm screams. Neil is aiming the iPhone at Hillary. She 
           braces herself. And then she unzips her jacket to reveal her 
           ROPE BURN for the camera.

                                 NEIL
                        Where did you move?

                                 HILLARY
                        Back to Yosemite. I got a place. I 
                        wanted to be closer to El Cap.
                                 NEIL
                        You left all your stuff in my 
                        apartment.

                                 HILLARY
                        I got new stuff.

                                 NEIL
                        I still have the old stuff.

                                 HILLARY
                        I don’t need stuff. I live in a 
                        van. In the driveway of an empty 
                        house.

                                 NEIL
                        That’s sad.

                                 HILLARY
                        I know.

                                 NEIL
                        Part of me was relieved when you 
                        fell. It’s sick, I know. But I 
                        actually thought we’d finally have 
                        a chance. You’d finally slow down. 
                        We could have a life somehow. 

                                 HILLARY
                        That’s not a question. 

                                 NEIL
                        It was always about the next big 
                        climb for you. And once you got to 
                        the top, you’d be all in on me. 
                        Until you got the itch. And then it  
                        was the next epic. And suddenly I’m 
                        just your belay. 

                                 HILLARY
                        You were a great belay.

                                 NEIL
                        Why did you push me away?

                                 HILLARY
                        I don’t want to be tied down.

                                 NEIL
                        Tied down? What am I, ropes?

                                 HILLARY
                        Yeah, Neil. You’re ropes.

           WOOSH! Wind blast the tent so hard it knocks them into each 
           other. They reel away. Hillary stares at the camera. Like 
           it’s trying to catch a glimpse of her soul. 
                                 NEIL
                        Why did you bring me here? Really.

                                 HILLARY
                        The North Face dropped me. I was 
                        always bad for the brand. I was 
                        desperate. And I knew you’d say 
                        yes. I’m broke. I figured it would 
                        get me a sponsor. I need a sponsor 
                        to keep climbing.

                                 NEIL
                        You’re the most self obsessed 
                        person I’ve ever met.

                                 HILLARY
                        And you’re the most selfless, maybe 
                        that’s why we lasted so long.

                                 NEIL
                        You gotta know there’s nothing at 
                        the top but more mountain. It’ll 
                        never be never enough for you. The 
                        top will keep getting higher, and 
                        the world below will just keep 
                        getting smaller. There’s nothing up 
                        there that’s gonna fix you.

                                 HILLARY
                        Not a... that’s not a... question.

                                 NEIL
                        No. But it’s the truth.

           And it hits her hard.

                                 NEIL
                        What are you climbing away from?

           She won’t answer. 

                                 NEIL
                        You’re not the climber you were. 
                        And you’ll never be that again. The 
                        sooner you accept that, the sooner 
                        you’ll be happy.

           She looks at him. Thunder rattles the tent.

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s not my hand it’s my spine. 

                                 NEIL
                        Tell me.

           She glances at the iPhone. Nervous. Her guard goes back up. 
           Neil stops filming, puts the iPhone aside. 
                                 HILLARY
                        No. Keep filming.

           He does. 

                                 HILLARY
                        I’m not supposed to be here. I 
                        can’t solo, I can’t climb. It’s 
                        over for me. If my doctors knew I 
                        was climbing now they would all 
                        freak. It’s the same thing Bader 
                        had after he fell in Joshua Tree.

                                 NEIL
                        Cervical Myelopathy.

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s degenerative. It’s gonna get 
                        worse. I tweak my neck the wrong 
                        way, and my hand dies. Worthless. 
                        In a year I’m going to lose my fine 
                        motor skills. Coordination 
                        problems, vertigo. Atrophy. And 
                        then... down the road, any kind of 
                        stressful activity will put me at 
                        risk of paralysis. I could sneeze 
                        and die... 
                             (beat)
                        This is my last trip. I wanted it 
                        to be... I wanted it to...

           Hillary bows her head, ashamed. 

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s my whole life. It’s all there 
                        is for me. This is what I was put 
                        on this earth to do. If I don’t 
                        climb I’ll die.

           She touches her rope burn. Neil lowers the iPhone. 

                                 NEIL
                        You’re gonna take us all with you.

                                 HILLARY
                        I... I need to get out of here. I 
                        have to get out of here, I’m losing 
                        my fucking mind. I’m losing-- 

           Thunder roars back. She snaps, starts punching him, kicking 
           him, screaming with the storm, the tent shaking rattling the 
           world. He tries to subdue her but she’s a feral beast.
                                 HILLARY
                        GET ME OUT OF HERE!!! FUCK! FUCK! 
                        AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. NEIL AND HILLARY’S PORTALEDGE - NIGHT

           Hillary is snuggled up in a hammock dangling underneath the 
           portaledge. Crying. Rain blasts around her. Lightning 
           explodes around. The portaledge roof keeps her dry. 

           Swinging in the wind, Hillary stares down into the abyss. 
           Watching how the rain falls forever. 

           It’s such a long, and beautiful way down. Calling her. 

           INT. NEIL AND HILLARY’S PORTALEDGE - NIGHT

           Neil is huddled up. Destroyed. He’s talking to her through 
           the floor.

                                 NEIL
                        Come on! Get back in here! You’re 
                        nuts to be out there! Hill!

           EXT. NEIL AND HILLARY’S PORTALEDGE - NIGHT

           Hillary huddles up for warmth. Listening to Neil pleading, 
           ignoring him. 

           Her rope dangles. She watches it swinging in the wind. But 
           it’s not the wind. Her mouth falls open as the rope starts to 
           pick itself up, rising up from below. Its frayed tip turns 
           and looks at her, like it’s the head of a snake. 

           The rope starts slithering towards her. She’s paralyzed with 
           fear. She turns away from it. 

           But it twists and curls and hovers above her now, serpent-
           like. Hillary shudders as it drapes itself across her chest. 

           She yelps, and slaps it away. The plastic tip nudges her. 
           Taps her shoulder like a horrible black finger. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Oh god, oh god, oh god...

           It slithers across her, nuzzling. She pushes it away, but it 
           reels back, angry, and stares her in the face. Dangling 
           before her eyes.

           It starts to tie itself into a noose for her. She gasps, 
           closes her eyes. Grips the piton tighter.
           INT. ERNIE AND JEN'S PORTALEDGE - NIGHT

           Jen opens her eyes. She sees Ernie kneeling over her in his 
           harness. Watching her sleep. His face is lost in shadow. Rain 
           drips from his chin.

                                 JEN
                        What are you doing? You’re wet. 
                        Ernie?! You have a fever, you’re 
                        gonna get pneumonia!

           Ernie’s face tilts into the light. Eyes pulsing with rage. 
           Hair matted by rain.

                                 JEN
                        Your nose, you’re bleeding. Come 
                        here, honey. You’re sleepwalking. 

           She hugs Ernie, holding his head. Nothing but love. He 
           freezes. Stiff. 

                                 JEN
                        What? You got to lie down, and try 
                        to get some sleep.

           She finally notices the rope-tooth knife in his hand. He’s 
           trembling with hate. Repressing murder. Jen looks nervous.

           Jen shudders at the words. Lightning explodes behind him. 
           Rain screams. He chokes up on the knife.

                                 JEN
                        Ernie?

           The veins in his temple throb. It’s taking every ounce of 
           strength he can muster to not stab Jen in the throat. 

                                 JEN
                        I love you. I have to tell you 
                        that. I’ve loved you since K2.

           He grips the knife tighter. A war is waging inside.

                                 JEN
                        You’re my ideal. 

           He looks at her. Nothing.

                                 JEN
                        Every time I see you I just want to 
                        hug you, I want to be with you all 
                        the time and... 

           He chokes up on the knife. These words cut through the 
           granite madness. A tear rolls down his face.
                                 JEN
                        Ernie, please. Put down the knife.

           Jen’s fingers travel over to the propane tank.

                                 ERNIE
                        AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!

           He rears back to stab her and -- WHAPPP!!! She cracks him on 
           the face with the tank. 

           INT. NEIL AND HILLARY'S PORTALEDGE - NIGHT

           Neil is lying there, sound asleep. The sound of the tent flap 
           unzipping stirs him awake.

                                 NEIL
                             (groggy)
                        Hill? I’m sorry, I--

           We see the shadow of Hillary climbing into her sleeping bag. 
           Head to toe.

                                 NEIL
                        I’m sorry about what I said. There’s 
                        something I gotta tell you, I’m... 
                        shit. Your toes are freezing.

           He looks over. He sees the bulge in Hillary’s sleeping bag. 

                                 NEIL
                        Hill?

           THE DEAD CHINESE CLIMBER BOLTS UP SCREAMING! 

           Neil screams, starts kicking at him, freaking out. The 
           Climber’s mouth falls open even wider and a BABY LIZARD 
           crawls out. The reptile scales the climber’s face, and 
           summits on top of his head.

           EXT. HAMMOCK - NIGHT

           Hillary hears Neil’s screams above. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Neil?!

           She looks up, sees the shadow play. The tent shaking. She 
           starts climbing up there, but --

           THE NOOSE CUFFS HER AROUND THE NECK and pulls her back. She 
           gasps, it yanks her hard, and tries to pull her off the 
           ledge. But it won’t work, she’s harnessed in. The rope pulls 
           tighter, she’s turning blue. Grabbing at her throat. 
           She tries to pry her fingers into the noose. It’s too tight. 
           She reaches for her knife. Her eyes fluttering. Hands 
           weakening. The world is starting to slip away from her.

           THUNDER CRASHES around her as she chokes to death. Streaks of 
           fire turning night into day for a split second. Blood vessels 
           explode in her eyes like crimson fireworks.

           She slashes at the rope above, but it’s a slippery snake and 
           she’s losing consciousness. She tries cutting the noose 
           around her neck, clumsily stabbing her own throat. Blood 
           spilling down her neck. It’s no use. Fading. 

                                 NEIL (O.S)
                        AHHH GOD!!!!

           Neil’s screams SNAP HER BACK. Invigorate her. With a choking 
           wail, she reaches up, snatches the rope and saws herself 
           free. The rope breaks and falls into the void.

           Hillary catches her breath in the rain, climbing to the wall. 
           The color returning to her face. Her voice is a wet rasp --

                                 HILLARY
                        Not... today.

           INT. NEIL AND HILLARY'S PORTALEDGE - NIGHT

           WHAPP!!! Hillary bursts into the tent, soaking wet. She has a 
           fresh, horrible rope burn.

           She scares the shit out of Neil. The Chinese Climber is gone, 
           and Neil is still reeling. Relieved, Neil hugs her, holds her 
           close, freaking out. 

                                 NEIL
                        Ernie was right! The mountain is 
                        haunted! We have to climb!

                                 HILLARY
                             (rasp)
                        Let’s get... the fuck outta here.

                                 NEIL
                        What happened to you?!

           She ignores this, grabs the walkie. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Jen? Are you there?

           GZZT. No response. Just static.

                                 HILLARY
                        Jen? We’re leaving. Now.
           They look at each other. And then A BLOOD CURDLING scream 
           from above. They gasp. He starts out. She grabs him. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Hold on. Helmets.

           She hands Neil his helmet. He nods. She puts on her own.

           EXT. WALL - NIGHT

           Hillary and Neil cling to the wall. They place pro, and start 
           climbing toward’s Jen’s portaledge. Rain hammers them. Jen’s 
           screams wafting out.  

           INT. ERNIE AND JEN'S PORTALEDGE - NIGHT

           Hillary opens the flap to see a naked and blood-stained Ernie 
           kneeling over Jen, holding the knife. She’s fighting him, 
           gasping, covered in blood. SLISH!! He stabs her again.

                                 NEIL
                        Ernie?!

           Ernie looks at her. Eyes dripping with wet madness. Full 
           surrender to the rock. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Ern. You gotta drop the knife, bud. 

           But there’s no Ernie left. He starts to scream, and takes a 
           swipe at Hillary. Neil tries to grab him, but Ernie slices 
           him across the cheek, drawing blood. Neil reels back in pain.

           Ernie falls on top of Hillary and she grabs his wrist. The 
           knife inches from her face. He’s drooling on her. Screaming.

           WHAM!! WHAM! WHAM!! Neil starts kicking him. He falls off 
           Hillary. She joins in and they kick him out of the tent.

           He falls. The rope catches him, fifty feet below. He slams 
           into the wall. 

           They go to Jen. She is sweating. Suffering. Holding her side. 

                                 JEN
                        He... snapped... 

           Hillary rips up a towel and ties it around her waist. 

                                 JEN
                        It’s the trauma... it’s the 
                        altitude... it’s--

                                 HILLARY
                        --It’s the mountain. It’s alive. 
                        It’s controlling everything. 
                                 NEIL
                             (dark)
                        Ernie’s a force of nature...

           They hear Ernie SCREAMING below. Obscenities and nonsense.

                                 JEN
                        We gotta get the fuck out.

                                 NEIL
                        Can you climb?

           She snaps out of it.

                                 JEN
                        I don’t know. I think so...

           Suddenly -- WOOOOOSHHH! The tent starts shaking violently. 

           WHAMM! They slam into each other. But it’s not the wind. It’s 
           something else. Impossibly strong. An unseen force, shaking 
           them up like a cocktail. WHACK! They slam against the rock. 
           WHACK! WHACK! Tangling and falling all over each other. Pure 
           screaming chaos. Supplies fly. The stove burner cracks 
           Hillary on the head. 

           And someone else is screaming with them. We catch BRIEF 
           GLIMPSES OF PAUL HERNANDEZ. Covered in blood. He’s screaming, 
           too. Crashing into them. Just as petrified as they are. 
           Screaming like he’s being stabbed thirty times...

           A force is slamming them into the wall like a tetherball. 

           WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! You can hear the avalanche -- rocks 
           catapulting down, whizzing by. 

           Paul is gone. WOOOOSHH!!! They’re dropped from the sky. Up 
           and down, plummeting, and rising. Down is up and up is down -- 

           The portaledge base snaps and now they are dangling off their 
           anchors in a bag. No floor. Tangled in nylon. Like three sick 
           cats in a burlap sack. And then the madness just stops. They 
           look around. Creaking ropes. They catch their breath. 

                                 JEN
                        Holy fuck!

                                 NEIL
                        Come on, we’re leap frogging it.

           EXT. PORTALEDGE - NIGHT

           Torrents of rain. They emerge, and start climbing. Hillary 
           shines her headlamp down the wall. 

           Ernie is fifty below, and getting closer. Climbing at them. 
           Knife in teeth like some deranged, bloodthirsty pirate. 
           EXT. THE WALL - NIGHT

           They blast up the slick rock. It’s about getting to the top 
           and nothing else. 

           Their headlamps cut through the dark. Placing protection. 
           This is the best climbing we’ve seen yet. Their lives depend 
           on it. Battered by rain. No thinking. Just up. She looks 
           down. Her light illuminates Ernie. A feral beast. Getting 
           closer.

           The shrieking vulture circles. The wind shifts. Neil leads. 
           Jen in the middle. Hillary brings up the rear. Jen’s blood is 
           leaking from her side and staining the wall as she goes. She 
           twists wrong, and cries out in pain.

           Slips. Falls. Her cam pops out and she takes a whipper. 
           WOOOOSHH!!! Slams into the wall, a foot above of Ernie.

           AHHHHHHH!!!! He lunges and grabs on to Jen’s legs. Climbs up 
           her. Hillary is down climbing to her rescue. 

           Jen is screaming. Crashing into the wall. Ernie starts 
           stabbing as he climbs her like a tree -- SLISH! SLISH! SLISH! 
           Stabbing her all over, moaning and crying. Jen is trying 
           desperately to kick Ernie off. 

           He hugs Jen like some horrible leech, and starts frantically 
           CUTTING HER ROPE. 

                                 JEN
                        ERNIE! ERNIE! 

           She’s screaming, trying to fight him off, but she’s so weak.

           Hillary pops her cam out of the rock and plummets. Dropping 
           on to Ernie’s back like a superhero, knocking him off Jen. 

           They slam into the wall together. Tangling in each other’s 
           ropes. He stabs at her, but she hits him in the face with her 
           chalk bag. It explodes, blinding him. She starts elbowing him 
           in the head. 

           He cuffs her around the neck. Hard. Tighter. Clamps down. 
           Hillary turning purple. Choking. Slapping at his hands. His 
           face white from chalk like a fucked-up clown. 

           He clamps down tighter. Tighter. Her eyes fluttering. A blood 
           vessel erupts like a little crimson firework. 

           Above them, THE VULTURE SHRIEKS. Hillary is fading to black. 

           WHAMMM! Neil appears out of nowhere, cracking Ernie on top of 
           the head with a rock so hard it sends him plummeting. 
           He hits the wall and starts to convulse. A SEIZURE on the 
           rock. He is flopping spastically like a fish out of water. 
           Foaming. Gurgling in the rain. 

           Suddenly, the seizing stops. Ernie is slowly coming back to 
           lucidity. And wishes he wasn’t. Eye fluttering, he looks up. 

           He’s Ernie again. And sees what he’s done to Jen. He looks at 
           Hillary. At Neil. He starts to cut his own rope.

                                 HILLARY
                        Ernie, no!

           But his knife is sharp and he falls. And we’re falling 
           through the rain with Ernie. He’s scared at first but then he 
           stops fighting, and gives himself over to the terminal 
           velocity. Surrender. 

           Twenty-six hundred feet in twelve seconds. The wind carrying 
           him home. WHAMM!!! He hits a ledge. His head explodes like a 
           ripe watermelon. Still falling. A headless body. Swallowed by 
           the abyss. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Jen is hanging there crying. Fear, and sorrow and more 
           confusion than anything else.

                                 HILLARY
                        Can you climb?!

                                 JEN
                        AHHHH GOD! AHHH GOD!! ERNIE!!!

                                 HILLARY
                        Try the crack, the crack!

                                 JEN
                        I dunno... I... God, it hurts...

           She sticks her fingers in a crack system. Starts climbing up. 
           It hurts but up she goes.

                                 HILLARY
                        There you go, you got it!

                                 JEN
                        I can do it... Hill. I can do it!

           Hope flashes in Jen’s eyes. Hillary watches her climb the 
           crack and -- SLISSSHHH!! The crack vices together like a 
           guillotine, slicing Jen’s fingers clean off! And she 
           plummets, screaming. 

           Watching her fingers bounce of the rock and fall. Blood 
           sprays out of her nubs. A finger bounces off Hillary’s head. 
                                 HILLARY
                        Jen?!

           A razor flake is cutting through Jen’s rope. The mountain is 
           finishing what Ernie started. It tears. She falls.

           But instead of falling down -- Jen is falling up. Bizzaro 
           gravity. Like the world is upside down and she’s falling 
           through it. Up, up. Screaming as she goes. 

           Falling higher and higher in the rain. Up through the storm 
           clouds, lightning pulsing around her. Wind beating her, and 
           stealing her breath. 

           And suddenly Jen’s looking down at the tiny world below. At 
           her fingerless hands. 

           The vulture flying past. A little too close. So high above 
           the summit of Dìyù Shan. Neil and Hillary are wet specks of 
           barnacle on the rock. 

           And then... Like Wiley Coyote... Jen stops dead in mid air. 
           Another thousand feet above the summit. Swollen storm clouds. 
           Dangling there, kicking at the sky. Sucking in breaths.

           Suddenly -- Gravity kicks in. And now she’s falling the way 
           God intended. Down. And we’re falling with her. A five 
           thousand foot free fall. 

           She can’t scream because her stomach is lodged in her throat. 
           Wheezing. Desperate to breathe the air that rushes by. It 
           rejects her needy lungs. Down. Fifty feet a second.

           And there’s the summit of the mountain below her shoes. Small 
           and pointless from up here. Falling. Choking on rain. It’s 
           taking such a long time.

           WHACK!! Clipping the top of the wall. A munch of bones. 
           Bouncing off an outcrop and somersaulting down. Past the 
           screaming blur of Neil and Hillary. Falling through the 
           storm. Her screams are musical. In key. Falling. Falling. 

           And then the ground rushes up at 300 MPH!

                                                                CUT TO:

           DÌYÙ SHAN. A giant monster in the rain. The spires look like 
           horns. The cave looks like a mouth. Gluttonous.  

           God turns off the faucet and the rain stops a little too 
           abruptly. Clouds part too quickly. Day breaks like a femur. 
           The sun is on the rise. An explosion of golden light climbs 
           up the wall. It doesn’t need a belay. 

           We climb with the light. Rising with the sun to join Hillary 
           and Neil so high above. Neil is screaming in shock. He can’t 
           move he’s frozen. Staring down. 
           And then the screams stop abruptly. Hillary touches him, he 
           jumps. Looks at her. Horrified. He’s trying to speak the 
           words die on his tongue.

                                 HILLARY
                        We have to keep climbing. Don’t 
                        look down. Keep climbing, no matter 
                        what. 

                                 NEIL
                        They’re my family. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Neil. We have to go. The only way 
                        off this mountain is up. 

           She touches him warmly. Birds chirp. The mist melts away to 
           reveal the green shag carpet of trees twenty seven hundred 
           feet below their dangling shoes. 

           They look up at the rock. It glistens. Clean and washed. And 
           the most perfect rainbow she’s ever seen. It’s horrible.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           They climb on. The sun growing larger in the sky. Hillary is 
           exhausted, Neil is fueled by adrenaline. Working together. 
           Connected by an nylon umbilical chord. Placing cams, nuts, 
           and hexes. Ascending fast. 

           The vulture soaring over head. Hillary looks around. It’s 
           very familiar terrain. She pulls herself up. But then she 
           feels something. A pebble maybe. Looks at her hand. There’s A 
           TOOTH stuck to the bottom. 

                                 HILLARY
                        No.

           Pulls herself on to the ledge. Standing in dried blood. And 
           there’s the HUMAN JAW. She gasps, and kicks it off.

           It’s that ledge. PITCH TWENTY AGAIN. They see their 
           portaledge camp slapping against the rock. Mark and Paul’s 
           tent looming above it. Neil pulls himself up. They look 
           around. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Pitch twenty? How--  

                                 NEIL
                        How did we get here? We’re back... 
                        Did we downclimb? How did we--

           She’s trying to orient herself. All the climbing they just 
           did for naught.
                                 HILLARY
                        It’s fucking with us. It’s fucking 
                        with our heads.

           Hillary looks up at the old portaledge. Neil’s ears perk. His 
           eyes flash. He looks down at his ankles. He doesn’t see it. 
           He feels it. 

                                 NEIL
                        Something... Something is--

           THE INVISIBLE FORCE. Cuffing his ankles. We see the 
           indentation on his pants. Two invisible hands gripping him. 

                                 NEIL
                        What the fuck?!

           And he’s slowly pulled away from the wall. 

                                 HILLARY
                        No.

           She grabs him, but he’s yanked out of her hands by the 
           invisible force. Getting pulled further away from the wall. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Neil!

           He’s kicking and screaming, trying to free himself from the 
           horrible grasp. Hillary bends and kicks off the wall as hard 
           as she can, grabbing on to his shirt. Clutches her arm. And 
           now he’s pulling her too, both off the wall. Peeling away. 

           But the force YANKS HIM HARD, breaking them apart. Hillary 
           SLAMS into the wall. And Neil is kicking at the evil air. 
           Twenty feet off from the wall.

           His rope stretching as he’s pulled away. Growing taut. Fifty 
           feet away, on his back in the air, facing heaven. The lead up 
           to of some deranged amusement park ride.  

           Arching upwards into the air. Hundred feet away from the wall 
           now. A rope’s length. The FORCE FLIPS HIM OVER. And now he’s 
           looking straight down at the eternal below. It would give 
           Hitchcock vertigo. A warm patch of urine stains his pants, 
           and rains. 

           A little to the right. Like he’s being lined up. Hillary 
           looks to her right and sees it -- The sharp ledge. The force 
           is lining him up for the bullseye.  

                                 HILLARY
                        No.

           And Neil is pulled higher. Screaming tears. No more slack 
           left on the rope. You can hear it creak. 
           Hillary gains momentum, running across the wall, back and 
           forth like a trapeze artist. 

           The force lets Neil go and he is flying through the air like 
           a pendulum. She runs across the wall to break his fall. Dives 
           for him but, misses and -- WHACKKKKK!!! Neil slams into the 
           ledge and his leg instantly SNAPS. The tibia BURSTS through 
           the skin.

                                 NEIL
                        FUCK!!!!! OH GOD!!!!!

           Spitting. Moaning. Seething. Hillary climbs over to him. 
           Horrified. He’s incoherent with pain. Swaying on the rope. 
           Blood falling down and riding the wind, pecking her face.

                                 NEIL
                        I’m dead. I’m fucked. It hurts so 
                        bad. I’m gonna pass out. It hurts 
                        so bad. It’s bad.

                                 HILLARY
                        Breathe. Just breathe. I’m getting 
                        you off this rock, I promise.

                                 NEIL
                        I can’t. How am I gonna climb? 

                                 HILLARY
                        I’ll climb for you. 

           She looks up. And there’s THE CAVE above. She grabs his rope, 
           and snaps into action -- blasting up the rock. Climbing up to 
           the cave. Three thousand feet up now, three quarters of the 
           way, and higher than anything made by man. The earth is like 
           a living map below. 

           INT. CAVE - DAY

           Hillary leaps to grab the branch on the lip, and pulls 
           herself in. She looks around. It’s dark. Dank.

           She throws her light around. The cave is smaller than it 
           looks. Like a stuffy crypt. Her light is dull so it’s hard to 
           get a feel for the place. It looks empty. But it isn’t. 

           She follows the wall, fingers tracing the rock, looking for 
           another way out. Feeling her way. Cobwebs. Massive bugs 
           skittering everywhere. A stray bat. 

           CRUNCH. She steps on something. Looks down. It’s HER LIGHTER. 

           Weird. She picks it up. How the fuck did it get up here? She 
           sparks it. It works. Plays on her face. She illuminates 
           something else in the dark. We don’t see it yet. But she 
           drops her lighter as pure horror deforms her face. 
           Her SCREAMS are swallowed by the cave and vomited back out in 
           echo, so loud they shake the dust loose from the ceiling. 

           She turns away from the horror, towards the bright light of 
           the entrance, and collapses on her hands and knees.

                                 HILLARY
                             (muttering)
                        Oh God. I’m sorry, I’m so sorry...

                                 NEIL (O.S.)
                        Where are you?!!

           Neil’s voice snaps her out of it. No time for fear and guilt. 
           She has to act. She climbs to her feet. Moves away from the 
           horror, back towards the entrance to the cave. Towards life.

                                 HILLARY
                        Neil! Listen to me! I’m pulling you 
                        up! Climb with your hands! Can you 
                        do that for me?!

                                 NEIL (O.S.)
                        I think. I think so...

           The VULTURE lands on the branch at the lip. Staring at her. 
           Hillary picks up a rock, and CHUCKS IT at the bird. It 
           bounces off its beak, and the bird flies away.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Neil. Hanging there. So broken. Inside and out.

                                 HILLARY (O.S.)
                        Here we go!

           INTERCUT: Hillary wraps the rope around her hands. Braces 
           herself. And starts pulling. Adrenaline coursing. 

           Neil is using his hands and good leg as Hillary pulls. Up 
           Neil goes, climbing with one leg. Muscles bulging. Closer to 
           the cave. Hillary screams, mustering all the strength she 
           has. And she’s suddenly stronger than she’s ever been.   

                                 HILLARY
                        Keep climbing! No matter what!

           He’s so close. She goes to the edge. Grabs his hands. He’s 
           screaming in pain as he leg catches the lip. She pulls him up 
           and in and he falls on top of her. Crying. Moaning. 

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s okay. It’s okay. 

           He holds her close. And they just lie there on the floor. 
           Breathing heavy. Catching their breath. Safe in each other’s 
           arms. Safe for now. 
                                 NEIL
                        Oh fuck. It hurts...

           She holds him. Hushes him. He sees something in the shadows. 

                                 NEIL
                        ...What is that?

           She lets go of him. Looks at him pitifully. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Everything.

           And then she shows him. Shining her lamp to reveal: The cave 
           is full of familiar junk. The portaledge pole that almost hit 
           her. Her ripped tent. The climbing journal she threw off. The 
           drill. The rope. Jen’s walkie talkie. Neil’s camera. The 
           human jaw. The dead lizard. A graveyard of the fallen. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Everything that fell. It’s all ends 
                        up here somehow. Everything.

           And then her lamp reveals the remains of ERNIE AND JEN. 
           Sitting upright. A mess of gore and climbing gear. Jen’s face 
           decimated from her free falls. Ernie is headless. 

           Neil SCREAMS, tries to scoot away, but backs into the 
           shriveled corpses of MARK and PAUL behind him. Worm food. 
           Mark has NO JAW. Neil cries, crawling away, pain stabbing.

                                 HILLARY
                        Your leg! You gotta stay still!

           He crashes into THE CHINESE CLIMBER. A skeleton in a knit 
           hat, covered with ropes. The skeleton falls on top of Neil. 
           He screams and pushes it off, tearing cobwebs off his face.

           Hillary tries to calm him down. Holds him. He’s gasping.

                                 HILLARY
                        Stop. It’s okay, it’s okay. We’re 
                        gonna be okay.

           The corpses are all sitting against the wall, as if they were 
           arranged that way. They see the bones littered throughout the 
           cave. Human remains. Skulls. Ribs. Pelvises. Piles of bones. 

                                 NEIL
                        We’re never leaving. We’re gonna be 
                        like Mark and Paul, like all of 
                        them...
                             (sheer terror)
                        We’re never getting off this 
                        mountain!
                                 HILLARY
                        Neil. Please... Don’t move...
                             (tears)
                        We gotta splint your leg.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Hillary’s whittled the branch into two flat sides, turned it 
           into a splint. She’s removing her rope now. Cuts a small 
           section off. Splits it. She puts her hands on Neil’s leg. 
           Swollen and wrong. The blood wet nub of bone jutting out.

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s gonna hurt.

           He bites a stick.

                                 NEIL
                        Okay. Go. Do it.

           SNAP! She puts his leg straight. He SCREAMS so loud the dirt 
           rains from above.

                                                                CUT TO:

           They just sit there against the wall. Neil’s leg is swelling 
           in the splint. He’s groaning. She hands him a couple more 
           pills. He takes them, greedily. She’s looking at him with 
           soul piercing eyes. He feels her stare.

                                 HILLARY
                        You were my rock all along. I 
                        really blew it. I could have had a 
                        life with you, but I was afraid... 
                        And I fucked everything up... 

                                 NEIL
                        We’ll be together. One way or 
                        another. I love you... Since we 
                        were kids, climbing El Cap after 
                        school. I love you. 

           He takes her hand. Hillary’s face ignites with a new purpose.

                                 HILLARY
                        We’re getting out of here.

                                 NEIL
                        The mountain always wins. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Not this time. We’re getting off 
                        this rock. I’m climbing to the top, 
                        no matter what. I’m gonna walk 
                        down. Just walk down the trail on 
                        the other side like nothing. Li is 
                        waiting. We’ll get help. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HILLARY (CONT'D)
                        They’re gonna air lift you out and 
                        everything’s gonna be okay, I 
                        promise. 

                                 NEIL
                             (smiles)
                        I believe you.

           She kisses her piton necklace. 

                                 NEIL
                        What’s with the necklace?

                                 HILLARY
                        What do you mean? You gave it to 
                        me. Way back. Teaching me how to 
                        fall. Remember?

                                 NEIL
                        But, why do you keep kissing it?

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s good luck.

           Neil smiles. Kisses it himself. 

                                 NEIL
                        Good luck.

                                 HILLARY
                        Climbing.

                                 NEIL
                        Climb on.

           She starts away -- THE PIERCING SHRIEK OF THE VULTURE! She 
           turns to find it. Perched on the edge of the cave. It has her 
           rope in its beak. 

                                 HILLARY
                        No.

           Hillary takes a step towards the bird. The soulless thing 
           just stares at her. 

           Hillary lunges for the rope. Catches the end, but the bird 
           TAKES OFF and it slips through her fingers.

                                 HILLARY
                        FUCK!

           The vulture flies away. Soaring over the world with the rope. 
           It lets it go and the rope falls.

           Hillary leans against the wall. Horrified. It’s all over now. 
           Neil is staring at her. 
                                 NEIL
                        We’re fucked.

           But Hillary knows what she has to do. A beat of silence. 

                                 HILLARY
                        I gotta solo.

                                 NEIL
                        What? Hill. You can’t. Your hand.

                                 HILLARY
                        I have to. It’s the only way.

                                 NEIL
                        Your hand’s gonna tweak! No! I’m 
                        not gonna lose you again!

                                 HILLARY
                        Neil. Listen to me. It’s only four 
                        hundred feet to the crack. Just a 
                        perfect crack all the way to the 
                        summit, it’s beautiful. If I can 
                        get up those four hundred feet 
                        we’re home free.

                                 NEIL
                        It’s fucking with you. It doesn’t 
                        want you to get to the top.

                                 HILLARY
                        I’m not trying to get to the top. 
                        I’m trying to get to the bottom.
                             (smiles)
                        I’m climbing towards something now.

                                 NEIL
                        The purest form of climbing. Right?
                        I guess if anyone can do it, you 
                        can. You’re a born climber. This is 
                        what you were put on this earth to 
                        do. Do it.

                                 HILLARY
                        Climb on.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           A pile of cigarette butts. Another joins them. A foot stamps 
           it out. REVEAL LI at the trailhead. Waiting by his truck. He 
           looks at the gnarled forest, and the snipped chain. He hears 
           the vulture SHRIEK. Sees it flying overhead. He shudders. 
           Checks the time. He’s antsy. He lights up another cigarette. 

           EXT. THE WALL - DAY

           Hillary is climbing up the wall without ropes. 
           She slots her hands into cracks. Jamming upward. Slow and 
           steady. Supreme presence. It’s a beautiful day for a climb. 

           She’s climbing up the crack system. She doesn’t look down. 
           But we do. Thirty two hundred feet above the earth. Higher 
           than the World Trade Centers stacked on top of each other. 

           Hillary dances across a flake like a dirtbag ballerina. Locks 
           off on an undercling. The holds are sharp, like grabbing the 
           tips of tacks. 

           She comes to the end of the pitch. Pulls herself up on a 
           shelf. Three hundred feet to the final crack. She looks 
           across the mountain. The rock is calm. Too calm.  

           INT. CAVE - DAY

           Neil sits with his back to the wall, shivering. So much pain. 
           The remains of the dead surrounding him. He looks like he 
           belongs with them. And then his light starts to flicker. And 
           then it dies. He sits alone in the dark.

           EXT. WALL - DAY

           Next pitch. Hillary steps on to a foothold the size of a 
           pebble. Reaching for a pinch. 

           THE VULTURE is perched on the rock above, watching her. It 
           SHRIEKS! She cries out. Feet slip, but she catches herself. 

           Cranes up at the bird. It takes off. So does Hillary. Higher. 
           She kicks over to the ledge. The crack vanishes naturally 
           into a seam. The wall is blank like glass. Nothing to grab on 
           to. A swath of nothing. This is where it gets dicey.

                                 HILLARY
                        Okay. Okay. 

           She chalks up. Plants her fingers. Nothing but gravity and a 
           bit of friction holding her up. Like walking on the sky. The 
           toughest kind of climbing. She’s making it look easy. 

           She contorts her body in impossible ways, pressing against 
           corners like she’s made of glue. 

           She reaches for a microhold above, spread eagle across the 
           wall like she’s frozen in a jumping jack. The wall is getting 
           steeper now. She’s getting tired. 

           One hundred feet above, the final crack to the top. The 
           vulture SHRIEKS. She sees its shadow and feels it, too. 

           She pulls herself on to a ledge. She catches a glimpse of the 
           abyss below. Rock dust rains. Best not to look.
           Hands gashed and bleeding, she reaches into her pocket and 
           pulls out a small tube of SUPER GLUE. Fills in the cut. Works 
           like charm.

           The FINAL CRACK above her head. She jams her hands into the 
           fracture. They fit like gloves. 

           Riding the crack like an escalator. She can see the summit 
           above. The vulture perched, watching. 

           Hillary reaches the wrong way -- A STAB OF PAIN! And she 
           tweaks out. Her hand goes numb and dies. 

           Hillary screams. Helpless on the wall. Single handed. She 
           starts flapping her dead mitt wildly. Desperate. 

           She reaches for the pills in her pocket. Grabs the bottle. 
           But it slips through her fingers. Bounces off the ledge. 
           Pills explode, and fall to earth with the bottle. Only a 
           couple of pills scattered across the ledge. 

                                 HILLARY
                        FUCK!

           She presses her head against the wall. Breathes. Looks down 
           at her limp wrist. Jams the worthless, fingery meat into the 
           large crack for balance, all of her weight on her right hand. 

           She starts to downclimb. Sloppy. A rock cuts her ankle, blood 
           fills her shoes and stains the wall.

           Her foot slips, she nearly falls. But she manages to lower 
           herself down onto the ledge. Scoops up the last of the pills 
           and stuffs them in her mouth. 

           Slides down on to her ass. Just enough room on the ledge to 
           wallow. Pumping her dead hand over and over. 

           The top seems so far now. As if the rock has grown a couple 
           hundred feet higher. Maybe it has. Pumping her fist, her hand 
           slowly comes back to life. 

           Hillary grabs hold of the crack, and starts back up. A dead 
           sprint to the top. Fifty feet from the summit now. She’s 
           actually going to make it! It’s all downhill from here. 

           She reaches for the crack -- But slips! Gasps. Dangling from 
           one hand -- her bad one. A debris of rock dust rains. 
           Hillary’s desperate. 

           All of her weight on her fingertips. She tries to pull 
           herself up. Feet scraping the wall for friction. She looks up 
           and sees --

           A STRANGE CREEPING MIST gathering at the summit, shrouding 
           the world around the top. 
           It billows down the rock like dying clouds. She closes her 
           eyes. Finds the grace to breath. CLOSE on the piton around 
           her neck.  

                                 YOUNG HILLARY (O.S.)
                        I’m gonna fall!

                                 YOUNG NEIL (O.S)
                        The rope will catch you, I promise!  
                        I won’t let go of it!

           EXT. ROCK - FLASHBACK

           YOUNG HILLARY is 12-years-old. Strapped into a harness. In 
           the middle of her first rock wall. A hundred feet up. 

           YOUNG NEIL is 14. Below on belay. As Hillary climbs, Neil 
           pulls the rope through her device, taking out the slack. 
           Young Hillary can’t go on. Her eyes scrunch shut.

                                 YOUNG HILLARY
                        I’m scared!

                                 YOUNG NEIL
                        There’s nothing to be scared of! 
                        Falling is good! Falling means 
                        learning and pushing your limits! 

           She looks up. It’s so high, it seems impossible from here.

                                 YOUNG NEIL
                        Don’t look down! Only up!

           And with that, Young Hillary reaches for the hold above. And 
           takes off. Climbing up the rock. She’s a natural. So strong. 
           The rope is taut. Young Neil watches with eagle eyes.  

           She climbs higher. And then she falls! She’s instantly yanked 
           up by the harness as Neil’s rope catches her. She swings.

                                 YOUNG NEIL
                        You did it! 

           And suddenly -- Hillary is laughing. The thrill of her life. 

                                 YOUNG NEIL
                        You’re a real climber now! 

           These words etch themselves into the wet cement of her soul. 
           She pumps her arms in victory. 

           THE CRY OF THE VULTURE!

                                                               BACK TO:
           HILLARY OPENS HER EYES. Nothing’s changed, but she’s calm 
           now. Hanging. Fingers slipping. And it’s all over. A smile of 
           surrender. And instead of being evicted...

           She lets go. Falling on her own terms. Falling through the 
           world again. Like the statue of a climber, gripping the wind. 

           This is when the rope would catch her. But the tug never 
           comes. Because there is no rope. There never was. Gray rock 
           blurs by. She closes her eyes and -- AND WHAMM!!! She lands 
           in someone’s arms.

           Her eyes snap open. IT’S ERNIE. Perched on the ledge. A 
           perfect smiling vision, like a comforting angel. 

           She looks at him. In total shock. Ernie’s smile washes over 
           her like medicine. He’s a hero. His dream has come true. 

           He pushes her towards to the crack. She latches on. 

           And then Ernie is just gone. Gratitude in her eyes. She even 
           manages a laugh. She kisses her lucky piton, and blasts off! 

           She climbs up to the final crack to the top. Home free. It 
           might as well be an elevator. The wind-swept slab drops away. 
           The summit comes into view. The top obscured by a sad blanket 
           of fog spilling down. Swallowing the rock. 

           The vulture is perched on the lip, blocking her way. One last 
           obstacle. Face to face. A long, intense stare down. We see 
           Hillary’s reflection in the bird’s obsidian eyes. And then --

           WOOOOSHHH!!! The vulture blasts off. Allowing her to pass. As 
           if she’s worthy of the top.

           EXT. SUMMIT - DAY

           Hillary pulls herself up to the summit. Four thousand feet 
           closer to heaven. Wrapped in fog.

           Screaming as she reaches the top. Falls to her knees. Sweaty 
           tears rolling down her face. Exhausted, gasping for breath.  
           Finally, she props herself up on one arm, and looks around. 

           FOG. That’s all. Just a bland choke of fog. Dead and gray. No 
           view from up here. The fog has swallowed the world. Even the 
           sounds of nature have been eaten alive.

           Hillary starts hacking. Climbs to her feet. Feeling her way 
           through the hungry shroud. And then she stops. Sees A FIGURE 
           standing before her. An outline of person. Coming into focus.

           IT’S JEN. Smiling. So warm and kind. She has all her fingers. 
           More people appear obscured behind her. Hillary isn’t afraid.

           IT’S MARK and PAUL and the CHINESE CLIMBER. They’re all 
           smiling. No fear. Everything is perfect.
           Others, too. Shadows lost in the fog. Centuries of forgotten 
           climbers. Many have tried and failed. They’re all here.

           Ernie summits from below. Joins them. A family again. And 
           then the last man comes through the fog. IT’S NEIL. Love in 
           his eyes. Hillary lights up with joy. He takes her hands. 

                                 NEIL
                        We’ll always be together.

           CLOSE on Hillary’s face. A smile breaks across it. So big it 
           tickles her ears. She’s finally free. Hillary and Neil 
           embrace and the fog devours them. The world is erased.

           INT. CAVE - NIGHT

           The leathery corpses of Neil and Hillary sitting side by 
           side. Hand in hand. Hillary’s head on Neil’s shoulder. 
           Arranged. They’ve been here for a few weeks now, and they’ve 
           begun to decay. But they’ll decay together. Together forever. 

           The vulture is perched at the mouth. Watching. The bird 
           spreads it’s giant black wings like the angel of death -- 
           WOOOOSHHH!!!! Takes off.

           And we fly with it. Flying over China as the sun starts to rise 
           and lights up the world. We fly further and further away from 
           Dìyù Shan until it’s nothing but a sad pebble on the horizon.
