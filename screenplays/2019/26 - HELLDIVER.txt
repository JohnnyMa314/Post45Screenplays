           OVER BLACK. 

           A long silence. We sit, waiting. No credit roll. 

           Alone in the dark, staring into the eternal abyss. Just long 
           enough to make our skin crawl, when:

           THE SCREAM OF A PASSING FIGHTER PLANE PIERCES THE DARKNESS. 

           THUMP-THUMP-THUMP. The eternal hammering of exploding 
           artillery shells rattle the ribs caging our anxious heart. 

           The Fighter Plane’s engine WHINES impossibly loud.

           The uproar of battle becomes a distant drum beat. 

           Serenity. Calm. Only for a moment.

                             TEXT: The Pacific Theatre, 1945.

                                                            SMASH OPEN:

           INT. COCKPIT - FIGHTER PLANE -- DAY

           We are high up in the clouds, looking out upon the endless 
           sea and sky. The plane lurches forward and - NOSE DIVES. 

           Descending into the chaos of war. Fighter Planes swarm an 
           AIRCRAFT CARRIER like locusts. 

           Dogfights rage on in the sky. We fly through mayhem. 

           Our speed intensifies with each passing second. 

           The Carrier unleashes a bevy of artillery. They EXPLODE a few 
           feet from the plane’s canopy, shaking us in our seat.

           We remain locked on. Bound for impact.

           The distance closes instantly.

           Soldiers scramble on deck, spotting the incoming fighter 
           plane. They race for cover. 

           Our engine crescendos into the HOWL of a dive bombing -

                                 SOLDIERS ON DECK
                        ZEKE! INCOMING! WATCH THAT ZERO! 
                        BREACH! TAKE COVER! BRACE FOR-- 

                                                              HARD CUT:
           EXT. OCEAN -- DAY

           Open endless ocean.

           As far as the eye can see. 

           The water peacefully laps across the side of an overturned 
           metal hull. WINGS. LANDING GEAR. ATTACHED BOMBS. 

           The underbelly of a plane. It floats a few feet above water. 

           A NOISE interrupts. Just barely there. A subtle...

           THUD. THUD. THUD. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER 

           Diving down we see - 

           The metal hull is revealed to be the bottom of a capsized: 

           CURTISS SB2C HELLDIVER. A U.S. Navy Two Seater Dive Bomber. 

           THUD. THUD. THUD. It’s coming from the - 

           INT. COCKPIT - HELLDIVER 

           The cockpit is FLOODED. 

           EDWARD MORETTI (26) drowns, trapped by his seat’s harness. 

           An American Pilot with one too many years at war and one too 
           many years of booze and cigarettes. 

           Edward screams. Air bubbles billow out of his mouth. He 
           desperately fumbles with the jammed harness release.

           Edward wrestles against the harness. THUD. THUD. CLICK. 

           It unlatches, freeing him. Instantly, he dives down -

           He gasps for air. Head at the bottom of the cockpit. Foot 
           pedals inches from his face. Remember - We’re capsized. 

           The water is only up to his waist, but RISING...

           WATER LINE - WAIST 

           Edward braces himself against the foot pedals and -

           STOMPS his feet against the canopy. 
           He KICKS with all his strength to no avail. 

           WATER LINE - CHEST

           He frantically reaches into his flight jacket and pulls the 
           M1911 PISTOL stowed there. 

           He dives down and presses the pistol against the canopy -

           BANG! The bullet punches a hole through the glass. The 
           surrounding glass remains intact. 

           Water instantly surges through...

           WATER LINE - FUCK 

           Edward resurfaces for air but - 

           There’s no more. He’s completely submerged. 

           He dives down and presses the pistol against the canopy -

           BANG! Fires another shot a foot from the first. The pistol 
           slips from his hand and clatters onto the canopy. 

           No time. Edward braces himself and STOMPS as hard as he can 
           between the two bullet holes. 

           A small CRACK appears. Another kick. The crack splinters 
           across the canopy. Kicks again. Desperate. Drowning.

           His strength slowly fades...

           EXT. OCEAN 

           The empty void between sea and sky. 

           Silent. Meditative. The calm lingers.

           Splash! Edward breaches. Choking for air. He stares out at 
           the open water. A realization cuts across his face.

           He dives down. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER

           Edward swims to the back of the Helldiver, right up to the -
           REAR GUNNER’S STATION 

           Where DAVID BONDELL (23), an American Gunner, drowns, eyes 
           wide with panic. Fully submerged. Flailing helplessly. 

           David’s foot has stomped through the canopy glass. He writhes 
           in agony as the glass tears into the muscle of his leg. 

           Edward uses his KNIFE to pry away the cockpit glass, allowing 
           David to pull his leg back into the Gunner’s Station. 

           David STOMPS. Smashing a bigger hole. 

           He slips through and joins Edward in open water. 

           EXT. OCEAN 

           The pair breach. Gasping. Breathless. 

           After a moment, Edward embraces David. Elated. 

           Both men stare out at the horror of open ocean over the 
           others shoulder. Their embrace tightens, quelling the fear 
           and weight of the situation.

           Deep breaths. In and out. Slower. In and out. Slow...

                                 EDWARD
                        It’s okay. We’ll get out of this. 

           Off in the distance: thick black PLUMES OF SMOKE rises. The 
           aftermath of a deadly air-sea battle. 

                                 DAVID
                        How? 

                                 EDWARD
                        Ain’t you the one who went to 
                        college? You tell me. 

           David spots the smoke in the distance. His face falls. A grim 
           mood befalls both men. 

                                 DAVID
                        Think anyone else made it?

                                 EDWARD
                        I hope so... 

           Edward quickly shakes the grief. No time for mourning. 
                                 EDWARD
                        C’mon. 

           Edward hoists himself onto the Helldiver’s - 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN 

           Edward pulls David out of the water onto the Helldiver’s 
           belly. He SCREAMS in pain. 

                                 EDWARD
                        What’s wrong? 

                                 DAVID
                        I’m fine, Eddy. Gimme a sec. 

           David COUGHS. Flecks of blood dot his hand. 

                                 EDWARD
                        David.

           David traces Edward’s gaze down to his gut. There’s a BULLET 
           HOLE in David’s jacket. Stained with blood. 

           Edward rushes to David and applies pressure on the wound. His 
           hands immediately wet with blood. 

                                 DAVID
                        Son of a bitch.

           David grins, amused. 

                                 DAVID
                        I blew that Zero out of the sky. 
                        Bastard still got me...    

           He goes into shock and topples over. 

                                 EDWARD
                        No. No. You’re going to be fine. 
                        Just hang on. Spotter Plane will 
                        see us any second.

           David looks to the distant smoke. 

                                 DAVID
                        They’re gone, Eddy. 
                        We’re on our own. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Don’t talk. 

           Edward spots another BULLET HOLE in David’s jacket.
                                 DAVID
                        What?

           David tries to sit up. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Nothing. Easy, Buddy. Just lay 
                        there. I’m gonna’ fix this. 

           David lays down, wheezing in and out. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Remember Henson? Son of a bitch got 
                        both his legs blown off and he’s on 
                        deck every morning wheelin’ around 
                        like a fuckin’ hot dog cart.  

           David coughs up blood as his body convulses.

                                 EDWARD
                        David! 

                                 DAVID
                        ...Eddy. 

           Edward realizes David is laughing not convulsing. 

                                 DAVID
                        You’re terrible at this. 

           A somber moment between the pair. 

           David pats a pocket on his jacket. Edward pulls a PACK OF 
           CIGARETTES from it. They’re wet and soggy.

                                 DAVID
                        Ah, shit... That’s all right. Just 
                        felt like a smoke, I guess.  

           David’s eyes well with tears. Terrified. 

                                 DAVID
                        It’s getting cold out.   

           Edward positions himself behind David. He gently wraps his 
           arms around him, trying to warm him. 

           They sit in silence as David’s breathing softens. 

                                 DAVID
                        Hey, Eddy...

                                 EDWARD
                        Yeah?
                                 DAVID
                        My wife. My kids. Tell them... Tell 
                        them I tried to get back. 

           A quiet beat. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Tell them yourself. 

           But David is gone. Eyes still open. 

           Edward holds David’s hand tightly. He covers his mouth, doing 
           his best to quell his rising emotions. 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN -- NIGHT

           The moon gently illuminates David’s pale face, frozen in a 
           peaceful rest. Edward tidies up David’s appearance, scrubbing 
           out stains of blood and oil from his jacket. 

           Satisfied, Edward pats David on the chest. 

           He pulls out a WATERLOGGED PHOTO OF A WOMAN and gazes 
           longingly at her. Yearning for her comfort. 

           SPLASH. Edward stands. He cautiously scans the ocean. 

           A small ripple pulses away and disappears...

           EXT. HOME - FLASHBACK -- DAY

           ...A BOOT splashes through a puddle. 

           A MAN approaches a house at the end of a dirt drive way. 

           INT. HOME - FLASHBACK -- DAY

           A quaint home. One of comfort, not excess. The front door 
           opens and Edward enters. He wears a day’s worth of hard work 
           on his oil-stained mechanic coveralls.

           He drifts to the fridge and pulls out a beer, expertly 
           opening it with his house key. He sips and smiles at - 

           The fridge. It’s decorated with PHOTOS OF EDWARD AND HIS 
           WIFE. Showcasing their budding love story. Happy as can be. 

           We see Edward’s Photo from the present.

           A CLATTER from deep in the house. 
           INT. NURSERY

           A simple nursery built with the utmost of hopes. 

           The walls are painted over with hand-drawn illustrations. A 
           deliberate effort to hide the home’s worn interior. 

           MIA (18) struggles with a pile of wooden crib pieces. There’s 
           an intelligence and grace to her. She’s 6 MONTHS PREGNANT. 

                                 MIA
                        Ugh. Why’d I even buy this stupid 
                        thing? Shit!

           She lets out a frustrated sigh. 

                                 EDWARD
                        I don’t think that’s very lady 
                        like. Especially for a pregnant 
                        girl. 

           Mia looks up to find Edward standing in the doorway with his 
           beer. She snaps back playfully:

                                 MIA
                        It’s your fault I got this bowling 
                        ball in my gut.  

           Edward smiles and sips his beer.

                                 EDWARD
                        I told you not to buy it. 

                                 MIA
                        I know. I know. It’s just...

           Mia lets it all come out. 

                                                         EDWARD
                                              Mia. Whoa.
                            MIA
           You told me not to get it and 
           I got it anyway. And now, 
           none of the pieces fit...

                            MIA
                                                         EDWARD
                                              Hey. Hey. It’s okay.
           ...And the ceiling fan is 
           making that stupid noise 
           again and I’m putting on 
           weight with the baby and...

           Edward kneels beside her. Kisses her. And with that, all of 
           Mia’s pent up crib-stress vanishes. 
                                 EDWARD
                        That ceiling fan’s always been like 
                        that. It’ll hold. Trust me.

           Edward looks up at the whirring CEILING FAN. 

           Mia looks into Edward’s eyes. Mesmerized. Everything is right 
           again and she knows it. 

                                 MIA
                        How did I get so lucky? 

                                 EDWARD
                        I ask myself the same question. You 
                        should see yourself in that dress 
                        with those “girls.”

           Edward looks down at Mia’s breasts. She swats him. 

                                 MIA
                        Eddy Moretti. 

                                 EDWARD
                        What? Pregnancy has its perks.

           Mia playfully tackles Edward to the ground. 

           They kiss. The passion swells and they claw at each others 
           clothes. A BUTTON pops off Mia’s blouse.

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN - PRESENT -- DAY

           A hand grips a METAL BUTTON. 

           It slowly carves into the Helldiver, scratching III to IIII. 

           Edward stares at the carving with haggard eyes. His skin now 
           a bright hue of red with a spattering of blisters.

           Four days have passed. Without food. Without water. 

           He stares out at the ocean’s horizon, squints. Something bobs 
           among the waves. A familiar shape - A BODY. What the hel- 

           Edward’s eyes widen in horror. He scans the surface of the 
           bare Helldiver, realizing: 

                                 EDWARD 
                        DAVIIIIIID!

           Edward leaps into the water and swims after him. 
           After some strokes, he pauses. Torn between his friend and 
           the safety of the Helldiver. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER

           From below we watch Edward wade in the water. 

           Trapped in indecision. After a moment, he swims for David’s 
           body. We linger on him a bit too long, when -

           A MASSIVE SILHOUETTE passes by. 

           Gone as quick as it came.

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Edward swims. Battling the strong ocean current. 

           Winded from the laborious effort, he pauses for a break and 
           turns, checking that the Helldiver is still there. 

           He sighs in relief at its sight. Thank God. 

           Edward swims the last stretch and comes up on David’s body. 
           He lays face down in the water. Edward flips him and -

           Cringes at the sight of DAVID’S BLOATED WHITE FACE. 

           Little FISH strip flesh from the corpse. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Get the fuck outta’ here! 

           Edward swats at the fish in outrage. 

           He fights the instinct to break down, then pushes David 
           forward as he swims towards the Helldiver. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER

           We watch Edward swim and push David’s body on the surface. 

           Unbeknown to Edward - David is MISSING A LEG. 

           Bits of rotten flesh rain down from the severed stump into 
           the murky abyss below...

           EXT. OCEAN

           Edward pauses to catch his breath. 
           He wades with David for a moment, until - 

           Something brushes against his leg out of sight. Not hard. But 
           just enough to cause alarm. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Whoa...

           Edward tenses. Anxious. He looks down into the water - 

           EXT. UNDERWATER (EDWARD POV) 

           Only the murky depths. 

           No sign of any lurking threat. 

           Just dark blue nothingness. 

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Edward rises to the surface. 

           But just a few yards behind him:

           A MASSIVE RIPPLE THROBS ON THE WATER’S SURFACE. 

           He turns and catches the last blip of pulsing water. 

           It’s hard for him to make out if it’s the ocean’s natural 
           motion or something more sinister. 

           He looks down into the water again -

           EXT. UNDERWATER (EDWARD POV)

           Once again, just blue endless ocean. 

           Edward spots a white ribbon of flesh in the water. 

           He traces it back up to David’s SEVERED STUMP. 

           EXT. OCEAN

           Edward comes up. Nervous. 

           Something did that. Something in the water. 

           He whips back and forth, frantic. 
           EXT. UNDERWATER

           Edward jerks around sporadically. 

           A clear disturbance on the water’s surface. 

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Edward scans the ocean’s surface when - 

           His eyes catch sight of something. 

           In the distance - THE HULL OF THE HELLDIVER. 

           It’s drifted farther away from Edward.  

           He swims after it. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER

           We watch from below as Edward and David’s silhouettes cut 
           across the ocean’s surface. The only movement for miles. 

           A stark contrast against the surrounding still waters. 

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Edward swims vigorously. Splashing everywhere. 

           A current pulls the Helldiver further away from him. The 
           distance expands swiftly. 

           Edward looks between David’s Body and the Helldiver.

                                 EDWARD
                        Sorry... 

           Edward yanks David’s DOGTAG and quickly removes the LIFE VEST 
           from the body. He pats David then swims off. 

           Edward swims with all he’s got. Closer. Closer. And...

           A HOLLOW THUD. His hand flush against the Helldiver’s Hull. 

           He catches his breath, both exhausted and relieved. 

           Edward turns back towards the ocean - David’s Body is gone. 

           He whips around - BUMPED by something unseen. 

           Alarmed. Edward dives down into the water -
           EXT. UNDERWATER (EDWARD POV)

           We fear the utter worst, waiting...

           And worse than that - we see nothing. 

           After a moment of tense searching, he relaxes.

           Then turns around to be face to face with - Here it comes. 

           A SEA TURTLE! Edward is taken by surprise. Spooked.

           He stares at it. Eyes lost in curious admiration. The wonder 
           fades and his eyes harden. He draws his KNIFE and -

           DRIVES it into the Turtle’s skull. CRUNCH. 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN -- NIGHT

           Edward sits in silence. Fresh turtle blood kisses his lips. 
           The carcass of the sea turtle lays before him, stripped of 
           meat. Edward stares at David’s life vest. The empty sight of 
           it is painful to look at. 

           A sigh. The depression. Hopelessness. 

           Edward hums. Peaceful. Fighting the wave of useless feelings. 
           It helps. Just barely. 

           He looks down at the Photo of Mia in his hands. Smiles. His 
           lips purse and out comes an unexpected sweet sound:

                                 EDWARD
                        When the lights go on again all 
                        over the world. And the boys are 
                        home again all over the world-

           EXT. OCEAN 

           We’re pressed tight against the side of the Helldiver. Just 
           out of Edward’s line of sight. 

           We watch him from an unknown POV: 

                                 EDWARD
                        -And rain or snow is all that may 
                        fall from the skies above-

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN 

           Edward stares out at the ocean. A GLIMMER catches his eye. 
           He fades off into a whisper.

                                 EDWARD
                        A kiss won’t mean “goodbye” but 
                        “hello to love.”

           His eyes fall upon a FRAGMENT OF A ZERO’S FIGHTER PLANE WING. 

           Japan’s RED SUN stares at him like an evil eye. 

           Edward’s melody is joined by orchestral instruments...

           INT. MIA’S PARENTS HOUSE - FLASHBACK -- NIGHT

           ...and takes on a more upbeat tone. Party music. 

           Mia adorns an elegant maternity dress while Edward looks out 
           of place in a cheap button-down. He’s a sore thumb in a room 
           full of affluent and educated people.

                                 EDWARD
                        No. C’mon, Mia. I knew this was a 
                        bad idea. Please. 

           Mia leads him towards the dance floor.

                                 MIA
                        It’s just one dance.

                                 EDWARD
                        I don’t dance. 

           Mia’s cute smile begs him on.

                                 MIA
                        Just try it. You might actually 
                        enjoy yourself. 

           Edward nervously watches Rich Couples dance with prowess. 

           He grabs a CHAMPAGNE GLASS from a SERVER. He downs it in a 
           single gulp and sets the empty glass back on the tray. 

                                 CHARLES (O.S.)
                        Mia?

           She turns to see CHARLES (28), a dapper and handsome 
           bachelor. The whiskey in him has spurred his unchecked ego. 

           He offers his hand to Mia. 

                                 CHARLES
                        A dance? Like old times. 
           Mia rejects his hand and stands between Charles and Edward. 

                                 MIA
                        What’re you doing here, Charles?

                                 CHARLES
                        I’m just asking for a dance. I 
                        don’t see a ring? 

           Charles smirks at Edward. 

                                 CHARLES
                        Work at the shop must be slow.

           Mia’s hand tightens around Edward’s arm. She can feel the 
           anger coursing through him. 

                                 MIA
                        Did my parents invite you? 

           Charles doesn’t say anything but we know she’s right. Mia 
           shakes her head, unbelievably annoyed. 

                                 MIA
                        Of course you can’t see that I’m 
                        happy now. Because you never saw 
                        how miserable I was with you. 

           Charles is taken aback. An anger brims. 

                                 CHARLES
                        Your parents convinced me to give 
                        you a second chance, even with the 
                        baby. But you know what? Maybe this 
                        fucking mutt does suit you wel- 

           Edward pounces on Charles in a flash. It’s no contest. He 
           pummels Charles’ face. Fist after fist. 

           PARTY GUESTS wrench Edward off. Only now does Edward notice 
           that the room has fallen silent. The music has stopped. 

           All eyes are on him. Mia stares at Edward in horror.

           Blood drips from his knuckles.

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN - PRESENT -- DAY

           A drop of blood plops into the ocean.

           Edward weakly cranes his head. A paleness in his sunburnt 
           skin. Dehydration and sickness has taken him. Blood drips 
           from his chapped and cracked lips. 
           He lurches for the side of the Helldiver. His face just a 
           foot from the water’s surface...

           EXT. UNDERWATER

           Something lurks below. It watches Edward’s distorted 
           silhouette as he VOMITS. 

           Chunks of noxious bile and turtle meat splash down at us. 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN

           Edward wipes his face. Still just a foot from the water’s 
           edge. He stares at his reflection: A shell of the man he was.

           Exhausted, his eyes flutter, fading off...

                                                                 BLACK.

           We sit in DARKNESS. 

           The SOUND OF WAVES lapping against the Helldiver. But then... 

           Another SOUND. A disturbance. Moving through the water. 

           Ever so slightly there. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER 

           We look up from far below. 

           The silhouette of the Helldiver on the ocean’s surface. 

           A MAN slowly paddles to the Helldiver. 

           He floats in a LIFE VEST and grabs handfuls of water to pull 
           himself closer and closer to the hull. 

           If it weren’t for the life vest, he’d drown. 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN

           An arm comes into view and grabs the wing of the Helldiver. 
           It’s covered by a familiar fabric. A Pilot’s Jumpsuit. 

           A second hand comes into view. It holds a KATANA. 

           The katana SCRAPES against the metal of the wing. 

           The mysterious intruder freezes. Doesn’t make a sound. 
           From his POV we can see Edward hunched over on the other side 
           of the Helldiver. He remains oblivious. 

           The man’s breathing is shallow. Quiet as can be. 

           He muscles himself up and we catch sight of the shoulder of 
           the Pilot’s Jacket, displaying - JAPAN’S RED SUN. 

           The Pilot slowly stands. His weight strains the frame enough 
           to cause a NOISE -  

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN -- CONTINUOUS

           Edward wakes. What was that? 

           No idea how much time has passed. He stares at his 
           reflection. Incoherent. 

           His brow furrows in confusion as a form materializes in the 
           reflection beside him. The faint image of a - KAMIKAZE PILOT. 

           The Kamikaze Pilot is sopping wet. He silently approaches in 
           the reflection. Drip. Drip. Drip. 

           A rage builds in Edward. His body tightens and his breath 
           increases. Adrenaline spikes his blood. He turns to see:

           HIRO UEDA (17)

           The Kamikaze Pilot. Leather flight cap atop his head. A WHITE 
           SCARF adorned across his neck. Scorched Pilot’s Jumpsuit. 

           Hiro halts his advance. He holds his katana at the ready. His 
           knuckles burn white against the handle.  

           He stares at Edward in silence. A standstill. 

           Edward removes his KNIFE from his pocket. Hiro watches him as 
           he takes a defensive stance. Ready for battle. 

           The soldiers vibrate with indecision. Fear pulls them back. 
           Yet hate pushes them forward. 

                                 EDWARD
                        You’re the Zero. 

           Edward steps forward. Hateful. 

                                 EDWARD
                        The bastard that killed David. 
           Hiro does not speak English. All spoken dialogue is in 
           Japanese and italicized. Subtitled.

           Hiro keeps the katana trained on Edward.

                                 EDWARD
                        You’re supposed to be dead. Like 
                        the rest of your friends. 

                                 HIRO
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        My death will find glory. 
                        Yours will not. 

           Hiro CHARGES and swings the katana -

           Edward narrowly PARRIES the strike. Hiro grunts in anger and 
           raises the sword high. Edward grabs the sea turtle carcass 
           and hoists it up in a defensive block -

           THWAP! The katana slams into the shell, wedged in. 

           Edward YANKS the shell. Left. Right. Jerking the katana and 
           Hiro with it, until they SEPARATE. 

           Hiro topples over as Edward slips and SLAMS his head against 
           the hull. The shell splashes into the ocean.

           EXT. UNDERWATER

           The turtle shell sinks... 

           Leaving a trail of blood and guts from the water’s surface 
           down into the murky abyss. 

           It’s dark and lonely here. Silent like outer space. 

           A SWIFT BLUR SNATCHES THE SHELL OUT OF NOWHERE!

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN 

           Edward flutters back to consciousness. He leaps to his feet, 
           knife at the ready. He turns to see:

           Hiro let out a WAR CRY and charge, sword raised -

           Edward parries the strike, knocking the katana away from his 
           vitals and SLICING across his leg.

           Edward LUNGES and DRIVES his knife into Hiro’s clavicle, 
           inciting a pained scream from the Kamikaze. 
           THEY TUMBLE INTO THE OCEAN... 

           EXT. UNDERWATER 

           The men wildly thrash in a cloud of red. 

           Battling for the upper hand. 

           A haze of blood spreads through the water. 

           IN THE DEPTHS

           Something watches them from down below. 

           A lingering gaze upon them...

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Hiro grips Edward tightly, forcing him into a headlock from 
           behind. His katana still in hand. 

           Edward wrestles against him, but Hiro’s grasp tightens. 

           The life squeezes out of Edward...

           EXT. UNDERWATER

           Edward’s hand is still wrapped around his knife.

           He STABS Hiro’s leg. Buries it. Wriggling it around for 
           maximum damage and pain. 

           Edward STABS back again. The knife catches on Hiro’s life 
           vest and SLICES it open. The vest deflates. 

           Hiro shoves Edward and knocks the knife from his hand. 

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Hiro writhes in pain and lunges for the Helldiver. 

           Edward dives after the knife...

           EXT. UNDERWATER (EDWARD POV)

           Down...    Down...   Down... 

           He reaches for a small blur - The knife. 
           Misses. The knife continues to sink, pulling Edward deeper 
           and deeper into darker waters. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER

           Edward dives after the knife. 

           Behind him, something slowly cuts through the water. 

           A faint SILHOUETTE passes by. 

           Edward remains oblivious. Focused on the knife. He stretches 
           for the blade. Almost there... 

           The silhouette returns. Closing in on Edward fast. 

           Edward GRABS the knife. He hangs in the depths for a moment. 
           A sixth sense warning him of an eerie presence. 

           The silhouette EXPANDS as it approaches, revealing its true 
           size - that of an oversized pick-up truck.

           We catch a brief glance of a MASSIVE GRAY FORM. It slinks 
           back into the dark waters just as:

           Edward turns to see - Nothing.

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Edward breaches. Choking for air. 

           Hiro hangs on the edge of the Helldiver. Frozen still. He 
           scans the water’s surface with frightened eyes. 

           Edward senses his fear. He looks out across the water, when:

           A DORSAL FIN breaches, passing between Edward and Hiro. 

           It dips below. Gone like an apparition. 

           Both men are motionless. Fear taking hold. 

           Hiro puts on the GOGGLES from his leather cap. 

           He stares down into the water - 

           EXT. UNDERWATER (HIRO POV)

           Nothing in all directions. 

           Just the RIBBONS OF BLOOD leaking from his body. 
           We stare out towards the edge of the clear water. 

           Holding there for a moment. Letting our imagination build a 
           knot in our stomach. 

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Hiro comes up for air. 

           Edward is a few feet beside him. He struggles to pull himself 
           onto the hull of the Helldiver. 

           He’s desperate. Moving fast. 

           A look of worry crosses Hiro’s face. He holds his katana at 
           arms length, defensively. 

           He peers back down. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER (HIRO POV)

           Endless ocean as far as the eye can see.  

           No sign of any beast. It’s gone. 

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Hiro comes up. Tense eyes on the water. 

           He eases and turns to the Helldiver. Bloody hands slapping 
           helplessly at the hull for a grip. Got one. 

           Edward painfully and eagerly hoists himself up. Almost out of 
           the water. In the homestretch towards safety.

           Hiro’s almost out but his fingers lose their grip. Slipping 
           ever so slightly. Slipping more. Shit. 

           He splashes back into the water. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER (HIRO POV)

           A quick look below, fearing the worst. 

           Nothing. We bob out of the water briefly, catching sight of -

           A DORSAL FIN. Out there in the distance. 

           But we’re back down in the water before we can process. 
           EXT. OCEAN 

           Hiro comes up. The fin is gone. 

           Edward watches Hiro stare out over the water, then claw a 
           grip onto the Helldiver in an attempt to muscle himself up. 

           The ocean is still. Tempting calm waters. 

           Edward readies his last reserve of strength to push himself 
           onto the hull before Hiro, when:

           A GREAT WHITE EXPLODES OUT OF THE WATER. GAPING 
           JAWS. GUMS FLARED. 22 FEET LONG. 4,000 POUNDS.  

           It SLAMS into the Helldiver. Jaws snapping inches from 
           Edward’s face. Edward crashes back into the water.

           He comes up instantly. Hands outstretched towards the sky, 
           screaming out in fear and is - YANKED UNDERWATER. 

           A mix of above water and underwater screams as the Shark 
           tears into Edward’s leg. Working her teeth like saw-blades.

           Hiro takes his chance, scrambling onto the hull of the 
           Helldiver. Watches helpless as Edward screams. 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN - HIRO

           Hiro turns around and covers his ears. 

           It fails to drown out Edward’s SCREAM. He can’t stand to hear 
           this man be torn to pieces. 

           EXT. OCEAN - EDWARD

           Edward is lifted and mashed against the Helldiver. 

           The BULGING WHITE EYES and GAPING MOUTH of the Shark emerge - 

           Getting a bigger bite of Edward’s leg. The impact of the 
           massive beast dips the Helldiver... 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN - HIRO

           ...knocking Hiro off balance.

           HURTLING HIM OVER THE EDGE! Terror crosses his face. 
           The katana slips from his grip and slides across the hull. It 
           catches on the rear wheel. 

           Hiro plummets into the water.

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Edward screams in agony. He STABS at the Shark with his knife 
           but misses. Narrowly out of reach. Twisted at an odd angle.

           Again and again. Miss. Miss. Still not close enough. 

           A HAND yanks the blade from Edward’s grip. Hiro. 

           He raises the knife high and SHINK! Buries the knife from tip 
           to heel into the Shark’s flesh.  

           In a flash, the Shark’s tail whips up out of the water, 
           spraying Edward and Hiro then - stillness. 

           The men cling to the side of the Helldiver. Whimpers and 
           labored breathing from the both of them. 

           Edward frantically attempts to hoist himself up. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER (HIRO POV)

           Hiro wildly scans the depths below.

           No sign of the Shark. We wait tensely...

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Hiro comes up.

           He watches as Edward struggles to squirm himself up and onto 
           the hull. He manages his upper half first. 

           Hiro cringes at the sight of Edward’s mangled leg - 

           Ribbons of human flesh dangle loosely. 

           75 FEET AWAY

           The DORSAL FIN rises from the water. 

           Silently approaching. Our men remain oblivious. 

           Edward loses a grip and slips back into the water. He looks 
           to Hiro and his eyes stretch in horror.
           Hiro doesn’t have to look back. He knows. His blood soaked 
           hands claw at the hull, searching for a grip. 

           50 FEET AWAY

           The DORSAL FIN comes in fast, upon them...

           Edward is almost on the hull. Hiro beside him. 

           Edward purposefully KICKS, sending a foot sailing into Hiro 
           and knocking him into the water. 

           Hiro lunges for the wing of the Helldiver. 

           Edward screams in pain and pulls himself out of the water. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER - SHARK POV

           We change directions. Now sending for the pair of dangling 
           feet on the Helldiver’s wing. 

           Coming in like a speeding bullet -

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Hiro pulls himself up at the last second. 

           EXT. AERIAL VIEW

           The Great White passes under the Helldiver.

           We catch its massive form slink into the depths. 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN 

           Both soldiers stare out at the water. 

           Edward then looks down at his SHREDDED LEG.

           He presses together two flaps of flesh so they don’t expose 
           his torn muscles. Shock masks his panic and pain. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Ah, man. Fuck! 

           He reaches for David’s life vest -

           A FLAP OF LEG MEAT dangles free as he stretches. He quickly 
           pushes the flesh back into place. 
           Edward shimmies to the life vest and grabs it.  

           He passes a venomous glare to -

           HIRO

           Who pays no attention. Eyes locked on the katana caught on 
           the Helldiver’s rear wheel. 

           EDWARD

           Quickly pulls free the straps from the life vest. 

           His shaking hands lift up his mangled leg over one of the 
           straps. He steels himself and ties it off -

                                 EDWARD
                        MOTHERFUCKER! 

           Edward screams in agony as the strap cinches tight. 

           He pulses in and out of consciousness.  

           HIRO

           Scans the surrounding waters. 

           He notes that the Helldiver’s tail and rear wheel are almost 
           level with the ocean, and thus whatever lurks in it. 

           He lays prone on his stomach and stretches his arm -

           The tips of his fingers tap the katana gently. A mistake here 
           and this sword disappears forever. 

           Hiro lunges and swipes the katana loose... 

           He catches it an inch above the water. 

           EDWARD

           Ties off his second strap around his leg. He screams in 
           excruciating pain. 

                                 EDWARD
                        OH GOD! 

           Edward VOMITS, then cranes his head up at: 
           Hiro. Standing a foot before him, katana in hand. It’s 
           unnerving just how young and baby-faced he is.

           They stare at each other hatefully. Tense. 

           Hiro steps forward and Edward defensively covers his wounded 
           leg with his hands. 

           Hiro brings his boot down on Edward’s hands. PRESSING DOWN 
           into Edward’s open faced leg wound. Lingering there...

           Edward SCREAMS like a banshee - 

           So much so that it disturbs the young Kamikaze. 

           He eases off of Edward’s leg then drags his katana 
           perpendicular across the hull of the Helldiver: 

           Divides one side for each soldier. 

           Both men slump over onto their backs, drained. 

           They look up at the blue sky...

           EXT. SKY -- DAY

           ...and we follow their gaze high up into the clouds. 

           Slowly, the DRONE of propellers fade in and - 

           An AERO-FLEET OF JAPANESE ZEROS materializes. 

           INT. COCKPIT - ZERO - FLASHBACK -- DAY

           Hiro sits in silence. Dressed in his pristine Pilot’s 
           Jumpsuit. Ready to fulfill his destiny and yet:

           He carries a growing anxiety on his face. In his blood.  

           A SMALL DOLL KEY CHAIN is tied to the Zero’s controls. 

                                 HIRO (V.O.)
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        Dear Mother, Father, Taku, and 
                        Yuki. Thank you for all that you 
                        have done in my life. I am on the 
                        eve of my final departure. I am 
                        proud to bring honor to my family 
                        and country.  

           He looks down through the cockpit glass as the first wave of 
           Zeros engage the Aircraft Carrier below.
                                 HIRO (V.O.)
                        Please do not cry for me. I go with 
                        my brothers in good spirit and will 
                        be waiting on the eternal road.

           Hiro turns to his side at the aero-fleet of awaiting Zeros 
           and young anxious faces. 

                                 HIRO (V.O.)
                        I know you are in pain Mother. Do 
                        not blame Father for my death. The 
                        love between two should outlast 
                        their children. It was known before 
                        me. I pray that it will be known 
                        after me. 

           The Zeros begin their descent. Hiro lingers.  

                                 HIRO (V.O.)
                        Taku, Yuki, take care of Mother and 
                        Father. I must go now. Goodbye. 

           He takes a deep breath in, terror on his face. And DIPS the 
           plane towards the raging battle. 

           The Small Doll Key Chain RATTLES violently...

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN - PRESENT -- NIGHT

           ...Hiro looks down at the Small Doll Key Chain. 

           He lets out a sigh and clutches it tightly in his hand. 

           Hiro spots Edward watching him and quickly tucks the doll 
           into his jacket. Violated by his enemy’s gaze.

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN -- NIGHT

           Edward investigates his wounded leg. Every movement is 
           accompanied by splitting pain. 

           He covers his mouth and nose as the noxious stench of rotting 
           flesh invades his senses. 

           Edward notices that his boot is closer to the water’s edge 
           than before. His face falls, realizing:

                                 EDWARD
                        We’re sinking.

           He painfully shimmies up to a higher position on the hull 
           when he catches sight of a...
           DORSAL FIN. Gliding through the water. 

           The massive head slinks by. BLACK EYES reflecting against the 
           moonlight. Staring right at Edward. 

           Edward turns to Hiro. Both men filled with worry. 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN -- DAY

           SUNGLASSES BEING SNAPPED IN HALF. 

           Edward weakly works the wire frame. Twist. Bend. Repeat. 

           He’s been at this for some time now when - 

           SNAP. Victory. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A MAKESHIFT FISH HOOK IN EDWARD’S PALM.

           He pulls a line of thread from his jacket as fishing line and 
           ties it to the hook. 

           He sits there thinking for a long beat when -

           A twisted smile spreads across his face. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EDWARD BITES DOWN ON HIS JACKET.

           We reverse to reveal: He’s holding the fish hook above the 
           rotten tissue of his shredded leg. 

           Edward huffs nervously, then bites down HARD. 

           Threading the hook into his flesh... 

           He bellows out, the veins in his face primed to pop. 

           HIRO

           Watches as Edward cringes against the pain and -

           RIPS LOOSE a piece of rotting flesh. 

                                 HIRO
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        No fish wants to eat that. 
           EDWARD

           Ignores Hiro. Laughs, unhinged. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Come here little fishy... 

           He dips his BAITED FISH HOOK into the water.

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN -- DAY

           A SMALL FISH SLAPS against the hull. 

           Edward grins at Hiro in victory. Tears into his prize. 

           Hiro stares at the fish, stomach aching. His eyes are fixated 
           on Edward’s teeth as they rip into the juicy meat. 

                                 HIRO
                        (Japanese, subtitled)
                        Hey... Yankee... Give me some. 

           Edward talks with his mouth full:

                                 EDWARD
                        What was that? 

                                 HIRO
                        Give me some.

           Edward taunts, puts a hand to his ear. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Sorry. Didn’t catch that.
                        Could you speak up?  

           Hiro boils. 

                                 HIRO
                        Maybe I just kill you and take it. 

                                 EDWARD
                        I always thought the Japs were 
                        crazy for eating this shit raw. 
                        Y’know what? It’s not half bad.

           Hiro stands, approaches. Katana in hand. 

           Edward points at the ETCHED DIVIDER. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Whoa-whoa-whoa. Easy, man. 
           Hiro looks down at the line, then walks right past it.

                                 EDWARD
                        Stay on your side! That’s the rule! 

           Edward shimmies away, defenseless. He takes one final bite of 
           fish and HEAVES it into the ocean. 

                                 HIRO
                        Stupid American! 

           Hiro grabs Edward by the throat, choking him. Edward SPITS 
           fish in Hiro’s face. Hiro raises the katana in anger. 

                                 EDWARD
                        C’mon! Do it! You fuckin’ savages 
                        killed my friends! What’s one more! 

           The katana hangs in the air. Hiro can’t will himself to kill 
           him. His eyes never leave Edward.  

                                 EDWARD
                        WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?! 

           Hiro lowers his katana. He yanks the FISH HOOK and LINE from 
           Edward’s hand. Takes it for himself.

                                 EDWARD
                        We’re dead anyway. This piece of 
                        shit is sinking. 

           Edward motions at the sinking plane.

                                 EDWARD
                        Look around you! We’re fucked. 

           Hiro gauges the change in water level. Understands.

           Hiro greedily eats the chunks of fish Edward spit out. He 
           saves a piece and sticks it on the hook. 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN -- NIGHT

           Hiro dozes in and out of sleep. 

           The fishing line is tied snug around his wrist. The line 
           gently tugs, bobbing in the water...

           Hiro wakes with a start. Eyes wide with hope. He quickly 
           pulls up the fishing line. Fights it for a moment. 

           The line comes up and - NOTHING. 
                                 EDWARD
                        Thought you were supposed to be 
                        good at this? 

           Hiro puts a hand to his ear. A callback to Edward’s taunt.  

                                 HIRO
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        Speak up. 

           Edward glares at Hiro. Har-har. Edward readies to speak when 
           a RAIN DROP plops on his face. Silences him. 

           The pair look up at the sky. Hopeful. After a moment of eager 
           waiting, the sky drains. Raining down on them. 

           Edward opens his mouth, desperately sipping from the sky. 

           Hiro takes his leather flight cap and COLLECTS WATER. 

           INT. JAPANESE CLASSROOM - FLASHBACK -- DAY

           Rain pelts the classroom windows. 

           The room bustles with JAPANESE TEENS dressed in monochrome 
           uniforms. Everyone is happy and carefree. 

           At the back of the classroom we find Hiro and AYUKO (17). 
           Quirky. Shy. And beautiful to Hiro in the best way. A 
           friendship that wishes to be more. 

                                 AYUKO
                        C’mon. Open it. 

           Hiro holds a LETTER. Nervous. 

                                 HIRO
                        I don’t know. I should wait until 
                        I’m with my parents. 

           Ayuko nudges Hiro playfully.

                                 AYUKO
                        Don’t be such a baby. 

                                 HIRO
                        You got into college. You don’t 
                        have to worry anymore. 

                                 AYUKO
                        It’ll be fine. Here, she can help 
                        with good luck. 
           Ayuko removes a SMALL DOLL KEY CHAIN from her backpack and 
           gives it to Hiro. Same key chain from Hiro’s Zero. 

                                 HIRO
                        I hate this thing. Creeps me out. 

                                 AYUKO
                        Just open it! 

           Hiro smiles. He begins to open the envelope when - 

           It’s snatched out of his hands. REN (17), an obnoxious jock, 
           prances around as Hiro chases him.

                                 REN
                        The betting starts at five-hundred 
                        yen! Will Hiro be accepted? Or 
                        rejected once again?

                                 HIRO
                        GIVE IT BACK! 

           Ren holds the letter just out of Hiro’s reach. He opens the 
           letter and reads. His amusement fizzles. 

                                 REN
                        Another rejection letter. Big 
                        surprise there. 

                                 HIRO
                        Asshole...

           Ren tosses the rejection letter at Hiro. His attention is 
           pulled towards a gaggle of classmates around a desk. 

           Hiro sees that Ayuko has also joined this group. Hiro walks 
           over to see what the fuss is about. 

                      GIRL STUDENT #1
                                                    MALE STUDENT #1 
           They’re so handsome!
                                              What a badass.

           Everyone stares in awe at a PHOTO of a KAMIKAZE UNIT. 
           Handsome. Strong. And armed with the brightest smile. 

                            REN
           What an honor.
                                                     GIRL STUDENT #2
                                              You’d be lucky to be chosen.

           Girl Student #2 hands the photo to Ayuko. She stares at the 
           Kamikaze Unit with admiration. 

                                 GIRL STUDENT #2
                        This was taken before my brother’s 
                        last mission. 
                                 AYUKO
                        The bravery it takes...

           Hiro is taken aback by Ayuko’s comment. He steps away from 
           the group. An outcast. Alone.

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN - PRESENT -- DAY

           A fishing line bobs in the water. 

           It’s hoisted up to reveal a FISH at the end of it. 

           Edward smiles at his catch. A new makeshift fish hook and 
           line in hand. He looks over at Hiro and weakly grins. 

           Hiro turns to his empty fish line, then back at Edward’s 
           tasty catch. His aching stomach sounds. 

                                 HIRO
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        How about a trade, Yankee? 

           Edward looks at Hiro, confused. 

           Hiro holds up his leather cap filled with water, then points 
           at Edward’s fish. 

                                 EDWARD
                        ...Water for fish? 

           Edward holds up his fish. Hiro nods. 

                                 HIRO
                        A trade. 

           Edward thinks on it, then:

                                 EDWARD
                        Look at this bad boy. A fish like 
                        this in the market would set you 
                        back. And if you tossed it into a 
                        cioppino. Mmm. 

           Hiro is lost. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Not happening. 

           Edward shakes his head. Hiro scoffs. 

                                 HIRO
                        You need water more than fish! 
                                 EDWARD
                        Look, kid. I - need - water. 

           Edward points at the Leather Cap. 

                                 EDWARD
                        You - need - fish. 

           Edward points at the fish. Hiro listens intently, deciphering 
           as best he can. 

                                 EDWARD
                        We gotta play this smart. We need 
                        food AND water to survive out here. 

           Hiro stares, piecing together Edward’s proposal. 

                                 HIRO
                        Half. 

                                 EDWARD
                        What? Look I don’t-

                                 HIRO
                        Half!

           Hiro points at the ETCHED DIVIDER. 

                                 EDWARD
                        What am I supposed to get from-

           Edward realizes. 

                                 EDWARD
                        You mean half? Splitting it? That’s 
                        what I was gettin’ at. 

           Hiro and Edward half-smile. Message received. 

           Edward TEARS the fish with his teeth into two halves. Hiro 
           holds his cap of water. They come in close.

           Both men lock cautious eyes on the other, eagerly expecting a 
           betrayal. A swift swap of hands. 

           Trade complete. The men nod gratefully at the other and look 
           down upon their bounty. Excited for once. 

           Edward sips from the helmet graciously. Savors every drop. 

           Hiro sinks his teeth into the fish... 
           INT. HIRO’S HOME - FLASHBACK -- NIGHT

           ...and graciously eats. Hiro cringes at the taste. He quietly 
           spits it into his napkin and tucks it away. 

           We’re in a traditional Japanese dining room. War time has 
           stripped it down to the bare necessities. A KATANA rests on 
           an exquisite sword stand at the focal point of the room. A 
           quiet reminder of the fortune and honor that once was. 

           Hiro eats dinner with his family. Small rations of rice and 
           questionable pieces of “fresh” fish. He watches as -

           NOBUYA (58), Hiro’s father, passionately converses with his 
           two older brothers, TAKU (25) and YUKI (24). The two brothers 
           proudly don their Army Uniforms. Nobuya claps at them. 

                                 TAKU
                        To Japan!

           KANA (56), Hiro’s mother, passes Hiro a sympathetic look. 
           Listening to this conversation pains her.

                                 YUKI
                        The Americans will never touch our 
                        soil! 

           Taku and Yuki cheers their sake cups and drink.

                                 NOBUYA
                        A life in service to country is a 
                        life lived with purpose. It’s still 
                        my greatest honor. 

           Nobuya bows to Taku and Yuki. They bow in return. 

                                 NOBUYA
                        Maybe the two of you could talk 
                        some sense into your brother? 

           Yuki pats Hiro on the back. 

                                 YUKI
                        He’ll find his way soon. 

                                 TAKU
                        You know you’re named after the 
                        Emperor, right? 

                                 NOBUYA
                        I named the wrong boy. 

           Yuki and Taku giggle. Kana nudges Nobuya. 
                                 NOBUYA
                        What?

           Hiro stares down at his place. 

                                 KANA
                        Hiro? You haven’t touched your 
                        plate. What’s wrong? 

           Hiro keeps his head down.

                                 NOBUYA
                        If you won’t answer her. Answer me. 

           Hiro obediently raises his head and bows. He keeps his head 
           bowed down in shame. 

                                 HIRO
                        ...I got another rejection, sir. 

           Nobuya stares at Hiro in disbelief.

                                 KANA
                        Nobuya... We have our son. That 
                        should be enough.

           Nobuya grabs Hiro and SLAPS him across the face.

                                 NOBUYA
                        Should it?! 

                                 KANA
                        Nobuya! 

                                 NOBUYA
                        I’ve held my suspicions long 
                        enough!

           He glares down at his submissive son and points:

                                 NOBUYA
                        He only wanted to go to college to 
                        escape enlisting!

           Hiro looks to his brothers for help. They turn away with 
           disgust. Hiro is alone. Nobuya readies to hit Hiro, when -

           Kana throws herself in front of Nobuya. He stares at Kana in 
           disbelief. Her eyes beg him on. Hit me. I dare you. 

           Nobuya looks down at Hiro. 

                                 NOBUYA
                        You coward... 
           Nobuya storms out of the room. Yuki and Taku follow. 

           Hiro and Kana hug tightly... 

           INT. HIRO’S HOME - FLASHBACK -- NIGHT

           ...Hiro and Kana pull away from a hug. Different clothes. 
           Weeks later. They stand in the Genkan. A Japanese Foyer. 

           They stare at one another in silence. Hiro is different 
           though. Cold. Distant. 

                                 KANA
                        Don’t listen to your father.

                                 HIRO
                        The Emperor needs me. I’m no use to 
                        Japan here. 

                                 KANA
                        Those aren’t your words.

           Kana searches Hiro’s eyes for any sign of remorse. She finds 
           none. His mind is made. 

                                 HIRO
                        Tell Father I will make him proud. 

           Hiro turns to the sliding door. 

                                 KANA
                        Wait...

           Kana hurries into the house. She returns with the KATANA and 
           presents it to Hiro. Bowing and offering. 

                                 HIRO
                        What about Father? 

                                 KANA
                        It’s not his to give. It was my 
                        Father’s. And he would be proud of 
                        the man you already are.  

           Hiro takes the katana.

                                 KANA
                        You’re much more than the emperor’s 
                        hand grenade...
           EXT. HULL, OCEAN - PRESENT -- DAY

           Hiro’s eyes slowly crack open. 

           His POV is blurred, adjusting to the sun’s harsh rays. The 
           horizon clears and we see - 

           A TINY SPECK in the distance. 

           Hiro taps Edward, who sleeps beside him. They look out, 
           squinting, trying to make out the distant object. 

           The form materializes - it’s a YELLOW RAFT. 

                                 EDWARD
                        That’s gotta’ be one of us. 

           Edward stares out elated. Hiro not so much. 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN -- LATER

           The raft is closer. 

           Edward waves his hands in the air with excitement. As the 
           raft approaches, he recognizes the shape of a MAN onboard. 

           The Man sits upright, his back leaning on the raft. 

           Edward takes off his shirt, waves it and proudly bellows out:

                                 EDWARD
                        Stand, Navy, out to sea. Fight our 
                        battle cry. We’ll never change our 
                        course, so vicious foe steer shy-y.

           Hiro’s grip on the katana tightens. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Roll out the TNT, Anchors Aweigh. 
                        Sail on to victory and-

           Edward smiles at Hiro, pats him like a friend. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Sink their bones to Davy Jones...

           Edward’s enthusiasm fades.  

           CLOSE ON RAFT

           An eerie silence as the raft bobs past the hull. 
           The Man, young and dressed much like Edward, sits motionless. 

           His head hangs at an obscure angle. A BULLET HOLE punched 
           through the side of his temple.

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN 

           Hiro’s grip on his katana eases. 

           They watch the raft drift past, dejected. 

           CLOSE ON EDWARD

           A realization cuts across Edward’s face. He goes from 
           disheartened to determined in one look. 

                                 EDWARD
                        We need that raft. 

           Edward points. 

                                 EDWARD
                        There’s gotta’ be somethin’ 
                        onboard. Rations. A flare. We got a 
                        better shot on that than the 
                        Helldiver. 

           Edward hesitates, knows what he’s about to ask. 

                                 EDWARD
                        I would but-

           Looks down at his leg. Hiro notes this. 

                                 EDWARD
                        It has to be you. 

           Hiro looks to the raft then to Edward, interprets his plea. 
           Shakes his head - “No.”  

                                 EDWARD
                        It’s right there! 

           Edward grabs Hiro. 

                                 EDWARD
                        We’re sinking. This plane won’t be 
                        here forever. And then what? 

                                 HIRO
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        Get your hands off me...
           Hiro glares at Edward’s hands, but Edward doesn’t move. 

                                 HIRO
                        Now.

                                 EDWARD
                        You got a better plan?

           Hiro SWATS Edward’s arms, knocks him down. 

                                 HIRO
                        I can’t swim! 

           Hiro is angered and embarrassed by this fact. 

           But all Edward sees and understands is his angry intonation, 
           and it doesn’t sit well. 

                                 EDWARD
                        You lazy fuck...

           He LUNGES for Hiro and knocks him over. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER

           Hiro crashes into the ocean. 

           His legs kick erratically, striving to stay afloat. 

           An aphrodisiac to any predators lurking below. 

           EXT. OCEAN

           Hiro fails to wade the water calmly, his hands desperately 
           slap at the hull. Fear all over his face. 

           He’s useless without a life vest. 

                                 HIRO
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        I can’t swim! 

           Edward points at the raft. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Quit messin’ around and get your 
                        ass over there! 

                                 HIRO
                        I can’t swim! 
           Hiro claws at the hull, but every time his hand catches a 
           grip, Edward slaps it away. 

                                 EDWARD
                        It’s floating away! Don’t wait for 
                        the shark to get here!

                                 HIRO
                        I can’t- 

           Hiro dips under briefly and comes back up choking for air. 

                                 HIRO
                        Please- Help-

           Edward watches confused, then realizes what he’s done. He 
           outstretches his hand to Hiro - 

                                 EDWARD
                        It was an honest misunderstanding. 
                        Sorry. I- I didn’t know. 

           Hiro SLAPS Edward’s hand away and finally latches onto the 
           hull. He shimmies himself up on his own. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER -- LATER

           Edward slides into the water. 

           His legs undulate calmly, keeping him afloat. 

           A small ribbon of blood leaks from his leg. 

           EXT. OCEAN

           Edward wears his life vest and nods at Hiro. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Dead if we don’t try, right? Whose 
                        stupid idea was that.  

           He turns towards the raft.   

                                 HIRO
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        Wait... 

           Edward looks back. Hiro reluctantly offers him the katana. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Whoa. 
           Edward grins as soon as it trades hands. He holds it up 
           playfully. A kid with a new toy. 

           He catches Hiro’s concerned look, then playfully bows. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Relax. I’ll take good care of her. 

           Edward breast strokes towards the raft. 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN 

           Hiro watches from the safety of the hull. 

           He scans the water’s surface for any disturbances. 

           All clear for now. 

           EXT. OCEAN

           The raft is in line and in sight. 

           Edward approaches with each stroke. 

           A large swell dips him -

           UNDERWATER

           Ever so briefly. 

           A split-second glimpse of a TAIL FIN. 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN 

           Hiro surveys from his vantage point. Nothing. 

           He notices that Edward has stopped swimming, when he hears:

           A DISTANT DRONE. APPROACHING. 

           EXT. OCEAN

           Edward searches the sky. Hears a distant plane engine. 

           There it is! A tiny spot on the horizon. 

                                 HIRO (O.S.)
                        YANKEE! WATCH OUT! 
           Edward whips around. Doesn’t see anything. 

                                 HIRO (O.S.)
                        OVER THERE! 

           Edward turns again. Fuck. He spots the DORSAL FIN a mere 
           hundred feet away. It circles him... 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN 

           Hiro watches Edward nervously. 

           He turns towards the plane - It’s closer. 

                                 HIRO
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        It’s coming this way! 

           EXT. OCEAN

           Edward keeps his eyes on the Dorsal Fin.

           In the background, he spots the APPROACHING PLANE. 

           There’s no way out of this. 

           EXT. AERIAL VIEW

           Edward is dead center between the raft and Helldiver. 

           Fifty-fifty odds. Either way. 

           EXT. OCEAN

           Edward watches the Dorsal Fin. 

           He braces himself for what’s to come, then...

           SWIMS FOR HIS FUCKING LIFE. 

           THE DORSAL FIN

           Slices through the water. Full tilt. 

           Trailing after Edward. 
           EDWARD

           Grimaces against the pain of his tattered leg.

           He’s almost to the raft. The Great White not far behind. 

           Edward makes contact with the raft. He tosses the katana in 
           and hoists himself up. 

           That DORSAL FIN, oh so close...

           EXT. RAFT

           Edward collapses into the raft. He covers his head crumpled 
           in the fetal position and screams.

           So sure he’s dead. Heart in overdrive. Expecting the 
           behemoth's massive jaws to rip him in two. 

           Just a slight nudge as the Shark passes beneath the raft. 

           We’re pressed tight against Edward’s fearful face. He hears 
           the hum of the passing airplane. 

           Edward sits up in the raft. Remembers his mission. 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN 

           Hiro shouts as loud as he can. 

                                 HIRO
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        HEY! OVER HERE!

           Waves his hands in the air, desperate to flag down the 
           SPOTTER PLANE. His heart praying to be seen. 

           It’s about to pass them... 

           EXT. RAFT

           Edward looks across to see - TWO BODIES. 

           Our head-shot suicide. Propped upright against the raft. His 
           brains decorating his lap. And the withered remains of a NAVY 
           OFFICER curled in the corner of the raft. 

           Edward ignores them and scrambles to collect what he can:

           A HANDFUL OF FISH HOOKS AND LINE. A SIGNAL MIRROR. A PATCH 
           KIT. A WATERPROOF MATCH CONTAINER.
           He spots a FLARE GUN in the hands of the Navy Officer. He 
           pries it free and points up at the sky: 

                                 EDWARD
                        C’mon... 

           CLICK. CLICK-CLICK. 

           The hope leaves Edward’s face. He watches the SPOTTER PLANE 
           disappear among the clouds. 

                                 NAVAL OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Come back... Come back... 

           The Naval Officer. Still half-alive. Hangs over the edge of 
           the raft and reaches out for the plane, when - 

           THE JAWS OF THE GREAT WHITE EXPLODE FROM THE WATER AND SNAP 
           DOWN ON THE NAVAL OFFICER AND RAFT!

           Ribs splinter. Intestines spill. 

                                 NAVAL OFFICER
                        HELP! PLEASE! HE-

           A gut-wrenching CRACK! 

           Air whooshes out and the raft takes on water. The raft 
           quickly folds inward and ensnares Edward. 

           The Great White drags the raft below the surface...

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN 

           Hiro watches. Helpless. 

           The beast’s whipping tail fin disappears into the water.

           EXT. UNDERWATER (EDWARD POV)

           A tight mess of yellow canvas traps Edward. 

           He thrashes wildly, desperately trying to break free. A man 
           saran-wrapped in a yellow tomb. 

           Edward wriggles against the canvas, goes for an opening.  

           The Great White lunges from the darkness, JAWS SNAPPING -

           Edward retreats into the folds of the raft’s canvas. The 
           Great White follows and buries its head in the raft. 
           Our line of sight locks in on the katana.  

           Edward grabs it and PIERCES the raft.

           EXT. UNDERWATER

           Edward squirms through the raft like a birthed newborn. 

           He swims for the shadow of the Helldiver up above. 

           The Great White remains trapped in the raft. 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN -- DAY

           Hiro scans the water’s surface. 

           After a long moment - the hope fades.

           SPLASH! Edward comes up FIFTY FEET away from the Helldiver. 

           The Great White could be lurking anywhere. Moments from an 
           attack at any second. 

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Edward swims. TEN FEET from the Helldiver. 

           Hiro reaches out for him, waiting for his arrival. 

           The DORSAL FIN emerges FIFTEEN FEET behind Edward. 

           The Monster’s GAPING JAWS only FIVE FEET behind. 

           Edward outstretches his arm. 

           The katana extends his wingspan.

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN

           Hiro looks at the katana. Utterly torn. Fuck me. 

           He has to grab the blade to save Edward. Hiro grimaces.

           The Shark is almost upon Edward. 

           HIRO WRAPS HIS HANDS AROUND THE KATANA’S BLADE. 

           Gripping tight. The blade sinks into the meat of his hands. 

           Hiro bellows out in agony, pulling in Edward. 
           He hoists him onto the hull just as: 

           THE GREAT WHITE’S JAWS SLAM INTO THE HELLDIVER!

           The pair collapse onto the hull. 

           HIRO

           Painfully grabs the katana by the handle and...

           STABS into the Shark’s SNAPPING JAWS! 

           The Shark retreats underwater. Sprays the men with a geyser 
           of water and vanishes. 

           It takes a moment for the shock and adrenaline to fade. 

                                 EDWARD
                        You saved me?

           Hiro looks down at his SLICED PALMS. 

                                 HIRO
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        I’m no good at catching fish. 

           Edward reaches into his pocket and proudly presents: Match 
           container. Patch kit. Signal mirror. Fish hooks and line.

           He smiles at Hiro, then lays down and closes his eyes. 

           Water sloshes against the side of the Helldiver...

           INT. TRUCK - FLASHBACK -- NIGHT

           ...The windshield wiper clears away the falling rain. 

           It’s the night of the party. Edward drives behind a truck on 
           a dark country road. Mia sits in the passenger seat. She 
           looks over Edward, worried. 

                                 MIA
                        You sure you’re okay to drive? 

                                 EDWARD
                        We’re almost home, ain’t we. 

           Awkward tension boils beneath the surface. A long beat. 

                                 MIA
                        You going to talk? Or am I going to 
                        have to pull it out of you. 
                                 EDWARD
                        What do you want me to say? 

           Mia gets angry, blurts out:

                                 MIA
                        You always do this! Talk to me, 
                        Eddy. Anything! 

                                 EDWARD
                        I am! I am! 

                                 MIA
                        No, you’re not! You’re just fucking 
                        sitting there. 

           Edward keeps his eyes on the road. Never turns to face Mia. 

                                 EDWARD
                        I’m... I’m getting us home! 

                                 MIA
                        What happened in there? 

           Edward falls silent. 

                                 MIA
                        God damn it, Eddy. 

                                 EDWARD
                        What?! 

                                 MIA
                        I need an answer from you!

           Edward is silent. Mia watches as his eyes well with tears. He 
           wipes them and keeps his eyes on the road. 

                                 EDWARD
                        I can’t give you what he can... 

           Mia puts her hand in Edward’s lap. Edward tightly squeezes 
           her hand and faces her. 

                                 MIA
                        ...No. You’ll give me something 
                        better. 

           With that, all of Edward’s fears and insecurities vanish. He 
           smiles and admires the sight of Mia and her pregnant belly.

           Taking the moment in, when: Mia instinctively braces. Hands 
           wrapping around her belly protectively. 
                                 MIA
                        EDDY!

           Edward has drifted into the oncoming lane - 

           BLINDING HEADLIGHTS speed right towards them...

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN - PRESENT -- DAY

           ...materializing into the hot radiating sun.

           Edward howls in pain as Hiro STITCHES the torn flesh and 
           muscle back together with fish hooks and line. Edward stares 
           longingly at the PHOTO OF MIA. Grunting through the pain. 

           Hiro ties off the final knot and covers the wound with GLUE 
           from the patch kit. He removes his WHITE SCARF and ties it 
           around Edward’s leg. It’s not a clean job but it’ll do. 

           Edward catches Hiro’s gaze on Mia’s photo.

                                 HIRO
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        She’s beautiful. 

           Edward offers the photo. Hiro stares at it. A reminder of a 
           life he’s “honorably” forfeited. 

                                 EDWARD
                        What about you, huh? You got an old 
                        lady back home? 

           Edward points at Mia. 

                                 EDWARD
                        A woman? 

           Hiro grins at the thought.

                                 HIRO
                        I wish... 

           His boyish attitude brings to question: 

                                 EDWARD
                        How old are you? 

           Edward thinks of a way to communicate. He points to himself, 
           then holds up with his fingers. Ten. Ten. Six. 

                                 EDWARD
                        I’m twenty-six. You?
           Hiro signals. Ten. Seven. 

                                 HIRO
                        Seventeen. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Jesus Christ. I guess we are 
                        winning this war.

           Edward stares at Hiro with a new-found innocence.  

                                 EDWARD
                        You don’t even know what it’s like 
                        to be with a woman, do you? 

           Hiro doesn’t understand. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Tell you what, after we win this 
                        thing I will personally see to it 
                        that Emperor Tojo gives you - The. 
                        Most. Honorable hummer.

           Edward makes a “blowjob motion.”  

                                 EDWARD
                        All. Night. Long. 

           Hiro looks confused and disgusted. 

           Edward cracks up, prompting Hiro to chuckle. They share in 
           laughter, forgetting just how fucked they are. 

           Hiro stares out at the ocean. Eyes lost somewhere else. 

           Edward continues to laugh...

           INT. NAVY BARRACK - FLASHBACK -- DAY

           ...and is overshadowed by the laughs of Pilot Trainees. 

           Hiro lays on his dirty cot. Dressed in a Pilot’s Jumpsuit. 
           He’s surrounded by rows of bunkbeds and Pilot Trainees. 

           They kill time. Cards. Conversation. Writing letters.

                                 PILOT TRAINEE
                        They summoned us to the hall. 

           The room falls silent. There’s a weight and understanding to 
           the Pilot Trainee’s statement. 
                                 HIRO
                        Everyone?

           The Pilot Trainee nods. 

           Hushed whispers and worried glances pass among some of the 
           Trainees. Others embrace proudly.  

           Hiro does neither. Lost. 

           INT. NAVY HALL

           Hiro and the Pilot Trainees pack tightly into a room. 

           Movement stirs at the front. Hiro stretches to look over the 
           taller trainees and sees - A GROUP OF HIGH RANKING OFFICERS. 

                                 LEAD OFFICER
                        Formation! 

           The Pilot Trainees quickly line up into rows. 

                                 LEAD OFFICER
                        It is with great honor and 
                        privilege, that I inform you of 
                        Emperor Hirohito’s personal request 
                        that you serve in the “Special 
                        Attack Corps.” 

           The blood drains from Hiro’s face. 

           He scans over his fellow Pilot Trainees. Searching if anyone 
           feels the same apprehension. He finds only vacant stares. 

                                 LEAD OFFICER
                        Those who do not want to fulfill 
                        the Emperor’s wish, please step 
                        forward now. 

           Hiro remains still, but his eyes search frantically. Will 
           anyone step forward? A few Trainees do the same. 

           A PILOT TRAINEE steps out of formation. 

                                 LEAD OFFICER
                        Anyone else? 

           There’s an angry tone in the Lead Officer’s voice. 

           A long beat passes. Hiro stands there. Every range of emotion 
           and possibility floods his brain, but he remains put. 
           No one else steps forward. An OFFICER escorts the Pilot 
           Trainee out of the hall. 

           The Lead Officer bows to the newly minted “Special Attack” 
           Unit. The Trainees bow in unison. 

                                 LEAD OFFICER
                        Japan thanks you for your bravery. 

           Hiro walks over to a window sill. Needs something to lean on. 
           He grabs on for support. His mind still catching up... 

           He notices the sound of DRIPPING. There’s water leaking from 
           the window into the room but - There’s no rain outside? 

           Hiro looks down. A FEW INCHES OF WATER lays across the floor. 

           Nothing adds up, but it doesn’t need to, because - 

           THE WINDOWS EXPLODE AND WATER SURGES IN!

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN - PRESENT -- NIGHT

           Hiro wakes with a start. 

           And is immediately POUNDED by a massive wave.

           He’s pushed across the belly of the Helldiver. A few feet 
           from going overboard into the raging ocean - 

           A hand grabs him at the last second.  

                                 EDWARD
                        SO MUCH FOR A GODDAMN NAP!

           Edward pulls Hiro onto the wing. They latch onto the UNDER-
           WING BOMB. Gripping for dear life. 

           The men are PUMMELED by angry waves. Set after set.

           Edward looks at Hiro. The sight of the young and helpless 
           Kamikaze stirs something in him. 

                                 EDWARD
                        HERE!

           Edward takes off his life vest. Offers it to Hiro - 

           He looks at Edward. Baffled. He recognizes this heroic 
           sacrifice but doesn’t understand why. 

                                 EDWARD
                        C’MON! TAKE IT, KID! 
           Hiro takes the life vest and frantically puts it on. 

           He looks on in horror as - A SWELL DWARFS THE HELLDIVER. 

           Edward and Hiro tense. Preparing for impact. Here it comes - 

           The WAVE slams into the Helldiver. Everything is consumed and 
           buried under the crashing wave. 

           The Helldiver resurfaces - Hiro and Edward are gone. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER CHAOS

           Water swirls violently. 

           A MUFFLED SCREAM cuts through the sound of churning water. 

           There it is again. Getting louder.

           A brief glimpse of a YELLOW LIFE VEST. It rises. 

           Pulling towards the surface... 

           EXT. OCEAN -- NIGHT

           ...Hiro bursts out of the water. 

           Gulps an enormous breath of air. 

           He ducks underwater just as a WAVE crashes down on him. Hiro 
           resurfaces and floats there. The worst has passed. 

           Hiro searches around. No sight of Edward. Alone. 

           The moonlight illuminates the ocean just enough to see the 
           Helldiver in the distance. It’s too far to paddle. 

           Clouds begin to cover the moon enshrouding us in DARKNESS. 

           It’s near impossible to see anything now. Sound is heightened 
           in this panicked state. We’re alone in the open ocean at 
           night. An utter nightmare. 

           Hiro scans the dark waters. Feeling out in front of him. 

                                 HIRO
                        YANKEEEEEEEEEEE!

           It’s no use out here. Hiro knows it. 

                                 HIRO
                        Yankee...
           Silence. The darkness closes in on us. A claustrophobic 
           tightness as the last of moonlight vanishes -

                                                                 BLACK.

           Only the sound of Hiro’s labored breathing.

           It goes on, then - Stops purposely. 

           Like someone holding their breath. 

           A quiet SPLASH breaks the silence. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER -- LATER

           Pillars of moonlight shine down into the deep.

           Looking up above we see a SILHOUETTE OF A BODY on the ocean’s 
           surface. It just floats there. 

           The bottoms of TWO RAFTS come into view. 

           They approach the body and pull it out of the water...

           INT. HOME - KITCHEN - FLASHBACK -- DAY

           ...a strainer filled with shellfish is pulled from a plastic 
           bin of ice water. Edward dumps the contents into a tomato 
           based stew and begins breaking down some fish. 

                                 EDWARD
                        I was thinking that it might be 
                        nice to visit your parents for the 
                        week. I know they’d be happy to 
                        have us. How does that sound? 

           Mia works behind Edward, chopping vegetables. 

           Her thinned frame tells us all we need to know. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Mia? 

           She’s barely present. The pair of them work at their stations 
           with their backs turned to the other. 

                                 MIA
                        Huh? 

                                 EDWARD
                        You wanna visit your parents?
                                 MIA
                        You hate going there. 

           Edward tries to cover. 

                                 EDWARD
                        I hate the people there. Sure. But 
                        the air. There’s just something 
                        about it that I don’t find here. 

                                 MIA
                        The air? 

           Mia chops. Eyes lost somewhere else. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Yeah... It’s lighter. 

                                 MIA
                        Okay. 

           Mia’s eye twitches slightly.

                                 EDWARD
                        Great. I’ll give them a call. 

           She looks down at the cutting board before her. She’s SLICED 
           her finger. Deep. But it doesn’t register. 

           Her eyes pass over the kitchen and Edward as if she’s 
           noticing where she is for the first time. 

                                 MIA
                        What are we making? 

                                 EDWARD
                        Cioppino. It’s my mother’s recipe. 
                        Same one that won you over. 

                                 MIA
                        I thought that’s for celebrations?

                                 EDWARD
                        Who says every day isn’t a 
                        celebration. 

           Mia watches Edward as he works. Her eyes light up and she’s 
           present. Feeling Edward’s love for her once again. 

                                 MIA
                        Eddy...

           Edward pauses. Frozen. Like he hasn’t heard that name in a 
           long time. He slowly turns - 
           He looks at Mia and she stares right back. Edward notices her 
           bleeding finger. He pulls her in.

                                 EDWARD
                        What happened? 

           She doesn’t know. 

                                 MIA
                        I... I...

           And now, the pain of her loss swarms her. 

           Mia collapses in Edward’s arms. He holds her as she cries. 
           She clutches onto him, holding tighter than she ever has.

           EXT. RAFT #1 - PRESENT -- DAY

           Edward slowly comes to consciousness. He holds onto the side 
           of the raft the same way he held Mia. 

           His eyes adjust to a dark silhouette before him. His vision 
           clears to reveal the haggard face of - 

           FROST (24). An American Marine. Dressed in his tattered khaki 
           utility uniform. He stares over Edward with bulging eyes and 
           erotically strokes the THOMPSON MACHINE GUN in his lap. 

                                 FROST
                        He’s alive! That’s twenty-bucks and 
                        a night with your sister, Zwingman! 

           Edward sits up to orient himself. Before him, on the end of 
           the horizon sits a small blur. The Helldiver.  

           He then turns around to see -

           RAFT #2

           It’s tied to Raft #1 with rope and floats a foot away. 

           The raft holds REYES (20) and ZWINGMAN (26). Marines wavering 
           in between starvation and insanity. Reyes’ eyes constantly 
           flit around inspecting when there’s nothing to inspect. 
           Zwingman has bitten his nails down to the cuticle. 

                                 ZWINGMAN
                        Like she’d fuck a scumbag like you!

           Edward’s eyes fall on someone else - HIRO. 
           His face is BRUISED and SWOLLEN from multiple beatings. He 
           lays slumped in a corner, unconscious. 

           Any relief Edward had of being saved is tainted by the sight 
           of Hiro’s beaten body. Not to mention the crazies... 

           RAFT #1 AND RAFT #2

           Frost wrings the Thompson tightly, grins. 

           Edward watches him, senses the mental unbalance behind 
           Frost’s gaunt eyes. 

                                 FROST
                        Were you on the carrier?

           Edward weakly nods, disturbed. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Flew Helldivers... 

           Zwingman shakes his head, disappointed. 

                                 ZWINGMAN
                        Damn plane has taken more of our 
                        brothers than I’d wish to count. 

                                 REYES
                        Shitcan ain’t worthy of being in 
                        the sky if you ask me!

                                 EDWARD
                        Wasn’t the plane I imagined I’d be 
                        flying, that’s for sure. 

                                 FROST
                        You go down in it?

           Frost continues to wring the Thompson. Edward notices that 
           the inside of Frost’s palms are raw to the muscle. 

                                 EDWARD
                        ...Went down after the carrier was 
                        hit. That bitch was all I had. Got 
                        bucked off in the night. 

                                 ZWINGMAN
                        Someone’s watching over you! That’s 
                        for fucking sure. 

                                 FROST
                        You got a name, Pilot? 
                                 EDWARD
                        Eddy.   

           Frost tastes the sound on his tongue, mouths “Eddy.” Doesn’t 
           taste great. He shakes his head, angry.  

                                 FROST
                        No. No. No. That won’t cut it. 
                        What’s your war name? 

                                 EDWARD
                        I don’t have one... 

                                 REYES
                        Fuckin’ Airmen! 

                                 FROST
                        You don’t have one? 

           Frost lunges at Edward, grabs him by the jacket. Stares 
           daggers into Edward’s eyes, then calms. Releases. 

                                 FROST
                        Gimme a sec. Think. Think. Think.

           Frost’s knuckles burn white against the Thompson. Endlessly 
           wringing and stroking. He smacks his head. 

                                 FROST
                        Here ye. Here ye. After this moment 
                        forward thou shall be now known and 
                        christened as - “Helldiver.” 

           Frost looks at Edward like a puppy for approval. 

                                 FROST
                        What do you think? You like it? 

           Edward has to give him a bone. 

                                 EDWARD
                        ...yeah. Helldiver. Thanks. 

                                 FROST
                        You just joined the Marines, 
                        Helldiver! Hoo-rah!

                                 REYES & ZWINGMAN
                        Hoorah! 

           Frost points at Reyes then Zwingman. 
                                 FROST
                        The Mexican is Reyes and that 
                        asshole is Zwingman. 

                                 EDWARD
                        What’s their war names? 

           Frost chuckles. Doesn’t know what he’s talking about. A tense 
           and uncomfortable silence until - 

                                 REYES (O.S.)
                        Don’t forget Tojo! 

           A SEVERED HEAD crashes into Edward’s lap, startling him. 

           He shoves the head away into the corner of the raft. 

           The Severed Head of a Japanese Pilot stares at Edward with 
           rotten eyes. It’s face frozen in a distressing scream. 

                                 ZWINGMAN
                        He’s the handsome one! 

                                 EDWARD
                        What the fuck is wrong with you?!

           The Marines laugh, passing confused glances. 

                                 REYES
                        Ain’t anyone back home ask you to 
                        bring back a Jap? 

                                 EDWARD
                        What?

                                 FROST
                        He’s a flyboy. Doesn’t know how. 

           Zwingman leans over the side of Raft #2 to be close to 
           Edward. He speaks with a proud glint. 

                                 ZWINGMAN
                        It’s easy. We can show you.

                                 REYES
                        They keep sending me men with gold 
                        crowned teeth. What am I supposed 
                        to do? Leave ‘em be? 

           Frost shakes his head. 

                                 FROST
                        All that gold down with the ship.
                                 REYES 
                        That reminds me...

           Reyes eyes an unconscious Hiro. 

                                 ZWINGMAN
                        My little brother asked for a Jap. 
                        Lucky for me, we found “Tojo.” 
                        Usually you gotta boil the head, 
                        but we ain’t got that kind of 
                        luxury at this point. He’s gettin’ 
                        what he gets. 

           Edward points to Hiro.

                                 EDWARD
                        What’re you going to do with him?

                                 ZWINGMAN
                        I don’t know yet. But it’ll be fun. 
                        I promise you that. 

           The Marines crack up. Edward looks to -

           RAFT #2

           Reyes has his KNIFE in Hiro’s mouth. Searching...

           Hiro weakly comes to, eyes wide with horror. He doesn’t dare 
           move. He pants angrily. Hate brimming. 

                                 REYES
                        We struck gold, boys! Gimme some 
                        help will ya?!

           Reyes pulls out the knife and sidesteps, letting Zwingman 
           PUNCH Hiro across the face. Reyes nods to Zwingman. 

                                 REYES
                        Hold him.

           Hiro’s weak gaze finds Edward and they stare in silence. 

           Tension. Uncertainty. 

           RAFT #1 

           Frost looks to Edward, then points at Hiro.

                                 FROST
                        You wanna take him for a spin? 
                                 EDWARD
                        What? 

                                 FROST
                        Lotta our boys went down in that 
                        carrier. You can’t keep that shit 
                        bottled up. 

           Frost crawls to the corner of the Raft and takes “Tojo” into 
           his lap. He lovingly pets his face. 

                                 FROST
                        It eats at you. Kills you piece by 
                        piece. You must release. You must 
                        release. Release... 

           Edward backs away from Frost and locks eyes on Hiro. 

           RAFT #2 

           They stare at each other. Long and unspoken. 

                                 ZWINGMAN
                        What are you looking at “Helldiver” 
                        for? Oh, he does not like you. 

           Reyes grabs Hiro by the hair. YANKS him around. 

                                 REYES
                        Quit looking at him! 

           Hiro keeps staring, eyes burning in anger. Betrayed. 

           Zwingman KICKS him in the face. Hiro drops into the corner, 
           keeps his gaze down. 

           RAFT #1

           Edward looks to Frost. 

                                 EDWARD
                        We- We can’t do this. He’s a 
                        prisoner. A POW then, right? 

                                 ZWINGMAN (O.S.)
                        New guy’s funny! I like him!

                                 FROST 
                        POW? Says who? 

           Frost eyes Edward, then looks to Reyes and Zwingman. 
           RAFT #2

           Zwingman holds down Hiro as Reyes forces the KNIFE back into 
           Hiro’s mouth. Hiro HOWLS in pain and fear. 

                                 ZWINGMAN
                        Uncle Sam wants us to kill these 
                        bastards. As far as I’m concerned, 
                        that’s the only job I gotta do. 

           Reyes digs around in Hiro’s mouth with the knife. He sees a 
           GOLD CROWN and gleams with joy.

                                 REYES
                        That’s a crown fit for a king!

           Reyes buries the knife into Hiro’s gums. Hiro SCREAMS in 
           excruciating pain. Blood puddles in his mouth. 

                                 ZWINGMAN
                        Should’ve brushed, kid. 

           RAFT #1 AND RAFT #2

           Edward screams out at Zwingman and Reyes. 

                                 EDWARD
                        He’s a Pilot! 

           Reyes DIGS deep into Hiro’s mouth. Hiro cringes in pain, his 
           mouth stained with blood. 

                                 ZWINGMAN
                        Good. Then we’ve got the bastard 
                        that put us here. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Navy Intelligence should be talking 
                        to him! They’ll want him! The kid 
                        probably knows some things! 

                                 ZWINGMAN
                        He ain’t dead yet. 

                                 EDWARD
                        He could be useful! This is insane!

                                 REYES
                        We just want the gold... 

           Reyes leverages the knife, pushes down hard. CRACK. Hiro 
           bellows out in excruciating pain. 
                                 REYES
                        That’s it! It’s loose! 

           Reyes and Zwingman force Hiro’s mouth open. He stares at them 
           with a blood soaked smirk face. 

                                 ZWINGMAN
                        Where is it?

           Reyes is livid. 

                                 REYES
                        He swallowed it.

           Hiro spits a mouthful of blood at Reyes and Zwingman.

                                 REYES
                        Fuck it. Let’s gut the kid.

           Reyes runs the knife up and down Hiro’s stomach. Hiro SQUIRMS 
           against Zwingman’s tight hold. 

                                 FROST
                        Now? 

           Reyes pauses, turns to Frost angrily. 

                                 REYES
                        You’re the fucker who wanted to cut 
                        him up and eat him! 

                                 FROST
                        That was “Tojo!”

           Frost holds “Tojo” protectively. 

                                 REYES
                        Looks like “Tojo” will have a 
                        friend real soon then. 

           Reyes STABS the knife at Hiro - 

           But Hiro narrowly dodges the blade as it SLICES across his 
           torso and BURIES into Zwingman’s chest. 

                                 REYES
                        FUCK! 

           Hiro KICKS Reyes down then SHOVES a skewered Zwingman over 
           the edge of the raft. He splashes into the ocean.

           Hiro leaps onto Reyes and wraps his hands around his throat, 
           squeezing like a vice. 
           Hateful eyes burn between the two. 

           RAFT #1

           Edward watches horrified at what’s unfolding before him. 

           Frost rises to his feet and aims the Thompson at Hiro -  

                                 FROST
                        I’LL FUCKING SEND YOU TO HELL! I’LL 
                        DO IT! DON’T LOOK “TOJO!”

           RAFT #2

           Hiro chokes the life out of Reyes. 

           Oblivious to Frost behind him. 

           RAFT #1

           Frost lines up a shot on Hiro - 

           THWAP! Edward swings an OAR right into Frost’s arms and 
           chest, toppling him into the ocean. 

           The Thompson falls into Raft #2. 

           RAFT #2

           Reyes stares at the Thompson, his arms stretch from his side 
           for the gun. Fingers sweeping the wooden stock. 

           Hiro presses down hard, choking...

           He spots the Thompson just as Reyes grabs it! 

           Hiro lunges for the gun -

           And rips it from Reyes’s hand.

           OCEAN 

           Frost wades in the water. 

           He scans the ocean. Confused. ZWINGMAN’S GONE. 

           His eyes settle on a CLOUD OF BLOOD in the water. 
           RAFT #2

           Hiro slams the stock of the Thompson into Reyes’ face and 
           SHATTERS a mouthful of teeth. 

           He scrambles to the other side of the raft and points the 
           Thompson wildly at Reyes. Terrified. 

                                 EDWARD
                        STOOOOP! 

           Hiro looks beyond Reyes at Edward. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Let it go... Just take a raft and 
                        we can go our separate ways. 

           Edward’s calm composure is soothing, but - 

           Hiro is too frenzied and fearful to listen. His finger wavers 
           on the Thompson’s trigger. 

           Edward senses Hiro’s intention. 

                                 EDWARD
                        NO! 

           Hiro aims at Reyes and pulls the trigger. CLICK. CLICK.

           Reyes flinches then CHARGES at Hiro -  

           Hiro heaves the Thompson at Reyes to no avail. 

           Reyes TACKLES Hiro clean out of the raft. 

           RAFT #1

           Edward watches the two wrestle in the water, both men 
           punching and clawing to drown the other. 

           He spots Frost as he hoists himself onto Raft #2 -

           He’s going for the Thompson. Shit! 

           Edward leaps into -

           RAFT #2

           Grabs the Thompson! 

           And looks into Frost’s disgruntled face, when -
           Blood SPATTERS Edward’s face. He stares into Frost’s 
           horrified eyes, his mouth wet with blood. 

           A sickening CRUNCH out of view. 

           Suddenly, Frost is yanked from Raft #2 and into the depths.

           Edward looks over the edge of the raft, spots the TAIL FIN 
           seconds before it vanishes. 

           Pssssssssshhhhhhhhhh... 

           Raft #2 is leaking air. Fast. 

           UNDERWATER

           Hiro is held in a headlock by Reyes. 

           He drowns just below the water’s surface, arms and elbows 
           flailing back helplessly. 

           RAFT #1 AND RAFT #2

           Edward jumps into Raft #1 with the Thompson. 

                                 EDWARD
                        GET OUT OF THE WATER! SHARK! 

           Reyes can’t hear him, lost in a blind-rage. 

           Trapped by the instinct to kill. 

           UNDERWATER

           Hiro notices the murky red water before him. 

           Spots a shadow dart out of the haze. A glimpse of that 
           familiar behemoth shape. It disappears into the deep. 

           Hiro’s eyes light up in alarm. He tears at Reyes frantic, 
           desperate to escape. 

           He turns back towards the beast’s direction and it 
           materializes out of the darkness - 

           CHARGING FAST. CLOSING IN. 

           Hiro screams. He muscles free from Reyes’s arms just enough 
           to BITE DOWN on his forearm. Reyes releases. 

           Hiro backpedals and kicks Reyes into -
           -- THE SHARK’S JAWS! SIDE-SWIPING HIM LIKE A BUS. -- 

           EXT. OCEAN

           Hiro breaches. Choking for air. 

           The Great White tears into Reyes. Whipping back and forth as 
           it dismembers him. We hear his tortured SCREAMS -

           Hiro catches a final glimpse of Raft #2 before it sinks. 

           He looks to Raft #1 and Edward with the Thompson. 

           EXT. RAFT

           Edward checks the Thompson and flicks the safety off. 

           He aims out at the feasting Great White. Takes in a 
           calculated breath. Steadies his aim and - 

           BANG! BANG! - Two direct shots at the beast. 

                                 EDWARD
                        SHIT!  

           Edward angrily switches from SINGLE FIRE to FULL AUTO.

           He aims back out but the Shark is gone. Just a stain of 
           bloody water where she was and Reyes’ severed torso. 

           Hiro floats with his life vest. He looks at Edward. They 
           stare at each other for a long beat. 

           Edward turns away and sits down in the raft

           EXT. RAFT -- MOMENTS LATER

           Hiro pulls himself into the Raft. 

           Edward doesn’t care. Allows him to. 

           They sit in silence. Eyes passing every now and then between 
           the two. The trust they built - broken. 

           Edward pulls the Thompson closer to his side. 

           EXT. RAFT -- DAY

           Edward and Hiro sit in silence on their opposite ends. 
           Not a word has been spoken. Edward looks over to see Hiro 
           looking sullen at something - 

           It’s the back of “Tojo’s” head. Mashed against the canvas. It 
           lays closer to Edward’s side. 

           Hiro snaps out of his trance. His eyes lock with Edward’s 
           briefly and dart away. 

           Edward looks at “Tojo.” The longer he stares the more he 
           realizes “Tojo” was once just like Hiro...

           Edward falls glum. He reaches out and grabs “Tojo.”

           Hiro watches as Edward gently and respectfully takes “Tojo” 
           and releases him into the ocean. 

           Edward nods to Hiro and he nods back. 

           Maybe the trust isn’t all broken.

           EXT. RAFT -- LATER

           Edward stares out at the ocean. The faint silhouette of the 
           Helldiver dots the horizon. But he couldn’t care less. 

           Hiro looks up at the sky. Drained.

           He closes his eyes...

           INT. NAVY BARRACK - FLASHBACK -- DAY

           Hiro scribbles on a small piece of paper. Writing fervently. 
           A clear urgency to the message.

           He’s dressed as we know him in the present. 

                                 HIRO (V.O.)
                        ...It was known before me. I pray 
                        that it will be known after me...

           It’s the voice over from Hiro’s flashback in his Zero. We 
           realize now - This LETTER/V.O. was his final farewell. 

           A KAMIKAZE PILOT stands over Hiro.  

                                 KAMIKAZE PILOT
                        We need to go! Hurry up!

           Hiro scribbles faster. Finishes writing. 
                                 HIRO (V.O.)
                        ...Taku, Yuki, take care of Mother 
                        and Father...

           He jams the piece of paper into an envelope and hands it to 
           the Pilot Trainee in the cot above him.

           Hiro pockets AYUKO’S DOLL KEYCHAIN from his cot. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COCKPIT - HIRO’S ZERO - FLASHBACK -- DAY

           We are back to Hiro’s initial flashback.

           Continuing right where we left off -

           The DOLL KEY CHAIN rattles violently as Hiro DIPS his Zero 
           and begins his descent. 

           Anti-Aircraft flak BURST like violent black fireworks inches 
           from the cockpit glass. It’s fucking mayhem. 

                                 HIRO (V.O.)
                        ...I must go now. Goodbye. 

           Hiro jerks as the Zero weaves through the flak. 

           He looks over to see another ZERO at his side: 

           The KAMIKAZE PILOT stares back. A familiar face we’ve seen 
           before. Hiro’s face falls, racked with confusion. 

           It’s the Trainee who refused to be a Kamikaze.

           A brief moment of recognition passes between the two. Like 
           they know the deepest most painful secret of the other. 

           HIRO POV

           The Trainee’s Zero is SLAMMED by flak and BURSTS into flames.

           Hiro watches in horror as the Trainee BURNS and -

           BOOM! Explodes in a violent ball of fire. 

           Hiro narrowly DODGES the wreckage. Levels his Zero. 

           Zeros are SHOT DOWN all around Hiro. Metal and flesh are 
           blasted apart in aerial carnage. Destinies unfulfilled. 
           INT. COCKPIT - HIRO’S ZERO

           Hiro presses down on the Zero’s stick. Accelerates, when - 

           TINK!TINK!TINK! A hail of bullets rip across his Zero. 
           Puncturing holes into the engine and wing. 

           Hiro yanks on the stick and veers in a new direction - 

           We stay in the cockpit. Focused on Hiro. 

           He steadies the Zero. Accelerates a little. 

           Hiro moves his stick side to side. The Zero obeys. He’s 
           following someone. Tracking their moves. Accelerates. 

           He readies his finger on the firing trigger - 

                                 HIRO
                        Got you. 

           The Zero RATTLES and BUZZES as her canons fire but - 

           TINK!TINK!TINK! Enemy fire peppers the Zero. 

           Hiro JOLTS in his seat. Blood SPATTERS the windshield. He 
           checks his arm. It’s just a flesh wound. 

           Through Hiro’s POV we see the enemy briefly - 

           THE HELLDIVER

           She looks like shit. Battle scared and bullet riddled. Her 
           wing has caught ABLAZE and she BARRELS towards the ocean. 

           We push in on the FLAMING WING of the Helldiver. The flames 
           burn dangerously close to the UNDER-WING BOMBS. 

           Hiro watches transfixed. A thought taking shape...

           INT. COCKPIT - HIRO'S ZERO

           Hiro is pushed back against his seat. Descending too fast. He 
           struggles to level the plummeting Zero. 

           He wrestles the stick angrily. It’s JAMMED.

                                 HIRO
                        Shit-shit-shit-shit. 

           The WHISTLE of the dive bombing Zero crescendos...
                                 HIRO
                        NO! NO! NO!

           He braces for impact as the Zero nose-dives towards the 
           ocean’s surface. Closer. Closer. Closer. 

           Water rushes at us slamming us to -

           EXT. UNDERWATER - PRESENT -- DAY

           The RAFT cuts across the ocean’s surface. 

           OARS rhythmically propel the raft forward. 

           INT. RAFT -- DAY

           Hiro rows the raft towards the Helldiver. 

           Edward watches Hiro, fascinated by the young man’s 
           determination. More amused than helpful. 

                                 EDWARD
                        You missed her that bad?  

           Edward puts a hand on one of the oars. 

                                 EDWARD
                        There’s nothing over there.

           Hiro stops rowing for a beat. 

                                 HIRO
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        I have a plan. 

           Hiro goes back to rowing. His eyes fall on a set of dark 
           storm clouds directly where they’re heading. 

           Edward and Hiro share a look of worry. 

           EXT. RAFT -- DAY

           The raft saddles up beside the Helldiver. 

           Hiro ties the raft to the Helldiver’s tail with the ROPE that 
           connected the Marine’s rafts together. 

           Edward stays in the raft and watches as - 

           Hiro takes his katana and hops onto the Helldiver. 
           EXT. HULL, OCEAN 

           Hiro walks onto the wing. 

           He takes the katana and points the tip of the blade into the 
           frame of the Helldiver. 

           Hiro presses his body weight onto the hilt of the katana. The 
           sword begins to slice and dig into the wing. 

           He kneels down to the hole. Sniffs.

           A wide grin spreads across Hiro’s face. He waves Edward to 
           come over. Elated. He reluctantly does so. 

           Edward smells the hole. Locks eyes with Hiro. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Gas.

           Hiro nods enthusiastically. He points to the left and right 
           wing and the attached bombs. 

                                 EDWARD
                        You clever son of a bitch...

           Edward takes the lead. He looks down at the Helldiver 
           proudly. Maybe even for the first time. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Okay. What you got, Missy? I know 
                        this. I know this.

           Edward fights to remember. Bingo. He points at the wings -

                                 EDWARD
                        So - She’s got a hundred gallon 
                        tank there. And there. Another-
                        twenty behind the Gunner’s Station. 

           He motions at the UNDER-WING BOMBS and the INTERNAL BOMB BAY. 

                                 EDWARD
                        And with that under-wing load-out 
                        and the thousand pound demo-bomb in 
                        the bay - We’re lookin’ at the 
                        Fourth of July here.  

           Hiro RATTLES the Match Container in Edward’s face.

                                 EDWARD
                        Or whatever you guys call it... 
           Edward takes the Match Container and opens it. There’s a 
           decent amount of matches for this to work. 

                                 EDWARD
                        If we drain out the fuel from the 
                        wings and the internal tank...

           Edward takes it in. Nods. 

                                 EDWARD
                        ...That could work. Spotter Planes 
                        would see the fire for miles. 

           Edward and Hiro look up at the dark storm clouds, then down 
           at each other. We doing this? 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN -- DAY

           A ROPE is tied snug on the Helldiver’s wing. 

           Edward and Hiro check it religiously. 

           We track the rope from the Helldiver’s tail into the water 
           and to the RAFT. Floating off in the distance. 

           Hiro looks at it nervously. 

                                 EDWARD
                        If that burns up, we’re more than 
                        fucked. It’s the only way. 

           Edward pats Hiro on the back. 

                                 HIRO
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        Now what?

           EXT. OCEAN -- DAY

           Hiro clings to the wing of the Helldiver with a white knuckle 
           grip. Half-submerged. He holds the katana in his other hand. 

           Edward wades in the turbulent ocean. The storm is here. 

                                 EDWARD
                        You’re doing good! Keep movin’ your 
                        legs slow! Just like I showed you! 

           A swell rocks the Helldiver and Hiro. Not ideal conditions 
           for a novice swimmer. Hiro is hating every second. 
                                 HIRO
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        This was a stupid idea! 

           Edward scans the water’s surface. He spots A DORSAL FIN for a 
           split-second. Was it? It’s unclear. But regardless:

                                 EDWARD
                        We gotta’ move fast! We don’t have 
                        much time before she goes under! 

           Hiro shakes his head. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Don’t look so nervous! You’re 
                        gonna’ freak me out! 

           Edward extends his hand. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Grab my hand! 

           Hiro reaches out, but Edward’s too far. Intentionally so. 

                                 HIRO
                        You motherfucker!

           Hiro reluctantly releases and paddles to Edward. 

                                 EDWARD
                        There you go! Look at that! We’ve 
                        got ourselves a natural! 

           He grabs Edward’s hand. They wade there in the water. Hiro 
           kicks his legs slow and keeps himself afloat.  

                                 EDWARD
                        You good? 

           After a moment, Hiro is confident. He lets go of Edward and 
           wades there by himself. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Okay... This is it.

           Hiro nods and Edward dips underwater.

           EXT. UNDERWATER

           Edward swims below the wing.  

           He feels along the metal frame then stops. His hands have 
           found a metal wedge. Bingo. He pulls on it -
           A latch SLIDES open. Exposes a fuel cap. 

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Hiro struggles to wade.

           He’s pushed around by angry swells but remains in position. 

           Scans the water’s surface. No sign of a dorsal fin. 

           He dips under. On edge. 

           HIRO POV

           He looks down into the dark water. Nothing.  

           Everything is going too easy. 

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Hiro comes up.

           He turns towards the wing - EDWARD IS GONE. 

           FUCK. Hiro SWIMS towards the wing. Too worried and terrified 
           to notice that he’s actually swimming.  

           EXT. UNDERWATER - POV

           We’re charging right for Hiro. 

           Coming in fast for his side. 

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Hiro swims, oblivious to his impending doom, when:

           Edward BURSTS out of the water and grabs him. Close one.

           Hiro notices the smudge of oil on Edward’s face. They nod to 
           one another and swim for the other wing. 

           An angry SWELL dips the Helldiver.

                                 HIRO
                        NO. NO. NO. 

                                 EDWARD
                        SHIT!
           The Helldiver rolls forward and takes on water, sinking 
           faster than planned.

                                 EDWARD
                        WE GOTTA MOVE! YOU TAKE THE WING! 
                        I’LL GO DOWN FOR THE INTERNAL! 

           No time for careful translations. 

           Edward pulls the MATCH CONTAINER from his jacket. He puts it 
           in Hiro’s jacket pocket. 

                                 EDWARD
                        ONCE THAT WING IS OPEN, YOU GET ON 
                        HER BELLY AND LIGHT THE BITCH! 

           Edward splashes his hand in the slick skim of fuel and oil.

                                 HIRO
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA WHAT YOU’RE 
                        SAYING!

           There’s no time. Edward gives Hiro a slap on the back and 
           dives underwater. Leaving him. 

           Hiro swims to the other wing. He clings on. Scans his 
           surroundings, eyes falling on:

           A DORSAL FIN. Circling from afar.

           EXT. UNDERWATER 

           Edward swims to the -

           REAR GUNNER’S STATION

           He searches along the body of the Helldiver. 

           Finds a LATCH. 

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Hiro frantically feels along the wing. Doesn’t really know 
           what he’s looking for. He dives underwater -  

           The DORSAL FIN surfaces in the waters behind him. 
           UNDERWATER

           Hiro searches the wing. Running his hands up and down. Side 
           to side. Covering every inch. 

           It pains us to see where the latch is. 

           Watching Hiro pass over it every time. 

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Hiro comes up for air. 

           He turns back - NO DORSAL FIN. 

           He quickly dives -

           UNDERWATER

           Hiro runs his hand up and down the wing until -  

           His fingers wrap around the latch! He pulls on it but -  

           It’s jammed. He yanks hard -

           Not enough. Yanks harder! Still not enough. Yanks even 
           harder! The latch slides and EXPOSES the fuel cap. 

           Hiro unscrews the fuel cap and drains the fuel. 

           He’s about to go up for air, when - 

           THE GREAT WHITE MATERIALIZES! SINKS TEETH INTO HIRO’S ARM. 

           And drags him even deeper...

           EXT. UNDERWATER - EDWARD

           Edward frantically works the latch on the side of the plane.

           On the other side of the Helldiver’s wing -

           The Great White violently shakes Hiro by the arm. Ripping 
           flesh and splintering bone. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER - HIRO

           Hiro uses his other arm to - 

           DRIVE THE KATANA INTO THE SHARK’S SIDE. 
           The Shark releases and darts away into the depths. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER - EDWARD

           Edward yanks the latch open, releasing the dark fuel... 

           He turns to his side. The Shark is gone. He catches sight of 
           Hiro’s legs as they’re pulled up onto the wing. 

           Edward swims for the surface...

           EXT. OCEAN 

           ...and breaches. 

           He’s about to pull himself up, when:

                                 HIRO
                        WATCH OUT!

           Hiro points behind him. Edward turns to see -

           THE DORSAL FIN CHARGING RIGHT AT HIM!

           He doesn’t have enough time to get out. Edward takes in an 
           enormous GULP OF AIR and ducks...

           EXT. UNDERWATER

           ...THE GREAT WHITE DARTS OUT OF THE DARKNESS!

           Edward dips into the -

           REAR GUNNER’S STATION

           - At the last second!

           The Great White SLAMS against the Helldiver. 

           Its massive jaws SNAP at the Rear Gunner’s station. Teeth 
           carving into the metal frame of the Helldiver.  

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN

           Rain pelts the Helldiver. 

           Hiro lays on top of the wing and tries to fish the match 
           container out of his jacket pocket. 
           It’s hard with a broken and mangled arm. He wrestles against 
           the pain and pulls the container free. 

           The water surrounding the Helldiver is slick with fuel. 

           It’s time... 

           EXT. REAR GUNNER’S STATION - UNDERWATER 

           Edward muscles the M1919 BROWNING towards the SNAPPING JAWS. 

           The Great White CLAMPS down on the machine gun, violently 
           yanking it back and forth -  

           Edward is pushed around effortlessly by the beast. He SLAMS 
           his head against the inside of the station. Dazed. 

           And releases his grip on the M1919 Browning - 

           He flutters in and out of consciousness. Locked in on the 
           beast’s massive WHITE EYE. 

           Edward stops fighting. He’s no match and he knows it. 

           He lets himself fade off... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOME - FLASHBACK -- DAY

           Rain violently pelts the windows. 

           The front door whips open and Edward storms in. His mechanic 
           coveralls are sopping wet. He beelines to the RADIO on the 
           kitchen counter. Turns it on. 

           The Pearl Harbor Address continues:

                                 PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT (V.O.)
                        Last night, Japanese forces 
                        attacked Hong Kong. Last night, 
                        Japanese forces attacked Guam. 

           Edward looks over the home. No sign of Mia to be found.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. REAR GUNNER’S STATION - UNDERWATER -- PRESENT

           Edward wakes with a start.
           The Shark’s JAWS go for a bite -  

           Edward shrinks into the station. He KICKS the Shark in the 
           nose and she backs off. She rounds for another attack - 

           Edward turns the M1919 Browning at the Shark -

           She bites down. Edward fights to keep her at bay. 

           His motions begins to slow. He’s running out of oxygen. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOME - FLASHBACK -- DAY

           Edward drifts away from the radio and looks around the house. 
           He comes to the Master Bedroom. A bed for two. Neatly made. 

                                 PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT (V.O.)
                        Last night, the Japanese attacked 
                        Wake Island. And this morning, the 
                        Japanese attacked Midway Island.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. REAR GUNNER’S STATION - UNDERWATER -- PRESENT

           The Great White rips loose the M1919 Browning!

           Edward instantly closes the CANOPY’S SHATTERED FRAME.

           It’s just enough to BLOCK the Shark’s GAPING JAWS - 

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN

           Wet and extinguished matches litter the hull. 

           Hiro only has FIVE MORE MATCHES. 

           He lights one. It burns for a second, but the whipping winds 
           and pouring rain extinguish it. 

           FOUR MORE LEFT. C’mon. Think. Think. 

           He takes THREE MATCHES. Knows the risk.

           Strikes them as one. The matches BURN, flame taking to wood.

           Hiro quickly tosses them into the oil. 

           NOTHING. The oil does not take.
           EXT. REAR GUNNER’S STATION - UNDERWATER 

           The Great White attempts to muscle its head into the Rear 
           Gunner’s Station - STRAINING the canopy’s frame. 

           The SNAPPING JAWS inch closer to Edward -  

           He yanks a SHARD OF GLASS off the canopy frame.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOME - FLASHBACK -- DAY

           Edward strolls through the hallway. PHOTOS of Mia and Edward 
           decorate the wall. The happiest of times. 

                                 PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT (V.O.)
                        Japan has, therefore, undertaken a 
                        surprise offensive extending 
                        throughout the Pacific...

           He stops outside a door and looks at the small cloud sign 
           that hangs without a name. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Mia?

           No response. He turns the door knob, enters slowly...

           NURSERY

           ...The world falls SILENT. 

           Edward’s legs give out and he CRUMPLES in the doorway. 

           We reverse to reveal the BABY CRIB... 

           A pair of BARE FEET floating just above it. 

           The bottom of MIA’S MATERNITY DRESS hangs in view.  

           A glimpse of the CEILING FAN. It’s ripped slightly ajar from 
           the ceiling. A ROPE leads out of frame. 

           Edward lets out a blood-curdling SCREAM. 

           A pain unlike anything he’s experienced. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. REAR GUNNER’S STATION - UNDERWATER -- PRESENT

           Edward stares right at the Great White. 

           The SHARD OF GLASS at the ready. 

           He belts out a GUTTERAL SCREAM of unholy rage. 

           Letting out all the air in his lungs.

           EXT. HULL, OCEAN

           ONE. SINGLE. MATCH. 

           Hiro stares at the match. Hopeless. His last chance. 

           He notices a SHINE to his fingers. They’re wet with fuel. 

           Hiro scans over his entire body and finds - 

           A PUDDLE OF FUEL AT HIS FEET. A wick waiting to be lit. 

           He knows what must be done. Hiro steels himself.

           STRIKES the match. FLAME takes to wood. He drops it as -

           THE PUDDLE IGNITES...

                                        ...AND HIRO BURSTS INTO FLAMES!

           He lets out a WAR CRY and LEAPS OFF the Helldiver at the 
           thrashing Great White. SPLASH! 

           The water IGNITES. Flames spread instantly. 

           A great CIRCLE OF FIRE surrounds the Helldiver. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER

           Hiro extinguishes on impact. 

           He’s SMACKED by the Shark’s tail fin as it spins around and 
           flees from the flames above. The Shark vanishes. 

           Hiro takes the opening and desperately dives for the -

           REAR GUNNER’S STATION

           Edward floats unconscious, suspended in the muddy black 
           water. Hiro grabs him, yanks him from the plane. 
           Pulling Edward into - 

           OPEN WATERS

           Hiro moves with no time to spare. 

           Every passing second is one without air. 

           One closer to the Helldiver’s impending explosion. 

           EXT. AERIAL VIEW

           The oil and fuel burn violently. 

           The flames lick the bomber and its load-out, consuming it...

           Priming it. 

           EXT. UNDERWATER

           Hiro looks up above - ANGRY FLAMES BURN. 

           He thrashes and strokes, but Edward weighs him down. 

           For every frenzied stroke forward they descend a foot deeper -  

           Still, he has to try. Swimming as best he can... Sinking...

           Something stirs in the corner of Hiro’s vision - THE SHARK. 

           She CHARGES, passing under the sinking Helldiver when:

           -- KA-BOOM! THE HELLDIVER EXPLODES. A SEISMIC SHOCK. --

           A MAELSTRON OF RIPPLES consumes Hiro and Edward.

           EXT. OCEAN

           Splotches of INKY OIL-FIRES burn on the water’s surface. 
           PILLARS OF DARK SMOKE rises out for miles. 

           We sit with the fire and smoke for a beat, when - 

           Hiro and Edward breach! Alive and kicking. Edward instantly 
           sputters up a mouthful of water and breathes in. 

           He takes in his surroundings. Passing his view over floating 
           pieces of the Helldiver and raging oil-fires... 
           Edward cheers and hugs Hiro. Grateful. The two men take in 
           the wreckage in awe. We did it. We fucking did it. 

           The RAFT floats in the distance. Just as planned. 

           Hiro and Edward paddle in the Raft’s direction. Each move is 
           laborious and painful. 

           Hiro changes directions and paddles towards something - 

                                 EDWARD
                        Where are you going?

           Hiro holds up the END OF A ROPE. 

           He pulls on it and the rope comes up out of the water. Hiro 
           pulls in the rope and raft. 

           Edward smiles wide with hope, but then - 

           THE DORSAL FIN

           Slices up out of the water. 

           The Shark Flesh is scorched and burned. 

           It charges right for us. 

           UNDERWATER

           The Shark’s body is marred with patches of CHARRED FLESH. 

           SHRAPNEL stabs out of her body. A TATTERED TAIL FIN. 

           Despite the damage, she comes at them faster than ever -  

           HIRO

           Sees the fin. He pulls in fast. 

           The Raft slowly comes closer. 

           There’s too much rope and not enough time. 

                                 HIRO
                        GO! GO! 

           EDWARD

           Looks at Hiro and the Dorsal Fin. Torn. 
           But he has to do something. 

                                 EDWARD
                        JUST KEEP PULLING! DON’T STOP!

           Edward swims hard for the raft. 

           EXT. AERIAL VIEW 

           Hiro stays in place and PULLS IN the Raft. 

           Edward swims for the Raft as Hiro pulls it towards him.  

           The Great White swims for Hiro. 

           It’s a race to the fucking finish...

           HIRO

           Pulls in as fast as he can. 

           The rope begins to dig into his sliced palms.

           Hiro’s bloody palms make it harder to pull the Raft in. 

           His hands slip down the rope -

           But he keeps pulling. 

           THE DORSAL FIN

           Is halfway to Hiro. 

           She isn’t holding pack. 

           Charging at 25mph! 

           EDWARD

           Keeps pushing forward. 

           Almost to the Raft. 

           HIRO

           Reels in hard. 

           He looks back to see - 
           THE DORSAL FIN

           Closes in for the kill. 

           Fuck. She’s so close. 

           EDWARD

           Reaches the raft.

           Climbs onboard. 

           HIRO

           A peaceful look falls upon Hiro’s face. 

           He stops pulling in the raft. 

           THE DORSAL FIN

           Is right behind Hiro. 

           The body of the Great White begins to surface -  

           Don’t look back. 

           HIRO

           Readies for what’s to come.

           The Great White seconds behind him - 

                                 EDWARD (O.S.)
                        MOVE! 

           Hiro ducks underwater. 

           Exposing the incoming Shark - MOUTH AGAPE!

           EDWARD

           Lays prone in the raft. 

           The THOMPSON MACHINE GUN aimed at the Shark:

           -- EDWARD EMPTIES THE MAGAZINE. BULLETS PUNCH THROUGH 
           THE SHARK. DECIMATING THE BEAST IN SECONDS --
           EXT. UNDERWATER

           Hiro watches in awe as - 

           The BULLET RIDDLED SHARK descends into the deep. 

           Blood trails out of the monster’s gaping jaws. Its bulging 
           white eyes stare out lifeless, forcing one final shudder down 
           Hiro’s spine. Finally, the beast is slain. 

           Hiro swims for the surface -

           EXT. OCEAN 

           Hiro breaches and belts out a CHEER. 

           Edward YELLS in celebration. He rows the raft to Hiro and 
           offers his hand -

           Hiro takes it without a second thought, embracing Edward as 
           he’s hoisted into the raft. They look upon the other proudly, 
           not as enemies in this moment, but as friends. 

           The pair settle themselves in the raft. Only the sound of 
           labored breathing and the electricity of survival. 

           EXT. RAFT -- LATER 

           Edward and Hiro lay motionless.

           Not an ounce of energy left in their tattered bodies. A small 
           puddle of blood sloshes in the bottom of the raft. 

           The faint DRONE of a distant plane breaks the silence. 

           Nobody moves. The sound grows LOUDER. Closer. 

           Slowly, Edward and Hiro come to life, rolling over to look up 
           at the sky where - A SPOTTER PLANE soars above. 

           The plane rounds back for them, descending to the water...

           EXT. OCEAN -- MOMENTS LATER

           The amphibious aircraft floats atop the water a few meters 
           away from the raft. Waiting idle. 

           An AIRMAN waves at Edward, yelling: 
                                 AIRMAN
                        Imperial Navy’s heading this way! 
                        No time to waste!

           The airman points to the horizon where -

           A JAPANESE AIRCRAFT CARRIER approaches... 

           EXT. RAFT

           Hiro weakly stares at the approaching Japanese Carrier. 
           There’s no hope or joy on his face. Just recognition.  

           Edward looks on to the Airman and the Spotter Plane. 

           Hiro and Edward look back at each other, holding there. So 
           many things to be said yet no time to say it. 

           A simple nod passes between the two.

           Edward slips into the water and swims for the Spotter Plane.

           He climbs into the plane and takes one last look at Hiro. 

           He closes the hatch. 

           EXT. RAFT -- MOMENTS LATER

           Hiro looks up into the sky and watches the Spotter Plane fly 
           off into the distance. Free. 

           A sincere grin spreads across Hiro’s face. 

           He relishes this moment for a beat. Then, lowers his gaze at 
           the approaching JAPANESE AIRCRAFT CARRIER. 

           EXT. JAPANESE AIRCRAFT CARRIER -- DAY

           Hiro is on the deck. His wounds have been treated and his 
           shark bitten arm is all bandaged up.  

           He looks out at the ocean. Eyes deep in thought. 

           INT. INFIRMARY, AMERICAN AIRCRAFT CARRIER -- DAY

           Edward sits in a medical bed. 

           He’s healthier. Color back in his face. A BANDAGED STUMP 
           where his leg used to be. A DOCTOR checks the stump. 
                                 DOCTOR
                        You’re lucky to be alive. 

           Edward sits there, deciphering those words. After hesitating, 
           a sense of relief comes over him. 

           His eyes well up with tears. He lets them fall. 

           INT. SAILOR QUARTERS, JAPANESE AIRCRAFT CARRIER -- DAY

           Hiro is escorted into the barrack by an OFFICER.  

           There’s an odd sense of familiarity to everything he sees. 
           The room is filled with JAPANESE SAILORS AND PILOTS. 

           That same young bravado. It’s unnerving to Hiro. 

                                 OFFICER
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        You’ll find your glory soon.

           Hiro sits down on a cot and the Officer gives him a pat.

           INT. HALLWAY, AMERICAN AIRCRAFT CARRIER -- DAY

           Claustrophobic chaos. An ALARM sounds. Echoes. Ringing. 

           Sailors and Airmen bustle about, sprinting into action. The 
           continuous drone of an alarm signals them for battle. 

                                 SAILOR
                        Stations! Stations! Stations! We 
                        got a Japanese Carrier! 

           Among the chaos we find Edward. He stands on crutches. 

           A look of worry crosses everyone’s face.

           INT. SAILOR QUARTERS, JAPANESE AIRCRAFT CARRIER -- DAY

           The room bustles with life. 

           Every Sailor and Airman readies for battle. They move with a 
           heightened sense of purpose. Battle and glory awaits. 

                                 KAMIKAZE PILOT
                             (Japanese, subtitled)
                        C’mon! The Americans are coming!

           Hiro sits in his cot. A solitary statue. He’s got all the 
           time in the world. He looks at the Kamikaze Pilot. 
                                 HIRO
                        ...You really want to die? 

           The Kamikaze stares at Hiro like he’s crazy. 

           INT. HOSPITAL BUNK, AIRCRAFT CARRIER -- DAY

           Edward sits on his bunk. Surrounded by fellow wounded 
           soldiers. Able bodied men move into action around them. 

           He stares at a PHOTO OF MIA in his hands. 

           Making peace with whatever may come. 

           EXT. DECK, JAPANESE AIRCRAFT CARRIER -- DAY

           Hiro walks on deck. He’s stoic but - 

           His nose is BROKEN and his face is battered with bruises. 

           TWO OFFICERS escort him towards an awaiting ZERO. They stop 
           before it. Hiro looks back at them. Defiant. 

           An Officer puts his hand on his holstered pistol. 

           INT. HOSPITAL BUNK, AIRCRAFT CARRIER

           Edward tucks away the photo of Mia to his heart. 

                                 SAILOR
                        Eddy! Hop your ass on deck! You 
                        need to see this. 

           The Sailor disappears down the hall. 

           Edward slowly climbs out of his cot. 

           EXT. DECK, JAPANESE AIRCRAFT CARRIER

           Hiro stares at the Officers. 

           Kamikaze Pilots load into their Zeros. They watch the 
           dramatic standoff from their cockpits. 

           The Officer unholsters his pistol and aims at Hiro - 

           Hiro doesn’t falter. He’s not afraid. Not of this. 

           Japanese Sailors and Airmen look out off the side of the 
           deck. Something else has overshadowed Hiro’s showdown. 
           The anger dissipates from the Officer’s face. He sees it too. 

           He lowers his pistol and walks to the railing of the deck. 

           Hiro turns around. Everyone on deck looks out at - 

           EXT. DECK, AMERICAN AIRCRAFT CARRIER

           Edward hobbles on deck with his crutches. 

           Everyone on deck looks out over the railing in awe - 

           A MUSHROOM CLOUD OF UNGODLY PROPORTIONS RISES. 

           Edwards stops in his tracks. Shocked. Confused. 

           The aftermath of the Hiroshima bombing. 

           Soldiers on deck shout with joy. They embrace their brothers 
           in arms with a sense of empowerment. 

           Edward takes the sight in with a look of sorrow. 

           EXT. DECK, JAPANESE AIRCRAFT CARRIER

           Hiro looks out over the railing - 

           THE MUSHROOM CLOUD RISES IN THE DISTANCE. 

           The deck is silent. We pass over the faces of Japanese 
           Sailors and Pilots. No one knows what this moment means. 

           But they feel it. And it breaks every one of them. 

           Hiro looks on. A sense of relief tarnished by an unbearable 
           pain. A man and his nation... 

           Heading into the unknown. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
