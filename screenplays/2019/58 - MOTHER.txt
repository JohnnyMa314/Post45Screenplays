                                   The True Story of the Matriarch of Organized Crime in New York 
           EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE, NYC - CLINTON STREET - 1869

           We’re abruptly hit in the face by poverty: unpaved streets, 
           worn buildings, layers of street trash consisting of HORSE 
           URINE and MANURE, FOOD WASTE, BROKEN WOOD, and THICK BLACK TAR.

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        You might’ve forgotten by now, but 
                        Lower Manhattan was once known as 
                        the dirtiest place in the world.

           Knee-deep in that filth are STREET DWELLERS that we’re taught 
           only exist in third world countries. But this is America. 
           PEDDLERS, PROSTITUTES, ORPHANS all begging in Old New York. 

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        No sanitation service. No clean 
                        water. Disease ran rampant, spiking 
                        death rates to rival medieval 
                        London. And we bathed once a month. 
                        Well, when we could afford soap...

           We FOCUS on a broken plumbing pipe, forming a puddle around a 
           HORSE CARCASS. A HUNGRY CHILD (8) sits nearby, staring at it.

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        But the City’s Government refused to 
                        pay attention to us. They dedicated 
                        their resources to Upper Manhattan -- 
                        where the votes mattered.

           The CARCASS is SPLASHED as a LIVE HORSE trots into the puddle. 
           It stops on command from its driver: INVESTIGATOR DORCY (22), an 
           ambitious rule keeper with a chip on his shoulder. 

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        Just a few years after Lincoln got 
                        popped and there was already a 
                        second Civil War brewing... The 
                        haves versus the have nots.

           An EXPENSIVE LEATHER SHOE steps out and into the puddle. It 
           belongs to a WEALTHY BUSINESSMAN (30s). He shakes off gunk, 
           annoyed, paying no mind to the hungry child beside him. 

           Then, he and Dorcy walk toward a CORNER STORE. 

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        The rich had profit. But the poor 
                        had purpose. And purpose made all 
                        the difference...

           The Child watches them go for a moment. Then, he clocks the 
           horse carcass... the beast eyes, flickering. He’s concerned.

                        Someone help the horsey.

           An IRISHMAN follows the Kid’s gaze. The horse is barely alive. 
           Struggling. They all know the feeling. He retrieves a KNIFE --

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S DRY GOODS STORE - CONTINUOUS

           From inside, we see him DRIVE the blade into the horse’s neck! 
           BLOOD SPEWS. But a DRESSMAKER (48) in her flamboyant hat is 
           unfazed. She’s focused on her alteration of an engraved 
           handkerchief. This is MARM MANDLEBAUM, high-mileage, homely, and 
           fine with both because she ain’t trying to please you anyway. 

           The Wealthy Businessman enters. Dorcy right behind.

                                 DORCY
                        That’s her. This is the place.

                                 MARM
                        Would you two fine gentlemen like 
                        to make a purchase?

                                 WEALTHY BUSINESSMAN 
                        No. I want my wife’s ring back. 

           Marm is uninterested in the dramatics. She scans both men 
           briefly, sizing them up.

                                 MARM
                        I can’t imagine your treasure is  
                        down here. What is it your Madison 
                        Avenue friends call Lower 
                        Manhattan? The bowels of New York?

                        The den of disease. 

                                 MARM
                        Ah. Right. 

                                 DORCY
                        Ma’am -- 

                                 MARM
                        I prefer Marm. It’s much sweeter.

                                 DORCY
                        Marm, a criminal has habits, traits 
                        which reveal their identity to a 
                        skilled investigator. No different 
                        than a blade of grass revealing its 
                        genus to a practiced botanist.

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 MARM
                        So tell me, are you a skilled 
                        investigator or a failed botanist?

                                 DORCY
                        I’m a believer in law and order. 

                                 MARM
                        Yet, you do not bring any chains. 
                        Could it be because New York penal 
                        codes define the receiving of 
                        stolen property as ancillary?

                                 DORCY
                        But still punishable when a thief 
                        provides proof of his transaction.

                                 MARM
                        For whom do I owe the favor?

                                 DORCY
                        Lars Lynch. He told the judge he 
                        brought it here, that you’re a 
                        cleaner for stolen goods.

                                 MARM
                        Merely an accusation. Because it was 
                        Lars who went to prison, wasn’t it? 

           The Wealthy Businessman SLAMS his hand DOWN on the counter.

                                 WEALTHY BUSINESSMAN 
                        Look, we know what happens here. 
                        Garments trimmed with scissors. 
                        Jewelry re-engraved. Pointed 
                        edges, rounded. Rounded edges, 
                        pointed. All ID removed so the 
                        lady herself could not recognize 
                        her ring by evening! 

                                 MARM
                        Perhaps this gentleman should be 
                        the one under investigation...? 

                                 DORCY
                        Perhaps I question your husband.

                                 MARM
                        Perhaps you can show me your badge.

           Dorcy visibly angers. He doesn’t have one.

                        I figured. Real cops focus on real 
                        criminals. So again I ask: would 
                        you two fine gentlemen like to make 
                        a purchase?

           Marm reveals an ALTERED RING. The Businessman recognizes it.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Twelve dollars.

                                 DORCY
                        Ten.

                                 MARM
                        Deal.

                                 WEALTHY BUSINESSMAN 
                        For my own engagement ring?

                                 MARM
                        Why is it that men have a problem 
                        for every solution? 

                                 DORCY
                        Just give her the money. It’s the 
                        best you’re going to get.

           A tiny beat. The Businessman reluctantly hands over $10 and 
           Marm hands him his ring... Then, he SPITS in her face. Dorcy 
           is shocked. But Marm simply sets down her scissors. Unafraid.

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        Every jungle requires a code to 
                        survive. Mine were my ten virtues. 

           He waits for her to retaliate, to incriminate herself. But 
           she allows the saliva to drip down her cheek. Pure defiance.

                                 MARM (V.O)
                        Resilience was my first. 
                        Regardless of circumstance, of 
                        struggle, of what anyone does to 
                        you... No matter how cruel... 
                        Never let them see you sweat. 

           The saliva OOZES down. And Marm smiles at the Businessman. Which 
           makes him angrier. He folds under the pressure and leaves the 
           store. But Dorcy remains, still burned by the “real cop” comment.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Will that be all? Sure you have 
                        some cheating husbands to spy on.

           Dorcy swallows his rage and follows his client outside. Then, 
           finally, she wipes her face and adds her $10 to her purse. 
           This is Marm’s jungle and we’re about to live in it...

           EXT. MANDELBAUM’S DRY GOODS STORE / 79 CLINTON STREET - NIGHT

           Marm locks her store and begins her walk home. She keeps her 
           eyes down, averting gazes from STREET DWELLERS. She spots the 
           dried blood from where the horse carcass lied earlier. A moment 
           of sympathy for the beast of burden, but she keeps on walking.

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S TENEMENT HOME - NIGHT

           Marm enters her confined apartment. Outside FACTORY HUMS provide 
           a soundscape. KEROSINE LANTERNS illuminate sweat beads on HER 
           DAUGHTERS (ANNA 11, GERTIE 14, SARA 15) in makeshift beds.

                                 MARM
                        My darlings.

           In spite of their circumstance, they’re happy to see their 
           mother... until VIOLENT COUGHING emanates from --

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S TENEMENT HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           WOLFE MANDELBAUM (50), a worn and torn German-immigrant, rests 
           on a damp pillow. Beside him is their son JULIUS (16), insecure, 
           always in the way and desperate to be more than he’s capable of. 

                                 JULIUS
                        Mother. We were worried. 

                                 WOLFE
                        He was worried. Like always.

           Marm looks to the other side of the bed at DR. SCHMIDT (30s), an 
           elitist who made it out of the ghetto. He packs his medical box.

                                 DR. SCHMIDT
                        Would you care to sit down?

                                 MARM
                        No. 

                                 DR. SCHMIDT
                        Tuberculosis. Unfortunately, it’s 
                        very common down here.

                                 MARM
                        When does he get better?

                                 WOLFE
                        He’s says I won’t. That I’ll just 
                        waste away...

           Marm looks at Dr. Schmidt for confirmation -- and he bows his 
           head. It’s true. Julius studies Marm for a reaction, but she 
           remains stoic, covering her emotions by reaching for her purse.

                                 MARM
                        How much?

                                 DR. SCHMIDT
                        Including the kids and all the 
                        visits over the last few months... 
                        Thirty four.

                                 MARM
                        I’ll have to stay on credit. You’re 
                        not the only one I owe right now.

                                 DR. SCHMIDT
                        Mrs. Mandelbaum, this only gets 
                        uglier. More painful. Expensive. If 
                        Wolfe doesn’t have his medicine --

                                 MARM
                        He will. 

                                 DR. SCHMIDT
                        Or if your children lack nutrients--

                                 MARM
                        They won’t. Here. For now.

           She gestures $10 that she’s willing to give. He takes it.

                                 DR. SCHMIDT
                        Look, either we settle your debts 
                        in the next few weeks or--

                                 MARM
                        You can’t come anymore. I get it. 

           Off Wolfe’s hacking growing worse...

           Marm, in a pea coat, stands at an intersection of LOITERING 
           GANGSTERS; exchanging loot, drinking, fighting... She enters. 
           And threatening glances are immediately sent her way.

           But Marm persists, searching for one inviting pair of eyes. 
           And she finds them in a FREDDIE, a homeless teenager, near a 
           pushcart of shitty loot (FLOUR, METAL, ROPE).

                                 MARM
                        Evening, young man.

                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 FREDDIE
                        I’m not interested.

                                 MARM
                        But you don’t know what I’m selling.

                                 FREDDIE
                        I’m assuming it’s relations. 

                                 MARM
                        You’re a boy. And no, far more 
                        lucrative: silver and timepieces.

           Marm indicates to BULKY AREAS of her coat. He cocks his head.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        They’ve been in my husband’s family 
                        for generations. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        And you’re bringing them to Thieves 
                        Exchange?

                                 MARM
                        Sentimentality doesn’t pay bills.

           Freddie is intrigued, but clocks the criminals’ angry gazes.

                                 FREDDIE
                        You got some balls comin’ here.

                                 MARM
                        So do you.
                          (re: his shitty loot)
                        Trying to make a profit off trash.

                                 FREDDIE
                        How much for the silver?

                                 MARM
                        A quarter.

                                 FREDDIE
                        Ten cents.

                                 MARM
                        Fifty cents.

                                 FREDDIE
                        That’s not how this works.

                                 MARM
                        Final offer. No engravings and it’s 
                        not hot. You could flip it tonight.

           Just as Freddie considers -- Marm is BUMPED. HARD. 

           SILVER falls from her dress. She turns to find JOHN GRADY (32), 
           a career criminal who wears his scars like badges of honor.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Pardon me.

           Marm bends down to retrieve her silver. Grady towers over her.

                                 GRADY
                        This ain’t the place for manners. 

           But as she turns to go, Grady stops her with his bear-claw.

                                 GRADY (CONT'D)
                        Nah, nah, nah. The silver first.

                                 MARM
                        Okay. What’s your offer?

           Grady pulls a blade, taunting Marm. Marm searches for help. 
           But no one cares to. They want to see blood.

                                 GRADY
                        Go on: scream. Here, let me do it 
                        for you: Someone help this old hag! 
                        She’s being raped!... Hold on... 
                        Wait one God-forsaken minute! She 
                        likes it! Yes! It’s been years 
                        since a man’s touched her like 
                        this! But-- But it’s-- Oh, God, 
                        it’s a disaster down here! Somebody 
                        bring rags! She’s fixen to blow!

           THIEVES LAUGH. Marm stares into Grady’s haunted eyes -- and then  *
           SWATS his hand away! She won’t be their clown. 

           Grady responds by GRABBING HER BY THE NECK. Tense beat. In a 
           flip from earlier, this is not her jungle. So she hands over 
           her silver. And Grady releases his choke. THEN -- 

           He TOSSES the silver into the crowd. Thieves CHEER, GRASP for 
           it. Marm watches the animals scavenge her family’s nest egg -- 
           as Grady stares her down, DARING her to make a move for it --

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        Failure. Number two. It teaches us 
                        more than success. A hungry 
                        stomach, an empty pocket, and a 
                        broken heart give us our best 
                        lessons... Listen and learn.

           -- But she doesn’t. She just retreats out and to safety.

           EXT. STREET / ALLEY NEAR THIEVES EXCHANGE - NIGHT

           Her brisk walk comes to a slow once she reaches a quiet street. 
           Anxiety washes over her... regret... defeat... THEN --

           WHIMPERS sound off from the alley ahead. No one notices. Or 
           cares. But Marm’s instincts kick in: could it be an abandoned 
           baby? A woman in danger? She peeks between buildings to find: 

           SOPHIE ELKINS (18), ethereal beauty and magnetic presence, but 
           desperate in every way, right down to her super-tight-corset.

                                 MARM
                        Dear...? Are you hurt?

           Marm approaches Sophie who scoots backward, apprehensive like a 
           hungry street dog. Once Marm reaches her, she gently touches her. 

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        It’s not safe for a young girl 
                        like you at this hour.

           Sophie arches her eyebrows, feeling challenged.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Might be worse for a lady like you.

                                 MARM
                        It might. What’s wrong? Where are 
                        your parents?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Sing Sing.

           Sophie bursts into tears. But this time Marm takes her into 
           her arms like a child. And Sophie allows it.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Look, I ain’t no whore. 

                                 MARM
                        Pardon?

                                 SOPHIE
                        I know what business old maids got 
                        at night... No offense or nothin’.

                                 MARM
                        None taken. I’ve earned my 
                        wrinkles. I’m proud of my wrinkles. 
                        And I would never ask a girl to 
                        sell herself out.

                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 SOPHIE
                        Right. You was just comin’ to check 
                        on a homeless girl.

                                 MARM
                        Who was crying. But seems as if 
                        you’re fine so I won’t be a bother.

           Marm pulls away from the embrace. But Sophie holds onto it.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Wait. How about some charity before 
                        you go?

           Marm takes a moment. That one tagged her the wrong way.

                                 MARM
                        You expect a stranger to just offer 
                        you help because you are upset?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Ain’t that why you came?  

                                 MARM
                          (Marm’s actual quote)
                        Dear, I’m a Jew, an immigrant, and 
                        a woman. I know exactly how it 
                        feels when the world tries to tell 
                        you that you’re nothing. Sometimes 
                        we even believe it. But no one 
                        changes their fortune by begging... 
                        So drop the sob story and go tell 
                        the world who you are.

           Marm forces herself out of the embrace and rises to leave.

                                 SOPHIE
                        All high and mighty but what about 
                        who you are?.. A woman only keeps 
                        her ring hidden when she’s out 
                        being naughty...

           Sophie reveals MARM’S RING. Marm feels her empty pocket.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Sorry, I get tingly when it’s that 
                        easy. You can thank my mother for 
                        that. She always said opportunity 
                        was made out of misfortune. 

                                 MARM
                        Give me my ring back.

                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 SOPHIE
                        Let’s talk first. Where you coming 
                        from if you ain’t a madame? 

                                 MARM
                        Hasn’t anyone ever told you that 
                        it’s not polite to ask questions?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Isn’t that a question?

           Sophie smirks. Marm finds her moment and SNATCHES HER RING.

                                 MARM
                        A good thief never takes her eye 
                        off the loot. Your mother should 
                        have taught you the basics. 

           Marm stuffs her ring back into her breast pocket and feels 
           for her other items in her coat. All of them are still there.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Take care of yourself out here.

           Marm walks off before anything else goes wrong tonight. 

           INT. MANDELBAUM'S TENEMENT HOME - NIGHT

           Marm tip toes in. Her daughters and Julius are sleeping. She 
           blows out the lanterns and retreats into the shadows toward -- 

           THE CHIMNEY. Marm removes the false back revealing a 
           DUMBWAITER holding FAMILY HEIRLOOMS. She empties her pockets 
           and places the timepieces from her coat on the dumbwaiter. 

           Then, with a YANK of a lever, it RAISES UPWARD into hiding... 

           She reaches into her breast pocket and takes out her wedding 
           ring. She puts it back on her finger... and a wave of concern 
           washes over her face... THE RING IS LOOSE. It is not hers.

                                 MARM (PRE-LAP)
                        Please forgive me...

           INT. MANDELBAUM'S TENEMENT HOME - DAY

           Wolfe has worsened, evident by BLOOD on his pillow. He CRINGES 
           with every rise of his chest while staring at the false ring.

                                 WOLFE
                        All you had to do was look at it.

                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 MARM
                        It was dark. I was in an alley... 
                        And I was scared...

                                 WOLFE
                        Since when do you scare?

                                 MARM
                        I was at Thieves Exchange.

           That lands on Wolfe. Surprise. Concern. Realizing:

                                 WOLFE
                        You were going to sell your ring? 

                                 MARM
                        First, I was trying to sell what 
                        your grandmother left us.

           Disappointment quietly washes over Wolfe’s face. Marm, 
           ashamed, puts the false ring away. A down beat.

                                 WOLFE
                        Tell Julius he’s done with school. 

                                 MARM
                        He’s two years from graduating.

                                 WOLFE
                        But you need help. 

                                 MARM
                        And I’ll figure it out. I’m not 
                        sending our son to the streets.

                                 WOLFE
                        So you’re going to sell our 
                        family’s history on them?

                                 MARM
                        How else am I going to afford your 
                        medicine? Food for the children? 
                        Rent?... The store isn’t enough. It 
                        hasn’t been for a while now.

           The couple begins speaking German so the kids can’t hear.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Castle Garden. Our first steps in 
                        America. We made a promise...

                                 MARM
                        Which means giving our son a chance 
                        to build his life how he chooses.

           A beat. 

                                 WOLFE
                        Then have mercy on me.

                                 MARM
                        How do you mean? 

                                 WOLFE
                        My lungs, my stomach... My head. 
                        It all feels like the Devil’s ass.
                        It’s only a matter of time anyway.

           Wolfe indicates the pillow. Marm studies him, carefully.

                                 MARM
                        Wolfe... What’re you asking of me?

                                 WOLFE
                        We can’t afford another burden. And 
                        that’s all I’ll be until... I waste 
                        away.

                                 MARM
                        And then what?

                                 WOLFE
                        You’ll figure it out.

                                 MARM
                        No.

                                 WOLFE
                        You can do more than anyone gives 
                        you credit for --

                                 MARM
                        -- I know what I’m capable of -- 

                                 WOLFE
                        -- But not with me around. I’m 
                        suffering --

                                 MARM
                        -- And I can’t, I won’t --

                                 WOLFE
                        They’re suffering.

           Silence. Wolfe grasps Marm’s hand and looks in her eyes.

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 WOLFE (CONT'D)
                        Castle Garden.

           A tiny beat. Marm flicks her eyes away and stares at the pillow.

                                 WOLFE (CONT'D)
                        You have to. Please... I love you, 
                        my dear... But I’m ready now.

           He uses his last bit of strength to place her hands and the 
           pillow over his face. Marm takes a moment as her sick husband 
           lies still, desperately wanting out of this life...

                                 MARM
                        I love you, too, Wolfe.

           Then, she puts pressure on the pillow, suffocating her husband. 
           He doesn’t struggle though his body instinctively flails. She 
           keeps an eye on the door to ensure her children don’t enter as 
           she holds the pillow firmly over their father’s face... 

           And then... Wolfe’s body goes limp... Marm keeps the pillow 
           there, angry she had to do it, afraid to look... And after a 
           few moments, she exhales... And it’s not one of relief.

           EXT. GRAVEYARD - THE MANDELBAUMS PLOT - DAY

           The ORANGE SUNSET casts a glow over a turn-of-the-century 
           graveyard; elaborate shrines for the haves and crooked graves 
           for the have-nots. A stoic Marm stands over her children who 
           kneel before a crooked stone: WOLFE MANDELBAUM 1819-1869. 

           REVEAL IN THE DISTANCE: Dr. Schmidt spying this portrait of 
           a shattered family from a cushy horse & carriage with a 
           YOUNG COUPLE in the back. The Young husband pulls his Young 
           Wife closer... as Dr. Schmidt steps out... 

           BACK TO: Marm comforting her children. After a few moments...

                                 DR. SCHMIDT
                        My condolences... Wolfe was a great 
                        man, a wonderful father...

                                 MARM
                        Doctor Schmidt?... 
                          (then, realizing)
                        Oh, right. Your money.

                                 DR. SCHMIDT
                        Please. I’m not here to collect.
                          (off her look)
                        I’m just here to talk about your 
                        debts. Privately.

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           Dr. Schmidt indicates to her children. Marm grows curious, 
           and steps aside. They talk in whispers:

                                 DR. SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
                        You have a long road ahead. So do 
                        they. And I don’t want to make it 
                        longer... And well...
                          (then)
                        Mr. and Mrs. Kittle are a fine pair 
                        of folks... cursed by infertility.

           Marm clocks the CARRIAGE. The couple gently smiles. She doesn’t.

                                 MARM
                        Surely a sea of gravestones won’t 
                        lift their curse.

                                 DR. SCHMIDT
                        But your daughter could. 

                                 MARM
                        What did you just say to me?

                                 DR. SCHMIDT
                        Listen, Mothers do it all the time 
                        these days.

           Marm scoffs. But Dr. Schmidt continues his pitch:

                                 DR. SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
                        They are offering one thousand 
                        dollars for your youngest. Cash. 

           He expects that to land in a big way. It doesn’t. Instead, 
           Marm takes out $34 from her purse and drops it at his feet.

                                 MARM
                        I suppose I’ll skip dinner this week. 

                                 DR. SCHMIDT
                        Miss Mandelbaum... You have four 
                        children and a failed dry goods 
                        store... What are you going to do?

                                 MARM
                        That doesn’t concern you. We have 
                        no more business together, Doctor.

                                 DR. SCHMIDT
                        Do you really want your pride to be 
                        the reason they suffer?

           That pissed Marm off. But for the first time, she doesn’t have 
           a quip. Instead, she pushes past and back to her children.

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 MARM
                        Come on. We’ve had enough. No 
                        one’s accomplished anything by 
                        just dwelling in their misery.

           With tears in their eyes, the children stand and glance back 
           at Dr. Schmidt and the money... They’re confused. But before 
           they can ask, Marm ushers them away from the gravestone... 

           And as they walk off, Marm’s facade of strength is beginning 
           to shatter... She has no fucking idea what she’s going to do.

           EXT. STREET - EVENING

           Sophie is jolly as she walks down the street, grazed by the 
           final rays of sunset. From a distance, we watch her locking 
           eyes with every PASSING MAN on his way home from work. THEN --

           She COLLIDES with A DISTRACTED MAN. Sophie uses her hands 
           to brace his chest for impact.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Ow!

           STREET DWELLERS turn their eyes to the commotion. Sophie 
           clutches her bruised chest.

                                 DISTRACTED MAN
                        I’m so sorry!

           Sophie eyes him -- considers making a scene -- but feels pity 
           for the pathetic bastard. So she just moves forward. It’s his 
           lucky day. He watches her go as she turns the corner to enter --  *

           THE ALLEY. Sophie walks in, swallowed into the darkness. Just 
           then, she pulls out a SILVER TIME PIECE. She’s delighted by 
           her new item and she inspects it closely when --

           We spot Marm eerily silhouetted behind her. Menacing as she also  *
           enters the alley. And as she approaches, Sophie has no idea... 

                                 MARM
                        You’re pretty good at this.

           Sophie SPINS around --

                                 SOPHIE
                        It’s mine -- I swear!

           But then she recognizes Marm. And IMMEDIATELY jumps backward.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        I already hocked your ring!

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 MARM
                        I hope you got a good deal. But I’m 
                        here for something more valuable.

           Marm inches toward Sophie as she backs into a CONCRETE WALL.

                                 MARM
                                   (CONT'D)
                        Recruitment. 

           That’s NOT what Sophie was expecting. She studies Marm, puzzled. *

                                 MARM
                                   (CONT'D)
                        Let’s earn a living. Me and you.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Oh. You want me to steal for you. 

                                 MARM
                        I want you to embrace your God-given 
                        talent. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        He didn’t give me none of that.

           Marm indicates the stolen timepiece.

                                 MARM
                        Darling, we are all born with a 
                        skill and we don’t get to choose 
                        what it is. I’m a caretaker. You’re 
                        a thief.

                                 SOPHIE
                        You think I want to do what I do?

                                 MARM
                        Certainly not. That’s why I need you. 
                        And frankly, it’s why you need me, 
                        too.

           Sophie folds her arms. That means she’s listening.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        When the rich break laws, it’s 
                        called business. But when the poor 
                        retaliate, it’s called crime. 
                        Perhaps it’s time to blend the two. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        How so?

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 MARM
                        Honor as thieves. We organize our 
                        crime and play by the same flexible 
                        rules as the Forbes or Vanderbilts. 
                        No violence. Some fibbing. Everyone 
                        eats.

           Sophie eyes glisten, but she’s still apprehensive.

                                 SOPHIE
                        And I should trust you because...

                                 MARM
                        I didn’t take you to the police. 
                        Yet. So are you interested?

                                 SOPHIE
                          (considering, then)
                        When do we start? 

                                 MARM
                        First, we educate. Assemble. And 
                        then, we attack.

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S SCHOOL FOR CRIMINALS - GRAND STREET - DAY 

           Marm pontificates in front of a CHALKBOARD chock full of 
           writing. Sophie is the only student in the classroom.

                                 MARM
                        Never write when you can speak. 
                        Never speak when you can nod. Never 
                        nod when you can wink.

                                 SOPHIE
                        So... I’m not going to learn any 
                        practical skills then? I don’t 
                        know, like reading or writing? 

                                 MARM
                        Dear, you’re learning communication 
                        right now. Next is mathematics -- 

           Marm points to an area which reads: “CALCULATING A SALE.”

                        Then, economics --

           Underneath that: “SUPPLY AND DEMAND.” She continues pointing 
           around to various phrases on the board:

           Marm points to her quote: “LIFE IS ALWAYS MORE VALUABLE THAN LOOT.” 

                                 MARM
                                   (CONT'D)
                        So pay attention and I’ll teach you 
                        every life skill you’ll ever need.

           Sophie is in over her head as Marm continues writing her list.

           EXT. THIEVES EXCHANGE - BROADWAY/HOUSTON INTERSECTION - DAY

           Marm and Sophie stand at Thieves Exchange. Marm holds a BAG.

                                 MARM
                        It’s the Silk Road of New York.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What the heck is the silk road?

                                 MARM
                        Criminals exchange everything here. 
                        Loot, secrets, even people. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Is it dangerous?

                                 MARM
                        Of course.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Then why are you sending me alone?

                                 MARM
                        Last time I tried, I was nearly 
                        killed. But you’re softer than me. 
                        You can convince them to listen.

                                 SOPHIE
                        And if the Grady Gang is here? 

                                 MARM
                        It’s Sunday and Grady fancies 
                        himself as a man of God. 

           Marm shoves the BAG into her arms and nudges her forward...

           Sophie enters, passing the same GANGSTERS that hated Marm, 
           but now their gazes aren’t threatening. They’re lustful. 
           Sophie ignores them all, continuing toward -- 

           Freddie. The homeless teen with the shitty loot. He’s 
           surrounded by ORPHANS (5-15). Sophie sets the bag down.

           Freddie looks inside: STACKS OF HOMECOOKED MEALS. The smell 
           causes the Orphans to look, too. Rumbling stomachs. Hungry eyes. 

           FROM AFAR, Marm delightfully watches as Freddie hands out meals.

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S SCHOOL FOR CRIMINALS - GRAND STREET - DAY 

           Marm’s chalkboard has lessons written all over. Now, Sophie 
           is sitting in the classroom PACKED with ORPHANS. The students 
           are fully engaged as Marm continues her lesson...

                                 MARM (V.O.)

                        eat for a day. Earn a man’s 
                        loyalty, you’ll eat for a lifetime.

           INT. CONGREGATION TEMPLE RODEPH SHOLOM - SHABBAT EVENING

           THE CONGREGATION listens to their beloved RABBI DAVID SCHMIDT 
           (50s). In the back pew: Marm sits between her kids & Sophie.

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        The street kids were the eyes and 
                        ears of the city. And no one cared 
                        for them. Not until I cared. And 
                        well, the future is either your 
                        greatest ally or greatest enemy... 

           Marm glares at SEVEN ORPHANS in the same row goofing around. 

                                 MARM
                        Hush up. The Rabbi will pray for 
                        you and he will save your soul. 
                        Trust me, you’re going to need it.

           The Orphans quiet and look at the Rabbi. Marm turns around. 
           But we see Julius enviously staring at the street kids... 

           EXT. CONGREGATION TEMPLE RODEPH SHOLOM - LATER

           Marm waits in a LINE of WORSHIPPERS greeting the Rabbi. Her 
           daughters are star struck as they near closer. Sophie is 
           unfazed. But Julius keeps an eye across the street --

           An ORPHAN BEGS a WELL-DRESSED-MAN for change. While the mark’s 
           distracted, Freddie sneaks behind to pick the man’s pocket -- 

           Once he scores, the kids BOOK IT down the street. As shocked 
           HEADS turn toward the crime, Marm feigns surprise, too, stowing 
           away her satisfaction with the orphans.

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S DRY GOODS STORE - BACK ROOM - DAY

           Surrounded by DRY GOODS STORAGE, Marm inspects TEN TIMEPIECES 
           while Sophie keeps watch by the door for customers. 

                                 MARM
                        Always inspect what the kids give 
                        us. You put bad eggs with good 
                        ones, it’ll rot the carton.

                                 SOPHIE
                        But at some point, you’ve got to 
                        cook the eggs.
                          (off Marm’s look)
                        All we’ve been doing is stealing, 
                        recruiting, or hiding loot away.

                                 MARM
                        Yes. Stocking inventory.

                                 SOPHIE
                        And when do we start moving the 
                        inventory to sellers?

                                 MARM
                        Once I’ve made crime my commodity 
                        to barter. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Marm, I’m aware of the mission 
                        statement. But I need to know when 
                        it becomes more than just words. 

                                 MARM
                        When we have the community in the 
                        palm of our hands. Business is 
                        about calculated risk.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Well, what are we still 
                        calculating? Our luck?

           Marm reaches between BLANKETS and dumps all ten timepieces 
           into a HIDDEN CHEST.

                                 MARM
                        Luck lives on Madison Avenue. Here, 
                        we work for what we have.

           Marm stuffs the chest away and heads back into --

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S DRY GOODS STORE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Marm positions herself behind the counter. Sophie follows.

                        Look, we’ve educated. We’ve 
                        assembled. Now, when do we attack?

                                 MARM
                        When we have a cop on payroll.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Are you crazy? No-no-no-no. 

                                 MARM
                        Sophie, once we have the law, we 
                        have the community. Then and only 
                        then can we attack the criminals.

                                 SOPHIE
                        You’ve got this ass backwards.

                                 MARM
                        Why can’t you be patient? Do you 
                        have four children? 

                                 SOPHIE
                        No.

                                 MARM
                        Do you owe debts on multiple bills?

                                 SOPHIE
                        No.

                                 MARM
                        Do you have a dead husband?

                                 SOPHIE
                        I wish.

           The admission surprises Marm. It hangs in the air for a moment.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        I married him when I was 14 to get 
                        off the streets. My mother left me 
                        at a market because her new man 
                        didn’t want someone else’s kids. So 
                        I made it work. At least for a 
                        while. And I thought you were my 
                        way out... so you know... I don’t 
                        have to repeat it all over again 
                        with some other pathetic brute. 

           A pregnant beat. Marm sees pain in her eyes. Her story is true.

                                 MARM
                        Okay. You can live with me for now.

                        No. You’re not understanding.

                                 MARM
                        Sophie, I do. I get it. We are all 
                        a prisoner of some memory.

           Sophie sees pain right back in Marm’s eyes. But doesn’t press.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Maybe, fine. But I didn’t sign up 
                        for this to be someone’s burden. 

                                 MARM
                        Family is never supposed to be a 
                        burden. And that’s what we need to 
                        be before we make our move... 
                        Otherwise, we’re just like the 
                        rest of ‘em.

           Marm moves toward Sophie and grabs her hands.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        I’m going to give you things your 
                        own mother didn’t. Like love. All I 
                        ask in return is for your loyalty. 
                        Like a real daughter. You can even 
                        start calling me “Mother.” If it 
                        makes you feel good... So what do 
                        you say, Sophie?

           Sophie smiles. A haunting, desperate smile...

                                 JULIUS (PRE-LAP)
                        Why can’t I help you at the store?

           INT. THE MANDELBAUM'S TENEMENT HOME - KITCHENETTE - EVENING

           An awkward dinner. Marm sits across Julius and her daughters. 
           All the children stare across the table at -- Sophie.

                                 MARM
                        You have school to finish.

                                 JULIUS
                        Then I can help you at night... 
                        with your other stuff.

                                 MARM
                        What other stuff?

           Julius indicates to his sisters, not wanting to say.

                        Go on. Secrets kill families.

                                 JULIUS
                        I know why you help those orphans. 
                        I saw the false chimney before you 
                        moved everything to your store... I 
                        know why Sophie is here.

                                 MARM
                        Do your sisters know?

                                 JULIUS
                        No. You can trust me. 

                                 MARM
                        Girls, I’m a fence. I’m sorry your 
                        brother hasn’t already told you.

           CLANGS of silverware. Julius was NOT expecting that.

                                 GERTIE
                        Does that mean you steal?

                                 JULIUS
                        Yes.

                                 MARM
                        No. It means I borrow someone’s 
                        belongings until another person 
                        pays for them.

                                 SARA
                        Is that why you came to New York?

                                 JULIUS
                        She came for the American Dream.

                                 MARM
                        No. I came to break away from my 
                        family.

           A rare moment of vulnerability. No one knows that story. And 
           no one has the guts to ask.

                                 ANNA
                        ... Did Papa know what you did?

                                 JULIUS
                        No.

                                 MARM
                        Yes. I guess you aren’t as astute 
                        as you thought, Julius. Best for 
                        you to stay in school.

                                 JULIUS
                        Wait. Father let you do this?

                                 MARM
                        Who do you think taught me? He had 
                        a pawn shop in Bavaria.
                          (then, to the girls)
                        But it’s only for now. To get us 
                        ahead. And Sophie is helping me do 
                        that while she stays with us... If 
                        that’s okay with all of you.

           A moment. Sophie smiles at the girls. And they return the smile.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Oh, joy!

           But when Marm looks to Julius for approval... He grimaces.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        One day you’ll understand.

           Off Julius, a family forming whether he likes it or not... 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           A turn-of-the-century hotel room. Sophie passionately kisses 
           TOMAS “SHANG” DRAPER (33), a large man born with the safety 
           off, and an underlying darkness like Joaquin Phoenix. 

           He presses her against the wall, turned on. Impatient. Ready 
           to go as he reaches under her dress --

                                 SOPHIE
                        You must be married.

                                 SHANG
                        Only a little.

           Sophie shoves him onto the bed. Shang loves the aggression. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Well, I don’t know about her. But I 
                        need a little foreplay first.

           He watches as Sophie unbuttons her dress down to undergarments. 
           Just as her fingers reach beneath her underwear -- she STOPS.

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Strip. All of it.

           Without any kind of show, Shang instantly gets nude and tosses his 
           clothes aside --

                                 SHANG
                        Your turn. Finish.

           But Sophie SNATCHES his clothes and moves to the closed door.

                                 SOPHIE
                        In your dreams, creep. 

           The DOOR BURSTS OPEN and it’s Marm, holding the HOTEL KEY.

                                 MARM
                        Shall she scream or would you like 
                        to play ball?

                                 SHANG
                        Is this part of the service?

                                 MARM
                        No, you idiot.

                                 SHANG
                        Oh. I get it now. Well, before you 
                        ask me to buy my wardrobe back, you 
                        might wanna look in my pocket.

           Sophie reaches into his pocket and... pulls out a POLICE BADGE.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Mother?!

           And Marm CLOSES the door. Sophie drops the damsel in distress 
           act. She has an evil grin as she hands Marm his POLICE WEAPON.

                                 SHANG
                        What the fuck? You two broads are 
                        cop killers?

           Shang braces himself to fight but Marm sets the gun aside. 
           Instead, she grabs the POLICE BADGE and holds it up -- 

                                 MARM
                        You haven’t made detective yet. 

                                 SHANG
                        I’m saving up for that.

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 MARM
                        So the NYPD still requires you to 
                        pay for your own promotion?

                                 SHANG
                        Lady, if you think I haven’t been 
                        offered side cash from a perp 
                        trying to get out of an arrest --

                                 MARM
                        I am an organizer offering payroll.

           Beat. Shang wasn’t expecting that.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        In exchange, you protect us from 
                        the law and the streets. Quick, 
                        easy money. We crack no safes, 
                        dodge no bullets, pick no locks. 
                        We work with our neighbors.

                                 SHANG
                        Who’s we?

                                 MARM
                        At the moment? Me, her, and a bunch 
                        of orphans.

                                 SHANG
                        That’s your gang?

                                 MARM
                        My business. Designed for people 
                        who don’t want to just survive the 
                        streets. They want to run them...
                          (then)
                        Or did you give up that dream?

                                 SHANG
                        How do you mean?

                                 MARM
                        Well, at the precinct, you’re a 
                        dutiful policeman... But Officer 
                        Draper used to be a different man. 
                        He used to chase his desires.

           Shang studies her, allows her to keep going...

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Satan’s Circus. You were “Shang.” 
                        Earned the nickname by shanghaiing 
                        drunk fellas by the East River on 
                        ships to Europe.

                                 SHANG
                        Who the hell are you?

                                 MARM
                        An old lady who asks a bunch of 
                        innocent questions and the street 
                        always answers... You were a nasty 
                        son of a bitch. 

                                 SHANG
                        I was.

                                 MARM
                        Did you like that son of a bitch?

                                 SHANG
                        ... I did.

                                 MARM
                        Then be that son of a bitch again. 
                        But this time -- with the badge. 

           Beat. 

                                 SHANG
                        And how are you two gonna gain turf 
                        on boys like Traveling John Grady 
                        and Killer Kyle McCrow?

                                 MARM
                        We live in the shadows. We’re 
                        relegated to being servants, 
                        housemaids. Women can’t even 
                        legally buy a beer. And when no one 
                        suspects you of doing much of 
                        anything, then they don’t expect 
                        you to strike, either... We don’t 
                        forget. We don’t react with 
                        violence. And we don’t rat. No. A 
                        woman -- a real woman -- knows 
                        loyalty. Honor. Family. And that’s 
                        what crime should be about. And 
                        what ours will be about.

           Marm sees Shang considering and she goes for the kill:

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        So... Shang, I am offering you the 
                        opportunity to be yourself again. 

           Off Shang’s intrigue...

           EXT. LORD & TAYLOR DEPARTMENT STORE - “LADIES MILE” - DAY

           In the real-life row of Department Stores in Gilded Age, WOMEN, 
           stroll on the arms of MEN, fawning over window displays. Marm 
           turns the corner, in raggedy clothing. Sophie follows also in 
           subpar duds, insecure as she waddles in her wide-legged dress.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What knuck sewed this horrid thing?

                                 MARM
                        I did. Look, no matter how 
                        expensive their heels are, they’re 
                        walking on the same ground as you.

           The ladies stop before the entrance. Sophie waits, incredulous.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Do you think I’m going to start 
                        opening my own doors now, too?

           Marm rolls her eyes and opens the door. As Sophie enters --

           INT. LORD & TAYLOR DEPARTMENT STORE - LADIES MILE - LATER

           Wealthy. White. Women. Shopping. Marm browses silk while 
           keeping her eye on the -- 

           DIAMOND COUNTER where Sophie flirts with a MALE CLERK (20s). 

           But Marm’s gaze is interrupted by a judgey FEMALE CLERK (30s).

                                 FEMALE CLERK
                        Excuse me, Miss?

                                 MARM
                        I’m okay. Thank you.

                                 FEMALE CLERK
                        I’ve had my eye on you since you 
                        walked in here.

                                 MARM
                        Oh?

                                 FEMALE CLERK
                        I know a thief when I see one.

           Marm focuses on the Female Clerk.

                                 MARM
                        Quite the accusation. 

           Marm sneaks a glance to Sophie -- DIAMONDS now out before her.

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Let me tell you what I see.

           Marm sizes the Female Clerk up and then dives in:

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        I see a woman forced to work 
                        because of a husband who can’t earn 
                        enough. You chose Lord and Taylor 
                        because it allows you to rub elbows 
                        with the versions of yourself you 
                        desperately want to be. Pampered. 
                        Beautiful. Wealthy. Your dream as a 
                        little girl. Hey, maybe you’ll even 
                        get some double takes... That’d 
                        make you feel good, right? Because 
                        all of this distracts you from the 
                        real version of yourself that keeps 
                        you awake at night. Becoming me. A 
                        woman who doesn’t belong. But 
                        here’s a little secret from an old 
                        lady, you will never belong. So 
                        take your eye off of me and look at 
                        the bitch in the mirror.

           The Female Clerk looks at Marm, shocked. Shaken. Muttering.

                                 FEMALE CLERK
                        I... would like...

                                 MARM
                        Don’t mumble now. Go on and make 
                        your commotion.

           The Female Clerk stuffs away her tears and then GRABS MARM.

                                 FEMALE CLERK
                        Gypsy! Someone call a policeman! 

           Heads turn. Bingo. As chaos erupts, Sophie and Male Clerk also 
           look up. Sophie JUMPS back, KNOCKING OVER THE DIAMOND TRAY-- 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Oh my, God. I’m so sorry.

           Diamonds SCATTER on the floor! Male Clerk RUSHES around to 
           collect his diamonds, brushing Sophie -- who FALLS to the ground. 

           Her wide dress landing right over a clump of diamonds. 

           Customers turn as Sophie begins WAILING, nursing her knee. 

                                 COP (O.S.)
                        Out of the way!
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 FEMALE CLERK
                        Check this woman’s ankles.

           A UNIFORMED OFFICER rushes in --  

                                 SHANG
                        Who attacked this young lady?

           But the cop is SHANG. And he looks right past the Female 
           Clerk who points at Marm -- to Sophie, on the ground.

                                 SOPHIE
                        He did.

           She points to the Male Clerk. Customers nod. Shang takes out 
           his BATON and approaches... Now, everyone’s attention is 
           fully on the Male Clerk who gets down on his knees, afraid...

           And Marm slips out. Sophie stands and waddles her way out, 
           too. A masterful bait and switch. And just as the Male Clerk 
           is handcuffed we see one INTRIGUED CUSTOMER in the corner: 

           GEORGE LESLIE (26), charming like Gosling, well-dressed like 
           Clooney, but a meticulous perfectionist. He witnessed 
           everything... and he’s impressed.

           EXT. LORD & TAYLOR DEPT. STORE - LADIES MILE - MOMENTS LATER

           Sophie finds Marm waiting for her. They share a smile as Marm 
           reaches under her dress to retrieve FIVE STOLEN DIAMONDS.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Smooth as a baby’s bottom. 

                                 MARM
                        Patience always pays off, my dear.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I’ll admit it. You were right.

           Marm grins as she puts the loot under her hat before they fold 
           into the crowd.

                                 MARM
                        And now we attack.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What do you have in mind?

                                 MARM
                        Nothing fancy. We just announce 
                        we’re open for business...

           As our POV rises like a skyscraper, we CROSSFADE TO:
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           EXT. THIEVES EXCHANGE - BROADWAY/HOUSTON INTERSECTION - NIGHT

           Marm and Sophie enter the belly of the beast. But this time, 
           they fearlessly beeline past the CRIMINAL GAZES -- to Freddie 
           and a THICK PACK of STREET KIDS who form a circle.

           Marm enters the circle with Sophie. And Freddie closes it off 
           by moving one of his tables. Marm is temporarily guarded.

                                 MARM
                          (to Freddie)
                        Stand strong. I’ll be quick.

           Freddie nods. And then, Marm removes A DIAMOND from her hat -- 
           and stands on a crate and calls out:

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        This is a 2 carat African diamond.

           THE SPARKLING ROCK captures every criminal’s attention. 
           Including Grady, who eyes Marm from afar, incredulous, pissed 
           that she didn’t take his warning seriously... Marm continues:

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Starting tomorrow, I will be 
                        selling high quality goods just 
                        like this out of my store on 79 
                        Clinton Street. That is my Thieves 
                        Exchange. My prices are fair. And 
                        all are welcome.

           Grady moves with his crew, ready to plow over the kids. THEN --

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Thank you everyone for your time.

           Marm FLICKS the DIAMOND in the air! Every criminal is in awe, 
           focused on the Diamond’s trajectory. As they form a THICK 
           PACK, waiting for its descent -- 

           Marm slips between and leads Sophie and the Orphans out of 
           Thieves Exchange before Grady and his crew can get to them.

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        Respect. It comes from fear or 
                        admiration. They chose fear. So I 
                        chose to be unique. And that’s how 
                        I gained my turf in New York City.

           The DIAMOND CRASHES to the ground and CHAOS ERUPTS! Every 
           THIEF fighting for ownership... Off Grady realizing he just 
           gained a new competitor.

           EXT. ELDRIDGE ST. POLICE STATION - SERGEANT’S OFFICE - DAY

           ANGLE ON: The precinct. Uneventful. A few CIVILIANS talk 
           outside. After a moment, TWO NYPD OFFICERS (SERGEANT, 30s & 
           BEAT COP, 20s) emerge. They continue talking before stopping 
           at a HORSE & CARRIAGE. We spy from across the street. 

           After a moment, Beat Cop offers a goodbye handshake, and 
           walks down the road. The Sergeant gets into his carriage...

           REVEAL Dorcy, watching from afar. And as soon as the carriage 
           trots forward, Dorcy approaches. The Sergeant notices.

                                 SERGEANT
                        God damn it.

           And he quickly checks around, ensuring no one is watching. 

                                 SERGEANT
                                       (CONT'D)
                        What’d I tell you about coming to 
                        my precinct?

                                 DORCY
                        I’m walking on the street. You’re 
                        in a carriage. We just happen to be 
                        going the same way.

           It’s true. Dorcy walks in unison with the carriage. But from 
           afar, they don’t appear to be together.

                                 DORCY
                                    (CONT'D)
                        Did you review my application?

                                 SERGEANT
                        Yes. 

                                 DORCY
                        And?

                                 SERGEANT
                        Same answer as the last precinct.

           Dorcy sinks but quickly rebounds by pulling out a LIST.

                                 DORCY
                        Pawn shops. I’ve documented every 
                        one in the area. Now, if you hire 
                        me, we can take out the middle man--

                                 SERGEANT
                        Just go to another state. 

                                 DORCY
                        I wanna be a cop in New York.
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 SERGEANT
                        Why?

                                 DORCY
                        You know why.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Well, he’s the reason you keep 
                        getting rejected. No one wants to 
                        hire the son of a crooked cop. 

                                 DORCY
                        He was undercover.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Look, go bring your conspiracies to 
                        the publications.

                                 DORCY
                        I’ve tried.

           The Sergeant ruffles the reigns slightly, causing the horse 
           to pick up the pace. But Dorcy keeps up.

                                 DORCY
                                    (CONT'D)
                        Maybe I should bring the papers my 
                        suspicion that a sergeant in Lower 
                        Manhattan likes to frequent the 
                        casinos at night.

           Finally, the Sergeant makes eye contact with Dorcy.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Is that a threat?

                                 DORCY
                        I don’t know. Is it?

           Beat. Dorcy has him hooked.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Okay. Listen. If you want to 
                        restore your family’s name, bring 
                        me an 800 pound gorilla wrapped in 
                        a nice bow. All I have to do is 
                        cuff him. Then, we’ll talk. 
                          (then, direct)
                        But if you keep stalking me, I 
                        promise you’ll rot in a jail cell. 
                        Do not fuck with me again, kid.

           Dorcy stops as he watches the Sergeant go with a smile. Off 
           this dog with a bone...

           INT. CONGREGATION TEMPLE RODEPH SHOLOM - EVENING

           A LINE OF WORSHIPPERS greet the Mandelbaum family before 
           service. LAWYER BILL HOWE (40s), a beanstalk, shakes her hand.

                                 BILL HOWE
                        You won’t find a better lawyer in 
                        Lower Manhattan...

                                 MARM
                        Shabbat Shalom.

           Marm smiles. Bill heads off. Next up is Rabbi David Schmidt 
           (whom we saw earlier) -- in his new TALLIT.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Oh, it looks delightful.

                                 RABBI SCHMIDT
                        It was a very generous gift.

                                 MARM
                        My pleasure. And thank you for 
                        letting the gentiles come, too.

           REVEAL CRIMINAL TYPES scattered among the CONGREGATION. 

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Tell me if they skimp on donations.

           The Rabbi smiles, but it’s clear something is on his mind.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Go on.

                                 RABBI SCHMIDT
                        Look, I am deeply ashamed what my 
                        brother asked of you. And so is he.

           Marm tenses at the mention. 

                                 RABBI SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
                        He’s willing to do whatever it 
                        takes to make things right.

                                 MARM
                        Understood. But in due time.

           Marm follows Rabbi’s gaze to the back where Dr. Schmidt 
           (Wolfe’s doctor) stands by the doors... And Rabbi Schmidt 
           shakes his head. He is NOT allowed in. 

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Thank you, Rabbi. You’re very kind.

           EXT. MANDELBAUM’S DRY GOODS STORE - DAY

           A long line of CUSTOMERS (criminals and neighbors) wait to 
           enter the store from the back. 

           INT. MANDELBAUM'S DRY GOODS' STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Sophie mans the counter, when the next customer approaches. 
           Sophie’s surprised to find -- Julius stepping up. He DROPS a 
           SATCHEL on the counter.

                                 JULIUS
                        I got antiques.

           Julius opens to show: tarnished jewels, silver, broken rings.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Where’d you get those?

                                 JULIUS
                        Hey, you ain’t supposed to ask a 
                        criminal where he got his loot.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I asked a boy whose mother will be 
                        upset that he’s dodging school.

                                 JULIUS
                        How’s she gonna know?
                          (re: line of customers)
                        You sayin’ these people are rats? 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Loyal rats. So am I. And I don’t 
                        want your trash, Julius.

           Julius eyes her for a moment. She’s not budging.

                                 JULIUS
                        Asshole.

           Julius takes his sack and heads out. Sophie watches him exit 
           before her attention is taken away by her next customer --

                                 GEORGE
                        How do ya do? George Leslie.

           George extends his hand. But Sophie sizes him up, suspicious.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I think you’re in the wrong place.
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 GEORGE
                        How do you mean? I’m here to sell. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Then show me what you’ve got because 
                        conversation isn’t currency here.

           George points to himself -- smiling, charming and obnoxious.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        No deal. Next in line.

                                 GEORGE
                        What if I told you it’s free. 
                        Comes with daddy issues, but hey, 
                        aren’t we all a little damaged?

                                 SOPHIE
                        “We?” Do you see anyone here 
                        wearing Brooks Brothers? Coming to 
                        a pawn shop isn’t going to make you 
                        a part of “we.” Ever. Now, move on.

           George takes it as a challenge and begins singing -- 

                                 GEORGE
                        Sweet violets, sweeter than roses. 
                        Covered all from head to tooooeee.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Please don’t do that.

           The CUSTOMERS in line are amused as George waltzes around, 
           singing Joseph Emmet’s censored rhyme full of innuendos.

                                 GEORGE
                        Covered all with sweet viiiooolets.

           He moves gracefully, conducting as Customers sing along:

                                 GEORGE & CUSTOMERS
                        There once was a farmer who took a 
                        young miss // in the back of the barn 
                        where he gave her a lecture! // On 
                        horses and chickens and eggs // and 
                        told her she had beautiful manners!

           Laughter all around. Even Sophie cracks a smile. George returns 
           to the counter.

                                 GEORGE
                        See, we aren’t so different. Just 
                        gotta give me a shot and I bet 
                        you’ll be delighted.

                                 SOPHIE
                        How much are you willing to bet?

                                 GEORGE
                        My pride? My ego? A very expensive 
                        dinner at a fancy restaurant?

           Off Sophie’s intrigue as a smile blossoms.

           INT. DELMONICO’S RESTAURANT - 5TH AVE & 26TH STREET - NIGHT

           WE FOLLOW A WAITER carrying TWO TRAYS in the first modern 
           restaurant in America. He floats between marble saloon tables, 
           nickel-plated showcases with fancy dessert, and a cabinet of 
           french china. This is the other side of the gilded age.

           Our hero waiter stops at the most high-profile table in the 
           joint. He sets down his trays and we meet our dinner guests: 
           Sophie and George, dressed to the nines, power-couple adjacent.

                                 WAITER
                        Lobster Newberg for the lady. Baked 
                        Alaska for the gentleman.

           The Waiter unveils the food. George indicates to empty glasses. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Thank you. And more wine please.

           The Waiter nods and scurries off. George sets his napkin.

                                 SOPHIE
                        How, exactly, did you get a 
                        reservation here?

                                 GEORGE
                        Well, first you contact the manager 
                        to check availability. Then--

                                 SOPHIE
                        To a restaurant which feeds the 
                        likes of Mark Twain.

                                 GEORGE
                        I look like them.

           George begins eating. Sophie sets her napkin.

                                 SOPHIE
                        But do you earn like them?

                                 GEORGE
                        These people don’t work.

                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 SOPHIE
                        You know what I mean. 

                                 GEORGE
                        How’s the fish?

                                 SOPHIE
                        What do you do for a living?

                                 GEORGE
                        At least try the fish. Before we 
                        have to go.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Are you in a rush? 

                                 GEORGE
                        No, but it’s a five dollar piece 
                        of fish and I’d like to know if 
                        it’s worth it.

           Sophie cuts off a piece of fish, tries it.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Now, what do you do?
                          (George still waits)
                        It’s worth it.

                                 GEORGE
                        I keep my options open.

                                 SOPHIE
                        For what?

                                 GEORGE
                        My next opportunity.

           Then, George notices the SNOODY MANAGER and the hero Waiter, 
           eyeing them. Sophie clocks it, too. George waves and smiles --

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Come on, eat.

                                 SOPHIE
                        You are in a rush.

                                 GEORGE
                        Time can’t be bought, sold, or 
                        stolen. It’s God’s greatest weapon. 
                        So we should all be in a rush.

           George races to eat -- 
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 SOPHIE
                        Who do these people think you are?

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s of no worth to me unless it’s 
                        going toward the bill. And it is.

                                 SOPHIE
                        So you’re a con artist.

                                 GEORGE
                        Not as keen as the one I’m with. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        I’m afraid I have no idea what 
                        you’re talking about.

                                 GEORGE
                        Is that so? ‘Cause you’ve gained 
                        quite the reputation around here. I 
                        find your “honor as thieves” 
                        particularly fascinating.

           Sophie stuffs her mouth with food to avoid the details.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Great. You’re finally eating. Now, 
                        I’ll tell you who I am.

           George finally sets his fork down.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        I’m a graduate of the University of 
                        Cincinnati. Engineering and 
                        Architecture, top of the class. But 
                        I got bored. Ohio is pretty hum 
                        drum. So I came to the big city.

                                 SOPHIE
                        A man with the privilege to be 
                        anything he wanted in the world but 
                        chooses to be anything but 
                        himself... What’re you running from?

                                 GEORGE
                        See, here’s where we are different. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Oh, don’t tell me you’re not. 
                        Everyone’s running.
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s true. But y’all are running 
                        away from a life, a country, a 
                        struggle. But I am running toward a 
                        goal: etching my name into history.

                                 SOPHIE
                        By doing what?

                                 GEORGE
                        I told you, I’m still working that 
                        part out.

                                 SOPHIE
                          (growing suspicious)
                        Is this is a business dinner, Mr. 
                        Leslie? Because if it is, you and 
                        me live and die by this five dollar 
                        piece of fish. No harm done.

                                 GEORGE
                        It’s a date. That’s all.

           That’s what she was hoping to hear. She settles.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        I do have one request though... Can 
                        you remove your heels?

           George points to the Manager and FAT SECURITY GUARD heading over  *
           with a WEALTHY COUPLE who just arrived for their reservations.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        It appears as though Mr. Roger 
                        Guillian has learned someone stole 
                        his reservation tonight...

           George smiles. Sophie, too. She reaches to unstrap her heel.

           EXT. 5TH AVE - NIGHT

           UPPER CLASS COUPLES stroll the street when -- WHOOSH -- 
           George and a barefoot Sophie POUND THE PAVEMENT -- leaving 
           the Fat Security Guard in the far distance, out of breath. 

           They catch eyes while they run, giggling, connecting... 

           And they turn a corner to catch their breath. Panting. Sophie 
           eyes George for a moment. Then, she plants him with a kiss. 
           They begin to make out. Raw passion in the concrete jungle...

                                 GEORGE
                        Wanna go back to your place?
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 SOPHIE
                        I live with my mother.

                                 GEORGE
                        Hard pass.
                          (then, an idea forming)
                        What about the store?

           Off Sophie’s adventurous gaze...

           INT. MANDELBAUM'S DRY GOODS' STORE - BACK ROOM - NIGHT 

           Sophie and George CRASH into a STACK OF SILK while making out. 
           George kisses her neck. Sophie undoes his belt. George unbuttons 
           her blouse. Sophie takes his pants off. He takes hers off. She 
           nibbles his ear. He lies on top of her AND... SMASH TO: 

           INT. MANDELBAUM'S DRY GOODS' STORE - BACK ROOM - LATER

           Sophie, with shagged up sex-hair, puts her dress back on while 
           thinking about what just happened in that room. On that crate. 
           Sweat marks still present. She smiles to herself. THEN--

           CRASH. From inside. She quickly redresses, growing concerned.

                                 SOPHIE
                        George?...

           INT. MANDELBAUM'S DRY GOODS' STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           Sophie enters to find Grady aiming his PEARL HANDLED DERRINGER 
           PISTOL at George behind the counter.

                                 GRADY
                        You said you were alone, you cunt.

           SEVEN OF GRADY’S GANGSTERS also fill the store. One is “BLACK” 
           LENA KLEINSCHMEIDT, a twisted version of Sophie who --

           Aims her WEBLEY REVOLVER at Sophie’s chest. 

                                 GEORGE
                        DON’T!

           Sophie tenses. There’s no shot.

                                 GRADY
                        Where does Mandelbaum keep her shit?

                                 SOPHIE
                        In a warehouse. No one knows the 
                        address. Not even me.
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 BLACK LENA
                        Bullshit! You’re her right hand.

                                 SOPHIE
                        And who are you?

                                 BLACK LENA
                        Black Lena. 

                                 GRADY
                        My right hand in Jersey. Lena is 
                        the Queen of Hackensack now.

                                 SOPHIE
                        No Queens live in New Jersey.

                                 BLACK LENA
                        Do you really wanna mouth off to 
                        someone aiming her gun atcha?

           Just as Grady flicks his eyes over, Sophie nods to George --

           And George GRABS Grady’s PISTOL -- aims it BACK IN HIS FACE! 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Never take your eye off the prize. 
                        Should’ve attended Marm’s school.

           Immediately, the SIX OTHERS PULL their guns on Sophie -- 

                                 GRADY
                        Always carry a weapon. Should’ve 
                        studied the game before playing it.

           It’s a STANDOFF. SEVEN guns on Sophie. George aiming on Grady.

                                 GEORGE
                        Okay, okay, okay. Everyone settle 
                        down. No one needs to get shot. 

                                 GRADY
                        Beg to differ.

                                 GEORGE
                        There’s a stash of cash underneath 
                        the register -- 

                                 SOPHIE
                        What are you doing?

                                 GEORGE
                        Making sure our second date isn’t 
                        six feet under. 
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           While keeping the gun trained on Grady, George carefully 
           reaches under the register to Marm’s secret stash of cash -- 

                                 SOPHIE
                        No. She’s gonna kill you.

                                 GRADY
                        Not if we do it first.

           George pulls out a WAD OF TENS from the stash.

                                 GEORGE
                        There’s about $200 here. And I’ll 
                        even return your pistol. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        George --

                                 GEORGE
                        Sophie, please. I got this.
                          (then, to Grady)
                        You lose nothing by taking this.

           Grady considers. Sophie still isn’t on board. But George 
           moves forward anyway, placing the money on the counter... 

           And Grady instantly grabs it.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Great. We’re doing great. Now, we 
                        lower our guns. You, first. 

           Tense beat. Grady nods. His gangsters lower their weapons. 
           Lena is last to do it, eyeing Sophie hard. Then, George 
           slowly hands Grady’s pistol back -- and Grady takes it. 

                                 GRADY
                        This boy bought you another chance 
                        at life. Don’t fuck it up now.

           Grady stares at Sophie while stepping back to the exit. His crew 
           follows. Once gone, George exhales. And Sophie begins shaking...

                                 SOPHIE (PRE-LAP)
                        And then George talked Grady down.

           INT. MANDELBAUM'S TENEMENT HOME - ALLEY - LATER

           Marm stands in her nightgown, with one eye on her apartment 
           window, and one eye on George. Sophie stands between them. 

                                 MARM
                        What’d you promise them?
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 GEORGE
                        I paid them.

                                 MARM
                        How much? 

                                 GEORGE
                        About two hundred.

                                 MARM
                        ... From my stash?

           George reluctantly nods. Sophie stays silent.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Well, thank God you were there to save 
                        my Sophie.
                          (George’s relieved, then)
                        But you’re going to pay me back.

                                 GEORGE
                        Ma’am, I don’t have that kind of 
                        disposable cash right now --

                                 MARM
                        I’m sure a man in your threads has 
                        an inheritance.

                                 GEORGE
                        Not anymore.

                                 MARM
                        Okay. Then you’ll earn it back.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Mother!

                                 MARM
                        Do you care about this George fella?

                                 SOPHIE
                        It was only one date...

                                 MARM
                        If you don’t, I’ll have him 
                        arrested for theft and trespassing 
                        in my store and we’ll call it even.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Yes. Okay. Yes. I could see it 
                        going somewhere. 
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 MARM
                        Great. Then this is his chance to 
                        prove he cares about you, too. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Are you blackmailing me?

                                 MARM
                        Precisely. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        No-no, I don’t want him involved--

                                 GEORGE
                        How do I earn it back?

                                 MARM
                        Handle my Grady situation.

                                 GEORGE
                        All due respect, I’m not a killer.

                                 MARM
                        Young man, did you think I was 
                        going to ask you to pull a revolver 
                        on his family and make headlines?

                                 GEORGE
                        I mean, obviously.

                                 MARM
                        Quite the opposite. I want a truce.

           George and Sophie were NOT expecting that.

                                 GEORGE
                        And if he doesn’t accept it?

                                 MARM
                          (matter of fact)
                        He’ll probably kill you. That’s why 
                        you are offering it instead of me. 
                        I’d say that’s worth about $200.

           Beat. The magnitude lands on George. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        George, you don’t need to do this.

                                 GEORGE
                        I want to. And that counts for 
                        something these days, right?

           Off George and Sophie exchanging a romantic glisten.

           EXT. EAST RIVER DOCKS - NIGHT

           Sea of darkness. George stands by a docked ship. Alone. Anxious. 

           GRADY emerges, leading a PACK OF GANGSTERS toward George. They 
           carry bats, chains, and bad intentions. George stiffens at the 
           sight, takes his hands out of his pockets just in case. 

           As they near closer, Grady cocks his head --

                                 GRADY
                        Where is Mandelbaum?

                                 GEORGE
                        With her children. 

                                 GRADY
                        So she sent you alone to get your 
                        ass whooped?

                                 GEORGE
                        She sent me to offer a truce.

           A tiny beat. 

                                 GRADY
                        Are you fucking me, George?

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re the one who just said you 
                        were going to whoop my ass.

                                 GRADY
                        Because if you’re fucking me -- 

                                 GEORGE
                        Look, she has two stashhouses of 
                        loot. Silver, antiques, furniture, 
                        cigars, you name it. And she’s 
                        willing to offer you one.

                                 GRADY
                        Take me there and if its worth it,  
                        then you and me have no more 
                        business together.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re already here.

           George motions to the ship. Rocking back and forth... Grady 
           indicates for George to go first. He does. Then, Grady 
           indicates for his crew to stay out, keep watch. They do.
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           Grady follows George onto the ship. They both disappear into 
           its bowels as Grady’s crew waits patiently for several moments.

           WHACK! THUD. Someone falls to the ground in the ship. THEN --

           FFFSHHHH! THE SHIP GOES UP IN FLAMES!

           Sophie HOPS OFF and onto the dock! George JUMPS BEHIND HER!

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        GO!! GO!! GO!! 

           They both BOLT in the opposite direction! JUST AS --

           WWWAAAHHH! POLICE HORNS BLARE! Grady’s THIEVES SCATTER.

           Grady steps off the boat, holding his head which begins to 
           swell. (He was the thud.) But before he can run --

                                 POLICEMAN (O.S.)
                        Get on the ground!

           A POLICE CARRIAGE SURROUNDS HIM IMMEDIATELY. 

                                 GRADY
                        What the hell is this?

           And out steps Shang, aiming his weapon at Grady -- 

                                 SHANG
                        I said on the ground! You’re under 
                        arrest.

           Grady puts his hands up and slowly gets onto his knees...

                                 GRADY
                        What the fuck? I didn’t do this 
                        shit! 

           The WELT forms on Grady’s head. Shang vigorously approaches 
           and Grady takes a step backward --

                                 GRADY (CONT'D)
                        Look at my forehead! I was 
                        attacked! I’m being framed.

                                 SHANG
                        No. You were resisting.

           Shang grabs Grady and SLAMS him to the ground, forcing his 
           bruised head onto the gritty wooden dock.
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 SHANG (CONT'D)
                        NYPD has patrol units all around 
                        the East River. I saw everything.

           Shang begins cuffing him.

                                 GRADY
                        Then did you see that kid lead me 
                        onto the ship? It’s another one of 
                        Mandelbaum’s fucking mind games.

                                 SHANG
                        That widow with the failed dry 
                        goods shop? 

           Shang cackles.

                                 SHANG (CONT'D)
                        See if that holds up in court.

           Shang brutally brings Grady to his feet by his wrist chains. 
           Grady YELPS. And then, Shang shoves him into the carriage --

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        Justice. The key to confrontation 
                        is to kill your enemy without them 
                        even realizing it.

           INT. TWEED COURTHOUSE - DAY

           The famously crooked courthouse. George is on the witness 
           stand, offering passionate testimony. Grady is the defendant.

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        For me, that was easy. Revenge is a 
                        dish best served by a mother. And 
                        on my platter was George -- 

           George cries during his defense, earning sympathy from all. 

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        A star witness who nobody would 
                        suspect of being associated with a 
                        poor old widow like me.

           The CURLY-HAIRED JUDGE BANGS his gavel. Grady grimaces.

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S CLAPBOARD HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Marm gazes at a LUXURIOUS LAMB-SKIN DINNER INVITATION reading: 
           “A Dinner Party Hosted by the Honorable Mrs. Mandelbaum.”

                        And when war is over, a great 
                        leader cultivates peace. My sixth 
                        virtue and perhaps life’s most 
                        profitable commodity. 

           The oven DINGS. Marm takes out a hot glass tray of DELICIOUS 
           FOOD. Like a Thanksgiving Commercial, Marm carries it into -- 

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S CLAPBOARD HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Marm’s new upscale dining room is full of GUESTS around her 
           marble table. Marm sets the tray down, unveiling DELICIOUS FOOD.

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        When families scavenged, they 
                        trusted me to help them survive. 
                        Business owners needed protection, 
                        I had brutes look after their 
                        store. You needed bail money, I 
                        fronted it. If you wanted the 
                        Jewish vote, you first needed my 
                        vote of confidence.

           REVEAL through the length of the table: George, Shang, Sophie, 
           Curly Haired Judge, Rabbi Schmidt, Lawyer Bill Howe, POLITICIANS, 
           COPS, THIEVES... 

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        And my dinner parties were the 
                        hottest in the city because my 
                        guest list was as carefully 
                        refined as my menu...

           PULL OUT to the FULL VIEW of Marm’s dining room where WHITE-
           COLLAREDS sit beside BLUE-COLLAREDS. All one happy family. 

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        The fringe of society dining with 
                        the high society. Not because this 
                        is America, but because when you do 
                        favors for people, they’re more 
                        likely to do one back... 

           Marm takes her seat at the head of the table --

                                 MARM
                        Let’s eat!

           Off her command, the guests dig in and celebrations begin...

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S CLAPBOARD HOME - HALLWAY - LATER

           Among echoes from the party, George toes down a hallway. A 
           LANTERN in one hand and a NEWSPAPER concealing a BULKY OBJECT 
           in his other. He approaches a door and pushes his way into --

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S CLAPBOARD HOME - JULIUS’ ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Where Julius stares at a SIX-SHOOTER beside a FALSE FLOORBOARD.

                                 GEORGE
                        Shit. Sorry.

                                 JULIUS
                        What the hell? You don’t knock?

                                 GEORGE
                        You didn’t lock and I thought... 
                        Where’s your mother’s room? 

           Julius stands, grabs his gun --

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Relax. She agreed to talk... away 
                        from everyone. That’s all.

                                 JULIUS
                        Then what’s in the newspaper?

           George unravels the paper to reveal: A SMALL TIN WHEEL WITH 
           WIRES ATTACHED (”THE LITTLE JOKER”). 

                                 GEORGE
                        A device I invented. I call it The 
                        Little Joker.

                                 JULIUS
                        What’s it for?

           George shows him the (real) newspaper headline: “Dexter Bank 
           Robbed by GENIUS! Police hunt for clues!”

                                 GEORGE
                        This. It records a safe’s 
                        combination without a trace. 

                                 JULIUS
                          (mesmerized)
                        You robbed a bank?
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 GEORGE
                          (re: Julius’s gun)
                        Do you want ME to start asking YOU 
                        questions? 

                                 JULIUS
                        I bought it at Thieves Exchange.

                                 GEORGE
                        Hey! I didn’t ask. I don’t want to 
                        know. Just put it away.

           Finally, Julius sets the gun down under the false floorboard.

                                 JULIUS
                        You gonna tell my mom? Like Sophie?

                                 GEORGE
                        Brothers are different.

                                 JULIUS
                        Is that what we are?

                                 GEORGE
                        We could be. 
                          (re: The Little Joker)
                        If you don’t tell anyone about my 
                        friend, either. 

           Julius nods. George goes. Then, with a YANK OF A LEVER (just 
           like Marm), Julius sends the gun downward into a crawl space.

           INT. MANDELBAUM'S CLAPBOARD HOME - MARM’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           George shows Marm his “Little Joker” device while she scans 
           the newspaper article to corroborate his story.

                                 GEORGE
                        Keep reading. It says I was in and 
                        out like a ghost. 

                                 MARM
                        Did the earnings disappear into 
                        thin air, too?

                                 GEORGE
                        They paid my debts. It cost me 
                        about the same to plan the heist.

                                 MARM
                        So there was no profit?

                                 GEORGE
                        The profit is proof that it works.
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           Marm hands the newspaper back.

                                 MARM
                        George, I’m not going to finance a 
                        heist just because I can.

                                 GEORGE
                        But you would if it earns you 
                        enough money to retire, right?... 
                        Criminals get hooked forever. 
                        Working people never stop working. 
                        But businesspeople, real 
                        businesspeople retire.

           Just as Marm considers that notion -- 

                                 SOPHIE (O.S.)
                        And what are you going to tell our 
                        children?

           They find Sophie in the doorway.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Daddy’s a bank robber? Daddy’s a 
                        cheat?

                                 GEORGE
                        Whoa. Kids? Slow down.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Speed up. I’m not here to be your 
                        arm candy. Or your accomplice. 

                                 GEORGE
                        I never asked you to be either. 
                        Just... please give us a moment.

           George eagerly looks at Marm, gripping his invention. But Sophie  *
           studies him for a brief moment, puzzled, speculating:

                                 SOPHIE
                        Wait. Were you fucking using me?

                                 GEORGE
                          (yes)
                        What, no. No, of course not.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Then, have your pick. Me or crime.

                                 GEORGE
                        Have yours. Me or the money you 
                        think I have.
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           Sophie is caught. But she’s not ashamed.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Well, I’m not gonna marry some bum 
                        who keeps me in this mess. And what 
                        do you mean by “think you have?”

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m the American Nightmare. Riches 
                        to rags. I have $140 dollars to my 
                        name... So we can all help each 
                        other out here...

                                 SOPHIE
                          (confirming it out loud)
                        No... no... You were using me... 
                        You’re... You’re broke.

           The air sinks out of the room for Sophie.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

                                 MARM
                        Sophie --

                                 SOPHIE
                        He’s a fucking liar and I want him 
                        out! NOW.

                                 MARM
                        We have guests. Go back inside.

           Sophie’s shocked. The first time Mother didn’t cater to her. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        You’re actually considering taking 
                        a bank? What the hell has gotten 
                        into you?

           Marm shuts the door.

                                 MARM
                        This secures my family’s future for 
                        generations. And I never once 
                        thought I’d come close that. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        But this isn’t how we do it.

           Marm just stares at Sophie. She’s fine with that. Beat.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        You’re all alone on this one.
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           Sophie turns to the door, but waits one last moment. Marm still  *
           doesn’t budge. So Sophie exits. Then, Marm looks to George:

                                 MARM
                        I need to know how you lost your 
                        money. Your curses, debts, motives. 
                        Tell me all of it. And if you lie, 
                        no matter when I discover it -- I 
                        will pull the rug from underneath 
                        you. Do not test me, young man.

           Beat. George carefully considers his answer:

                                 GEORGE
                        My father’s name was defined by 
                        breweries. Mine was defined by my 
                        father. I was a rich kid who got 
                        what he wanted when he wanted. I 
                        didn’t like that feeling. I hate 
                        those kinds of people. Dad called me 
                        ungrateful. He didn’t understand why 
                        I wanted to “make my own name.” So 
                        he cut me off as soon as my train 
                        stopped in New York... It was the 
                        nicest thing he’d ever done for 
                        me... That’s where you come in, Miss 
                        Mandelbaum. I invented this device 
                        because it doesn’t require dynamite, 
                        violence, or danger. Just fortitude. 
                        And I think you’re the only fence 
                        around who could appreciate my kind 
                        of genius.

           A loaded beat. Marm shuts the door.

                                 MARM
                        The Manhattan Savings Institution. 
                        It’s the personal depository of 
                        New York’s wealthiest and the only 
                        heist that makes this worth it for 
                        the both of us...

           Off Marm, dollars in her eyes and dreams in George’s...

           INT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - GRAND LOBBY - DAY

           An architectural masterpiece. TELLERS stand behind ARCHED 
           CAGES serving CLIENTS. PAT SHEVELIN (40s), a drone, a worn, 
           defeated, mutton-chopped drone, waves over the next customer -- 

           George, surveying every inch of this kingdom, while approaching.

                                 PAT SHEVELIN
                        Withdrawal or deposit?

                                 PAT SHEVELIN
                        Cash, gold, or personal items?

                                 GEORGE
                        Personal items.

           George reveals THREE DIAMONDS. Pat simply goes through the 
           motions, placing the three diamonds in a deposit tray... 
           Until George moves a diamond toward Pat. Now, Pat is engaged.

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S DRY GOODS’ STORE - NIGHT

           Sophie slouches, defeated, counting cash. Dorcy enters.

                                 SOPHIE
                        We’re closed.

                                 DORCY
                        Please. I need a ring. Fast.

                                 SOPHIE
                        This is a Dry Goods store. 
                        Bedsheets, silk, no diamonds.

                                 DORCY
                        Come on. I was referred here.

                                 SOPHIE
                        By whom?

                                 DORCY
                        Some orphan at Thieves Exchange. 
                        Said you have fair prices.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What’s his name?

                                 DORCY
                        Ralph? James? I don’t remember some 
                        fucking street kid. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Yet you trusted his recommendation.

                                 DORCY
                        Look, if I don’t propose tonight, 
                        she’s gone.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Aw. What a shame.
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 DORCY
                        I’ll pay a premium.

           Dorcy DROPS a SACK on the counter. 

                                 DORCY (CONT'D)
                        Directly to you. Unless you want to 
                        be a clerk at a pawn shop forever.

           Beat. Dorcy opens to reveal: a STACK OF CASH. Sophie eyes it. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Suppose we did have diamonds and 
                        suppose I did do this under the 
                        table... 

                                 DORCY
                        I wouldn’t tell nobody. Not even 
                        your boss.

                                 SOPHIE
                        That’s a given. But it’s gonna cost 
                        you a decent amount.

                                 DORCY
                        Call it.

                                 SOPHIE
                        No. You call the price. And make it 
                        enough to... I don’t know, “secure 
                        my future” at least for a few 
                        months.

                                 DORCY
                        I’ll give you all of it if you give 
                        me your best and biggest rock.

           Beat. She considers him, the deal behind Marm’s back... Then, 
           she pulls out a 2.5 Carat Diamond from behind the register. 
           Dorcy nods. Sophie takes his sack and hands him the diamond.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Piece of advice? Let the diamond do 
                        the proposing. Good luck, fella.

           But Dorcy doesn’t leave. And Sophie grows impatient.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        I said we’re done here. Good night.

           Then, Dorcy shows his P.I. License. Sophie’s stunned.

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 DORCY
                        Tiffany’s reported a loss of two 
                        thousand in diamonds yesterday. 
                        Something tells me I can trace this 
                        rock right back to their store...

                                 SOPHIE
                        Uh... No. A man came in with--

                                 DORCY
                        This is no accusation. This is 
                        proof, Miss Elkins.

           Sophie freezes.

                                 SOPHIE
                        How do you know my name?

                                 DORCY
                        I know lots of things. And either I 
                        can bring it to the precinct... or 
                        you can tell me all about Old Mother 
                        Mandelbaum and her operation.

           Off Sophie, completely fucked...

           INT. ELDRIDGE ST. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY/SHANG’S OFFICE

           Dorcy charges down a HALLWAY flanked by the SERGEANT from 
           earlier. They BUST INTO Shang’s office -- 

                                 SERGEANT
                        You bastard!

           The Sergeant SLAMS Shang’s HEAD down onto his desk and breaks 
           out the handcuffs. Shang is the one being arrested.

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S CLAPBOARD HOME - DINING ROOM - DAY

           George holds blueprints of the bank but Marm is distracted. 
           Nervous. Paranoid like we haven’t seen her...

                                 GEORGE
                        Shang probably did himself in.

                                 MARM
                        You realize what this means?

                                 GEORGE
                        That we have to move on the bank 
                        quickly. 

                                 MARM
                        That we have a wolf among us.
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 GEORGE
                        Okay. So we’ll move carefully.

           Sophie enters. Something seems off about her. She looks at 
           George as if she wants to say more... But all she says is:

                                 SOPHIE
                        I’m moving out. 

           Enter NED LYONS (30s) -- a burly redhead with a torn off ear. 

                                 MARM
                        With this brute?!

                                 SOPHIE
                        Ned, yes. He bought me a house in 
                        Long Island. And before you say--

                                 MARM
                        You are running from who you are 
                        again. And this man will fall very 
                        short of your expectations.

                                 SOPHIE
                        He wants to get away from all of 
                        this, too. Start a family. Live a 
                        quiet, comfortable life... 

           Sophie looks at Ned. He nods. 

                                 MARM
                        How do we know he isn’t the mole?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Because Ned comes from a family of 
                        criminals. You know who doesn’t?

           Sophie points to George. George scoffs.

                                 GEORGE
                        Please. Maybe you’re the snake.

           Marm rises, considers them both.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Mother -- I would never--

                                 GEORGE
                        This is exactly what she does when 
                        she doesn’t get her way. She plays 
                        people’s emotions to get them to do 
                        as she pleases.

                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 SOPHIE
                        I do not.

                                 GEORGE
                        Mother, look what’s happening right 
                        now -- 

                                 SOPHIE
                        What did you just call her?

                                 GEORGE
                        -- She found the worst possible guy 
                        after you agreed to a job that she 
                        doesn’t approve of.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I don’t approve of it because I’m 
                        looking out for her best interests. 

                                 GEORGE
                        You said yourself you have her 
                        wrapped around your finger.

           Marm expects Sophie’s denial... But instead, Sophie walks 
           aggressively toward George --

                                 SOPHIE
                        FUCK YOU, GEORGE! For fucking 
                        ruining everything --

           And George shoves Sophie away. Then, Ned grabs George and TOSSES 
           him into the CHINA CABINET. GLASS SHATTERS all over Marm’s floor.

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        Discipline. Choose a path or die in 
                        the middle. Don’t let compassion 
                        create liabilities.

           Ned readies for a fight as George stands. But George backs 
           off, respecting Marm’s code. He covers his bleeding elbow.

                                 MARM
                        Of course I cared for Sophie. But a 
                        mother’s sin is we care too much. 

           Sophie pushes Ned into a corner. And Marm deadeyes Sophie.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        I’m through with your grade school 
                        behavior.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Listen to me. 
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 MARM
                        No.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I swear I didn’t rat on you.

                                 MARM
                        I don’t want to see you anymore, 
                        Sophie. Do not ever come here again 
                        unless I send for you.

           That lands on Sophie. Sadness lingering in the air. And 
           Sophie quietly exits. Ned follows. LONG BEAT. 

           George just waits for Marm to gather herself. Then she puts 
           on her mask of determination as she declares:

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Cut ties with anyone we’ve ever 
                        worked with. We trust no one. We 
                        end every operation. It’s all over, 
                        George.

                                 GEORGE
                        ... Including Manhattan Savings?

                                 MARM
                        No. I need it now more than ever. 

           Relief washes over George’s face.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        So don’t fuck it up.

           Off Marm, grilling George...

           INT. MANDELBAUM'S CLAPBOARD HOME - JULIUS’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Marm enters to find Julius, looking out his window at Sophie.

                                 JULIUS
                        Where is she going?

                                 MARM
                        Long Island. Or so she says.

                                 JULIUS
                        Are we going to see her again?

           Emotional beat. Marm doesn’t respond. She sits beside Julius.

                                 MARM
                        I need your help. Just this once. 
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           Julius slowly turns his gaze to his mother. Sparkling eyes.

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S WAREHOUSE - BANK REPLICA - NIGHT

           AN EXACT REPLICA of the Manhattan Savings Institution in Marm’s 
           WAREHOUSE. Marm stands in the “grand lobby” with George.

                                 MARM
                        You used my money to build a replica? 

                                 GEORGE
                        Practice is man’s best friend.
                          (NOTE: this was the first 
                           replica ever used)
                        Now, come. Check out the vault.

           Marm follows George through the PRISTINE REPLICA LOBBY with 
           ARCHED TELLER CAGES.

           They pass the JANITOR’S STAIRS and a WATCHMAN’S CLOSET on the 
           right, a CONFERENCE ROOM on the left, and then arrive at --

           The ORNATE CIRCULAR VAULT ENTRANCE, protected by TRIPLE DOORS 
           -- open -- revealing TIN SECURITY DEPOSIT BOXES lining the 
           walls -- all leading to -- AN IRONCLAD CHUBBS AND SONS LOCK 
           AND SAFE, QUADRUPLE COMPARTMENT. 

           And inside the vault is: Pat Shevelin and Julius.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        My 3 man army. Meet Mr. Shevelin. 

           Pat looks at Marm, dryly. He’s not very good at greetings.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Mr. Shevelin goes inside the vault 
                        every day. And he’s going to 
                        install the little joker so we 
                        don’t have to break in twice... 

                                 PAT SHEVELIN
                        And Mr. Shevelin will be paid three 
                        thousand dollars for his services.

           Marm eyes him.

                                 GEORGE
                        Don’t mind him. He’s quirky. 

                                 MARM
                        I would have preferred an inside 
                        man who wasn’t.
                          (then, to Julius)
                        Have you been hired, yet?

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 JULIUS
                        Yep. Get my janitor’s uniform 
                        tomorrow. Been practicing my 
                        mopping, too. 

           Julius beams. Marm just stares at him with a ruthless glance. 

                                 MARM
                        Get to work.

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S WAREHOUSE - BANK REPLICA - MONTAGE - NIGHT

           Marm observes from the lobby as George lies inside the vault, 
           listening to each turn of the safe’s dial with a STETHOSCOPE. 

           Meanwhile, already mid-action, Julius rushes to transfer mock 
           jewelry from the 50 DEPOSIT BOXES to Pat’s WOOL BAG. Just as 
           they finish the 50th BOX, George hears a CLICK in the safe  --

           And he POPS OPEN THE SAFE. Julius and Pat stand tall as George 
           rushes to check the clock above the vault: striking 9:23pm.

                                 GEORGE
                        Pathetic! 

           Julius and Pat sink. George paces like a Drill Sergeant.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        34 seconds for 1 deposit box. 28 
                        minutes and 30 seconds for all 50. 
                        But we wouldn’t have even gotten 
                        that far because Pat decided to 
                        stand in the only spot where the 
                        top of his empty skull can be seen 
                        from anyone out on the street!

           George indicates the DUMMY-WINDOW in line with Pat’s position.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        But his gravest mistake was 
                        installing my Little Joker 
                        backwards. How could I possibly get 
                        the right combination when it’s 
                        showing me the wrong numbers? That’s 
                        why I had to use a stethoscope like 
                        I’m diagnosing fucking Small Pox. 

                                 PAT SHEVELIN
                        I’m sorry.

                                 GEORGE
                        That’s what prisoners say.
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           Pat looks away, moves back to the Janitor’s room for square 
           one. But George physically stops Julius from walking there.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Sweet buggy-eyed Julius... If I 
                        have to knock eight times on the 
                        janitor’s door -- instead of the 
                        agreed upon seven -- I’m going to 
                        kick you off this job and leave you 
                        begging for a suckle of your 
                        mother’s teet. Do you hear me?

           Julius looks to Marm -- for her defense. 

                                 MARM
                        Don’t look at me. Every one and 
                        every thing has a function. The 
                        janitor’s entrance is the cleanest 
                        way into the bank. One thing goes 
                        wrong, every thing goes wrong. Do 
                        it right or we will find someone 
                        else who can mop.

           Julius drags to the Janitor’s office. Then, George settles. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Sorry about the bug eyes thing. 
                        He’s very handsome. I just... this 
                        needs to be perfect.

           George fusses with a CLUNKY WOODEN CHAIR, inching it over.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        And it will be perfect. 

           George re-locks the safe. SMASH into A RAPID FIRE SEQUENCE...

           INT. BANK HEIST MONTAGE - DAY/NIGHT

           JANITOR’S DOOR -- George knocks SEVEN times. Pat waits on the 
           stairway. Julius opens the door. Too long. George shakes his 
           head. Again. George shuts the door. George knocks SEVEN 
           times. Julius opens. Too quick. Again. George shuts the door.

           REAL MANHATTAN SAVINGS BANK -- Behind his teller cage, Pat 
           hands George deposit paperwork. George slides cash -- and the 
           LITTLE JOKER over to Pat -- unseen by any eye in the joint.

           OFFICE ACROSS REAL MANHATTAN SAVINGS BANK -- George sits in an 
           empty office, staring at the bank across the street. You can 
           see Pat’s head through the window like he said. He studies the 
           BANKERS closing down process... IRON SHUTTERS BEING SHUT...

                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           WAREHOUSE REPLICA//MANHATTAN SAVINGS BANK -- ONE screen grows 
           into SIX split screens: 

           -- Now with CLOSED IRON SHUTTERS, the crew navigates the lobby.

           -- Julius opens the Janitor Door on time. 

           -- Pat dodges Marm’s attempt to trip him. 

           -- While running, Julius drops jewelry because he’s got too much.

           -- George cracks the replica safe. 

           -- Pat installs the LITTLE JOKER in the real bank’s safe. 

           WE MERGE BACK INTO ONE SCREEN WHICH CRASHES US INTO:

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S WAREHOUSE - BANK REPLICA - NIGHT

           Lit by ONE lantern in a COMPLETELY DARK WAREHOUSE, Marm watches 
           the trio -- mere movements in the shadows -- carrying out the 
           heist without light... CLICK... 

           The vault opens. George rushes to the CLOCK -- STRIKING 9:15pm.

                                 GEORGE
                        Gentlemen... We just mugged the 
                        Manhattan Savings Institution!

           Julius and Pat fall in exhaustion. George looks to Marm... 
           who cracks a smile. Off their celebratory embrace -- 

           INT. SATAN’S CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT

           It’s a party. Onyx pillars, oil paintings, silk curtains; 
           glitzy Vegas in Old New York. A very tipsy Julius and George 
           play POKER with DRUNKARDS. DEVIANT WOMEN on all their laps.

                                 JULIUS
                        We’re going to live in fucking 
                        infamy!

           Julius slides in CHIPS and reveals TWO ACES. George responds 
           with a STRAIGHT. The Drunkards groan.

                                 JULIUS (CONT'D)
                        GOD DAMN IT, GEORGE!

           And George takes the pot, adding it to his BIG STACK.

                                 SHANG (O.S.)
                        Room for one more?
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           They look up to find Shang heading over with his wife, BABE 
           DRAPER (30s, a firecracker before her marriage) --

                                 GEORGE
                        Shang. Holy shit.

           George rises to hug him. But Shang just takes a seat. Awkward.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing here? I thought 
                        they gave you five years.

                                 SHANG
                        A cop’s got powerful friends. 
                        Trade off is I can’t be a cop no 
                        more.

                                 GEORGE
                        Good trade off.

                                 SHANG
                        No. I got no more paycheck. I’m 
                        back to being “Shang” at this dump.

                                 GEORGE
                        I thought you liked it here.

                                 SHANG
                        I did.

           Awkward. Shang offers the DEALER cash. Dealer deals to the 
           players. George tries to make it better, indicating to Babe.

                                 GEORGE
                        Hey, at least you’ve got a lovely 
                        lady to keep you company.

                                 SHANG
                        My wife. Had her then, too.

                                 GEORGE
                        Nice to meet you, Mrs. Draper.

                                 SHANG
                        That’s enough, George. 

           Tension. Shang puts out a blind... And George matches it.

                                 SHANG (CONT'D)
                        What’s Marm up to these days?

                                 GEORGE
                        Called it quits after you got 
                        pinched. 
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 SHANG
                        Do I look like a bitch?

                                 GEORGE
                        Huh? No. No. Of course not.

                                 SHANG
                        ‘Cause I didn’t say a God-damned 
                        word in there. I could’ve. And I’d 
                        still be a cop. But I’d be a snake, 
                        too. And I don’t like snakes.

           George just nods. Shang’s eyes piercing through his skin. 
           Drunkards match the blind, if only to stay and watch. That 
           leaves Julius. He matches it, too. But Shang still glares --

                                 SHANG (CONT'D)
                        What do you think? Does she trust me?

                                 JULIUS
                        She should. I do.

                                 SHANG
                        Then maybe she has one last job to 
                        make things right between us?

                                 GEORGE
                        Shang, come on. I said she’s done.

                                 SHANG
                        I want to know what he says. If he 
                        can drink in Satan’s Circus, he can 
                        speak for himself. Right, Julius? 

                                 JULIUS
                        ... Right.

                                 GEORGE
                        Sophie sang on you. Okay? If you 
                        got a bone to pick, find her.

                                 SHANG
                        Actually, that’s why I came here. 
                        See, someone dug up shit on me -- 
                        and I wanted to know who it was -- 
                        so I did digging on everyone around 
                        me. Including my wife. I started 
                        with Sophie and she checked out...
                        But you? I’m not so sure about.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re turning this on me now?
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 SHANG
                        Yeah. ‘Cause no one ever quite knew 
                        why you were running... But I found 
                        out. You were being chased.

           George’s leg begins BOUNCING under the table. A THICK CROWD 
           begins to form as Shang speaks very loudly --

                                 SHANG (CONT'D)
                        Three million were called to duty 
                        for the Union. Half came back 
                        maimed, wounded, or not at all. 
                        But not you. ‘Cause Daddy paid to 
                        for you to dodge Lincoln’s draft.

           Silence falls. In this day, you’re a patriot or a traitor.

                                 SHANG (CONT'D)
                        Your city hated you. They all 
                        sacrificed someone but you 
                        sacrificed $300. So you came to a 
                        city too big to know you, too big 
                        to hate you... But I am sure there 
                        are men here right now who hate a 
                        man who don’t serve his country... 

           AYE! Men shout in agreement. The woman on his lap stands to 
           go. Angry gazes cover George. Including Julius. And then:

                                 GEORGE
                        My father paid without me knowing. 

           George stands, leaving his pot behind. 

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Keep the pot. For your paycheck. 
                        But I ain’t no fucking rat.

           Shang nods to a BIG IRISHMAN who STEPS in front of George AND 
           SHOVES HIM BACK into his seat. 

           THEN -- A BEER COMES FLYING at George’s chest. Alcohol DOUSING 
           his clothes. CHEERS for blood! 

           Still, George keeps it cool, looks to Julius.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Let’s get out of here.

           George stands. But Shang stops Julius from standing, too.

                                 SHANG

                                 IRISHMAN
                        Come on, you fucking greenback! 

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m not going to fight you, man.

                                 IRISHMAN
                        Hit me, you fucking twat! 

           The Irishman gets right in George’s face, taunting him. THEN 
           FROM OUT OF NOWHERE, SHANG THROWS AN ELBOW at the Irishman!

           The Irishman falls. 

           The crowd makes a CIRCLE as Shang mounts him, CRUSHING his 
           skull with ELBOW after ELBOW. BLOOD SPURTS onto Shang’s face. 

           George is SHOCKED. Julius, too. As they watch Shang throwing 
           blow after blow to the Irishman’s EYE. BREAKING THE BONE.

                                 BABE DRAPER
                        That’s enough, Tomas!

           But Shang can barely hear her over the violent cheers. He 
           PULLS OUT COPPER BRASS KNUCKLES, places them on, and POP! POP-
           POP! Shang nails the Irishman in the nose. The bone breaks. 

           He’s a fucking mush of flesh, bone, and blood -- 

                                 JULIUS
                        You’re going to kill him!

                                 GEORGE
                        Shang, enough!

           FINALLY -- George pulls at Shang. Shang dismounts. He catches 
           his breath -- and smiles as blood drips down his face. 

                                 SHANG
                        Someone get the mick help --

           MEN come haul off the Irishman -- groaning and grumbling. 
           Shang indicates for Babe to towel him off with a rag. As she 
           does, he keeps his eyes on George --

                                 SHANG (CONT'D)
                        I want in on her last job. And if 
                        not, I don’t like to hurt people, 
                        but when a man loses his 
                        livelihood, you know, it’s tough.

           Off George fearful, shamed, and flicking his eyes to Babe...

           EXT. HORSE STABLE - NIGHT

           HANDS LEAN ON A STACK OF HAY. Babe holds her balance as George 
           plows into her. Moans. Passion. CLIMAX. George plops beside 
           her in the blue moonlight. Babe catches her breath. A beat.

                                 BABE DRAPER
                        ... It was you, wasn’t it?

                                 GEORGE
                        How could you ask me that?

           But she waits for the answer.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                          (pointed)
                        Look, I ain’t no two timer.

                                 BABE DRAPER
                        I know what I am. I’m a notch on a 
                        frightened man’s belt. What does 
                        that say about you?

                                 GEORGE
                        You think I did this because of... 
                        whatever happened at the casino?

                                 BABE DRAPER
                        Why else would you do it?

                                 GEORGE
                          (lying)
                        Because Shang isn’t treating you 
                        right. Because I would.

                                 BABE DRAPER
                        Oh, so you’re here to save me, eh?

                                 GEORGE
                        Don’t be an ass.

                                 BABE DRAPER
                        Prove it then. Let’s runaway... Out 
                        of New York to some paradise. 
                          (then, threatening)
                        Far away from Shang. So he never 
                        finds out what we did tonight... 

           Off the veiled threat, George smiles to keep her happy.

                                 GEORGE
                        When you fixen to leave?

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S CLAPBOARD HOME - DINING ROOM

           Marm and George sit at the marble table.

                                 MARM
                        You said you could do it with three.

                                 GEORGE
                        I was so focused on the heist, I 
                        wasn’t thinking about a way out. 

                                 MARM
                        I was. We have a horse to carry 
                        everything to my warehouse. 

                                 GEORGE
                        And while we’re inside, who’s 
                        going to keep watch outside? You?

                                 MARM
                        I don’t get my hands dirty.

                                 GEORGE
                        But Shang does.

                                 MARM
                        Shang? 

                                 GEORGE
                        He’s out. And he didn’t say a peep. 
                        He’s the only other person we could 
                        trust to be our fourth man.

           Julius enters like he’s seen a ghost. Neither Marm nor George 
           were expecting him. And George is worried what he’ll say...

                                 JULIUS
                        It’s Sophie. She needs your help.

           INT. SING SING PRISON - HALLWAY OF CELLS - DAY

           Marm follows a GUARD down a hall of cells. They come upon 
           Sophie’s cell... Sophie won’t even look up. Marm scowls.

                                 MARM
                        That’s her.

           The Guard opens the cell and Marm enters. There’s a distance 
           between them. No eye contact. Marm still sits across from her. 

           Then, the Guard locks them inside before walking off.

           Marm waits for Sophie to look her in the eyes. But Sophie still 
           hangs her head. Ashamed. So Marm speaks first:
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        What do you want?

                                 SOPHIE
                          (muttering, ashamed)
                        You were right about Ned.

                                 MARM
                        Of course I was. But you knew you 
                        were dancing with the devil.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Now I’m suspected of ending that 
                        dance with a bullet to his brain.

           Sophie looks up through a swollen eye. Marm softens.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        He gave me everything a woman could 
                        want. All with an honest 
                        construction job out in Montauk. 
                        But when the job ended, money ran 
                        dry and that’s when he got cruel. 
                        Went back to the life, you know? So 
                        I made him choose. Well, Ned don’t 
                        like to be forced into nothing. So 
                        things spiraled and I guess I 
                        didn’t shut up like he told me to, 
                        so... So-- I just left...

           Marm studies her for a moment.

                                 MARM
                        Sophie. Either you tell me the 
                        whole truth for once or I leave.

           Beat. Sophie indicates her belly and the tiniest of baby bumps.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I didn’t want to put someone else 
                        through what I went through.

           Marm immediately moves to comfort Sophie. A temporary truce 
           that stretches beyond any bad blood.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        You’re right. I run. And I’m good 
                        at it. So when Ned got, you know... 
                        That’s what I did. But I never 
                        killed him. I swear to you. All I 
                        did was leave.

           Marm takes Sophie’s head into her arms. And it’s exactly what 
           Sophie needed. She grows immediately vulnerable like a child.

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Why does this always happen to me? 
                        What am I doing wrong? I want to 
                        stop running. I have to before... 
                        ya know... But how do I stop, Marm?
                          (then)
                        How did you stop?

                                 MARM
                        I never started. 

           Sophie looks at Marm, sympathetic but also challenging: 

                                 SOPHIE
                        No. No. You said yourself we are 
                        all a prisoner of some memory... 
                        Why did you come to America? What 
                        were you running from?

                                 MARM
                        That’s none of your business.

                                 SOPHIE
                        And that’s why I never asked. But 
                        now I need to know how I can do 
                        what you did, how a broken girl can 
                        be a good mother, too... 

           A pregnant pause. Marm struggles with her words...

                                 MARM
                        My mother... let my father and his 
                        friends do... unspeakable acts... 
                        But the strong only run until they 
                        reach their destination. Mine was 
                        New York, where I could start over. 
                        And here I am. Surviving... 
                          (a moment to steady herself)
                        Now, it’s your turn.

           Marm flicks her eyes back to Sophie: 

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        My lawyers have an alibi: You were 
                        out stealing when Ned was murdered. 
                        We’ve got a store owner from my 
                        synagogue who’ll say he caught you. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        And then I’ll be jailed for 
                        thievery.

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 MARM
                        No. They’re going to say you’re 
                        what’s called a kleptomaniac.
                          (NOTE: the first time in 
                           history this was used)
                        We don’t want to know if you really 
                        killed Ned. Just repeat every word 
                        they give you and say it like you 
                        mean it. You’ll be out tomorrow.

           The sincerity lands on Sophie. Tears well in her eyes.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        I made you a promise. That I’d 
                        never be like your mother. Now you 
                        promise me the same.
                          (re: Sophie’s belly)
                        That you won’t be, either.

           Sophie nods and HUGS Marm as if she never wants to let go. 
           But Marm is done with her now and pulls away --

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Goodbye, Sophie.

           Just as she rises --

                                 SOPHIE
                        Wait. I need to get something off 
                        my chest.

           Sophie rises, too. Eye level with Marm.

                                 SOPHIE
                                     (CONT'D)
                        Some investigator came into your 
                        store after you agreed to the 
                        heist. I wasn’t thinking clearly.

           Marm goes to speak but Sophie stands, puts her hand on her lips. *

                                 SOPHIE
                                     (CONT'D)
                        But I never once told him anything 
                        about you. Or your school. Shang. 
                        Any of it. I refused. I gave him 
                        dirt on one name... George Leslie.

           Marm wasn’t expecting that. Confusion, concern settles in...

                        And then Shang got arrested instead.

           Off Marm, running it over in her head, as RAGE takes form.

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S CLAPBOARD HOME - JULIUS’S ROOM - NIGHT

           ANGLE ON: Julius sleeping like an angel.

                                 MARM (O.S.)
                        Why did George suddenly want to 
                        bring on Shang?

           He wakes to his mother standing over him, lit from beneath 
           with her lantern, looking like a fucking demon.

                                 JULIUS
                        I don’t know.

                                 MARM
                        Tell me the fucking truth, you 
                        spineless twerp!

                                 JULIUS
                        Mother?

           Julius sits up, terrified. Marm towering over him --

                                 JULIUS (CONT'D)
                        Shang got violent... But--But George 
                        swears he trusts him.

                                 MARM
                        Because he’s protected!

                                 JULIUS
                        What?

                                 MARM
                        Get up.

                                 JULIUS
                        Why?

                                 MARM
                        I ought to kick you out on the 
                        streets for keeping this from me!

                                 JULIUS
                        I’m sorry... Please--

                                 MARM
                        Don’t beg with me, boy. 

                                 JULIUS
                        What do you want me to do? 

           Marm RIPS OFF his blankets.

           INT. OPIUM DEN - CHINATOWN - NIGHT

           A room of rugs, privacy curtains, and bunk beds. PROSTITUTES 
           lie with some of the men. George lies on the floor, smoking 
           some Shanghai Sally across from Dorcy. Sober. Determined. 

                                 DORCY
                        What’s taking so long?

                                 GEORGE
                        She isn’t exactly a walk in the 
                        park to deal with...

                                 DORCY
                        Do you think you have the leverage 
                        here, George?

                                 GEORGE
                        I’m handing Marm to you on a silver 
                        platter: Catching her red-handed in 
                        the biggest robbery in the United 
                        States. So yes, I call that 
                        leverage, Mr. Dorcy.

                                 DORCY
                        More like empty promises.

                                 GEORGE
                        Come again?

                                 DORCY
                        I’ve seen nothing so far but a smug 
                        prick who should be in jail taking 
                        his sweet ass time to deliver.

                                 GEORGE
                        Do you doubt me? 

                                 DORCY
                        Of course I doubt you.

                                 GEORGE
                        So you don’t think I can pull this 
                        off?

                                 DORCY
                        Or you won’t. I haven’t decided.

           Off the challenge, George puts the pipe down. 

                                 GEORGE
                        When I heard about Grady’s 
                        Mandelbaum problem, I offered to 
                        help him.

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        Said I’d get close to Sophie, 
                        bring her to the store, and then 
                        his crew could swoop in... I’d 
                        play hero, gain Marm’s trust, and 
                        boom -- I’d give Grady her schemes 
                        and contacts. 

                                 DORCY
                        But you flipped on Grady instead.

                                 GEORGE
                        Right. He was my way in to the 
                        underworld. But he wasn’t the fence 
                        who could make my dreams come true. 
                        Marm was. Now, ‘cause of Sophie’s 
                        loose lips, I need a way out. So 
                        Marm is Grady. And she will be 
                        jailed. And you are Marm. Except 
                        you will be the hero of the NYPD.

           EXT. OPIUM DEN - NIGHT - SIMULATANEOUS

           Julius eavesdrops by a SEEDY ENTRANCE concealed by a curtain. 

                                 GEORGE (O.S.)
                        So I am going to need you to--

           THRASH. Rats fight between garbage cans. FUCK. The talking 
           inside stops. His cover is blown. He steels himself, and...

           INT. OPIUM DEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Julius passes through the curtain to find George. Alone. 

                                 JULIUS
                        Hey.

                                 GEORGE
                        Hey? What’re you doing here?

                                 JULIUS
                        Looking for someone to smoke with. 
                        What’re you doing?

                                 GEORGE
                        Having a smoke.

                                 JULIUS
                        Alone?

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah. Why? You fixen to kill me? 

           George laughs. Julius echoes it while checking around. 
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                        You want a pipe?

           Then, Julius spots BOOTS behind the CURTAIN of the next room.

                                 JULIUS
                        Uh... em... No thanks.

                                 GEORGE
                        But you said you came to smoke.

                                 JULIUS
                        Right. 

           Julius nervously laughs. Then, George takes a glance at the 
           two boots behind the curtain. Not sure what Julius saw. 

                                 GEORGE
                        Or... perhaps you think you saw 
                        something Mama wouldn’t be fond of.

                                 JULIUS
                        Like your opium?

                                 GEORGE
                        Sure. Something like that. 

           Julius looks George dead in the eye and takes a seat:

                                 JULIUS
                        Even if I did, “brothers are 
                        different”... Remember? 

           Julius takes the pipe and hits it. George smiles at his mark.

                                 GEORGE
                        Indeed they are.

           And behind the curtain, we watch Dorcy as he slips out the back.

                                 JULIUS (PRE-LAP)
                        Sophie wasn’t lying...

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S CLAPBOARD HOME - DINING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           The sunrise peeks through the window. Marm sits across Julius.

                                 JULIUS
                        The heist is a double cross. We 
                        scam the law. George scams us. You 
                        get arrested.

                                 MARM
                        Dorcy’s letting him rob the bank?
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 JULIUS
                        In order to catch you in the act. 
                        Undeniable proof with an army of 
                        cops present. And George goes free.

           Julius takes out a CRUMPLED LETTER and gives it to Marm.

                                 JULIUS (CONT'D)
                        His love letter to Babe Draper. 
                        They’re skipping town right after.

           Beat. Marm reads, her concern and fury rising as we hear:

                                 MARM  (V.O.)
                        A single-mother is, perhaps, the 
                        busiest job in the world and George 
                        took advantage. He made me into a 
                        fool... Or at least he tried to. 

           Marm hands the letter back and looks at Julius, intensely. 

                                 MARM
                        He needs to be taken care of.

                                 JULIUS
                        Mother... We don’t do that.

                                 MARM
                        I don’t intend to do anything. You 
                        give this little love note to 
                        Shang. And we’ll see what happens.

           Off the death sentence, the burden on Julius’s shoulders...

           INT. BROTHEL - NIGHT

           A BLONDE-HAIRED-HEAD bobs up and down. George enjoys a 
           blowjob from someone who is not Babe Draper. In full ecstasy, 
           he leans back, looking up at the ceiling --

           And Shang steps up. Red with fury. The door wide open. 

                                 SHANG
                        BURN IN HELL, RAT FUCK!

           Shang presses a GUN to George’s forehead... CLICK... 

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S CLAPBOARD HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           ECHOES OF A GUN SHOT bleed over as Marm peeks through the 
           curtains. She spots a HORSE, lit by lantern, riding up the 
           street. Its driver: Shang. He stops. They locks eyes...

           Then, Shang nods. The deed is done. And Marm shuts the curtain. 
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           She paces in her room. ERRATIC. Waiting to burst. Then, she 
           sees the pillow she suffocated her husband with. The only 
           other time she was responsible for murder. The moment that 
           led her here. And she grabs it, STUFFS her face into it -- 

           And SCREAMS. Like a muted lion. After a few moments, she sets 
           it down, straightens herself and gently calls out:

                                 MARM
                        Julius, dear?

           After a moment, Julius enters with RED EYES. Marm shuts the door.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Tell Shang he needs to leave town. 
                        Tonight. And give him this... for 
                        all he’s done for us.

           Marm hands Julius an envelope of CASH. 

           INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

           ANGLE ON: George, a flicker of fear frozen on his face as he 
           lies in his COFFIN. The morticians did a shoddy job of covering 
           up the bullet hole in his forehead. FIFTY FUNERAL GUESTS fill 
           the room; CRIMINALS from New York, SNOBS from Cincinnati. 

           AND WAY IN THE BACK: Marm stands beside Julius. They both gaze 
           longingly at George’s corpse.

                                 MARM (V.O)
                        Adaptation. Survival is change. 
                        George forced me to pivot on my 
                        code and pounce. This sin was on 
                        his soul. Not mine. 

           Dorcy enters. Julius immediately tenses.

                                 JULIUS
                        Holy shit. Is he here for us?

                                 MARM
                        No. We were careful. 

           Marm watches carefully as Dorcy approaches GEORGE’S PARENTS.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        He’s here to talk to anyone George 
                        knew to get as many details as 
                        possible to bring us down...

                                 JULIUS
                        So what do we do?
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 MARM
                        We take Manhattan Savings.

                                 JULIUS
                        Wait. You still want to do this?

                                 MARM
                        Tonight. It’s our only chance to 
                        reap the rewards. Dorcy is 
                        distracted.

           Marm feigns tears as she grabs a tissue and dabs her eye.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Out the back. Act like you need 
                        fresh air.

           Julius follows and whispers as they walk toward an exit:

                                 JULIUS
                        We don’t even have a crew. Me and 
                        Pat can’t do it without--

                                 MARM
                        I’ll fill in for George. 

                                 JULIUS
                        And what about the fourth man?

           EXT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - BROADWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           HORSE HOOVES trot down the street before coming to a stop off 
           the command from its driver: Sophie. Marm gets out the back 
           with Pat. Before they go, Marm indicates to Sophie’s belly.

                                 MARM
                        That comes first. If anything 
                        happens out here, just go. 

           Sophie nods. Marm leads Pat toward...

           EXT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - BLEECKER ENTRANCE

           Marm and Pat toe into the alley, toward the side entrance. 
           Marm KNOCKS on the door. Seven times. Like they planned. And 
           then, Julius opens the door in janitor’s gear. They enter.

           INT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - JANITOR’S ROOM 

           Surrounded by janitorial tools, Julius hands out supplies; WOOL 
           BAGS, LANTERNS, KEYS... But Marm notices his hand is shaking.

                                 MARM
                        Are you okay, son?
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 JULIUS
                        Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Of course.

           Julius grabs his shaky hand to try to steady it.

                                 JULIUS (CONT'D)
                        Let’s fucking do this.

           Marm and Pat exchange a glance. Julius takes a step forward.

           INT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - GRAND LOBBY

           They’ve entered the lobby. Just like George’s replica; they 
           pass the ARCHED TELLER CAGES, the WATCHMAN’S CLOSET on the 
           right, CONFERENCE ROOM on the left... 

           And Marm leads the way to the CIRCULAR VAULT... 

           Once there, Pat turns the SPINDLE (looks like a Ship’s 
           Captain’s Wheel) in three distinct directions. THE FACADE DOOR 
           OPENS. That’s one.

           Now, they stand before a SECOND RECTANGULAR STEEL DOOR 
           enforced by RODS. Marm pulls at it herself, but there’s no 
           give. Before she can ask -- CLICK -- the door UNLOCKS. 

           Pat points to the CLOCK above the vault -- striking 9:00PM. 

                                 PAT SHEVELIN
                        Timed. Every 6 hours. 

           That’s two. Pat places his hand on THE THIRD STEEL DOOR while 
           retrieving a KEY from his pocket. He inserts it. THEN:

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN (O.S.)
                        Mr. Shevelin?

           Pat spins to find -- THE NIGHT WATCHMAN (20s, rugged).

                                 PAT SHEVELIN
                        Nick? What’re you doing here?

           And HIS MISTRESS (20s, smeared lipstick) emerges from the closet.

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN
                        She likes banks. What about you? 

                                 PAT SHEVELIN
                        I forgot something at my station. 

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN
                        Why’s the janitor here? And who’s 
                        the old lady?
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 JULIUS
                        My mother. She also likes banks.

           Standoff. They’re both being shady. But before Marm works her 
           magic -- Julius whips out a COLT45 and aims it at the Watchman.

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN
                        No! Don’t!

                                 MISTRESS
                        Oh my, God!

                                 MARM
                        Julius! 

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN
                        I have kids!

                                 MISTRESS
                        You do?

                                 PAT SHEVELIN
                        He does.

                                 MARM
                        Put the gun away. 

                                 JULIUS
                        I’m not going to jail because of 
                        this bastard’s infidelity.

                                 PAT SHEVELIN
                        He’s right. Just shoot him.

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN
                        Pat? Please --

           Julius is shaky, inching over. Marm moves to be the only 
           thing between the gun and the young couple.

                                 MARM
                        Let me handle this, Julius.

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN
                        I won’t tell anyone. Listen to her-- 

                                 JULIUS
                        I’m done listening to other people.

           Julius SHOOTS a round at the Watchman’s feet. But his aim is 
           WAY OFF as the bullet DINGS off a MARBLE PILLAR! 

           The Watchman DROPS to the ground in fear. Mistress shrieks as 
           Julius raises the pistol to aim and shoot again -- 
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           But Marm grabs his arm! 

                                 MARM
                        You are not going to kill anyone.

           Mother and son both hold the gun, danger brewing between them.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        We’ll lock them in the closet. No 
                        one’s going to jail. 

           A stare down. Both refuse to let go. 

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                          (to the Watchman)
                        Slide your gun over here.

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN
                        I don’t have a--

                                 MARM
                        Boy, now is not the time to lie.

                                 JULIUS
                        See! He’ll burn us. So let go.

           A tiny beat. Watchman takes his gun off his waist and slides 
           it to the other end of the lobby. A sign of peace. 

                                 MARM
                        Pat, get his cuffs and chain them 
                        to something sturdy in the closet.

           Pat walks to the Night Watchman and takes the handcuffs off 
           his waistband. The Watchman and Mistress both stand, shaky.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        I highly suggest you don’t try 
                        anything funny. Understood?

           They nod profusely. Pat leads the way to the closet. The 
           couple follows. But Marm and Julius both still hold the gun.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        What the hell are you thinking?

                                 JULIUS
                        I’m playing the game --

                                 MARM
                        Oh, no you are not. Give it to me.

                                 JULIUS
                        It’s mine. I bought it.
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           That lands on Marm. Fury. Fear. But no time for either.

                                 MARM
                        Julius -- GIVE. ME. THE. GUN.

           Beat. Marm stares, intensely. Finally, Julius hands it over.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Start on the deposit boxes. We’re 
                        running out of time. And now I have 
                        to go find your fucking bullet.

           Julius, ashamed, moves to the vault. Marm tucks the gun in her 
           waistband and begins searching on the ground for the bullet...

           EXT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - BROADWAY ENTRANCE

           A FAINT BANG from inside. Sophie checks her pocket watch. 
           9:15pm. Where are they? 

           THEN, a HORSE & CARRIAGE trots up with a SKEEZ driving it. 

                                 SKEEZ
                        You okay over there, Ma’am?

           Fuck. Sophie straightens herself, sneaks a glance at the bank.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Yes. Fine. Sir.

                                 SKEEZ
                        I could... come over there and... 
                        help you. If you’re interested.

           He grins. She cocks her head.

                                 SKEEZ (CONT'D)
                        These streets are dangerous, and, 
                        you know... I could keep you safe.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Maybe that’s the reason you 
                        shouldn’t come any closer.

                                 SKEEZ
                        Pardon?

                                 SOPHIE
                        If we’re going to speculate, let’s 
                        speculate. The streets could be 
                        dangerous because I am the danger.

                                 SKEEZ
                        A purdy lady like yourself?
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 SOPHIE
                        Sure. Perhaps this lady put a 
                        bullet in a man’s brain before.

           He considers her. Not sure what to make of that.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        You ever look into the eyes of 
                        someone who knows he’s gonna die? 
                        Pure fear. Pathetic. Yet 
                        heartbreaking. At least for me. 
                        ‘Cause last time I did it that man 
                        put a bump in my belly, too... See?
                          (re: her belly, then)
                        And I still pulled the trigger on 
                        that weak son of a bitch. Hope my 
                        baby boy ain’t too upset about that 
                        in there.

           A dark beat. Sophie holds her stomach. The Skeez remains.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        Whatcha waiting for, big boy? Come 
                        on over here. 

           Sophie moves her hand to her waistband, ready to draw her 
           weapon... And he senses she’s dead ass serious.

                                 SKEEZ
                        You be safe out there.

           He turns to trot away on his horse. THEN --

           We see Sophie’s hand, holding nothing. She was bluffing and he 
           was conned by the master. She grabs her belly from the baby 
           kicking... And then she looks to the bank, impatiently...

           INT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - VAULT

           ANGLE ON: JEWELRY DUMPED into a WOOL BAG. Pat holds the bag, 
           and Julius scurries back to OPENED SECURITY DEPOSIT BOXES. 

           Meanwhile, Marm pops off the SAFE’S DIAL KNOB, revealing the 
           LITTLE JOKER. She REMOVES the device and analyzes the 
           indentations on its tin wheel. Then, she replaces the dial. 
           She compares the Joker’s indentations to the dial numbers and 
           enters: 80-9-25 (the real combination)... CLICK. 

           The door opens.

           She opens it wider and a GOLD GLOW emerges on her face a la 
           PULP FICTION. But we get to see what’s inside: 

           BARS OF GOLD. STACKS OF CASH. CLUMPS of JEWELRY. 
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 JULIUS
                        It’s... real.

                                 PAT SHEVELIN
                        It’s a fortune.

                                 MARM
                        It’s ours.

           Marm grasps TWO STACKS OF HUNDREDS and DUMPS THE STACK OF CASH 
           into one of the wool bags. She motions for Pat to hold the bag 
           and Julius to assist. Together, Mother and Son race to steal 
           all SEVENTY STACKS and transfer them into another bag. 

           Once the cash is emptied -- Marm digs into the gold:

                                 PAT SHEVELIN
                        We don’t have time for that.

                                 MARM
                        We are NOT leaving gold.

           Pat nervously checks the clock. Marm nods to Julius. He helps 
           her transfer all FIFTY BARS OF GOLD from safe into the bag. 

           Then, Pat hoists his bag up --

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Not yet. The right compartment --

           Marm fusses with a lock inside the safe to another compartment.

                                 PAT SHEVELIN
                        It’s just securities.

                                 MARM
                        Of all the fat cats in New York.

                                 JULIUS
                        We have enough.

                                 MARM
                        They have enough.

           Marm begins SLAMMING the inside door to the extra 
           compartment. Pat and Julius exchange a look.

                                 PAT SHEVELIN
                        We’ll have a hard time selling ‘em 
                        anyway --

                                 MARM
                        Shut up and help me!

                                 JULIUS
                        Mother... Please. We’ve already been 
                        in here too long.

           Beat. Marm studies her son, a scared little boy. And she stops.

                                 MARM
                        Haul the bags out.

                                 PAT SHEVELIN
                        What about the watchman? 

                                 MARM
                        I’ll handle it.

           Marm wears a stoic gaze, as they run out with bags of loot...

           EXT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - BROADWAY ENTRANCE

           Sophie holds the reigns. BAGS OF LOOT between Julius and Pat 
           in the back. They’re still waiting for -- MARM who bursts 
           through the Broadway Entrance. She’s delighted to see Sophie. 

                                 MARM
                        You waited.

           Sophie smiles. Marm hops in -- with her own bag.

                                 SOPHIE
                        What’s in the bag?

                                 PAT SHEVELIN
                        You took the securities?

                                 MARM
                          (eyeing Julius)
                        Bullet. Shell. Gun. Our only trace 
                        and it’ll be dumped in the river.
                          (then, to Sophie)
                        Now take us to my warehouse.

           Sophie SHAKES the reigns and the horse races them off into night.

           INT. MANHATTAN SAVINGS INSTITUTION - VAULT - THE NEXT MORNING

           VAULT CLERK goes through the motions as he steps into the open 
           vault. Wait. OPEN? The safe emptied, security boxes gone.

                                 VAULT CLERK

           INT. NEW YORK STREETS - MORNING

           NEW YORKERS HUDDLE around newsstands carrying the (real) 
           headlines: “Manhattan Savings robbed OF 3 MILLION!!” “Most 
           Sensational Heist in History!” “THE KING OF BANK ROBBERS STRIKES!” 
           George’s coveted legacy now attributed to Marm. CROSSFADE INTO:

           EXT. MANDELBAUM'S DRY GOODS' STORE - STREETS - DAY

           Marm, in her flamboyant hat, plasters a SOLD SIGN on the 
           window. IMMIGRANTS, ORPHANS, and WHORES watch. Proud. 

           EXT. THIEVES EXCHANGE - NIGHT

           Marm walks by the new criminals of the day. No one protests 
           her being there. In fact, a thick pack forms around her. 

                                 MARM
                        Friends. It’s your lucky day. I am 
                        having a going out of business sale 
                        and I have enough loot to supply an 
                        army... Who’s interested?

           Off the shouts of offers and waves of cash --

           INT. PINKERTON AGENCY - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           The Night Watchman sits across Dorcy.

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN
                        No. I didn’t see this Miss Mandel-
                        whatever that night.

                                 DORCY
                        Bullshit.

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN 
                        Sir, I’ve already lost my job for 
                        this. If I saw someone there, I 
                        would’ve said it by now.

                                 DORCY
                        She paid you off, didn’t she?

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN
                          (yes)
                        No.

           Dorcy sees past it. The Night Watchman fusses in his seat.

                                            (CONT'D)
                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN
                        I don’t need to sit here and deal 
                        with accusations from some wannabe 
                        cop.

                                 DORCY
                        Actually, the NYPD is working with 
                        me on this one. So you do. Now 
                        explain to me how the watchman 
                        misses a break in.

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN
                        Because the thief was in and out 
                        like a ghost.
                          (then, an idea forming)
                        Wait. You ever find the one who 
                        took Dexter Bank?

           Dorcy clocks the cover story, nearly excited by the lie.

                                 DORCY
                        No. We didn’t.

                                 NIGHT WATCHMAN
                        Maybe it’s the same guy?

           Dorcy stands, places his hand on his shoulders to play nice guy. *

                                 DORCY
                        Listen Kid, I found a bullet graze 
                        on one of the pillars...

           The Watchman’s leg begins bouncing under the table.

                                 DORCY (CONT'D)
                        And I’m trying to help you here. 
                        Because if you didn’t hear gunfire, 
                        and you didn’t see anybody... 
                        perhaps you were the one who robbed 
                        the Manhattan Savings Institution.

           EXT. MANDELBAUM'S DRY GOODS' STORE - NIGHT

           Marm hands over the STORE KEYS to a YOUNG WHITE MAN. He 
           cheerfully walks inside. Marm gives her former store one last 
           look and walks away. After several strides, she passes a 
           STREET DWELLER in the ALLEY. She doesn’t pay him mind...

           BUT THEN MARM IS TACKLED TO THE GROUND. As she struggles, a 
           HOOD IS FORCED OVER her HEAD... and our POV GOES BLACK.

           INT. PINKERTON AGENCY - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Silence. Marm sits across Dorcy. The CLOCK ticks. Tocks. 

                                 MARM
                        Do you really believe a fifty year 
                        old woman is capable of taking the 
                        Fort Knox of banks?

                                 DORCY
                        Yes. Yes. I do.

                                 MARM
                        Under what pretense? My record is 
                        clean and I have good standing 
                        within my community. 

                                 DORCY
                        People talk when you offer them 
                        money. 

                                 MARM
                        Is that a confession of bribery?

                                 DORCY
                        Do you have proof of your 
                        accusation?

           Beat. Dorcy smirks, strokes his BATON.

                                 MARM
                        I want my lawyer.

                                 DORCY
                        What happened to George Leslie?

                                 MARM
                        You tell me. Word is that you were 
                        the one working with him.

                                 DORCY
                        Does that concern you?

                                 MARM
                        It should concern you. Perhaps all 
                        your information died with George. 

                                 DORCY
                        Why did you kill him? 

                                 MARM
                        Really, Sir?
                          (then)
                        Look, I could cry if it makes you 
                        feel better about letting me off.
                        Give me a moment. It’s been a 
                        while... Wait. Here it comes.

           As Marm face scrunches up -- Dorcy SMASHES HER WITH THE 
           BATON. She CRASHES down to the floor. 
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 DORCY
                        Will ya look at that. Motherbird 
                        got her egg scrambled.

           ANOTHER SWIPE TO HER JAW. Marm spits BLOOD. Dorcy mounts her. 
           As she re-orients herself, she sees Dorcy through hazy vision:

                                 MARM
                        Flaunting power while risking 
                        nothing. How manly of you.

           WHACK. Dorcy smacks her. She SPITS OUT BLOOD, clenches her 
           eyes. ANOTHER POP to her nose. SHE SQUEALS. BLOOD SPURTS. 

                                 DORCY
                        Go on. Start talking.

                                 MARM
                        Do what you will. Violence is your 
                        weapon. But strength is a mother’s.

           Marm braces for another whack -- 

                                 DORCY
                        You know what, you’re right.

           But Dorcy surprises her by calming down. He stands.

                                 DORCY (CONT'D)
                        But when you use someone strength 
                        against them, you find their 
                        weakness... Bring him in!

           TWO COPS walk in, ushering in a handcuffed -- JULIUS.

                                 MARM
                        Julius!

                                 JULIUS
                        MOTHER?!

                                 DORCY
                        I told you I had something. The kid 
                        shot off his gun that night. And I 
                        got a witness who’s willing to 
                        testify in court...

           Marm is horrified. She struggles to get to her son but Dorcy 
           keeps his foot on her neck. And Julius pushes to get to his 
           mother -- but he’s restrained. 

                                 JULIUS
                        I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU!
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 DORCY
                        Now... who murdered George Leslie?

           Dorcy raises his BATON toward Marm. Julius opens his mouth --

                                 MARM
                        I DID. 

                                 JULIUS
                        NO!

                                 MARM
                        And I took the bank. I’m the 
                        fence... My son doesn’t know how I 
                        earn my money. None of my kids do.

           Marm looks at Julius, desperate.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        I love you, baby. Don’t say a word.

           And Julius stays silent. Dorcy nods for them to take him away. 

                                 DORCY
                        I’ll be back with your confession.

           Dorcy leaves, too. As Marm is a bloody mess on the floor.

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        Sacrifice. My ninth virtue.

           She rests her head in her own pool of blood. Off her defeat --

           INT. BILL HOWE’S LAW OFFICE - DAY

           Marm sits across Bill Howe in an elegant office. She’s 
           focused on NEWSPAPER HEADLINE: “REDEMPTION: STAN DORCY, JR. 
           NABS MOST CORRUPT WOMAN IN NEW YORK!” accompanied by (the 
           real) offensively drawn caricature of Marm appearing guilty.

                                 BILL HOWE
                        We’re looking at forty years.

                                 MARM
                        I’m too old for that, Bill. What’s 
                        your other option?

                                 BILL HOWE
                        I’m afraid there isn’t one. I 
                        could get your sentenced reduced 
                        if you give up the names of your 
                        accomplices.

                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 MARM
                        I had none.

                                 BILL HOWE
                        Marm, you didn’t do this alone. 
                        Perhaps there’s an inside banker?

                                 MARM
                        You know how I feel about loyalty. 
                        Come on, we’ve been evading prison 
                        for quite some time... 

                                 BILL HOWE
                        Right. But this is different. We’re 
                        lucky Judge Donahue’s bail held up.

                                 MARM
                        Don’t ever call me lucky.

                                 BILL HOWE
                        Look, as your lawyer, I’m trying to 
                        get your affairs in order. 
                        Detective Dorcy is your police 
                        escort until sentencing. There’s no 
                        way out of this. It’s over, Marm.

           Marm considers her options, her reality. And she tears up... 

                                 BILL HOWE (CONT'D)
                        Don’t do this. It’s unnecessary.

           But it’s real. Marm is crying because she realizes it is 
           over. Her career, her life. Bill hands her a tissue. 

                                 MARM
                        Get your pen out.

                                 BILL HOWE
                        Why?

                                 MARM
                        Because I want to give a statement.

                                 BILL HOWE
                        To whom?

                                 MARM
                        New York.

           Beat. Bill takes out a pen. Marm considers her words. And he 
           begins writing as she speaks:

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Have corrupt Presidents gone to 
                        jail? Profiteers off the Civil War? 
                        Slave Owners? The elite who pay 
                        pitiful wages or incite hatred 
                        between Italians and Irish, Germans 
                        and Jews, unemployed and freed 
                        slaves -- anything to keep us 
                        against each other? No. None of 
                        them. I’ll tell you who’s gone to 
                        jail this year: Susan B. Anthony 
                        for unauthorized voting. This world 
                        gives people like me two options: 
                        beg or lose. And when you beg in 
                        America, you lose anyway. Because 
                        life is free but living is not. So 
                        I created a third option. Do it on 
                        my own terms. The front door was 
                        locked, so I opened the back. I 
                        understood the American system -- 
                        you get what you pay for -- and I 
                        paid to play. And you know what? I 
                        have not one single regret. 

           Bill shifts in his seat, uncomfortable. 

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Have every newspaper print every 
                        word. Not one edit. No one’s ever 
                        told me how to live my life. And 
                        it’s not gonna start now. 

           INT. MANDELBAUM’S CLAPBOARD HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           This time it’s NOT bursting with energy. It’s Marm and her four 
           children eating dinner. CLANGS of silverware. It’s gloomy. 
           Quiet. Resentment fills the air.... Marm looks at Julius.

                                 MARM
                        What did you say to them?

                                 GERTIE
                        Secrets kill families, right?

                                 SARA
                        He told us the truth.

                                 ANNA
                        That you’re going to prison.

                                 JULIUS
                        But it should be me. A man should 
                        face his own consequences.

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 MARM
                        Thank you all for your input. Now 
                        eat. All of you.

           But the children have stopped eating. They are unified.

                                 GERTIE
                        It’s your turn to listen. A mother 
                        shouldn’t abandon her children. 

                                 MARM
                        What?

                                 SARA
                        You cared more about kids on the 
                        street than you did for us.

                                 MARM
                        That is not --

                                 ANNA
                        We were just your excuse to do 
                        what you did. But it wasn’t for 
                        us... You did it for yourself.

           And that one tagged Marm the wrong way --

                                 MARM
                        I haven’t done a thing for myself 
                        since before I killed your father!

           An atomic bomb. The children are too stunned to cry, to 
           emote... But Marm feels no sympathy. They asked for this.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Not because I wanted to. Because he 
                        begged me to. He couldn’t watch you 
                        suffer anymore. So he left me to do 
                        it -- alone. For that, I will never 
                        forgive him. But I would suffocate 
                        him over and over and over and over 
                        if I was given the chance. Because 
                        that’s the only way he could die in 
                        peace. The only way we could keep 
                        our promise... Children first.

           Finally, Marm makes eye contact with each of them:

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        And in spite of my flaws and all 
                        the things that people will say 
                        when I’m gone, I am a woman of my 
                        word and I always will be.

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           The room is dead silent. But Marm’s facade is brave. She 
           doesn’t cry because she has no regrets. No doubts. No shame. 

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Now, I promise on my word -- on my 
                        everything -- I will be okay. You 
                        will be okay. So everyone just-- 
                        STOP with your God-damned opinions. 
                          (then, vulnerable)
                        Please. Please just stop.

           A tense beat. Julius runs to hug his mother. He sobs into her 
           arms like a child... The daughters all follow suit and hug 
           her tightly... And as Marm embraces them, it’s clear: a 
           mother needs her child as much as a child needs their mother.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Oh, my sweet babies. I will miss 
                        you. Dear God, how I’ll miss you... 

           As we slowly pull away from this portrait of a family once 
           shattered... but now united...

           EXT. MANDELBAUM’S CLAPBOARD HOME - EARLY MORNING

           Marm exits her home, head-scarf, flamboyant hat, covered in a 
           lot of garb. She gets into a HORSE & CARRIAGE driven by 
           Dorcy, wearing a crisp POLICE UNIFORM.

                                 MARM
                        Don’t you look handsome.

                                 DORCY
                        Where are we going? 

                                 MARM
                        Synagogue. 

                                 DORCY
                        You and God got some talking to do 
                        before prison.

                                 MARM
                        Sure do. He’s a good listener.

           But then, Marm feels her HEART RACING for a moment. She 
           physically holds her chest and lets out a NASTY cough. Just as 
           Dorcy registers it, she covers any weakness. In pure defiance. 

                                 DORCY
                        Are you... okay?
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 MARM
                        That’s sweet. On our merry way, 
                        shall we?

           Dorcy eyes her. Marm rubs her chest to work out the kinks.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        Just a little stressed out as you 
                        can imagine. Now, please.

           Marm indicates for Dorcy to go... And he ruffles the reigns.

           INT. CONGREGATION TEMPLE RODEPH SHOLOM - DAY

           The Carriage comes to a HALT. Marm gets out. Dorcy waits. 
           But as she begins walking... She WOBBLES. She stops for a 
           moment. Steadies herself. Then walks into the synagogue.

           Dorcy checks in the alleys: A POLICE CARRIAGE in each one. He 
           makes eye contact with its officers, all on high alert...

           INT. CONGREGATION TEMPLE RODEPH SHOLOM - LATER

           Time has passed. Dorcy is just as astute as before, eyeing the 
           synagogue, waiting for Marm... He checks his POCKET WATCH. Hm. 
           And then he clocks the COPS watching in the nearby alley. No 
           one has seen anything. Time seems to be moving slowly. Until --

           Rabbi Schmidt BURSTS through the doors -- 

                                 RABBI SCHMIDT
                        She’s having a heart attack!

           Dorcy looks through the open doors and sees Marm lying down, 
           labored breathing, clutching her chest...

                                 RABBI SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
                        Send for a doctor!

                                 DORCY
                        What happened?

                                 RABBI SCHMIDT
                        She needs a medical carriage!

                                 DORCY
                        I’ll take her!

                                 RABBI SCHMIDT
                        What?

                                 DORCY
                        We CAN NOT let her die. Load her in.

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           A MAKESHIFT GURNEY CRASHES through the doors. Rabbi Schmidt 
           steers it. Dorcy on his tail. Marm lies on it; eyes 
           fluttering, lungs GASPING, GRUMBLING IN PAIN...

           Dr. Schmidt meets his Rabbi brother by the doors.

                                 RABBI SCHMIDT
                        Jacob! I think it’s her heart.

           Dr. Schmidt looks at Marm, incredulous. He does a quick check 
           of her pupils, they’re spinning out of control.

                                 DR. SCHMIDT
                        She needs morphine.

           Dr. Schmidt takes the gurney and begins STEERING aggressively 
           down the hall, leaving Rabbi Schmidt behind...

           But Dorcy follows the Doctor as the gurney flies by SICK 
           PATIENTS in a Gilded Age Emergency Room. And then, Marm’s 
           CHEST STOPS RISING. She is NOT BREATHING. DEAD.

                                 DR. SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
                        FUCK. 
                          (looking around, then)
                        MOVE.

           Dr. Schmidt PUSHES Dorcy aside and grabs a nearby NURSE --

                                 DR. SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
                        STEER THIS.

           She does as Dr. Schmidt hops on top of Marm, and begins 
           compressions. Repeatedly. UP. DOWN. UP. DOWN. 

           They take a hard LEFT DOWN ANOTHER HALL -- nearly CRASHING 
           into another GURNEY FLYING in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION. Dr. 
           Schmidt barely holds on, continuing his compression...

           As Dorcy gets lost in the shuffle, he watches as Dr. Schmidt 
           and the Nurse lead a coding Marm into an OPERATING ROOM... 

           INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - EVENING

           Silent. Rabbi Schmidt and Dorcy wait. Impatiently. For 
           different reasons. Rabbi Schmidt doesn’t want to lose his 
           friend. Dorcy can’t lose his 800 pound gorilla.

           Finally, Dr. Schmidt emerges. They both stand. 

                        DORCY
                                                RABBI SCHMIDT
           Where is she?
                                         How is she?
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           And Dr. Schmidt removes his hat. 

                                 DORCY (CONT'D)
                        No. No!

           Rabbi Schmidt grows emotional.

                                 DORCY (CONT'D)
                        I need to see her.

                                 DR. SCHMIDT
                        Sir, we ask for some decency --

           Dorcy SHOWS his NYPD BADGE -- 

                                 DORCY
                        Dead or alive. Now.

           Dr. Schmidt exhales. Dorcy pushes past, and heads down the 
           hall. And once he’s gone, for the briefest of moments, Dr. 
           Schmidt and Rabbi Schmidt exchange an odd look -- 

                                 RABBI SCHMIDT
                        She said... She said forgives you.

           Dr. Schmidt absorbs that. A moment of relief between the two 
           brothers before Dr. Schmidt turns to follow Dorcy... 

           INT. HOSPITAL MORGUE - MOMENTS LATER

           In a room full of corpses, Dorcy towers over ONE CORPSE as Dr. 
           Schmidt pulls the sheet, revealing: AN UNKNOWN WOMAN’S CORPSE. 

                                 DR. SCHMIDT
                        The cyanide must’ve killed her in 
                        her cell. Nothing we could do.

           Dorcy is shocked. Confused. ANXIOUS.

                                 DORCY
                        That isn’t Mandelbaum.

                                 DR. SCHMIDT
                        I thought you were waiting for the 
                        prisoner. Marm left hours ago.

           Dorcy begins looking around, erratically pulling off sheets 
           of every corpse in sight. None of them are Marm.

                                 DR. SCHMIDT (CONT'D)
                        It wasn’t a heart attack. Just 
                        stress. I recommended bedrest --

           Dorcy GRABS Dr. Schmidt’s lapels and SLAMS HIM on the wall.

                                 DORCY
                        YOU MOTHERFUCKER! You’re aiding and 
                        abetting a felon--

                                 DR. SCHMIDT
                        Sir, it is not my responsibility to 
                        monitor healthy patients after they 
                        are discharged --

                                 DORCY
                        WHERE THE FUCK IS SHE?!

           INT. TRAIN - EVENING

           A FRAIL OLD MAN with a SUITCASE sits on a MOVING TRAIN. Sophie 
           steps up with her OWN SUITCASE and sits beside him. 

                                 FRAIL OLD MAN
                        How are you feeling?

                                 SOPHIE
                          (re: her stomach)
                        She won’t stop kicking.

           The Frail Old Man touches Sophie’s stomach. It’s warm. And as 
           we look closer, we realize the OLD MAN is MARM in DISGUISE.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                        How are yours doing?

                                 MARM
                        Oh, you know. Lots of tears. But 
                        they’re in for a treat when my 
                        lawyer delivers the boxes I left. 
                        Diamonds. Legal, too.
                          (then, proudly)
                        My babies are millionaires now.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Wait, what? How?

                                 MARM
                        Thieves Exchange helped me liquify 
                        my assets. Judge Donahue never 
                        signed the liens. And the bondsman 
                        forgot to file his paperwork. Oh 
                        and the jeweler was a wonderful 
                        recommendation from my Rabbi. No 
                        one did anything illegal. Just a 
                        bunch of minor mistakes in the 
                        community that add up to, well, a 
                        fortune.

                               Pink Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 SOPHIE
                        And Detective Dorcy?

                                 MARM
                        He’ll be accused of being crooked 
                        for my escape. Lose his badge. 
                        Might even be jailed. The world is 
                        fair sometimes, eh?

           Marm smirks, satisfied, at peace. Sophie’s impressed.

                                 SOPHIE
                        One last con but this time the 
                        Government is your mark.

                                 MARM
                        No. My last con was on you. 
                        You’re not coming to Montreal.

           Sophie’s heart drops. Marm swaps suitcases with Sophie.

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                        You’re going to England with enough 
                        cash to start over.
                          (off Sophie’s apprehension)
                        Canada is too risky if I’m there. 
                        And I can’t leave you in New York 
                        with your old friends. This is the 
                        destination you need... You are 
                        going to be a great mother, Sophie.

           Sophie finds solace in Marm’s confidence. She looks up and 
           grabs Marm’s hand.

                                 SOPHIE
                        ... Thank you, Marm.

                                 MARM
                          (French accent)
                        Actually, it’s Madame Fuchs now.

           Off their embrace, with America fading further away through 
           the train window, we CROSSFADE TO:

           EXT. COTTAGE - CANADA - SUNSET

           THE SUN RISES over a GRASSY MEADOW. This is NOT New York. It’s 
           peaceful. Serene. On an idyllic porch, Marm rocks on a chair. 
           Years have passed. She’s wrinkly, frail, in deep thought --

                                 MARM (V.O.)
                        Wealth, my final virtue. It drives 
                        you to be bigger than what anyone 
                        says you’re capable of.

                                 MARM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                                 MARM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Be greedy for wealth. But not riches. 
                        Wealth isn’t a fancy horse, house, or 
                        a number in a bank account. It’s the 
                        ability to live how you choose 
                        regardless of a society, of a rigged 
                        system, of any individual. That 
                        wealth is real freedom. Not the 
                        American scam. 

           Marm flicks her eyes down to a HANDWRITTEN LETTER. She begins 
           writing what she just said as we notice that EACH VIRTUE is 
           WRITTEN in the letter. At the top is the addressee which reads: 

           “My dear Julius,” 

                                 MARM
                        Times are different for you now. 
                        New York has changed. But I hope my 
                        letter reminds you of where we came 
                        from. So your son will always know 
                        what the Mandelbaums stood for and 
                        who they stood against... I really 
                        wish I could meet him because, 
                        well, I think I’d be one hell of a 
                        grandmother, too. Maybe one day. 
                        Let him be your greatest profit, 
                        Julius. Let him change your life. 
                        Let him know that his Oma loved him 
                        before she even met him.

           Marm signs: “LOVE, MOTHER” and stuffs it into an envelope. 

                                 MARM (CONT'D)
                          (French accent)
                        Barbara?

           A FEMALE CARETAKER (40) comes out of the house -- 

                                 CARETAKER
                        Yes, Madame Fuchs? 

           Marm hands over the envelope.

                                 CARETAKER (CONT'D)
                        To your friends in New York again?

                                 MARM
                          (French accent)
                        Yes. I miss ‘zem very much. 

           The Caretaker offers a polite nod and takes her envelope 
           inside. Marm returns to rocking, daydreaming about her family.

           A NEIGHBOR passes. Marm waves. They wave back. It’s endearing. 
           Not one Canadian suspects this sweet old lady for being the 
           Most Wanted Criminal in America... 

           EXT. THE STATUE OF LIBERTY - 1886 

           We watch the STATUE OF LIBERTY as its first erected... The 
           symbol of America, Immigration, the New York that we know today 
           -- and it’s a woman. 

           CHYRON SCROLLS OVER THE IMAGERY:

           When her eldest daughter died, Marm snuck back into New York to attend the 
           funeral. After the services, she fooled authorities once again, by evading arrest 
           and fleeing back to Canada.

           Marm died in 1894. Her casket was sent back to New York, but rumors ran 
           rampant that she faked her own death to come back home in one final scam. At 
           her funeral, wealthy attendees reported major losses due to pick-pockets, further 
           supporting the theory that she was offering one last gift to her loyal criminals.

           “BLACK” LENA and “SHANG” DRAPER died in prison.

           “TRAVELING” JOHN GRADY was murdered on the streets, but a falsified autopsy 
           prevented further investigation. His death was ruled “a freak accident.”

           SOPHIE ELKINS and her son battled in court in an attempt to get the other arrested. 
           Sophie won. She was murdered at 75 years old. Her perpetrator was never found. 

           FREDERICKA “OLD MOTHER” MANDELBAUM, a fence who handled over $270M 
           (based on inflation), and the mastermind behind the biggest bank robbery in U.S. 
           History, was never jailed, killed, or a victim of crime.

           Marm lived on her terms and died on her terms. She did it her way.
