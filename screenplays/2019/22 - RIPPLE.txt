           FADE IN:

           EXT. LAKE BALSAM - DAWN

           Sunlight glistens as morning mist wafts ghostlike over the 
           calm surface. 

           In the Background, a HYDROELECTRIC DAM towers over the lake. 
           Stretching from one shore to the other like a castle wall.  

           OVER THIS IMAGE: 

           Mountain Top removal - strip mining on steroids - is a threat 
           to both the geography and communities of Appalachia. 

           Its air pollution, deforestation, waste dumping, and water 
           pollution cause mysterious and dire health effects. 

           Approximately 17,500 tons of ammonium nitrate (ANFO) are 
           detonated weekly. Equivalent to the power of a Hiroshima 
           bomb. 

           This need for energy resulted in the creation of man-made 
           Dams throughout the region. 

           With the Dams came lakes, and with the lakes came long buried 
           secrets...

           The last of the text fades away, and for what seems like an 
           eternity, we settle on the murky water. Waiting. 

           THUNK. A STONE breaks the surface and a RIPPLE forms. 

           PAN over to find - 

           BOB, 75, deep eyes, rough cheeks, standing at the edge of the 
           lake. Decked out in fishing gear, he warms his hands. Breath 
           clouding around him in the cold mountain air. 

           A FISH jumps where the stone landed. Bob’s found a good spot. 
           He makes his move, wading slowly into deeper water.
           Bob cuts a small figure amidst a shadow of the monstrous Dam.  

           He jams a wriggling earthworm onto a rusty hook. Casts his 
           line, and waits... 

           A WOMAN’S voice over breaks the quiet:

                                 MAGGIE (V.O.)
                        The hills of this land attached to 
                        us like strings to a puppet. 
                        Leading, guiding, never allowin’ us 
                        to stray too far. We’re protected 
                        here... So long as the hills’ll 
                        have us.  

           Suddenly, Bob’s line TIGHTENS. 

           He snaps to. Reels in his line, tugging the pole as hard as 
           he can -- until a BROWN TROUT emerges. 

           AT THE SHORE

           Bob unhooks the fish. Watches its life fade. Then - 

           A SOUND, the small splash of water, catches his attention. 

           He looks toward the sound, but the morning mist has turned 
           into a thick fog over the surface of the lake. 

           Bob peers through the fog. Walks forward, back into the 
           water. Another quiet splash. Bob whips his head towards it. 

           A moment passes. Then, a few small, HOVERING ORBS of faint 
           light, emerge from the fog like phantoms, gliding toward him.   

           He rises to his feet, his whole face tightens, frozen in 
           FEAR. We don’t see his view, but everything about his deep, 
           cavernous eyes tell us terror lies ahead. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK THE SOUND OF SIRENS LEADS US INTO -- 

           INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

           EXTREME TIGHT CLOSE-UP - a young man’s wasted face. JOHNNY 
           BARNES (25). On the verge of death. Oxygen mask covers his 
           mouth and nose. Eyes bulge, jaw locked tight, saliva FOAMS 
           through his lips.

           MAGGIE DAWSON, an EMT in her mid-30’s, speaks briskly into a 
           CB RADIO. 
                                 MAGGIE
                        Flying in a male, twenties...
                             (calling out)
                        We’re losin’ him.

           RICKY, 25, driving the ambulance, SLAMS on the GAS. 

           The ambulance careens around curving mountain roads that wind 
           above Lake Balsam and the Hydro Dam below. 

           Johnny’s heart rate FLATLINES. Maggie readies a 
           defibrillator. SHOCK - She hits him with it. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Come on. 

           Over and over again, she SHOCKS his chest.   

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           CLOSE-UP of Johnny’s haunted face as white linen covers it. 

           DOCTOR and NURSE stand over the body. Maggie leans against 
           the wall nearby. Doctor rubs his brow, devastated.  

                                 DOCTOR
                        Lost count this week.  

                                 MAGGIE
                             (doesn’t miss a beat)
                        Eleven. 

           Maggie gazes at the young man, now gone from this world. But 
           something catches her eye. 

           A STRANGE BLACK RASH, wrapped around his forearm. 

           SLOW PUSH on the RASH -- Swollen, bulging, poisoned flesh.    

           Maggie eyes the rash, then the Doctor. Like she wants to call 
           attention to it -- but something deep inside holds her back.

           INT. HOSPITAL - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Maggie splashes water on her face. Grips the sink tightly. 
           She takes deep, soothing breaths. Slowly, her grip loosens. 

           EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Maggie and Ricky exit. Pull their coats tight and cross the 
           parking lot toward their cars. 
           Ricky lights a cigarette, hands one to Maggie. 

                                 RICKY
                        I know I’m new here but...this 
                        can’t be normal, right? I mean, all 
                        the overdoses, suicides. Never seen 
                        nothin’ like it.

           Maggie takes a long drag. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Death always seems to come in waves 
                        ‘round here but... yeah, not like 
                        this. 

           Ricky sighs. Lost for words.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        You see that rash on him? Didn’t 
                        look right to me.  

                                 RICKY
                        Didn’t notice. 

           Maggie registers this as they reach their trucks.

                                 RICKY (CONT'D)
                        Well, you wanna take a load off? 
                        Grab a beer or somethin’? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I gotta get home. 

                                 RICKY
                        Figured as much. I’ll see you. 

           Ricky gets in his truck and drives off. 

           MAGGIE’S TRUCK

           She warms her hands on the heat. Watches as Ricky pulls out 
           of the lot. Waits. Then -- she swings open her door and...

           EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           ...Walks around the back of the hospital, into a side door. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Maggie’s footsteps echo as she walks down a lonely hallway. 

           She cautiously checks over her shoulders when she reaches...   
           INT. HOSPITAL - SUPPLY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...Door creaks open. Maggie uses light from her phone to scan 
           supplies along the wall. 

           She finds a bottle labeled MORPHINE. 

           She swipes it and stuffs it in her purse.   

           EXT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - NIGHT

           Maggie’s truck moves down a long gravel driveway, toward -- A 
           broken down old log cabin resting in a mountain holler.

           A stone’s throw from Lake Balsam, the cabin looks as much a 
           part of this land as the soil it sits on. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Maggie enters the foyer. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Pop? 

           No response. She moves into the KITCHEN. Drops her keys onto 
           the table next to a pile of OVER DUE MEDICAL BILLS.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Pop?

           Again, no answer. The silence steals her breath. 

           She eases around the corner, scared of what she might find. 

           In the living room -- an EMPTY HOSPITAL COT under a large 
           window, its sheets tossed haphazardly to the floor. 

           The site sends PANIC through Maggie’s bones. Then: 

           A TOILET FLUSHES. The HALLWAY BATHROOM door creaks open.

           CONWAY DAWSON (75), Maggie’s ailing father, stumbles out. 
           He’s scrawny, hunched over, like an old stork whose lost its 
           ability to fly. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        What the hell are you doin’?  

                                 CONWAY
                             (eyes bathroom)
                        Obvious ain’t it. 
           Maggie helps Conway back to the empty cot. Lays him down and 
           covers him with a quilt.

           He can’t seem to catch his breath. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You know not to be up when I ain’t 
                        around. 

                                 CONWAY
                             (raspy voice)
                        Not gonna sit here and shit myself. 

           Maggie holds up a bedpan. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        That’s what this is for.

           Conway scoffs - which quickly turning into a COUGHING FIT. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        See, now I gotta listen to this all 
                        night.  

           After a moment, Maggie softens -- clearly he’s in great pain. 
           She holds a rag to Conway’s mouth as he hacks up a lung. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        There you go. Let it out. 

           She takes the handkerchief away -- Peppered with BLOOD SPOTS. 

           She looks into Conway’s eyes. At his thin face, cracked and 
           leathery. The kind of skin you get from years in a COAL MINE. 

           He cringes from the pain in his chest. Gathers his voice...

                                 CONWAY
                        You get it?

           Maggie nods. Pulls out the stolen MORPHINE. 

           She moves into the kitchen and swipes a syringe and bottle of 
           whiskey from a cabinet’s top shelf. Kneels back by Conway. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Lay back now. 

           Maggie takes hold of his feeble arm. Ties it off as tight as 
           she can with a belt. 

           Pours WHISKEY on a protruding vein - injects with morphine.

           Then -- She sticks a dose of morphine into his leg. 
           Conway drifts off into bliss - to a world without pain. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Maggie climbs the rickety old stairs. 

           At the top, she looks right -- her bedroom. To the left -- 
           the MASTER BEDROOM, where the door is CLOSED. 

           A PADLOCK over the cedar door frame. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT 

           Maggie opens her medicine cabinet. Reaches for a pill bottle 
           labeled NUPLAZID. 

           Dumps two in her hand. Stares at them a moment before washing 
           them down.

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Maggie exits the bathroom. Starts toward her bedroom, but 
           stops -- 

           LIGHT seeps from under the Master Bedroom door, flickering 
           luringly. 

           Maggie tenses -- the sight deeply unsettling her.   

           She inches down the narrow hallway - reaches the door. 

           Where the PADLOCK has now been undone.

           She slowly takes off the lock, cups the doorknob, and 
           cautiously creaks open the old door.  

           INSIDE THE MASTER BEDROOM 

           It’s a cold, eerie, shrine. 

           The whole space has an untouched feel. Sterile, not lived in, 
           like that door hasn’t been opened in years. 

           On the bedside table, a LAMP FLICKERS ever so slightly. 

           Maggie glares at it. How did that get turned on? 

           She steps in, crossing the threshold. 

           Moving gingerly, as if intruding, she appraises the room --  
           Stopping in front of an old vanity in the corner. 
           CLOSE ON: Maggie’s THUMBNAIL, DIGGING into her palm. 

           An old, faded PHOTOGRAPH is tucked into the side of the 
           vanity mirror: 

           YOUNG MAGGIE standing with Conway (aged 45) and MARY, her 
           mother, 40, tight jawed and rigid, like Maggie. 

           Maggie looks at Mary. Then at herself... Replicas. 

           PUSHING IN on the photograph, Maggie notices something: 

           A BLACK RASH on her mother’s neck. Same as the one on Johnny 
           Barnes. Then - 

           Maggie’s nail digs too deep. Drawing BLOOD. This SNAPS Maggie 
           out of it. 

           She moves decisively to the flickering lamp, cuts it off, and 
           paces out of the room, slamming the heavy door behind her.  

           INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - MAGGIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Her childhood bedroom, now devoid of innocence. 

           Maggie lays awake in bed, tossing and turning. Wind howls.

           She scrolls through the contacts on her phone, landing on the 
           name ELLIS. She texts: Sleep well. Love You. 

           After a moment... Ellis responds: Love you too, Mom.  

           The text calms her enough to drift off to sleep.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. WILLIAM’S HOUSE - ELLIS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           ELLIS (12), Maggie’s son. Both shy and edgy, a quiet unease 
           always wrapped about him. He also tucks his phone away and 
           rests his eyes. 

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Deep in the night. The dark hallway is immersed in shadow. 

           A strange stillness. Suddenly - LIGHT. 

           A small flicker. From behind the master bedroom door. 

           SLOW PUSH IN on the door, like we’re being dragged toward it. 
           Out of nowhere, a WOMAN’S VOICE. 

           A Cacophonous, whispering tone. Demonic. Otherworldly even. 

           IN OUR HEADS. 

                                 VOICE
                        WAKE UP... TAKE MARY... 

           As the haunting voice hangs in the air, morphing into a 
           brutal and guttural moan, we --

                                                          CRASH CUT TO:

                                        BOOM!

           INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - MAGGIE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Maggie jerks AWAKE. 

           Drenched in cold sweat and unable to breathe.

           Slowly, her breath returns.

           She looks down to see BLOOD seeping from her palm, where her 
           nail dug involuntarily. 

           EXT. MAGGIE’S PROPERTY - DAY

           Maggie steps out into the frigid morning air. 

           Across the lake, SMOKE and DEBRIS soar into the sky off a 
           nearby Mountain’s peak. Another BLAST echoes across the land. 

           Maggie watches with disdain. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Maggie, scans one of the MEDICAL BILLS. 

           A letter from a health insurance provider -- DENYING 
           insurance to Conway. She rubs her temples. Grinds her teeth. 

           Suddenly, the kitchen lights FLICKER. The phone rings.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hello?

           SILENCE. Then: 
           A low, hollow DRONE emanates from the other end of the line.

           A voice? Calling out from some awful void? 

           The drone builds quickly to an aggressive static. Maggie 
           slams the phone down, cupping her ear in pain. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Maggie brings Conway breakfast. NEWS COVERAGE plays on TV. 
           Footage of weary townsfolk protesting the local Coal Mine:

           The company is nearly finished mining Black Mountain -- the 
           last great mountain in the area. 

           She glares at the TV, then pointedly looks away. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Got everything you need?

           Conway holds up his TV remote. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Alright then. See you later. 

           EXT. DAWSON PROPERTY - MORNING

           Maggie reaches her truck. Notices something on the 
           windshield. 

           She swipes her finger against the glass and pulls off a layer 
           of COAL DUST. Looks at it bitterly. 

           I/E. MAGGIE’S TRUCK/BLUE CREEK RIDGE - MORNING

           A withered old sign -- “Welcome to Blue Creek Ridge.” Maggie 
           drives past. 

                                 WOMAN #1 ON RADIO
                        It’s bad enough our mountains are 
                        gone, now our people are followin’.

           IN AERIAL 

           The road runs along LAKE BALSAM, which stretches until it 
           hits the HYDROELECTRIC DAM, separating the water from MILLER 
           COAL MINE -- feeding energy into it. 

                                 WOMAN #2 ON RADIO (V.O.)
                        My husband slaved away at Miller 
                        Coal for 25 years.

                        What’d he get for it? Nothin’ but 
                        black lung and no payoff.  

           SOARING HIGHER, we see entire sections of the mountain range 
           demolished -- raped and pillaged by Miller Coal. 

                                 MAN #1 ON RADIO (V.O.)
                        Two weeks from now, they’ll be done 
                        with Black Mountain. What happens 
                        then? 

           This last part particularly seems to intrigue Maggie. So much 
           so she hits off the radio.  

           UP AHEAD  

           ASH CLOUDS billow down from the Mountain, onto a line of cars 
           that are stopped by A BLOCKADE set by MILLER COAL. 

           Maggie slows. Out the window, she sees -- 

           LENNY (30), standing outside his parked car on the edge of 
           the lake, pulling on a WETSUIT. 

           They lock eyes. Nod to each other as she passes. 

           EXT. BLOCKADE - DAY

           Maggie pulls up to the blockade, where an ARMED EMPLOYEE of 
           Miller Coal waits. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        The hell’s this?

                                 ARMED EMPLOYEE
                        Re-routing traffic for the day. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        What for? 

                                 ARMED EMPLOYEE
                        Safety precaution during blasting. 
                        Need you to keep moving.   

           EXT. MILLER COAL MINE - DAY

           The behemoth mine rests on the edge of the desolate town -- a 
           constant shadow over Blue Creek Ridge.

           A CLUSTER of IRATE TOWNSFOLK crowd around the gated property 
           line, holding SIGNS and shouting ANGRILY.  
           But they’re blocked at the entrance by DOZENS OF MINE 
           SECURITY GUARDS, all armed with GUNS. 

                                 TOWNSFOLK
                        We want jobs! Not Machines! Save 
                        Black Mountain! 

           Maggie pushes her way through the picketers, up to a SECURITY 
           SHACK, where a GUARD, reading a newspaper, stands watch. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        My name’s Maggie Dawson. Here to 
                        see my husband William.  

           Guard doesn’t look up. Spits dip into a Diet Pepsi bottle.  

                                 GUARD
                        You on the list? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Why don’t you check it to find out. 

           Guard looks up. Spits another mouthful of dip then 
           begrudgingly scans the list.  

           EXT. MILLER COAL MINE - DAY

           WILLIAM (35), Maggie’s ex-husband, stands at the crest of a 
           hill, overlooking a Mountain Top Removal operation below. 
           Speaks sternly to TWO EMPLOYEES.

                                 WILLIAM
                        That’s it? You don’t know? Well, 
                        they didn’t just walk off.

           He’s mid-level management, but his hands and face are caked 
           in ash and soot. He’s the head of the grunts at Miller Coal, 
           yet still a grunt himself. 

                                 EMPLOYEE #1
                        It was late when it got here. We 
                        were tired. Must’ve - 

           William steps forward. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Listen to me. I gotta be the one to 
                        go upstairs and explain to them I’m 
                        short three damn cases ANFO this 
                        week. 3 whole cases of industrial 
                        fucking explosives.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        Now, you’re responsible for 
                        inventory, so I don’t need no 
                        excuses. I need answers.  

           Employee #1 glances past William. William turns to see -- 
           Maggie cresting the hill. 

           He looks slaps Employee #1 on the shoulder. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        Get back to work. Talk later. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Real riot on your hands out there. 

           William pulls cigarettes from his shirt pocket. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well, luckily if things go to shit, 
                        I ain’t high enough up the ladder 
                        to fall too far. 

           He lights up a smoke. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        Wanna go inside? 

           She shakes her head. Looks out at the mine operation below.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Can’t stay long. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        How’s your Pop? 

                                 MAGGIE
                             (pointedly)
                        Sick. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yeah I know but -- sorry. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        That’s what your company told me 
                        too. Right after they claimed 
                        bankruptcy to get off payin’ his 
                        insurance. 

           A BEAT as that stinger hangs in the air. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        What’re you doin’ here Maggie? If 
                        it’s about the road blocks, you 
                        know I don’t have the authority to -
                                 MAGGIE
                        I want to see him. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        You’re coming over for dinner 
                        tomorrow aren’t you? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I want to see him without you.   

           A sudden BLAST from the mine shakes the very ground they 
           stand on. William allows the dust to clear. Then answers.  

                                 WILLIAM
                        Can’t happen right now.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Why not?

                                 WILLIAM
                        You know why. 

           Maggie takes that in. Softens a bit. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Did you ever trust me? 

           William thinks a moment. Nods. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Then do it again.

           She steps forward, closer to William. More intimate.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I’m really tryin’ here, Will. But I 
                        can’t get better - I can’t get past 
                        what happened, without him. I need 
                        time with my son.  

           William takes a long drag from his cigarette. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Let’s leave tomorrow the way it is. 
                        But I’ll think about it. I promise. 

           Maggie nods. Flicks her cigarette down into the Mine and...

           EXT. MILLER COAL MINE - CONTINUOUS

           ...walks down the hill, back toward the gate, where a truck 
           passes by carrying a large supply of ANFO on the back. 
           Suddenly -- a STRANGE NOISE, a whisper, distant and enticing.

           Maggie stops on a dime. Slowly turns to an OLD MINE SHAFT. 

           She looks toward the dark abyss. PUSH IN UNTIL - BOOM! 
           Another blast from Black Mountain snaps her out of it. 

           EXT. MILLER COAL MINE - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Maggie crosses the lot. Protests continue in the background. 

           A stern woman in front, holding a sign, JULIE (30), breaks 
           from the crowd, and follows after Maggie. 

                                 JULIE
                             (calling out)
                        Maggie. 

           Maggie picks up pace. Pretending not to hear. 

                                 JULIE (CONT'D)
                        Maggie!

           But Maggie reaches her truck. Julie watches from afar, 
           disappointment in her eyes, as Maggie drives away. 

           EXT. LOCAL CLINIC - DAY

           A nondescript brick building under a foggy, gray sky. Maggie 
           pulls into the lot. She looks at the clinic, takes a breath. 

                                 DR. RILEY (V.O.)
                        You’re quiet today...

           INT. DR. RILEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Maggie chews nervously on her finger nails, not really 
           engaging with her therapist, DR. RILEY, 60.

                                 DR. RILEY
                        ...I know it’s hard to assign words 
                        to feelings that go beyond them. 
                             (beat)
                        Let’s try something else... 
                        Sometimes it’s easiest to just 
                        state a fact and go from there. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Like what?  
                                 DR. RILEY
                        Could be anything. “I woke up 
                        today.” “I got dressed.” “I found 
                        five dollars.” You never know what 
                        can trigger you into talking.

           Dr. Riley waits. Feeling safer now, Maggie clears her throat. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I woke up yesterday. Fed my Dad. 
                        Went to work. Then a young man died 
                        in my arms.  

                                 DR. RILEY 
                        That’s terrible Maggie. 

           Maggie shrugs. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        He wasn’t the first. Won’t be the 
                        last. 
                             (beat)
                        Tell you the truth, sometimes it 
                        just feels like this whole place is 
                        doomed, you know. Like no matter 
                        what I do, it won’t count for 
                        nothin’. In the end, Miller Coal’s 
                        still gonna blast the last 
                        mountain, drugs and poverty are 
                        always gonna be here, and people in 
                        these hills are still gonna die. 

           A moment passes as concern washes over Dr. Riley. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        And I know I shouldn’t let those 
                        kinds of thoughts in. I’m tryin’ 
                        not to, but sometimes I can’t help 
                        it. That make me a bad person?  

                                 DR. RILEY 
                        No. I think most people don’t have 
                        to deal with the kinds of things 
                        you face on a daily basis.  

           Maggie rubs her brow. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I know. But if I want to see my 
                        son, if I want to be apart of 
                        Ellis’ life again, I have to bury 
                        all that away, nestle it inside me 
                        somewhere. I just - I’m afraid 
                        it’ll come out one way or another. 
           Dr. Riley leans in. 

                                 DR. RILEY
                        That darkness you feel. That pull 
                        inside of you. You’re right, you 
                        will have to face it again. 
                             (beat)
                        These sessions are just preparing 
                        you for when that day comes.  

           EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

           Illuminated by moonlight, a struggling body comes into frame. 
           Pale feet kicking, clenched hands pawing.  

           A WOMAN DROWNING... pitch black, claustrophobic, terrifying. 
           Then - THE WOMAN’S VOICE. 

                                 VOICE
                        Wake up... Take Mary...

                                                          CRASH CUT TO:

           INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - MAGGIE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Maggie startles awake. She tries desperately to breathe. But 
           nothing comes. It’s like she’s still drowning. 

           She falls from her bed, collapsing onto the floor. Writhing. 

           Finally, she sucks in fresh air, as reality returns.  

           EXT. MAGGIE’S PROPERTY - DOCK - DAY

           Standing on the dock at the edge of her property, Maggie 
           looks out at Lake Balsam. 

           She kneels, reaches her hand out and cups the murky water. 
           Staring at the puddle in her hands, she parts them, letting 
           the water run through. 

           EXT. PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY

           A down home grease joint. Packed with old coal miners smoking 
           cigarettes and drinking black coffee. A place lost in time.

           In the parking lot, Maggie and Ricky eat lunch on the back of 
           the ambulance. A black SUV pulls into the lot. 
           3 MEN in suits exit. Executives from Miller Coal. They’re 
           followed by an ARMED GUARD. 

           Another car pulls in behind. Protesters exit, carrying signs 
           and shouting at the executives. They’re lead by Julie.   

           Immediately, Maggie starts packing up her lunch. 

                                 MAGGIE 
                        Let’s get out of here.  

           Now he notices Julie too. 

                                 RICKY
                        Who’s that?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Just get in. 

           Maggie and Ricky climb into the front of the ambulance, but 
           not before Julie and Maggie lock eyes.  

           Julie nods to Maggie as Ricky drives off. 

           INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

           Ricky drives, while Maggie watches the town pass by below. 

                                 RICKY
                        What was that all about? 
                             (when she doesn’t answer)
                        Come on, we been ridin’ in this rig 
                        a month and I barely know you. Shit 
                        I think we’ve carried more bodies 
                        than conversations. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Her name’s Julie McCall. 

                                 RICKY
                        Real uptight chick that writes for 
                        the paper?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah. We was buddies in high 
                        school. Now she keeps tryin’ to get 
                        me to join the protests. 

                                 RICKY
                        What for?
                                 MAGGIE
                        Ever since they declared 
                        bankruptcy, Miller Coal doesn’t 
                        have to pay health care, pension, 
                        retirement. Nothin’. 
                             (beat)
                        Then what they do is go to the 
                        families, and “offer a way out.” 

                                 RICKY
                        A way out?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Try to buy your land. And at that 
                        point, they know you need the 
                        money, so they buy it cheap. Most 
                        folks can’t afford to resist. 

                                 RICKY
                        That’s fucked up. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah. They done it to my dad. Won’t 
                        be long now before they come 
                        knockin’ on my door.

           Maggie looks out the window, watching Lake Balsam pass by 
           when CRRSH - The radio clicks on. 

                                 CB RADIO VOICE
                        All Units please respond to 348 
                        Warwoman Road. Code 0 in progress.  

           Maggie’s head snaps to the CB RADIO. Fear in her eyes. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        That’s my Uncle’s house. 

           Ricky clicks on the siren and speeds off. 

           EXT. 348 WARWOMAN ROAD - EVENING

           Thick smoke rises from the chimney of a small brick house.

           PAN down to see half a dozen cop cars with blue lights 
           flashing. Deputies crouch behind cover, facing the house, 
           GUNS DRAWN. 

           Sirens wail as Maggie and Ricky pull in. 

           She rushes toward the chaos, but SHERIFF EARLE HOLLAND, a 
           bull of a man, grabs her. 
                                 MAGGIE
                        Let me go Sheriff. 

           But Sheriff Holland keeps a tight grip. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        What’s goin’ on?  

           Just then -- BOOM! A shotgun blast rips through the window. 

           Sheriff Holland drags Maggie to the ground, taking cover 
           behind his car. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        He barricaded himself in there. 
                        Shoutin’ nonsense and shooting 
                        every which way.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        What about Jan? 

           Sheriff Holland looks morose. Maggie tries to remain calm.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Let me talk to him. I’ll get him to 
                        come out. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        Can’t let you do that. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        The only other way this is gonna 
                        end is you stormin’ in guns 
                        blazin’. 

           Sheriff Holland takes a deep breath. Against his better 
           judgement...

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        Alright then. 
                             (stern)
                        But if you can’t get him out 
                        peacefully, we’ll have to take 
                        over. That happens, you hit the 
                        deck and don’t even think about 
                        interferin’. You hear me?  

           MINUTES LATER -- WIDE SHOT of the house. Everything strangely 
           still. Quiet. 

           We PUSH IN, very slowly, until -- Maggie’s foot comes into 
           frame. Moving with us. 
           As she stops in the front yard, CAMERA stops. Rises. Her full 
           body - strapped with a bullet proof vest -- now in frame. 

           A bit of movement FLASHES by the front window. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Uncle Bob. It’s Maggie. I know its 
                        been a while. But I’m here to help 
                        you. 

           Again, no response. Maggie looks back at Sheriff Holland. 

           She gives him a gesture: Wait. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I’m comin’ up onto the porch.  

           Maggie bravely steps forward onto the creaking steps when - 

                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        Maggie. 

           Maggie stops. Swallows. 

                                 BOB (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I don’t like it here. 

           His voice sounds frail and gravelly. Lost. Droning. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Well, I’ll take you someplace safe. 
                        All you gotta do is - 

                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        Where’s Mary? Where’s my sister? 

           Maggie’s jaw locks. Her whole body tense. She gathers what 
           little voice she can muster. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        She’s gone. You know that. 

           A LONG QUIET. 

           Then a heavy THUNK on the other side of the door. The sound 
           of IRON. A barricade being lifted. 

           CREAK -- the front door inches open. Each inch shining a dim 
           light on...

           Bob Whitaker - the old man from the opening scene - eyes 
           sunken, cheeks bony. Shotgun dangling from his side. 
           His eyes lazily scan the yard. Head drifts side to side. Not 
           making eye contact.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Uncle Bob. 

           Bob doesn’t respond. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Where’s Aunt Jan? 

           Bob looks to the heavens. 

                                 BOB
                        All around us. Part of everything 
                        now. Even the air we breathe. 

           Maggie follows his eyes. We realize he’s not looking to the 
           heavens at all. He’s looking to the SMOKE from the chimney.  

           She reaches out, letting particles from the smoke gather in 
           her palm -- small flakes of HUMAN ASH drifting in the breeze.

           Maggie nearly vomits. But she holds it together. Turning back 
           to Bob. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Give me the gun. 

           Sheriff Holland waves his deputies forward. They fan out in 
           the front yard. Guns raised. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Give me the gun, or they’ll kill 
                        you. 

           For the first time, Bob looks at Maggie. His deep cavernous 
           eyes, locking in on her. BUT - he’s not really there anymore.

           It’s as if he’s dreaming with his eyes open.

           Maggie looks back at this shadow of a man. Gaunt, sickly, yet 
           somehow austere. 

           Then her eyes widen, because -- on the side of Bob’s neck: 

           The grotesque, BLACK RASH covers his skin. Boiling and 
           pulsating, like a leach. 

           Bob’s wrecked voice snaps her out of it. Growling out...

                                 BOB
                        It’ll take us all. 
           Bob whips up his shotgun. Sticks the barrel in his own mouth. 
           And pulls the trigger. 

           BANG! 

           The back of Bob’s head, blood, bones, brains, splatter onto 
           the front door. His body crumples violently to the floor.  

           EXT. WILLIAM’S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - EVENING

           A 3 bedroom modular home. The antithesis of Maggie’s salt of 
           the earth cabin. The type of home you rent from Miller Coal.  

           INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - EVENING

           William sits at the dinner table across from Ellis, who 
           hasn’t touched his food. Instead, he eyes the empty chair 
           Maggie should be filling. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well, may as well go ahead.  

           Ellis nods. He and William eat in quiet. 

           EXT. 348 WARWOMAN ROAD - NIGHT

           We pan across flashing blue lights, various law enforcement, 
           paramedics, etc... 

           Until we find Maggie, blanket around her shoulders, leaning 
           against the edge of the ambulance. 

           Maggie stands. Moves through the front yard toward the house. 
           Bob’s body has been moved. She walks...

           INT. 348 WARWOMAN ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           ...Into the house - where more CSI and Deputies move about. 

           The sight laid out ahead takes her breath away: 

           Walls are covered in writing -- Smeared letters written in 
           CHARCOAL and BLOOD. 

           Over and over again, one word: MARY. 

           It nearly breaks Maggie. Then, a CAMERA FLASH steals her 
           attention to the LIVING ROOM. 
           PUSH IN on the stone fireplace, where AUNT JAN’S CORPSE is 
           propped up at a right angle. 

           The legs stick straight out, while the torso is still inside 
           the chimney. 

           The head, shoulders, and arms are GONE -- completely charred, 
           BURNT to a crisp. Another CAMERA FLASH takes us to -- 

           INT. POLICE STATION - SHERIFF HOLLAND’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           A LIGHTER SPARKING a cigarette. 

           Maggie’s shaken to the core but maintains her usual tough 
           exterior. She looks at her phone: 5 missed calls from Ellis. 

           Ricky enters holding coffee. Hands one to her. He stands in 
           heavy silence. No words come. 

           Sheriff Holland enters. Gives Ricky a look. Ricky gets the 
           message and leaves. 

           Sheriff sits down across from Maggie. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        You shouldn’t of had to witness 
                        that. I’m sorry. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Don’t have time for sorry’s. Got to 
                        get home to my dad, so let’s get 
                        this over with. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND 
                        I sent a deputy to him. He’ll be 
                        okay ‘til you get back. 

           Maggie raises her brows. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Nothin’. I just wouldn’t want to be 
                        in that deputies shoes right now. 

           Sheriff Holland laughs. But it doesn’t last long -- the 
           weight of the world always has a way of creeping back in. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        When was the last time you talked 
                        to Bob? 
                                 MAGGIE
                        Seen him around sometimes and wave, 
                        but, can’t remember the last time 
                        we actually spoke.

           Maggie takes a long drag. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Ain’t been close since my mom -- 
                        All the Whitaker property was left 
                        to me and my dad when she died. 
                        Uncle Bob had some debts to pay off 
                        and wanted to sell to Miller Coal, 
                        but my daddy wouldn’t do it. Said 
                        “Mary’d roll over in her grave if 
                        we sold.” Bob didn’t take too 
                        kindly, so that was that.  

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        Ever hear him threaten or show any 
                        kind of violent behavior? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        No. He and Aunt Jan had issues with 
                        my dad but, they were always sweet. 
                        Never thought he’d hurt a fly. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        That’s what bothers me.

           SILENCE. Then: 

                                 MAGGIE
                        What the fuck’s wrong with us? 
                        What’s wrong with my family? I mean 
                        first my mom, then -- 
                             (beat)
                        Now her brother. 

           Maggie looks at the Sheriff. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        You ever consider somethin’ else 
                        might be at play here? 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        What d’you mean? 

           Maggie stares down at her hand -- nail now digging into her 
           palm. The Rash clearly on her mind. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Nothin’. 
           Sheriff Holland leans in. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        I don’t know much. But I like to 
                        think of myself as a good 
                        Christian. And I’ve read the bible 
                        enough to know that darkness can 
                        latch itself onto our world. 
                        Now I never understood it, but I 
                        have to believe that somewhere in 
                        God’s plan, he seems to be okay 
                        with good people gettin’ caught up 
                        in that darkness. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        What if I ain’t good? 

           The Sheriff looks at her like a father would a daughter. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        Seen you with your boy. Nothin’ but 
                        good in that. 

           Maggie suppresses a few tears. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You always been real fair to us, 
                        Earle. Thank you. 

           She takes a sip of coffee and ashes her cigarette.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Be alright if I go down and pay my 
                        respects?  

           He nods. Maggie stands. Sheriff Holland goes to follow, but --  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I know my way. 

           INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

           Fluorescent lights flicker on, revealing a cold, stale room.

           Maggie enters. On a steel table ahead, a body is laid out, 
           covered by a sheet. 

           She moves closer. 

           Closer. 

           Right over him now. 
           She places her hand on the sheet. Takes a breath, and pulls --

           Maggie winces at the horrific site of Bob’s mangled head.  
           But she forces herself to confront it. 

           She reaches out, touches her hand to his chin. Turns his 
           head, so she can see where the BLACK RASH had formed. 

           Except it’s NO LONGER THERE.

           The skin on his neck is no longer oozing and pulsing. 

           Panicked, confused, frustrated, Maggie inspects Bob’s whole 
           body. His arms, legs, back... nothing. No Rash. 

           She thinks on something a moment. Then moves to the cold 
           chambers lining the nearby wall. Slides one open - Empty. 

           Down the line she goes until she finds A BODY.

           She slides it out of the cold chamber and pulls back the 
           sheet -- Johnny Barnes’ stiff dead face looks back at us.  

           Maggie frantically looks at his wrist. Sure enough, the BLACK 
           RASH has disappeared. 

           Confusion and desperation burn in her eyes. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           From ACROSS LAKE BALSAM, the cabin rests alone in the quiet, 
           eerie hills. 

           We PUSH TOWARD THE HOUSE, gliding methodically over the 
           water. As we reach the house, we -- 

           INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - MAGGIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Maggie’s eyes grow heavy as she reads an article on “Coal 
           Mine Air Pollution Symptoms.” Suddenly -- 

           FOOTSTEPS -- slow, methodical, thuds -- outside her door. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Pop? 

           But the tone in her voice tells us she senses something’s 
           off. Scared, Maggie rises. 

           Opens the bedroom door -- The upstairs hallway is empty. BUT, 
           the master bedroom is ajar. Padlock on the floor. Impossible. 
           Maggie moves slowly toward it. Enters. 

           INSIDE THE MASTER BEDROOM

           It’s as untouched as ever, EXCEPT for a small MUSIC BOX, 
           sitting in front of the vanity mirror. 

           An engraving on the top reads: MARY. 

           Maggie moves closer. Rests her fingertips on the box. She 
           opens it to find -- 

           A dusty piece of parchment, folded up. Maggie unfolds it. 

           DARK INK is scribbled messily across the paper. She strains 
           her eyes, and reads aloud.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Calling out for help, the ravenous, 
                        vengeful past never lets us leave. 
                        We are but walking shadows amongst 
                        them. Tools for payment to the 
                        world below. 

           Tears well in Maggie’s eyes as she frantically reads her 
           mother’s haunted writings.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Built with monstrous rock and 
                        stone, the dead water rises while 
                        ash and fire billow in our hell.      

           The rest of the ink is too faded to read. 

           She scans further down, past more demented drivel, until she 
           finds the last line:

                          “The Rash marks the chosen.”

           Maggie’s jaw tightens. Then -- 

           The lamp in the corner begins flickering rapidly until - 

           THUD: A noise from downstairs. Maggie looks up, eyes sharp. 

           KITCHEN

           Maggie enters cautiously. Nothing. Then, a GROAN.

           LIVING ROOM

           Maggie finds Conway sprawled out on the floor. 
           She flicks on the light -- POW! The ceiling light bulb blows, 
           shattering to the ground.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Jesus Christ. 

           Maggie moves to Conway’s side. He’s delirious. 

           She drags him into his bed. Suddenly -- 

           A SCRATCHING NOISE emanates through the room. 

           Maggie snaps to. Alert. 

           ANOTHER SCRATCH. This one longer, louder. 

           And it’s coming from the front door.

           Maggie grabs a SHOTGUN from above the fireplace. Inches 
           toward the front door. 

           SCCRRATTCHH. 

           It’s coming from right outside. Maggie gathers her voice. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Who’s there? 

           No answer. So she flips on the porch light. 

           Readying herself, she swings open the door and raises her 
           shotgun. 

           Nothing in the doorway. 

           Trying with all her might to keep her shaking hands steady, 
           she creeps out onto the front porch.  

           At first, there’s nothing. Then, HEAVY PANTING behind her.

           She whips around to see -- A large, shaggy, BLACK DOG. 

           Maggie startles. But Black Dog remains still as a statue. 
           Blank. Expressionless. Staring, as if it knows something. 

           She steps closer. Black Dog doesn’t move. 

           Maggie lowers the gun. Reaches out to feel its neck. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        No collar. Where’d you come from? 

           MOMENTS LATER 
           She sets out water and some old ground beef.

           INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Maggie climbs the stairs. Stops at the top. Looks to the 
           master bedroom, cracked open invitingly. 

           It’s enticing her. 

           But she storms to the door, and slams it shut, clamping the 
           padlock together once again. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAWN

           Maggie sips coffee. Conway watches news reports on Miller 
           Coal. 

           She grinds her teeth and rubs her temples. Chews nervously on 
           her nails. Dark circles have formed around her eyes. 

                                 MAGGIE
                             (re TV)
                        Will you turn that damn thing off?  

           Conway doesn’t. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I said turn it off. 

           She snatches the remote and clicks off the news. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        That’s all anybody fuckin’ talks 
                        about in this town.  

           Conway clears his clogged throat. Every word a struggle.

                                 CONWAY
                        Look tired. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah, wonder why that could be? 

           Conway looks at her - confused. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I heard you wandering around up 
                        stairs goin’ through Mom’s room 
                        last night. Then I come down and 
                        you’re sprawled out on the floor.
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Can’t rest if I’m worried about you 
                        fallin’ down and killin’ yourself.  

                                 CONWAY
                        Ain’t been... in that room... since 
                        the day... she died. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Then why was the light on a few 
                        days back? Why was the door open? 
                        Why’s her music box laid out?  

           Conway shrugs. Coughs. 

           Maggie looks into his big hound dog eyes. If it was him, he 
           truly doesn’t remember it.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Before Mom died, you remember her 
                        havin’ a black marking? Looked 
                        kinda like a rash, or a burn.

           Conway thinks a moment. Shakes his head. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        You sure?

           Conway nods. Maggie takes a breath as Conway eyes her with 
           deep concern.  

                                 CONWAY
                        Why? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Guess I just want to know what was 
                        on her mind before the end. What 
                        she went through. What lead to it. 

           LONG SILENCE. Then, with a grave expression:  

                                 CONWAY
                        No. You don’t. 

           EXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY

           SUN RISES. Maggie exits. Black Dog is still there, waiting. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Why’d you come to me huh? 

           A distant BLAST on top of Black Mountain steals both their 
           attentions. She pats Black Dog on the head. 
                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Better get used to that if you’re 
                        stickin’ around. 

           Suddenly, the SOUND of a CAR ENGINE. 

           Maggie looks to see -- An SUV pulling down the driveway. She 
           grits her teeth. Walks inside the house.  

           3 MEN in suits step out of the SUV -- executives from Miller 
           Coal. Clean cut and business like. Black Dog approaches them.  

                                 EXECUTIVE #1 
                        Hey there pooch. 

           The large dog GROWLS and bares his teeth.  

                                 EXECUTIVE #1 (CONT'D)
                        Mrs. Dawson? Mr. Dawson? 

           Maggie exits with her SHOTGUN.  

                                 EXECUTIVE #1 (CONT'D)
                        Not looking for trouble.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        No. You’re just bringin’ it.  

                                 EXECUTIVE #1
                        We’re with Miller Coal. We’d like -  

                                 MAGGIE
                        I know who you’re with.  

                                 EXECUTIVE #1
                        Alright. Well, we want a minute of 
                        your time. 

           Maggie walks down into the yard. Stands next to Black Dog. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Go on then. 

           EXECUTIVE #1 nods to EXECUTIVE #3 who pulls out a form and 
           hands it to Maggie, keeping a close eye on Black Dog. 

                                 EXECUTIVE #1
                        This is an offer.  

           Maggie looks at the paper. The moment has come at last. 
                                 EXECUTIVE #1 (CONT'D)
                        I’m sure you’ve heard the company’s 
                        planning expansion after our Black 
                        Mountain operation ends next week. 
                        We’re looking for new land. This 
                        generous offer -

           Executive #1’s voice trails off as Maggie looks around the 
           property. Her home. Her family’s land. She turns. 

           Through the screen door -- Conway sits bedridden, hooked to 
           oxygen. The Mine put him there, now they want his land.

           She looks past the Executives, at the billowing smoke on 
           Black Mountain. A thought hits her. 

                                 MAGGIE
                             (sotto)
                        Ash and fire. 

                                 EXECUTIVE #1
                        Excuse me? 

           Maggie glares at him.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m sure you’ve pulled this routine 
                        on other folks ‘round here. But I 
                        ain’t them. We’ve lived under the 
                        shadow of Miller Coal and your 
                        fuckin’ Dam for generations, and I 
                        don’t figure one more’ll do much 
                        harm. Shit, I got more coal dust on 
                        the side of this house than paint.

           Maggie moves closer, toe to toe with him now.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        We ain’t leavin’. Ever. 

           She spits in his face. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                             (nodding to her shotgun)
                        Now I know I ain’t in my rights to 
                        use this on you. But you best get 
                        the hell off my property before I 
                        do anyways. 

           Executive #1 wipes the spit from his face. Stares menacingly 
           at back. Finally, he nods to his partners. 

           Maggie watches them get back in the SUV and leave. With Black 
           Dog by her side, her gaze falls back onto -- 
           BLACK MOUNTAIN. Its wounded peak billowing ash and smoke.  

           Then to -- the HYDROELECTRIC DAM and LAKE BALSAM.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                             (sotto)
                        Monstrous rock and stone.

           As Mary’s words emerge from Maggie’s mouth, we...

           INT. DAWSON PROPERTY - MAGGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Pitch black. Save for a sliver of pale moonlight. 

           Maggie sleeps. 

           QUICK FLASH - Master Bedroom door. Light squeezing around its 
           frame. The voice again...WAKE UP...TAKE MARY. 

           BACK TO - Maggie’s eyes pop open. Her body seems paralyzed. 
           Barely able to breathe. 

           CREEEEAAAAKKKKK -- long, drawn out, deliberate. 

           She looks up to see the bedroom door clicking shut ever so 
           gently. BY. ITSELF. 

           Then, at a closer look, something in the shadowy corner of 
           the room makes Maggie FREEZE. 

           Standing motionless in the darkness, caught ever so slightly 
           in the dim moonlight, is a FIGURE -- Its outline so faint it 
           could just be our eyes playing tricks on us. 

           Maggie reaches a trembling hand to the bedside table and 
           clicks on the lamp. 

           As the light comes on, the Figure instantly disappears. Like 
           it was never there. 

           Paralyzed with fear, Maggie sits motionless. Then she stands. 
           Walks to the bedroom door. Opens it. 

           INT. WILLIAM’S HOUSE - ELLIS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ellis’ face. Tossing and turning. Wind howls outside. 
           Suddenly, soft whispers. Nearly inaudible, as if apart of the 
           wind. But just enough to get his attention.  
           He rises. Slowly scans the room’s dark corners. Waiting for 
           the source of the whispers to show itself. But -- Nothing.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           At the end of the hall, the master bedroom door. Shut. No 
           lights. No movement anywhere in the house. 

           Maggie makes the long walk across the hallway, to the master 
           bedroom door, and enters.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           OVER SHOTS OF THE VAST APPALACHIAN LANDSCAPE...

                                 CHOIR GIRL (V.O.)
                             (singing)
                        Oh, bury me beneath the willow 
                        Yes, under the weeping willow tree.

           The lament rings out over the land. 

           EXT. COUNTRY CHURCH - CHAPEL - ESTABLISHING 

           Set on the shores of Lake Balsam, it’s the kind of mountain 
           church outsiders only see in books and old photographs.  

           INT. COUNTRY CHURCH - CHAPEL - DAY

           Two closed coffins - Jan and Bob’s - rest before the altar, 
           where a young CHOIR GIRL sings the sad lament. 

                                 CHOIR GIRL
                        So he may know where I am sleeping
                        And perhaps he’ll weep for me. 

           Her voice chills the bone as we pan over townspeople, packed 
           into wooden pews - despair etched into their withered faces. 

           Maggie, Conway (strapped to an oxygen tank), Ellis, and 
           William stand in the front row. 

           Maggie glances to Ellis, who looks ominously at the coffins. 

           Off Ellis, she sees LENNY a few rows back - we recognize him 
           as the man in the wet suit by Lake Balsam. 

           Feeling her eyes, he gives a slight wave. William notices. 
                                 CHOIR GIRL (CONT'D)
                        Oh, bury me beneath the willow, 
                        under the weeping willow tree. 

           The last words ring out like a sad lullaby. 

           MOMENTS LATER: 

           The last of the Mourners shuffle past the coffins, paying 
           respects, saying goodbyes. Gospel tunes play as Maggie, 
           Conway, William, and Ellis (who doesn’t look) get their turn. 

           Maggie stops. Fingers a piece of paper in her hand. The 
           writings from Mary. 

           She stands still, as if waiting for some kind of sign... When 
           it doesn’t come, she follows the rest of the Mourners out.

           INT. PANCAKE HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY

           William, Ellis, and Maggie, still dressed in funeral attire, 
           eat in awkward SILENCE - they’ve forgotten how to be a 
           family. Maggie breaks it. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Sorry Grandpa couldn’t make it. He 
                        was tired after the funeral. 

                                 ELLIS
                        That’s okay. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I meant to show you this earlier. 

           She pulls out her phone. Shows Ellis a picture of Black Dog.   

                                 ELLIS
                        He’s yours? That’s awesome! 

           Maggie smiles. Reveling in Ellis’ happiness. But her smile 
           doesn’t last long, because -- 

                                 EXECUTIVE #1 (O.S.)
                        William. 

           She turns to see Executive #1, approaching the table. William 
           stands and shakes his hand. 

                                 EXECUTIVE #1 (CONT'D)
                        So this is your family?

                                 WILLIAM
                        My son Ellis. 
           Ellis nods a hello. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        And this is Maggie. 

                                 EXECUTIVE #1
                        Yes, we’ve had the pleasure. 

           Executive #1 holds out a hand. Shakes with Maggie. A BEAT, 
           then he turns to William, lowering his voice.  

                                 EXECUTIVE #1 (CONT'D)
                        We saw your inventory report and 
                        had a few concerns. I’d like to 
                        talk in the morning. First thing. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yes sir. 

                                 EXECUTIVE #1
                        Pleased to meet you Ellis. Mrs. 
                        Dawson. 

           Executive #1 leaves. William sits back down. Under the table, 
           we see Maggie’s thumbnail release from her bloody palm. 

           EXT. PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY

           They exit into the windy parking lot. Ellis points across the 
           street to - LENNY’S PAWN SHOP.

                                 ELLIS
                        Hey can we go in there? That guy’s 
                        got cool stuff. 

           Maggie and William look at each other. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Y’all go ahead. I’ll wait.  

           INT. LENNY’S PAWN SHOP - DAY

           Maggie and Ellis walk through the shop - filled with old 
           trinkets. Impossible to tell value from junk. 

           But Ellis finds a cool looking relic pocket knife. He turns 
           it over in his hands, admiringly.  

                                 LENNY (O.S.)
                        Got that off a traveler down in 
                        White Oak. 
           Lenny -- now changed from funeral attire, sports long hair, 
           colorful tattoos, and a grimy white T. 

           He’s country, true local, but somewhere along the way became 
           a hippie. This is what folks around here call a “River Rat.” 

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        Said it’d been passed down through 
                        his family for generations. Datin’ 
                        all the way back to the Civil War. 
                        See here...

           Lenny steps forward. Points out an engraving on the wooden 
           handle: A&P. 

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        Told me them letters were his great 
                        grandparent’s initials. That they 
                        was long lost lovers.  

                                 ELLIS
                        How much is it?

           Lenny looks to Maggie. Back to Ellis. 

                                 LENNY
                        On the house bud. 

                                 ELLIS
                             (beaming)
                        Really? Thank you. 

           Ellis leaves to look around at more stuff. Never taking his 
           eyes off the pocket knife for too long. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You didn’t have to do that. 

                                 LENNY
                        Ah it ain’t worth much anyways. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Sure sounds like it is. 

                                 LENNY
                        I found the old thing on the side 
                        of the road. Made that story up.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What for?

                                 LENNY
                        Habit I reckon. Always got to be a 
                        salesman in the pawn shop industry. 
                                 MAGGIE
                        But you gave it away for free. 

                                 LENNY
                        What can I say, I like stories. 

           Their friendliness slowly dissipates. 

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        Sorry about your Uncle. That was a 
                        nice service. 

           Lenny steps closer. Any goofy charm he had is now gone. He 
           looks at her like he knows her deepest secrets. 

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        Listen, I uh - We never really got 
                        a chance to talk after your - 

           He doesn’t know what to say... Ellis comes back. Relieving 
           Maggie and Lenny from each other. 

                                 ELLIS
                        Where d’you get all this stuff? 

           Lenny leans down. Eye level with Ellis. Putting on his story 
           mode voice again.

                                 LENNY
                        This town’s full of secrets boy. 
                        All kinds of items. Relics of the 
                        past. You just got to know where to 
                        look.

           OFF MAGGIE -- thinking about this statement from Lenny. 

           EXT. PANCAKE HOUSE - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Maggie shuts William’s truck door. Leans into the passenger 
           seat and kisses Ellis on the forehead. 

           Ellis twirls the new pocket knife in his hands excitedly. 
           William stands a few feet back. Maggie goes to him. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        I was thinking about our 
                        conversation the other day. Does 
                        Saturday work for you? 

           Maggie’s confused. William talks quietly so Ellis can’t hear. 
                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        I know you got your therapy that 
                        day, but if you want to -- Ellis 
                        has been actin’ a little off 
                        lately... he needs you Maggie. 

           Tears well in Maggie’s eyes. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Saturday. Yeah. That’s good.  

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’ll bring him by around lunch. 

           William smiles. Gets in his truck and leaves. 
           For the first time, we see pure joy cross Maggie’s face.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

           SIRENS BLARE as Maggie’s ambulance flies down curving roads 
           until it reaches -- 

           EXT. TRAILER - DAY

           Double-Wide trailer on Lake Balsam’s edge, OVERTAKEN BY FIRE. 

           Firefighters are on the scene, spraying water, trying 
           desperately to save the home. 

           Maggie and Ricky exit the ambulance and rush forward, where 
           TWO FIREFIGHTERS pull a girl, LYDIA (16), from the flames. 

           Maggie and Ricky strap Lydia to a gurney.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Is there anyone else?

                                 FIREFIGHTER
                        Two kids in back. Goin’ in now. 

           The two firefighters RUN back into the burning trailer. 

                                 MAGGIE
                             (to Ricky, re: Lydia)
                        Get her in the truck and stabilize 
                        her. We gotta wait -  

           WHOOSH! 

           The trailer ERRUPTS IN FLAMES. The power and heat sending 
           Maggie and Ricky crashing to the ground. 
           Lydia tumbles off of the gurney, next to Maggie. 

           Dazed, Maggie rises to see other firefighters in a war with 
           the flames.

           Screaming for their comrades -- now burning alive inside, 
           along with the two children. No saving them now.    

           Regaining her focus, she crawls to Lydia and turns her over.

           To Maggie’s horror, she sees the BLACK RASH -- grotesque and 
           spotted across Lydia’s arm.

           EXT. MILLER COAL MINE - DAY

           A school bus pulls up. Ellis exits. Walks around the crowd of 
           protesters to the SECURITY SHACK. 

           MOMENTS LATER: 

           Employee Entrance Gate opens. Ellis enters. Crosses the 
           mining site, toward William’s work lot. BUT -- 

           A soul-stirring whisper draws his attention. 

           Ellis turns to the sound. His gaze falls on the mouth of an 
           old mine entrance. The same one Maggie saw earlier. 

           The WHISPERS, inarticulate and otherworldly, seem to come 
           from the bowels of the mine, filling his bones with dread.

           But he can’t help himself. He walks forward. 

           EXT. MILLER COAL MINE - DAY

           William overlooks a blasting operation. Something catches his 
           eye down a nearby hill. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        What the hell? 

           It’s ELLIS, moving toward the old mine, as if in a trance.  

           EXT. MILLER COAL MINE - DAY

           Ellis steps into the dark mining tunnel. 

           INSIDE MINE SHAFT -- Entranced, he moves further forward.  
           EXT. MILLER COAL MINE - RIDGE - DAY

           On a nearby ridge, MINERS set explosives. Ready to blast.  

           INT. MINE SHAFT - DAY

           Ellis walks the cavernous tunnel. Sunlight disappearing 
           behind him. The whispers suddenly STOP. 

           And he’s now accompanied only by silence and darkness.

                                 ELLIS
                        Hello?

           BOOOM! 

           The walls shake. Coal Dust and debris cover the young boy. 
           Clouding around him like a thick wool blanket.  

           He COUGHS violently. Like he inhaled something poisonous.

           Suddenly, the WHISPERS kick in again. Surrounding him. As if 
           a part of the dust clouds. 

           Ellis rubs his eyes, trying to breathe. Delirious, about to 
           pass out when -- A SILOUHETTED FIGURE emerges behind him. 

           The Figure’s hand reaches out, pushing through the smoke...

           EXT. MILLER COAL MINE - DAY

           William drags Ellis out the shaft. Towering over his son, 
           holding anger only a frightened parent can possess. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        What the hell were you thinking?

           Ellis, covered in coal dust and wheezing, looks down.

                                 ELLIS
                        I’m sorry. I thought I - 

           Ellis can’t bring himself to say it. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        You thought what? 

                                 ELLIS
                        I thought I heard someone. Voices.

           William’s at a loss for words. Slowly, his anger dissipates.
           He kneels down next to Ellis, and slaps a strong hand on his 
           son’s shoulder. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’m just glad you’re okay. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Maggie, skin caked in ash from the trailer fire, stands 
           outside Lydia’s room. 

           She turns to see Sheriff Holland.

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        Never far from tragedy are you? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Part of the job.

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        Tell me about it. 

           He looks into Lydia’s room, where the young girl lays 
           strapped to the bed, in a deep coma, tubes and Iv’s running 
           through her body. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Family know yet?

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        Told the parents an hour ago. Had 
                        to stop ’em on their way home. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Jesus. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        Losin’ three kids in one night.  
                        Can’t imagine.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Two. Lydia’s still alive. 

           Something comes over Sheriff Holland. And Maggie notices. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        We found what was left of the kids. 
                        Fire wasn’t no accident. 
                             (beat)
                        Looks like they was tied up. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND (CONT'D)
                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND (CONT'D)
                        Gasoline marks were everywhere. We 
                        think Lydia done it herself. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Why would she do that?

           The Sheriff shrugs. Exasperated. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        Found some text messages and talked 
                        to her friends. Apparently her 
                        parents just sold the property to 
                        Miller Coal. They’re supposed to be 
                        out end of the month. Reckon she 
                        was mad about it. 
                             (beat)
                        Still hard to believe that’d drive 
                        her to do somethin’ like this. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Don’t you think it’s strange how 
                        often you had to say that lately. 

           He looks at her skeptically. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                             (under her breath)
                        Can’t be natural. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        What’re you gettin’ at?

           Maggie looks at him. Can’t bring herself to tell the truth. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND (CONT'D)
                        Go get some rest. You been through 
                        enough for one day. 

           Sheriff Holland watches with concern as Maggie leaves. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - DAY

           Maggie straightens up the house. Sweeps, wipes down the 
           counters, cleans up around Conway’s area. 

           She stops in front of a hallway mirror and fixes her hair. 

           Desperate to make a good impression. 

           BATHROOM 

           Maggie washes down her two pills. Eyes herself in the mirror. 
           Throws a third pill down her throat. 
           EXT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - FRONT PORCH - DAY

           Maggie sits with Black Dog, anxiously tapping her foot. 

           In the distance, William’s truck pulls down the driveway. 
           Maggie walks into the front yard to greet them.

           Ellis and William climb out the truck. 

           Maggie and Ellis hug. 

           Black Dog approaches cautiously. Sniffs Ellis’ hand. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        He likes you. Don’t seem to like 
                        most people. 

           William reaches a hand out, but Black Dog SNAPS. 

                                 WILLIAM
                             (pulling hand away)
                        Shit. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Told you. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yeah I see that. 

           Ellis walks off with the dog. William scans the property.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        Place looks good. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Your boys from Miller think so too. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Tried warning them getting you to 
                        sell was about as likely as the 
                        mine itself shutting down. 

           They share a rare smile together. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        Listen, I didn’t want to tell you 
                        this the other day, but I talked to 
                        the court. They said this can be a 
                        trial, long as I’m comfortable. 

           Maggie’s taken aback. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        So now this is some kind of test?
                                 WILLIAM
                        I didn’t say that. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You said he needed me. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        He does. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You think I don’t know how you see 
                        me? How this whole town sees me? 
                             (beat)
                        I know everybody thinks I’m crazy 
                        after what I done. What my mother 
                        done.  

                                 WILLIAM
                        That’s not true. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes it is. I made peace with it. 
                        But it’s hard enough for me to 
                        swallow my pride, without you 
                        judgin’ me too. You’re the one 
                        person I thought never would.    

                                 WILLIAM
                        This hasn’t been easy for me 
                        either. Just doing the best I can. 

           SILENCE.  

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        I’ll leave y’all to it then. 

           INT. MAGGIE’S PROPERTY - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

           Ellis exits out the bathroom. Looks to the master bedroom at 
           the end of the long hallway. The padlocked door enticing him 
           just as it did Maggie. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - KITCHEN - DAY

           Maggie, Ellis, and Conway eat lunch. Suddenly, Ellis coughs. 
           Hard and Brutal. She pats him on the back. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        How long’s that been goin’ on? 

                                 ELLIS
                        Few days. 
                                 MAGGIE
                        Sounds like bronchitis. 

                                 ELLIS
                        I’m okay. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Well keep an eye on it. Gets worse 
                        make sure your dad takes you in. 

           Ellis nods. His eyes scan the place. Land on Conway. Then on 
           a nearby photo of Conway and Mary’s wedding. 

                                 ELLIS
                        How’d Grandma die?

           Maggie looks up sharply, not sure how to respond.

                                 ELLIS (CONT'D)
                        Nobody’ll ever tell me. 

           Conway eyes his Grandson. Clears his throat. 

                                 CONWAY
                             (matter of fact)
                        Kilt herself. 

           BEAT as Ellis takes this in. It’s like he already knew. 

                                 CONWAY (CONT'D)
                        Took a boat out on the lake, slit 
                        her wrists, and dove in. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Dad -

                                 CONWAY
                        It’s truth. 

           Ellis looks hard at Conway. 

                                 ELLIS
                        Is that what’ll happen to me?

           Maggie’s eyes dart sharply to Ellis, filling with concern. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Of course not. Why the hell would 
                        you even think that?  

                                 ELLIS
                        Grandma did it. 
                             (to Maggie)
                        You did it. 
           Maggie’s speechless. Under the table, her finger nail digs 
           hard into her palm. 

           After a moment, she slides her chair back, stands up, and 
           walks outside.  

           EXT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - DUSK

           Maggie walks by Lake Balsam -- the edge of her property line. 

           Black Dog follows close by. 

           She watches as EXPLOSIONS ring out from Black Mountain - its 
           ash clouds billowing down over the Hydroelectric Dam. 

           Ellis approaches. She doesn’t look, but knows he’s there. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Even blastin’ on a Saturday.
                        You believe that? Guess the quicker 
                        they finish Black Mountain, the 
                        sooner they can move on to the 
                        next. 

           She walks a few more paces. Ellis follows in SILENCE. Then 
           gathers his courage. 

                                 ELLIS
                        Sorry about what I said.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You got the right to ask questions. 

           She takes a breath.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Sometimes it’s just hard for your 
                        dad and I to know exactly what to 
                        tell you and what to keep from you.

           They walk a few more steps. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        What’s got you so interested in 
                        Grandma anyway? 

           Ellis doesn’t answer. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Ellis. 

                                 ELLIS
                        I think she visits me. 
           Maggie stops walking. 

           Looks down at her son while her nail digs deeper than ever 
           into her palm.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        What d’you mean? 

                                 ELLIS
                        Well, I know I never knew her, but 
                        sometimes I think she talks to me 
                        in my dreams. 

           Ellis coughs again. Maggie remains stoic, unsure what to say.

           Then, she releases her nail. Kneels down next to Ellis. And 
           the truth pours out: 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I was about your age when she did 
                        it. It was the hardest thing I ever 
                        had to deal with. Still am... 
                        I’m sorry I put you through it too. 

           Tears well in Maggie’s eyes. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I ain’t the best at giving advice, 
                        but if I had to give you some. I’d 
                        tell you not to do what I did. 
                        Don’t drown in the bad. Don’t try 
                        to control things you can’t... The 
                        best thing you can do, is be a kid. 

           Maggie smiles reassuringly.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Don’t try to solve my problems. Or 
                        your Dad’s. Just be 12. 
                             (beat)
                        Do that, and I promise, I won’t let 
                        nothin’ bad happen to you. 

           Ellis smiles. Finding some small comfort. 

           LATER -- Ellis skips stones across the lake. Maggie watches. 
           Black Dog sitting by her. 

           Ellis sees something across the lake... A familiar glow on 
           the surface -- 

           A small, HOVERING ORB of light. The same we saw in the 
           opening scene with Bob. 
                                 ELLIS
                        You see that? 

           He points to the orb. A few more have eerily formed around 
           it. Maggie looks up. Walks next to Ellis.

                                 MAGGIE
                        They’re called Wanderlights. 

           Ellis looks up. Surprised she knows. But intrigued. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        In old folktales, they represent 
                        the souls of ghosts, of spirits. In 
                        some stories they’re just there. In 
                        others, they wait. They entice. And 
                        they lure travelers to ‘em. But 
                        they never satisfy.   

                                 ELLIS
                        Why not?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Well, the people that follow go 
                        mad, ‘cause no matter how long they 
                        search, or how far they follow, 
                        they can’t ever reach the light.  

                                 ELLIS
                        You ever try? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        When I was little I used to take 
                        Grandpa’s boat out and try to catch 
                        them in mason jars. But every time 
                        I got close, they’d slip away.  

                                 ELLIS
                        I didn’t know Grandpa had a boat. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - BARN - SUNSET

           Maggie drags open the barn door. 

           Old furniture and rusted farm equipment are stacked in the 
           corners. Cobwebs stretch across the wooden beams above. 

           In the back of the barn, Maggie approaches a large object, 
           covered by a dirty old tarp.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        Give me a hand. 
           Together, Ellis and Maggie pull the tarp to reveal a rusted 
           out old MOTORBOAT, caked in dirt and grime. 

                                 ELLIS
                        Cool. 

           Maggie steps back. Admiring the boat she played on as a kid. 

           Ellis moves closer. Starts wiping away some dirt and grime. 

                                 ELLIS (CONT'D)
                        There’s writing. Look. 

           Maggie kneels down by Ellis, who reaches out, and wipes away 
           a layer of mud, revealing the boat’s name --  MARY. 

           Maggie’s eyes flare. How did she never think of this before?

                                 MAGGIE
                             (sotto)
                        Take Mary.

           Black Dog barks. Maggie looks at him sharply. The dog locks 
           eyes with her. Barks again. 

           Maggie stares back at the name. 

           WE PUSH IN SLOWLY.

           INT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - MAGGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Maggie lies awake, restless in bed. Mind somewhere else. 

           QUICK FLASH - The bubbling BLACK RASH on Lydia’s forearm.  

           BACK TO - Maggie in bed. She swings the sheets off and rises. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Maggie checks on Conway, who sleeps. Sweat pours from his 
           head. She leans over to hear his breathing. 

           His wheezing is terrible. Each breath more of a gurgle. She 
           swipes her car keys from the table and exits. 

           EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Maggie waits in her car, gnawing nervously on her 
           fingernails. She reaches in her shirt pocket for a cigarette, 
           but her carton is empty. 
           Maggie opens her glove compartment. 

           Digs around for another cigarette. But instead, she finds a 
           pointed METAL OBJECT -- a device to pick locks.  

           Maggie holds it. Seemingly shocked to have it. 

           But she shakes off the odd feeling, closes the glove 
           compartment and exits. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Maggie opens the side entrance. Walks down the long dark 
           hallway. Stops in front of -- 

           LYDIA’S ROOM

           MAGGIE’S POV: Lydia on the bed, still in a coma. 

           She goes to open the door but stops herself. She turns and 
           walks back down the hallway, toward the...

           SUPPLY ROOM - Where Maggie finds the door is padlocked shut. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Shit. 

           As Maggie wrestles with the lock, CAMERA SLOWLY PANS around 
           her shoulder, revealing -- 

           A FIGURE, standing in the HALLWAY. Watching Maggie. 

           The silhouetted figure stands remarkably still, a hospital 
           gown dangling from its body. It’s LYDIA. 

           An idea hits Maggie. She turns toward the side exit. 

           Doesn’t see Lydia in the hallway behind.  

           EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Maggie reaches her truck. Dives back into her glove 
           compartment, and pulls out the lock pick. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - SUPPLY ROOM - NIGHT

           The sound of a lock being jimmied. After a moment, the door 
           clicks open, and Maggie steps inside. She swipes her usual 
           share of Morphine for Conway. 

           HALLWAY -- Maggie, Morphine in hand, reaches the exit door. 
           But she stops.

           This time, the background hallway is empty. There’s no Lydia. 
           But something’s still on Maggie’s mind. She looks back down 
           the hallway. 

           Starts walking toward Lydia’s room. 

           Closer... 

                   Closer... 

                         Closer... 

           LYDIA’S ROOM: 

           Maggie creaks open the door. Looks up to see -- 

           Lydia, lying in the hospital bed. No sign of movement. 

           She moves closer to the girl. Eyes on her wrist. 

           Maggie reaches out and touches Lydia’s arm. Turns it over. 
           Sure enough, there’s the rash. 

           PUSH IN SLOWLY until -- Lydia’s eyes pop open. 

           GRIPS TIGHTLY around Maggie’s wrist.

           Maggie startles, tries to pull away, but Lydia is awake now.  
           Heart-rate beeping wildly. Eyes wide and burning. 

           Maggie winces in pain as Lydia grips tighter. The RASH 
           pulsating on her wrist. 

                                 LYDIA
                        It’ll take us all. Can’t stop it.

           Maggie bites through the pain. Lydia’s whole body trembles. 

                                 MAGGIE
                             (re Rash)
                        Where did that come from? 

                                 LYDIA
                        They made me do it.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Who? Who made you? 

           Lydia’s eyes widen -- the same lost gaze Bob had. She looks 
           past Maggie, out the window. Terror fills her as her grip 
           tightens more on Maggie, squeezing. Really. Fucking. Hard. 
                                 LYDIA
                        The dead water... Release them...

           With her eyes nearly bulging from her head, Lydia passes out.

           Maggie rips her hand free -- momentum sending her crashing to 
           the floor. Maggie tries to steady her breath. 

           EXT. HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Maggie leans against her car, trying to clear her head. She 
           pulls her mother’s note from her pocket. Opens it.

                                 MAGGIE
                        The Dead water rises. 

           She lifts her head. Maggie looks down at her wrist -- now 
           covered in deep bruises.

           She glances up to Lydia’s window. Looks back to her wrist. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                             (sotto)
                        It’ll take us all. Release them. 

           Maggie rubs her eyes. What does that mean? 

           She gets in her truck and cranks the ignition. Takes one last 
           glance up to Lydia’s room. This time, she sees -- 

           LYDIA -- Standing stoically in the window -- WATCHING MAGGIE. 

           Maggie shutters. Freezes at the site. For a moment, time 
           stands still. Then - 

           CRASH! Lydia leaps, breaking through the hospital window, and 
           falling with a sickening CRUNCH to the pavement below. 

           Maggie runs toward Lydia -- broken body now sprawled across 
           the concrete, twitching involuntarily.  

           Maggie’s whole body shakes uncontrollably. Then: 

           WHISPERS ALL AROUND HER -- WAKE UP...TAKE MARY. 

           Maggie presses her palms to her ears. Shakes her head as the 
           voices bore into her skull. 

           Sobbing now, crouched over Lydia, Maggie pleads. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        This isn’t real. This can’t be 
                        real. 
           The voices build into an unbearable, inaudible, noise. Until 
           suddenly -- A BANDAGED HAND grabs hold of Maggie’s shoulder.

           She turns, expecting the worst, but --  A wave of relief 
           washes over. The hand belongs to LENNY. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

           Maggie sits across from Sheriff Holland. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        That’s it? You pulled in and that’s 
                        when it happened?  

           Maggie nods. Pulls her sleeve over her wrist, attempting to 
           hide the bruises Lydia gave her. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You said you didn’t know what could 
                        drive her to do what she did. 

           A BEAT as Maggie takes a deep breath. Gathering her courage 
           to say what she’s about to say. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I think somethin’, or someone is 
                        the reason for all this. 

           Sheriff Holland stares. Concerned but intrigued. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I know it sounds crazy Earle, but 
                        I’ve seen markings, the same ones, 
                        like a rash, on three different 
                        bodies. It’s gotta mean somethin’. 
                        Seems like the closer we get to 
                        Miller Coal finishing Black 
                        Mountain, the more bodies keep 
                        piling up.  

           Sheriff Holland eyes her sympathetically. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Don’t look at me like that. There’s 
                        a cancer over this town. It got my 
                        uncle, Johnny Barnes, now it got 
                        Lydia. Not to mention the dozens of 
                        others these last few months. It’s 
                        the reason for all these deaths. 
                        I’m tellin’ you something is - 
                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        What? Something what? Made her 
                        jump? Pulled her out the window? 
                        Jesus Christ you said yourself you 
                        saw her do it. 

           Maggie stays silent. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND (CONT'D)
                        Lydia set that house on fire. She 
                        killed her little brother and 
                        sister, then she woke up and did it 
                        to herself. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You call yourself a man of God, but 
                        when evil strikes you turn to a man 
                        of logic.

           A brief pause, then: 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        I was there after your mother did 
                        what she did. I heard the things 
                        she was sayin’ weeks before. Don’t 
                        go down that road, Maggie. 

           He places a loving hand on Maggie’s shoulder. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND (CONT'D)
                        We make our own fate. Ain’t nothin’ 
                        else controlling us. No one made 
                        your Uncle do what he did. Or your 
                        mother. Or you... The sooner you 
                        get that through your head the 
                        better off you’ll be. 

           HEAVY SILENCE as the Sheriff’s tough love fills the room with 
           tension. Finally, Lenny enters. Followed by an awkward beat.  

                                 LENNY
                        Am I interrupting? 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        You’re fine, Lenny. We’re done. 

           Sheriff Holland stands. Looks down to Maggie sternly, but 
           there’s also worry and love in his eyes. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND (CONT'D)
                        Think about what I said.  

           He nods to Lenny and exits, leaving Lenny and Maggie alone. 
           After a moment...
           EXT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY  - NIGHT

           Lenny’s truck pulls into the driveway. Headlights shine onto 
           the front porch, illuminating Black Dog, who waits stoically. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Want to come in?

           They exit the truck and walk to the front door, where Black 
           Dog growls ferociously at Lenny. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        It’s okay boy. 

           But Black Dog isn’t having it, bearing its teeth. Maggie 
           grabs him by the collar and pushes him away. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Go on now. Get. 

           Black Dog does as he’s told and lumbers out of the way. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Maggie and Lenny enter. Horrible coughing comes from the 
           other room. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Shit. 

           LIVING ROOM -- Maggie moves quickly to Conway’s side.

           Cringing in agony, the old man coughs brutally. It sounds 
           like his throat is being shredded from the inside out. 

           Maggie dabs at his mouth with a handkerchief. After a few 
           moments, the cough subsides. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Didn’t mean to leave you so long. 

           Maggie glances at Lenny, standing in the doorway of the room. 
           Her look tells us she’s unsure of what to do with him here.

           But she makes a decision. She ties Conway’s arm tight. Then 
           takes out the stolen Morphine. 

           Lenny looks on curiously. Glances away as Maggie administers 
           the drug. Conway drifts quietly off into bliss once more. 

           Maggie rises. Looks Lenny square in the eyes.  
                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Don’t tell no one. 

           EXT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

           Maggie and Lenny pass a bottle of Wild Turkey back and forth. 
           She looks distracted. Staring at the barn, where Black Dog 
           lays in the open doorway, keeping a close eye on them.  

                                 LENNY
                        How long you been givin’ him that?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Long as I needed to. Can’t afford 
                        treatments with no insurance so... 

                                 LENNY
                        Can’t believe them assholes would 
                        do that to people. 

           Maggie takes a swig of whiskey. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You heard me talkin’ to the Sheriff 
                        earlier, didn’t you? 

           Lenny nods, embarrassed.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        It’s alright. I thought as much. 

           She passes the bottle to Lenny.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        You think I’m crazy too? 

           Lenny shakes his head. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Liar. 
                             (smiles)
                        Shit you seen me at my worst.

           Maggie looks out at the dark landscape. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Never thanked you, did I? 

                                 LENNY
                        Never needed you to. 

           Lenny gives her the whiskey. She takes another big gulp. 
                                 MAGGIE
                        You know, when I woke up after you 
                        pulled me out of the water, I 
                        wasn’t relieved. If someone stops 
                        you from killin’ yourself, you 
                        should be grateful, but it’s not 
                        really like that. I didn’t come to 
                        with a moment of clarity about how 
                        good it is to be alive. I was just 
                        angry. I wanted to die, and you 
                        took that from me. 

           Lenny doesn’t know what to say.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        But the other day, I was with 
                        Ellis. He was upset and I calmed 
                        him down...I was a good mom... 
                        Right then I realized I am glad to 
                        be alive. I’m glad I’m here to 
                        protect him. You gave me that.  

           Lenny takes the bottle and sets it on the porch. He leans in 
           and kisses her. Maggie recoils a bit. Then kisses him back. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - MAGGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Maggie and Lenny in bed, post-sex. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hand me a cigarette will you. 

           He grabs a pack. Tries to light one, but the bandage on his 
           hand prevents it. 

           She lights it herself and takes a drag. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        What happened to your hand anyways?

                                 LENNY
                        Cut it on a slab of metal while I 
                        was diving in the lake.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        That’s odd. 

           Lenny shrugs. 

                                 LENNY
                        Find all kinds of things for my 
                        shop down there. But don’t tell 
                        nobody. It’s my little secret. 
                                 MAGGIE
                        What’s down there?

           Lenny eyes her playfully. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Come on, you seen all my secrets. 

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Lenny opens up his laptop. Maggie sits next to him. He 
           scrolls through images and videos. All images he’s taken 
           under the lake.  

           Maggie watches, intrigued. Then, her brows furrow. Something 
           seriously captivating her now. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        What is that? 

           The PHOTO is grainy and dark. But through the murky lake 
           water, a long, white, structure can be seen. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Is that a church steeple?

                                 LENNY
                        You ain’t seen nothin’ yet. 

           Maggie looks on in amazement as we flash through images of an 
           underwater Church, a graveyard, foundations of houses, all 
           still standing. Somehow intact. 

           A WHOLE TOWN - washed away and forgotten, yet strangely 
           preserved. Lost in time at the bottom of Lake Balsam.  

           INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - ELLIS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ellis sleeps. A NOISE wakes him. He opens his eyes. Sits up 
           sharply in bed. 

           FEELS the presence of someone else in the room, lurking in 
           the shadows, the walls, the air. 

           He’s rigid, too afraid to look. Too afraid to breathe.

           THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. 

           Footsteps... INSIDE HIS ROOM. Ellis closes his eyes tight. 

           PUSH IN on Ellis as the THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. Comes closer. 
           EXT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY  - NIGHT

           Maggie stands on the dock, looking out at the lake. 

           One by one, WANDERLIGHTS appear over the water. Moving toward 
           her. Maggie doesn’t move. She can’t. 

           Closer now, the orbs disappear underwater. BUT -- 

           Something else takes their place. Maggie squints. 

           Under the cold moonlight, she sees something. A NAKED BODY 
           floating toward the shore. 

           Maggie panics. She reaches into the water and grabs hold of 
           the body. Turns it over. A MAN, covered in the BLACK RASH. 

           She recoils. Looks out to see more naked bodies floating 
           toward her. Pale corpses in the black water. 

           One bumps the dock. It’s JULIE. Tears fill Maggie’s eyes. 

           These are the bodies of townsfolk she has known her entire 
           life. Each carrying the black rash. 

           Maggie, on her knees at the dock, pulls at her hair. She 
           turns another body over. WILLIAM’s dead face looks back up. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        No. 

           She looks up, notices one more body, 20 yards off shore. It’s 
           small, the only child sized corpse. 

           She wades into the water. Moving through the corpses. Their 
           dead hands and feet brushing her as she passes. 

           Finally, she reaches the child’s body. She turns it over to 
           find ELLIS. 

           The grief and horror of the site proves too much to bear. Her 
           worst fear finally come true. Maggie wails into the darkness.

           Her dead son draped limply across her arms. Suddenly - Ellis’ 
           hand GRASPS HER THROAT. He looks at her menacingly. 

                                 ELLIS
                        Release me. 

           The other corpses in the water have now risen, surrounding 
           Maggie. She tries to scream but their hands wrap around her 
           mouth, her face, her eyes. 

           They drag her into the black water. 
           INT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Maggie’s eyes pop open. Paralysis kicking in. 

           Her mouth is open as if she’s screaming, but no noise comes. 
           Slowly, her rigid body loosens and her scream is audible.

           Lenny wakes as Maggie roles off, collapsing to the floor. 

                                 LENNY
                        What the fuck. 

           Maggie rises to her knees. Mumbling. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Dead water. 

           Lenny helps Maggie back onto bed. 

                                 LENNY
                        Are you okay? 

           Shaking, Maggie picks up her phone. Dials William’s number. 

           CUT BETWEEN WILLIAM AND MAGGIE.

           William wakes up to his phone buzzing. He answers tiredly. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Is he okay?

                                 WILLIAM
                        It’s 3’clock in the mornin’. What 
                        the hell is this ab- 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Just check on him Goddamnit.  

           A PAUSE. William lets out an exasperated sigh. 

           IN WILLIAM’S HALLWAY -- William exits the bedroom. Walks down 
           toward Ellis’ room. 

           He creaks open the door -- looks in the dark room to find... 
           Ellis, sleeping. He walks toward his son, whose back is 
           toward us. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Ellis. 

           He puts his hand on Ellis’ back. Checking his breath. 
           Satisfied, William stands and walks back to the door. 
           Unable to believe he got woken up for this, he lifts the 
           phone to his ear. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        He’s fine. 

           ON MAGGIE as she nearly breaks from relief. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        What the fuck’s goin’ on?

           ON MAGGIE as she holds back tears. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Nothing. Just a bad dream. Sorry.  

           Maggie hangs up. William closes the bedroom door. BUT, as he 
           does, we... PUSH IN on Ellis -- awake. Eyes wide in fear. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - MAGGIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Maggie sets the phone down. Shaken to her very core. 

                                 LENNY
                        You alright? 

           BATHROOM -- Maggie washes her face in the sink. As she lifts 
           her hands, she stares petrified at the BLACK RASH. 

           Now on her wrist. It replaced the bruises Lydia gave her. 

           EXT. HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - MORNING

           Lenny pulls into the lot, next to Maggie’s truck. 

           Maggie pulls at her long sleeve shirt, ensuring the rash is 
           covered. She exits the truck. Before closing the door, she 
           turns back. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I want you to take me down there.  

                                 LENNY
                        What for?

                                 MAGGIE
                        All these thing’s can’t just be 
                        coincidence. Suicides, overdoses, 
                        fires, Miller Coal. Our whole 
                        town’s dying.

                        I know it sounds crazy, but this is 
                        all connected to the lake somehow. 
                        I can feel it. 

           INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING

           Ellis showers. Suddenly, he coughs. Again and again. He keels 
           over. Unable to stop. 

           Water splashes onto his back as he coughs up a THICK BLACK 
           SUBSTANCE -- Not blood. 

           It looks like Mud, like black sand, like COAL DUST. 

           Ellis doesn’t believe what he’s seeing as the Coal Dust 
           washes down the drain. He coughs again and DARK RED BLOOD 
           splatters on the white shower wall. 

           INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           William sips coffee. Ellis’ breakfast plate next to him. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Hey bud, breakfast is gettin’ cold. 

           William stands. Refills his coffee. He turns. Immediately the 
           mug slips from his hand, shattering to the ground. 

           REVEAL -- Ellis standing naked, thick blood rolling out of 
           his mouth, down his chin and onto his chest. 

           EXT. LAKE BALSAM - DAY

           Maggie slips in a wet suit. Lenny hooks her to diving gear. 

                                 LENNY
                        Ready?

           Maggie nods. Lenny climbs into his little motorboat. She 
           follows, but stops. Lenny notices. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I haven’t been on the lake since...

           Lenny holds out his hand. Maggie takes it. And climbs aboard. 

                                 LENNY
                        Gotta get out to the middle. 

           He cranks the engine. The boat chugs away from shore. 
           CLOSE ON: Maggie’s cell-phone, still in her truck, ringing 
           over and over from William’s desperate calls. 

           EXT. LAKE BALSAM - DAY

           Out in the middle, the deepest part of the lake. 

           Lenny cuts off the engine. The Boat idles in the water. 

           Behind them, in the near distance, the Hydroelectric Dam 
           looms, with Miller Coal just beyond. 

           Lenny turns to Maggie. 

                                 LENNY
                        Got enough air for two hours, so 
                        just remember to stay calm and 
                        breathe. Get to feelin’  
                        claustrophobic just come straight 
                        back up. I’ll be waitin’. 

           Maggie nods nervously. Lenny clicks on Maggie’s diving mask.

           It’s heavy and dated looking. Like something Lenny would sell 
           in his shop. 

           She sits on the edge of the boat. He gives her a thumbs up. 

           Maggie looks down at the dark water. 

           The same water that’s haunted her dreams. Haunted her life. 
           Her mother’s chosen resting place. 

           At one point this was her own chosen resting place.

           Maggie bites down on her oxygen tube and dives.

           EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

           Crashing into the water, Maggie floats for a moment. 

           Adjusts her eyes. Flicks on the flashlight attached to her 
           mask, which looks coincidentally like a miner’s lamp. 

           Then swims forward.  

           DEEPER NOW - 

           Maggie finally sees it. The UNDERWATER TOWN.

           Eerie, forgotten, strange. A ghost town in the truest sense.
           Maggie moves through the town, guiding herself with the 
           headlamps and the faintest rays of sunlight. 

           Algae and fungi cover the buildings, but other than that, 
           they are bizarrely in tact. 

           Through the windows, Maggie sees overturned furniture, wilted 
           paintings. These were lived in homes.  

           It’s deathly quiet. Isolated. She may as well be on the moon. 

           Maggie passes by lines of tiny old houses, each looking 
           exactly the same.

           This was clearly an old coal mining camp.

           Her eyes dart back and forth. 

           The distinct feeling of being watched setting in. 

           Maggie moves through an underwater GRAVEYARD.

           She shines her headlamp onto tombstones. Moves close to them. 
           The names are gone, faded, washed away. Forgotten forever. 

           Maggie looks up. With Lenny’s boat no longer visible, panic 
           sets in. She’s now acutely aware of how alone she is at the 
           bottom of this mystical water. 

           So much has been lost down here. History, towns, Mary. This 
           was nearly even Maggie’s tomb.

           HOUSE - She pushes her way into one of the house windows.  

           INSIDE - Furniture is still there. A PAINTING hangs above a 
           caved in fireplace. Maggie’s light hovers over it.

           Faded, washed out, but bizarrely still intact enough to see 
           the outline of what looks like a family, dressed in black. 

           But their faces are gone. Washed away just like names on the 
           tombstones. She stares at them intently. They look like the 
           FIGURE from her room. 

           Suddenly -- Maggie’s headlamp blinks. Ever so softly. 
           Similarly to the lightbulb in the Master Bedroom. 

           She reaches up to it, shaking the light, trying to get it to 
           stop. But -- the light goes out...

           DARKNESS SHROWDS HER. -- All we hear is Maggie’s breathing.

           We catch brief glimpses of her moving panicked through the 
           house as her head lamp flashes. 
           Each flash threatening to bring some waiting horror out of 
           the darkness and into the light. 

           Finally... 

           Maggie’s light flickers back on. Her eyes spell relief, until 
           she realizes where she’s standing...

           HOUSE BASEMENT -- WHERE SHE IS SURROUNDED BY -- 

           BODIES --  

           Strangely still somewhat preserved, the half-decayed corpses, 
           bloated and covered in algae, float like suspended 
           ventriloquist dummies. 

           Their eyes are hollow, mouths droop, jaws hang loose. 

           The remains of the family in the picture -- long forgotten in 
           the depths of Lake Balsam. 

           Horrified, Maggie lets out a muted scream -- 

           And the oxygen tube falls from her mouth, causing her to take 
           in water. 

           Panicked and choking, she turns from the corpses to the 
           basement door, but it’s closed. 

           She’s locked in. 

           The corpses seem to float toward her. 

           Drawn to her. 

           Maggie puts the oxygen tube back in her mouth and pushes the 
           door as hard as she can. 

           She struggles with all her might, but to no avail. 

           This is it. This is where she dies. 

           The underwater tomb that’s been waiting for her ever since 
           she escaped it the first time.

           As the CORPSES of the past float closer, their veiny white 
           hands suspended outwards, inches away -- 

           Maggie’s lamp again goes out.

           PITCH BLACK. 

           Just the sound of muffled panic. Pure desperation, until -- 
           In the small pixels of sunlight that made it to the bottom, 
           we find Maggie.

           She somehow felt her way out of the house.  

           Floating in the open, she turns to see -- LIGHTS, turning on 
           in a few of the house windows. Each one closer than the last.  

           Terrified, Maggie kicks off the lake bed.

           And rising to the surface, she looks down to see the lights 
           in the town dimming. 

           EXT. LAKE BALSAM - DAY

           Maggie explodes to the surface. Choking, gagging, exhausted, 
           she breathes in fresh air. 

           Lenny’s boat, idles 20 yards away. 

           She makes inaudible noises. Enough to get his attention. 

           He whips toward her. Drives close and lifts her into the 
           boat. She crumples to the floor. 

           Lenny kneels over. Takes off her mask to find Maggie’s 
           petrified eyes staring back.

           EXT. LAKE BALSAM - DAY

           On the shore, Lenny and Maggie sit. Clearly she’s just told 
           him what happened. 

                                 LENNY
                        You said you lost your oxygen. 
                        Could’ve hallucinated. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        No. They were there. I felt them. 
                        All around me. I saw lights. 

           Lenny can’t believe what he’s hearing.

                                 LENNY
                        Been going down there for years. 
                        Never seen nothin’ but forgotten 
                        houses and rusted old junk. 

           Maggie doesn’t listen. She’s certain this was real. 
                                 MAGGIE
                        It was a family. No different than 
                        mine. Must’ve took shelter in that 
                        basement. Hidin’ from somethin’. 

           Suddenly -- a BLAST from Miller Coal. Behind the 
           Hydroelectric Dam, smoke pours from Black Mountain. 

           And then, a moment of clarity as an idea hits Maggie. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Miller Coal built this dam right?

                                 LENNY
                        Reckon so. 

           Maggie stands. A newfound energy sweeping through her. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        So stupid. I can’t believe I never 
                        thought of it before. 

                                 LENNY
                        Thought of what? 

           Maggie moves to her truck.

                                 LENNY (CONT'D)
                        Maggie. Wait! 

           As Maggie gets in, she accidentally knocks her  cell phone to 
           the ground. But she’s in too big of a hurry to see -- 

           MULTIPLE MISSED CALLS from William. 

           Lenny jumps in the truck just as Maggie peels out. 

           INT. TRUCK - DAY

           Maggie speeds down the road, parallel to Lake Balsam. 

                                 LENNY
                        What’s goin’ on?

                                 MAGGIE
                        What’re dams built for?   

                                 LENNY
                        Dams? 

           Maggie drives faster. 
                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes Dams. They got a purpose right?

                                 LENNY
                        Energy. Electricity. Power - 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Exactly. 

                                 LENNY
                        I ain’t followin’. 

           ON THE ROAD AHEAD - Maggie sees a MILLER COAL BLOCKADE. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Fuck this. 

           VROOM! She whips the truck to the right, skidding down a 
           gravel road only a true local would know. 

           She follows the rocky, bumpy road, barely more than a hiking 
           trail, until they come out at a clearing on the edge of Lake 
           Balsam -- 

           Not far from the base of the Hydroelectric Dam. 

           Maggie stares at the Dam. Finally tells Lenny what’s on her 
           mind.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Miller Coal built that dam to feed 
                        energy into the mine. 

           Lenny shrugs. 

                                 LENNY
                        Yeah, so?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Don’t you see. There must’ve still 
                        been people in that town when they 
                        flooded the valley.

           Lenny’s at a loss for words. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        If you go stand on top of that dam, 
                        you can look down at Miller Coal on 
                        one side, Lake Balsam on the other. 
                        It’s all connected.  

           Lenny sighs. Rubs his eyes. 
           BZZZZ. Maggie’s phone vibrates. She reaches down by her feet, 
           and picks up her phone. 

           William’s calling.

           INT. HOSPITAL - EVENING

           CLOSE ON: Ellis -- in a COMA. His pitiful body motionless. 

                                 DOCTOR (V.O.)
                        I wish I had better news. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - OFFICE - EVENING

           Doctor, at his desk, speaks to William and Maggie. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        His lungs aren’t responding to the 
                        treatment, and his kidney activity 
                        is decreasing rapidly. He’s stable 
                        for now, but we need to be 
                        proactive to find out the cause. 
                        Right now, eliminating problems is 
                        the best path to finding it. 

            William, distraught, aura of shock around him. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        I don’t understand. He was fine 
                        yesterday.  

                                 DOCTOR
                        When did the cough start?  

                                 MAGGIE
                        He had it a few days ago when he 
                        came to my house.  

                                 WILLIAM
                        Started before that. Ever since...

           William eyes Maggie. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        Since he went down in the mine. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        He what?

           Maggie shoots daggers at William -- who looks pale and 
           sheepish. 
                                 WILLIAM
                        It was an accident. He came to see 
                        me at my office and I guess went 
                        wandering around. I told him never 
                        to go down there. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        What happened?

                                 WILLIAM
                        He went in one of the old mine 
                        shafts. They were blasting that 
                        day. 

           Maggie stands. Paces. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Jesus fucking christ. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        I pulled him out. But, he was 
                        coughing a lot. I didn’t think 
                        anything of it at the time. I mean 
                        I’ve breathed in coal dust a 
                        million times in my life and 
                        nothin’ happened to me.   

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah, we all have. Maybe that’s the 
                        fucking problem in this town. 
                             (beat)
                        Why would he go down there? 

                                 WILLIAM
                        He said he thought he heard voices. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Voices? Like what? 

                                 WILLIAM
                        I don’t know, I didn’t ask. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Your son tells you somethin’ like 
                        that and you just let it go. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        He’s a kid. He got curious. 
                             (bitterly)
                        We’re not all blessed with your 
                        imagination, Maggie.  

           Maggie’s jaw tightens. She’s irate, a coiled snake ready to 
           strike. Doctor interjects. 
                                 DOCTOR
                        Alright. Let’s try to calm down. We 
                        don’t know that’s what caused - 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Don’t tell me to be calm until you 
                        fix my son.  

           She exits. Slamming the door behind her.  

           INT. HOSPITAL - ELLIS’ ROOM - NIGHT

           Maggie sits next to Ellis, in prayer pose. She holds his hand 
           and talks to him. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Ellis. If you can hear me, I want 
                        you to know I wasn’t lyin’ when I 
                        said I won’t let nothin’ happen to 
                        you. Okay baby? 

           Tears stream from Maggie’s determined eyes. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I’m gonna fix this. I’m gonna make 
                        it right. 

           EXT. JOHNNY BARNES’ HOUSE - DAY

           Maggie parks at a wrecked house in a holler near Lake Balsam. 

           She exits her truck and climbs the rickety front porch. 

           She knocks. No answer. So she knocks again. 

           A Woman, JOHNNY’S MOTHER, answers. 

           Pock marks pepper her thin and wasted skin -- the face of a 
           meth addict. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        My name’s Maggie Dawson. I live 
                        over off Miller Road. 

                                 JOHNNY’S MOTHER
                        Dawson? Conway Dawson’s girl?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes ma’am. 
                                 JOHNNY’S MOTHER
                        Mamma’s the one went crazy years 
                        back? 

           Maggie holds her tongue. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I was wonderin’ if I could have a 
                        word with you, about your son?  

           This gets the woman’s attention. 

                                 JOHNNY’S MOTHER
                        You knew Johnny?

                                 MAGGIE
                        No. I um - I only spent a few 
                        moments with him. 

           Johnny’s Mother steps aside. Maggie follows her in. 

           INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - DAY

           The whole place is filthy. A hoarders paradise. 

           Another example of the poverty that festers under the shadow 
           of Miller Coal. 

           Johnny’s Mother nods toward a torn up old couch, where a 
           picture of Johnny rests on a nearby table. 

                                 JOHNNY’S MOTHER
                        Take a seat.  

           Maggie does. 

           Johnny’s Mother lights a cigarette. She goes in the kitchen 
           and returns with a plastic cup filled with whiskey.  

                                 JOHNNY’S MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        So, what’d you wanna know about 
                        Johnny? He owe you money? Cause I 
                        ain’t got none to give. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Not here for nothin’ like that.  

           A LONG SILENCE. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Were you with him at all the few 
                        days before he passed?
           Johnny’s Mother stares suspiciously. Like most residents of 
           Appalachia, she’s born skeptical. 

                                 JOHNNY’S MOTHER
                        Yeah. He lived here with me.

                                 MAGGIE
                        He act strange or, unusual?  

           Johnny’s Mother walks to a lazy boy. Sits down. 

                                 JOHNNY’S MOTHER
                        You know, he was fifteen the first 
                        time I saw him use. Didn’t even 
                        stop him. I was just glad he 
                        brought some home for me. 

           Takes a drag from her cigarette. 

                                 JOHNNY’S MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        Guess I ain’t gettin’ no mother of 
                        the year awards huh?  

           Maggie waits for her to continue. 

                                 JOHNNY’S MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        Johnny was cranked out his mind 
                        most the time. But, now you mention 
                        it, yeah a few days before he 
                        passed, there was a kind of clarity 
                        over him I ain’t seen since he was 
                        a kid. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Clarity? 

                                 JOHNNY’S MOTHER
                        He wasn’t using.
                             (beat)
                        See we sold this place to Miller 
                        Coal a few weeks back.

           Maggie perks up at this. 

                                 JOHNNY’S MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        He convinced me to do it. Said it’d 
                        help us start over. Think he 
                        thought that was true. That it 
                        could really happen. That we could 
                        both get clean. 

           Maggie listens intently. 
                                 JOHNNY’S MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        Then, everything changed. All of a 
                        sudden that clarity was gone, and 
                        it was like he couldn’t go another 
                        moment without a fix. 

           She lifts her hair out of her face to show Maggie a large 
           scar on her head. 

                                 JOHNNY’S  MOTHER
                        Last time I saw him he did this. 
                        Few hours later I got the worst 
                        phone call of my life. 
                             (beat)
                        Losin’ a child’s a terrible thing. 

           Maggie tries to maintain composure. Flexing that tough 
           exterior she always carries. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You said you sold to Miller Coal? 

           Johnny’s Mother stands up. 

                                 JOHNNY’S MOTHER
                        Gotta be out in a few days. Reckon 
                        as soon as they’re done with Black 
                        Mountain, they’ll come claim what 
                        they got from me. 

           Johnny’s Mother looks around her house. Drunk, high, dazed, 
           and BITTERLY ANGRY at the world.  

                                 JOHNNY’S MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        Ain’t gonna take a goddamned thing 
                        neither. For all I care the company 
                        can burn this place to the ground, 
                        and all that’s in it. 

           She locks eyes with Maggie.

                                 JOHNNY’S MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        That’s what they do best. 

           Johnny’s Mother turns and starts toward her bedroom.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Wait. 

           Maggie stands. Johnny’s Mother looks back. 

           Maggie rolls up her sleeve, looks down at her wrist, where 
           the black rash pulses. She shows it to Johnny’s Mother. 
                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        You see anything like this on 
                        Johnny? 

           Johnny’s Mother looks at Maggie’s wrist. We don’t see her POV 
           -- does she see the rash too? Or just bruises? 

                                 JOHNNY’S MOTHER
                        What’s that got to do with 
                        anything? 

           Maggie pushes her sleeve back down. 

                                 JOHNNY’S MOTHER (CONT'D)
                        You can see yourself out. 

           Maggie watches as the Johnny’s Mother walks to her bedroom, 
           and closes the door. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY  - NIGHT

           QUICK MONTAGE:

           - Maggie grabs Conway’s stack of newspapers. 

           - Looks through the latest, flipping to the OBITUARY section.      
           She finds the one she’s looking for -- JOHNNY BARNES. 

           - Maggie circles his family’s address. 

           - Opens her laptop to MAPS. Inputs Johnny’s address. Drops 
           pin. 

           - She does the same with Lydia’s home and Uncle Bob’s. 

           - Maggie stares at the computer screen. She’s figured 
           something out.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Maggie paces down the hallway. 

           Turns into Ellis’ room, but stops -- because standing over 
           Ellis is William, and Executive #1.  

           He’s shaking William’s hand. 

                                 EXECUTIVE #1
                        Look forward to you coming back and 
                        finishing up soon, Will. 

           He turns and sees Maggie, in the doorway. 
           She watches in SILENCE a moment. Feeling fury like never 
           before. 

           William looks up. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Maggie. You remember my boss. Came 
                        by to see Ellis. 

                                 MAGGIE
                             (to Executive #1)
                        You got a real habbit of poppin’ up 
                        where you ain’t wanted, don’t you?

           You could cut the tension with a knife. 

                                 EXECUTIVE #1
                        I should get going. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I think that would be best. 

           Maggie steps aside, as Executive #1 exits past. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        What the fuck Maggie?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I don’t want him, or anyone else 
                        from that place, near our son. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Jesus Christ. 

           William sits down in a chair. Exasperated. 

           Maggie closes the door behind her. Giving them privacy. She 
           steps forward. Stands over Ellis, petting his forehead and 
           hair. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I know how to help him. 

           William raises his head. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I went under the lake. There’s a 
                        whole town down there. 

           Maggie continues petting Ellis. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Miller Coal buried it... and the 
                        people who lived there.  
           William looks at her. Doesn’t have an answer. He seems numb, 
           as if nothing she says will surprise him anymore. 

           Maggie knows what she’s about to say is crazy.

           But she gathers her courage and continues anyway.  

           She turns to William. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I think they’re angry. I think 
                        we’re all bein’ punished. 

           Tears fill William’s eyes. A man on the brink.

                                 WILLIAM
                        My son’s dying. And you’re talking 
                        about ghosts? Folktales. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        What if it’s not? What if it’s 
                        real? 
                             (beat)
                        I’ve seen ‘em. I think Ellis has 
                        too. That’s the voices he heard in 
                        the mine. The dreams I’ve been - 

           William’s heard enough. 

           His pity suddenly erupts into anger as he rises to his feet.  

                                 WILLIAM
                        Okay Maggie. Let’s say you’re 
                        right. Let’s say this fucking crazy 
                        story of yours is true. 
                             (beat)
                        Why now? Why after all these years 
                        are your ghosts suddenly deciding 
                        to punish us? 

           Maggie stays surprisingly calm. It all makes sense to her. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Uncle Bob, Layla, and Johnny all 
                        sold their land to Miller Coal. So 
                        I looked into some of the deaths 
                        these last few weeks. They all did 
                        too.
                                 WILLIAM
                        That doesn’t prove nothin’. The 
                        company’s always buying land in the 
                        mountains, and people in the 
                        mountains are always dying. That’s 
                        the way it is. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        And Miller Coal’s not responsible 
                        for any of it?! 

           She steps closer to him. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I think years ago, Miller Coal 
                        wanted the same thing they do now. 
                        They needed people off the land so 
                        they could flood the valley and 
                        build the dam. They’d have an 
                        endless amount of energy for years 
                        to come. 
                             (beat)
                        But those people wouldn’t leave. 
                        They didn’t give in, and now 
                        they’re punishin’ us for not doing 
                        the same.  

           William scoffs, each word more preposterous than the last. 

           Then, a thought. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        You didn’t. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        What?

                                 WILLIAM
                        You didn’t give in. You kicked 
                        Miller Coal off your porch. Spit in 
                        their face. 
                             (beat)
                        So what do these ghosts want with 
                        Ellis? Why’re they punishin’ us? 

           Maggie hadn’t thought of this. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I think they want me to help them. 
                        To do somethin’ for them. Just like 
                        my mother.  

           William sighs. Softening a bit, he comes closer. 
           Tries to contain his emotions as he takes hold of Maggie’s 
           hand. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        I know you can’t help how you act 
                        sometimes. I know it’s hard to see 
                        the truth. 
                             (beat)
                        But Ellis is sick. He’s sick and we 
                        gotta get through that together. 

           He looks her dead in the eyes. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        It’s not ghosts, Maggie. It’s not 
                        the mine, or the lake. He’s just 
                        sick.  

           A pitiful looks sweeps Maggie’s face. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’m not crazy. 

           She pulls away, shifting to determination. Eyes crazed.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I’ve been wrong about everything. I 
                        thought I could help Ellis by 
                        stayin’ away. By shielding him from 
                        the worst parts of me and my 
                        family. But now I see, I can’t stay 
                        away anymore. I can’t be silent. 
                             (beat)
                        We have to stop Miller Coal from 
                        finishing their work. It’s the only 
                        way to save him.  

           William can’t believe what he’s hearing. And it kills him to 
           see her like this. 

                                 WILLIAM
                             (desperate)
                        Goddammit Maggie - 

           He reaches out, but she tugs away again. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Don’t. If you won’t help me, I’ll 
                        find the people who will.  

           INT. COMMUNITY BUILDING - NIGHT

           Dozens of Townsfolk have gathered. 
           Julie stands at a podium, speaking to the crowd. 

                                 JULIE
                        Miller Coal’s taken advantage of 
                        this town and its people for too 
                        long. We can’t stand for it! 

           The Townsfolk cheer. Julie beams. 

           As the crowd noise dissipates, a voice calls out. 

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        What’s the plan? 

           From the Podium, Julie sees Maggie pushing through the crowd. 

                                 JULIE
                        Maggie? I can’t believe you finally 
                        came.   

           Maggie walks closer to the podium, paying no mind to the 
           Townsfolk eyeing her as she passes.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        I want to know what the plan is. 

                                 JULIE
                             (caught off guard)
                        Plan?

                                 MAGGIE
                        For stoppin’ Miller Coal. 

           Maggie turns to the townsfolk. Raises her voice. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Ain’t that why you’re all here?!  

           Julie eyes Maggie. Concern creeping in. 

                                 JULIE
                        We’re building a movement. Get as 
                        many people on board as we can, 
                        then take our demands to the state. 
                        Progress is coming.  

           Maggie looks disappointed. 

                                 MAGGIE
                             (muttering)
                        It’s coming. It’s always coming. 
                             (back to Julie)
                        How soon? 
           All eyes on Maggie now, as every word she utters shows 
           conviction... shows madness. 

                                 JULIE
                        We still have a lot of work to do. 

           Maggie nods. Without a word she turns away, pushing back 
           through the crowd. 

           Julie’s in shock. Calls after. 

                                 JULIE (CONT'D)
                        Maggie. 

           Maggie stops. Julie steps off the podium, down into the 
           crowd. She approaches Maggie. 

                                 JULIE (CONT'D)
                        What’re you doing? 

           Maggie turns to Julie. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You won’t win this way. You can’t. 

           She keeps walking, but Julie paces after her. Grabs her 
           wrist, right on the spot where Maggie’s rash is. 

           Maggie jerks away violently. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Don’t fucking touch me. 

           Julie raises her hands. Voice trembling. 

                                 JULIE
                        Okay. I’m sorry. 

           Maggie’s eyes bore into Julie. Stare daggers at townsfolk.  

                                 MAGGIE
                             (raising her voice with 
                              intensity)
                        You people hear what I’m sayin’?! 
                        You can’t win this way! Protesting 
                        the company ain’t never done 
                        nothin’! It’s always the same.
                        Someone like you...
                             (points to Julie)
                        ...comes along and goes toe to toe 
                        with them. Maybe get’s them to 
                        change for a minute. Maybe gets 
                        workers another dollar or two an 
                        hour.

                                 (MORE)
                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        But what happens when you get 
                        tired? 
                             (to the crowd)
                        What happens when they’ve laid all 
                        you off? Forced you off your land. 
                        Killed you one by one?! 

                                 JULIE
                             (steadfast)
                        Someone else steps up. 

           A maniacal, sarcastic laughs escapes Maggie. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You people are so fucking lost. 
                        Don’t you see? They don’t care 
                        about you or your protests. They 
                        never have. They’re a machine. 
                        They’ll finish Black Mountain and 
                        move on to destroy something else. 
                        Until nothing’s left. 

           Maggie looks right at Julie. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        They’ll wash you away... Wash you 
                        all away. Just like they done to 
                        everyone else.

           Julie looks at the mad-woman in front of her. She steps 
           closer. Concerned, she speaks softly.  

                                 JULIE
                        If you came here just to be cruel 
                        to me -- 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I came because I want Miller Coal 
                        to pay for what they done! I came 
                        to see if you actually had a plan. 
                        If you had anything but words to 
                        throw at them!! 
                             (beat)
                        Looks like I’ll have to figure 
                        something out myself. 

           Maggie storms out of the building, leaving Julie to deal with 
           the stunned crowd.  

           EXT. LAKE BALSAM - NIGHT

           Maggie stands on the edge of the lake, looking out over the 
           water. Illuminated by headlights behind her. 
           Wanderlights float toward her.

           Maggie speaks out loud, to the lake. To the unseen forces 
           she’s convinced are there.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’ll do anything you want. Please 
                        don’t take my son from me.  

           Maggie closes her eyes. Like she’s praying. 

           PUSH IN, then:

           THE VOICE. Icy and Cold. 

           It’s like she stepped inside one of her dreams. 

                                 VOICE
                        Release us. And your son will be 
                        free. 

           Maggie’s face freezes in fear. Her whole body trembles. But 
           she manages a few words. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Tell me how. 

                                 VOICE
                        Wake up... Take Mary...

           Maggie opens her eyes -- which tell us she finally 
           understands. 

           She stares off at something in the distance -- 

           THE HYRDROELECTRIC DAM:

           A monument of death, and proof of Miller Coal’s destruction. 
           A gate keeping lost souls drowned. 

           She leans down, fills her palms with dark water from Lake 
           Balsam. 

           And just as she did earlier in the film... 

           Maggie opens her hands, letting the water run through. 

           CAMERA PANS slowly around, until BLACK DOG is in frame. 
           Watching Maggie. 

           She turns to him. Stares a while. 

           Then walks across her yard toward...
           INT. MAGGIE’S PROPERTY - BARN - CONTINUOUS

           Maggie enters. She walks toward the MARY BOAT in the back. 

           She whips off the tarp. Grabs hold of the motor boat and tugs 
           with all her might. 

           As she slides it, a strange sound... 

           Like rain falling. Maggie moves around the boat, toward the 
           sound. 

           REVERSE to see -- dirt spilling into a CRACK in the floor. 

           Maggie kneels down. Fingers the crack. 

           Follows it around until it turns. And we realize -- 

           This is a trap door. Maggie finds the handle. Opens it. 

           INSIDE - 

           A hole, about 5ft by 5 ft, is dug into the barn floor. And a 
           large CRATE sits inside. 

           She Opens it. Peers in.

           INT. HOSPITAL - ELLIS’ ROOM - DAY

           William sits in the hospital room with Ellis -- still in a 
           deep coma. His phone rings. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Hello?

                                 DR. RILEY
                        Mr. Colter?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yes.

                                 DR. RILEY
                        This is Dr. Eileen Riley. Maggie’s 
                        therapist. 

           William sits up in his chair. 

                                 DR. RILEY (CONT'D)
                        I’m calling because Maggie’s missed 
                        her last two sessions with me and 
                        she won’t return my calls. I’m 
                        concerned. 
                                 WILLIAM
                        Can’t believe she didn’t tell you.

           William rubs his eyes. Clears his throat. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        Our son Ellis is sick. He’s uh - 
                        he’s been in a coma the last week. 

                                 DR. RILEY
                        I see. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yeah. Between this and her Uncle 
                        passing, I’m sure she’s probably 
                        just lost track of things. 

                                 DR. RILEY
                        Mr. Colton, I appreciate how 
                        difficult this time must be for 
                        you, and for Maggie. I really do. 
                        But that’s precisely why someone in 
                        her condition shouldn’t be missing. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Her condition?

                                 DR. RILEY
                        Maggie’s in a highly sensitive 
                        place right now. She’s dealing with 
                        serious trauma. Depression. These 
                        issues can’t go unchecked. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        I understand. 

                                 DR. RILEY
                        I shouldn’t ask this but, are you 
                        aware if she’s taking her 
                        medication?  

                                 WILLIAM
                        No idea. Is there something I 
                        should know? 

                                 DR. RILEY
                        I’m sorry. I - I shouldn’t have 
                        called. I can’t divulge -

                                 WILLIAM
                        Wait. Look, Maggie and I aren’t 
                        together anymore. I don’t know what 
                        she’s told you, and lord knows I’m 
                        not perfect. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        But I would never do anything to 
                        hurt her. Please. Tell me what’s 
                        going on.

           Dr. Riley takes a deep breath. 

                                 DR. RILEY
                        I prescribed Nuplazid to Maggie a 
                        few months ago to combat 
                        hallucinations and paranoia that I 
                        believe she’s manifested out of 
                        grief. Guilt.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Hallucinations? 

                                 DR. RILEY
                        We’re all susceptible to emotional 
                        trauma in different ways. I think 
                        Maggie’s Mother committed suicide 
                        due to hallucinations born out of 
                        her own depression. 
                             (beat)
                        And I think Maggie followed in 
                        these same footsteps. 

           William’s at a loss for words. 

                                 DR. RILEY (CONT'D)
                        Have her call me as soon as 
                        possible. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Thank you. 

           William hangs up. Processing what he just heard, he takes a 
           long hard look at Ellis. 

           EXT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - EVENING

           WIDE SHOT of the barn. Noise from inside. Clattering and 
           clanking. 

           Black Dog comes into frame. 

           We PUSH IN slowly over his shoulder...Maggie exits. 

           Covered in dirt, her hair a wild mess. She locks eyes with 
           Black Dog. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        They sent you? 
           Black Dog just stares. Maggie stares back. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Tell ‘em I’ll do it. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Maggie stands in the hallway outside her bedroom, staring at 
           the Master Bedroom at the other end. 

           She walks downstairs. Slowly. 

           Each of her steps a familiar Thump...Thump...Thump...

           LIVINGROOM 

           She enters to find Conway coughing rapidly. His thin frame 
           shaking and heaving. 

           With a crazed look, far off and distant, nearly catatonic, 
           Maggie walks toward him. 

           In her hand -- we see the stolen morphine. 

           She kneels beside her father. Takes his hand. 

           Conway’s grizzled face and sunken eyes look up as Maggie 
           wipes sweat from his forehead. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s okay Pop. I’m here. 

           He coughs again. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Shhh. 

           Maggie strokes his head lovingly. 

           She stands. Walks over to an old record player in the corner. 

           She pulls out a withered vinyl. “The Carter Family.”

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Remember how much Mom used to love 
                        them?

           Conway nods. Maggie puts on vinyl and drops a groove. 

           Bury Me Beneath the Willow by The Carter Family plays. 

           We’ve heard this before. It’s the song the Choir Girl sang at 
           Bob’s funeral. 
           Maggie listens intently.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        She used to say they were the voice 
                        of our people. The voice of the 
                        mountains. 
                             (beat)
                        But that voice was taken Pop. I’m 
                        gonna give it back. 

           Maggie kneels beside Conway. She wraps his arm tightly until 
           his veins protrude. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Mom tried to warn you about the 
                        lake didn’t she? Tried to tell you. 

           Conway looks at her. Fear growing. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        You just thought she was crazy.  

           Conway nods. 

           A few tears flow down Maggie’s cheeks. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I did too. 

           Maggie pulls the band as tight as she can and injects him 
           with the morphine. 

           But, she doesn’t walk away. 

           She stays, staring into her father’s eyes. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        There’s something I have to do now. 
                        I’ve known it for some time. 

           To Conway’s horror -- Maggie reloads the Morhphine. 

           She grabs Conway’s arm. He struggles to break free, but 
           doesn’t have the strength. 

                                 CONWAY
                        Mag - no - 

                                 MAGGIE
                        After I’m done, I don’t think I’ll 
                        be around to care for you no more. 

           She forcefully injects him with more drugs.
           Conway struggles to stay alert. But quickly drifts. 

           Maggie reaches for a pillow. She kisses him on the head. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        They’ll pay for what they done to 
                        you. What they done to all of us. 

           She rises. Then presses the pillow to his face. She pushes 
           down hard, smothering him. 

           Conway’s muffled noises can barely be heard as Maggie sings 
           along with The Carter Family. 

           His arms fight for few moments. His legs kick weakly. His 
           chest falling up and down. 

           Maggie just presses down harder, until all movement stops. 
           She stands. Looks out the window where - 

           DOZENS OF WANDERLIGHTS FLOAT NEAR THE DOCK.

           The Wanderlights, along with Lake Balsam, the Dam, and the 
           Mine, seem to call out to her. 

           INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

           William drives. He calls Maggie. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Come on pick up. Pick. Up. 

           But it goes straight to voicemail. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        Shit. 

           He dials another number. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - HOUSE - NIGHT

           Wide shots of the quiet, still, empty house, as the phone 
           rings off the hook. 

           INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

           William on the phone. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Maggie pick up. I’m sorry for not 
                        believing you. I’m on my way. 
           EXT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY  - NIGHT

           William’s truck pulls into the yard. 

           He exits, crosses the yard and climbs the front porch steps. 

           He knocks on the door. No answer. 

           William peers in the window. 

           Moonlight shines just enough for him to see Conway’s Bed. 
           It’s Empty. Sheets on the floor. 

           Unsettled by the site, William tries to open the front door.

           Locked. He retrieves a spare key from under the porch. 

           He uses the key to click open the front door. Creaks it open 
           and peers into the dark house. 

           A terrible energy has engulfed the place. Saturated every 
           corner. 

           Faint music can be heard inside. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Maggie?

           His voice echos into the halls of the ancient log cabin. 

           William swallows. Gathering courage, he steps inside. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY  - HOUSE - NIGHT

           William walks through the downstairs section of the house.  

           The Carter Family plays. Echoing throughout the house like a 
           haunted choir. 

           LIVING ROOM

           He stands over Conway’s empty bed. Looks down, and sees 
           something. He picks it up -- The Morphine vile. 

           On high alert now, William rises. 

           BEHIND HIM WE SEE --

           MAGGIE. 

           Or at least the body that used to hold her, lurking in the 
           shadows. Still as a statue. An otherworldly presence about 
           her. Stalking him as Lydia stalked her. 
           But William doesn’t see. He moves through the kitchen and up 
           the stairs. 

           At the top, he looks to Maggie’s room. It’s dark. 

           But to the left -- light flickers from behind the Master 
           Bedroom Door. 

           William walks slowly toward it. Closer...

           Closer... 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Maggie? It’s Will. You in there?

           There’s a quiver in his voice. A hint of fear. 

           Right at the door now, he sees the padlock on the floor. He 
           cups the doorknob. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        I’m comin’ in. 

           William opens the door. 

           Over his shoulder, we see Maggie standing stoically behind 
           him in the hallway. Zombielike. Watching. 

           Reverse to see -- 

           MASTER BEDROOM

           It’s not pristine like we last saw it. In fact it’s like 
           we’re seeing it from a totally different point of view. 

           The view of someone who isn’t Maggie.

           Black writing is scribbled all over the walls just like Bob’s 
           house. 

           Photographs of Layla, Johnny, and Bob’s corpses litter the 
           floor. 

           But to William’s horror, on the bed -- CONWAY lies, arms 
           crossed over his chest. 

           William walks toward him. He reaches Conway. 

           Touches his neck to check for a pulse. Nothing. 

           Tears well in William’s eyes.

           He looks up to the writing on the walls. Looks closer... 
           The words are written over and over: 

                                   Wake up...Take Mary.

           Along with some fragments of Mary’s writing: 

                                The Rash Marks the Chosen. 

           Finally. A NAME is written over and over: 

                                         Ellis. 

           William backs up. 

           He bumps into the armoire in the corner, shattering the 
           mirror. 

           The picture of Young Maggie with Conway and Mary falls from 
           the mirror, onto the floor, along with a stack of papers. 

           William curiously looks through them to find: 

           Drawings of PEOPLE IN BLACK VEILS. Ghostly figures.

           Reminiscent of the damaged paintings Maggie saw at the bottom 
           of Lake Balsam. 

           Then, he sees something else...

           PHOTOS of Miller Coal’s Hydroelectric Dam. 

           Confused, curious, terrified, he wildly flips through the 
           photos -- each one a different angle of the Dam’s foundation. 

           Finally, a thick piece of parchment. He unfolds it and 
           spreads it out. 

           A BLUE PRINT of Miller Coal Mine. 

           There’s a marking running through. Tracing the shafts until 
           we realize -- 

           The Dam is indeed connected to the Mine. 

           Feeding energy into it. William’s eyes widen. 

           Suddenly, something outside catches his gaze: 

           The light in the barn clicking on.

           EXT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - NIGHT

           William exits the house, into the gothically dark night.  
           He takes the long walk toward the barn. Where he now knows 
           nothing good will be waiting.  

           He pushes open the door, and walks in. Behind him -- 

           Maggie comes into the light. 

           A haggard mess. Pitiful to look at, yet still terrifying. A 
           woman totally disconnected from reality.

           An eternity seems to pass before she raises a 2X4. 

           William, finally feeling her behind him, turns. But it’s too 
           late. 

           She SMASHES him over the head and we - 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - BARN - NIGHT

           POV: The ceiling lightbulb, in and out of focus. 

           PULL BACK --  William wakes. Blood trickles down his head and 
           into his eyes. Half blinding him.  

           He goes to stand but can’t, because his hands are tied to a 
           wooden post. 

           William panics. Tugs at the ropes.

           But a deep, resonate GROWL steals his attention. 

           William turns to see BLACK DOG in the doorway. 

           He approaches William. Sniffs him. Then sits. Staring. 

           The sound of an ENGINE alerts William to the barn door where, 
           Maggie’s truck backs in. 

           The truck stops in front of Mary’s Boat, covered by a tarp. 
           Maggie steps out. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Maggie. What are you doing?

           But Maggie doesn’t respond. William may as well not even be 
           there. She rips off the tarp. 

           Mary’s Boat now sits upright. 

           It’s been cleaned, polished, ready for the water. 
           She hooks it to the truck’s towing package, gets back into 
           the truck, and pulls forward.  

           William sees the Trap Door in the floor. What the fuck. 

           Maggie exits the truck. Opens the trap door. Reaches down and 
           rises, holding a heavy bag of some kind. 

           As she tosses it into the truck bed, William sees what it 
           is... 

           ANFO. 

           This is where his missing inventory disappeared to.

           She’s going to use their own explosive devices against them.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        Maggie. It was you? 

                                                                CUT TO:

           QUICK SERIES OF IMAGES:

           - Maggie, dressed in all black, walking silently through 
           Miller Coal at night. 

           - She stops in front of a warehouse. Using her LOCK PICK, she 
           opens the warehouse door.

           - Inside, she finds a crate. Uses the Lock Pick again to bust 
           open the crate, where bags of ANFO are inside.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. MAGGIE’S PROPERTY - BARN - NIGHT

           Maggie lifts another bag of ANFO into the truck bed. And 
           another. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Don’t do this. 

           Maggie finally finishes loading the ANFO. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                             (desperation kicking in)
                        I want to help you. 

           She walks to her truck door. Paying him no mind.  
                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        Ellis does too.

           At this, Maggie stops. Doesn’t look at William. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        Don’t do this to him. He needs you. 

           Maggie turns, eyes filled with sadness, anger, insanity.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        This is the only way to save him. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        No it’s not! Maggie this is fucking 
                        crazy! 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’ve seen them. The bodies of us 
                        all. If I don’t do this, Ellis 
                        won’t be the only one to suffer. 
                        The Mine’s disease will spread and 
                        the Lake will keep punishing us. 

           William cries. This lost cause slipping away. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        You just need help. 

           Maggie steps toward him. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                             (desperately pleading)
                        Let me help you. 

           She looks down at William as if trying to remember what it 
           was like before. What it was like to be sane. 

           She kneels in front of him. Strokes his face with her hand. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Did you ever trust me? 

           William’s eyes fill with tears -- 

           We’ve heard her ask this of him before. In their first scene 
           together.

           He answers the same way -- with a nod. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Then do it again. 
           She stuffs a gag into William’s mouth. Stands. Gets in her 
           truck, and drives away -- pulling the boat with her. 

           William’s muted pleads are muffled by the gag. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - ELLIS' ROOM - NIGHT

           Ellis’ heart rate monitor beeps. Once, twice, faster now. 

           EXT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - DOCK - NIGHT

           Under the moonlight, Maggie lowers the Mary Boat, which is 
           now loaded with the ANFO, into the water. 

           She climbs in. Cranks the motor. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - BARN - NIGHT

           William scratches the ties that bind him on a rusted nail. 

           EXT. LAKE BALSAM - NIGHT

           Maggie drives the motorboat toward the Dam. 

           She looks in the near distance where Wanderlights dreamily 
           guide her path. 

           INT. MAGGIE'S PROPERTY - BARN - NIGHT

           William frees himself. Unraveling his hands and taking the 
           gag from his mouth. 

           He stands. But -- BLACK DOG enters.

           Growling, territorial, RABID. William backs away slowly. 

           The dog stalks. Muscles flexing. Ready to kill. Then, it --   

           CHARGES. William readies himself for the blow.   

           The beast pounces, forcing William onto his back. It bites, 
           spits, foams at the mouth. 

           His jaw locks around William’s wrist. BITING down HARD. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        AHHHHH!!

           William fights with everything he has to keep the Dog at bay. 
           Blood pours from his wrist. 

           Then, the sickening sound of RIPPED FLESH as Black Dog tears 
           off some of William’s skin. 

           William crawls away. But Black Dog pulls him back. 

           Pouncing on him again, this time on his back. He bites down 
           hard on his shoulder. 

           William reaches for a shovel, just feet away. 

           Dark Blood pours from his collar bone and onto his face. A 
           pool forming on the ground by his mouth. 

           With one last gasp of energy, William reaches the rusted 
           shovel and -- 

           WHAM! 

           Lands a blow to Black dog’s skull. 

           It’s enough for William to scamper to his feet. 

           Black Dog scowls at him. Ready to charge again. He does. 

           WHAM! 

           William lands another blow with a vicious crunch.

           The shovel snaps in half. 

           William only holds the broken wooden handle, now in the form 
           a pointed stake. 

           Black Dog comes again. Leaping on top of William.  

           Bleeding and primal, William holds Black Dog off with all his 
           might with his good arm. 

           And with his injured wrist, he DRIVES the WOODEN STAKE into 
           the dogs throat. 

           The pointed wood pushes through the back of Black Dog’s head. 

           The Dog quivers involuntarily. Twitching violently a moment 
           before becoming still. 

           Exhausted, bleeding, and injured, William pulls himself to 
           his feet. 
           INT. HOSPITAL - ELLIS’ ROOM - NIGHT

           Ellis’ heart rate rises higher now. He’s drenched in sweat.

           Doctors and nurses rush in. Placing ice bags all over him.

           But there’s no stopping this fever.

           Suddenly, his eyes shoot open. He sees something ahead. 

           Or is he just hallucinating? 

           Either way, fear overtakes him. 

           INT. WILLIAM’S TRUCK - NIGHT

           William, blood seeping from his wounds, speeds down the road. 

           Woozy, he dials a number. 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                             (tired)
                        Hello?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Beth it’s William Colton, put Earle 
                        on right now. 

           EXT. LAKE BALSAM - HYDROELECTRIC DAM - NIGHT

           Maggie has driven her boat right up to the edge of the Dam. 

           She stacks the last of her ANFO at the most vulnerable area 
           of the Dam’s foundation. 

           Attaches a FUSE to the ANFO.

           Unravels it and crawls back into her boat. 

           Before she can pull away: 

                                 WILLIAM (O.S.)
                        Maggie! 

           She looks up sharply to see William on the banks of the lake, 
           at the edge of the Dam, twenty yards away. 

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        Don’t do it!

           Maggie looks down at her hands. So close to committing 
           something terrible. 
           But it’s the only way.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I have to! They’ll take him just 
                        like the others if I don’t. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        There’s no one to take him. 

           Maggie looks around.  Wanderlights begin surrounding her. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - ELLIS' ROOM - NIGHT

           Ellis seizes violently. Foam seeps from his wire tight jaws.

           EXT. LAKE BALSAM - HYDROELECTRIC DAM - NIGHT

           The Wanderlights are all around Maggie now. 

                                 MAGGIE
                             (to William)
                        Don’t you see?  

           Maggie watches as the Wanderlights rise out of the water. 

           BUT -- just below them, the surface of the lake changes from 
           still and mirror smooth, to dark and churning, because -- 

           FIGURES press up against the surface, as if blocked by a 
           sheet of ice.  

           Dark shapes, in all black, faceless, covered in veils.

           One by one the faceless specters emerge from the water,  
           hovering on the surface. Tied to it. 

           Trapped in this horrific state.  

           Maggie’s eyes glass over, just as we saw with Bob.

           Dreaming with her eyes open.

           The specters glide forward slowly, towards William. To the 
           shores. BUT -- 

           One by One, they sink back into the dead water. Back to their 
           forgotten home in the depths below. 

           The home they’re cursed to live in forever... unless Maggie 
           frees them. 

           But William can’t see them. 
           His attention’s focused on the DOZENS of POLICE OFFICERS who 
           have arrived on the scene -- Sheriff Holland amongst them.

           They move down the banks of the lake, blue lights flashing on 
           the hilltops. 

           All point their guns at Maggie. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND
                        Maggie! Put that down right now! 

           But Maggie doesn’t listen. He calls out again. 

                                 SHERIFF HOLLAND (CONT'D)
                        It’s not real! None of it’s real! 

           But Maggie’s long gone. 

           She only has eyes for the specters, as the last of them -- a 
           small, child sized figure, is pulled back into the dark of 
           Lake Balsam. 

           Tears well in Maggie’s eyes as she watches the child, no 
           bigger than Ellis, disappear. 

           She looks up to the Sheriff and repeats Bob’s words... 

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’ll take us all.  

           Sheriff Holland looks on, stunned. He was there when Bob said 
           it. Now he’s watching it all happen again. 

           Maggie shifts to William. Locking eyes with him. 

           A moment of private intimacy amidst chaos.

           Then her declaration...

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I’m going to cure this town. I’m 
                        going to save our son. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - ELLIS' ROOM - NIGHT

           Ellis’ seizure worsens. His whole body shaking. 

           EXT. LAKE BALSAM - HYDROELECTRIC DAM - NIGHT

           Maggie gives one last longing look to William. 

           Her sad, crazed eyes rippling with emotion, pain, terror. 
           She lights the fuse...

           EXT. COMMUNITY BUILDING - NIGHT

           Julie and other townsfolk exit. 

           Clearly coming from another protest meeting. Suddenly -- 

           BOOM! 

           They all look toward the DAM. 

           INT. MILLER COAL MINE - OFFICES - NIGHT

           Executive #1, working at his desk, falls to the floor as his 
           office walls SHAKE. 

           His eyes widen as he looks out the window to see the cause. 

           EXT. LAKE BALSAM - NIGHT

           Sitting alone on the edge of the lake, Lenny rises to his 
           feet. 

           Staring wide-eyed at the far off Dam, sadness fills him.

                                 LENNY
                        Maggie...

           INT. HOSPITAL - ELLIS' ROOM - NIGHT

           Ellis still struggles. 

           But the explosion catches the Hospital staff’s attention. 
           They look out the window. 

           In the distance, the explosion rocks the night.  

           EXT. LAKE BALSAM - HYDROELECTRIC DAM - NIGHT

           ASH CLOUDS the air as the “monstrous rock and stone” of the 
           Dam falls everywhere. 

           We find William, laying on the ground by the shoreline.

           Woozy, he rises and looks out upon the devastation. 

           The middle of the Dam is GONE. Obliterated by Maggie’s 
           explosion. 
           She actually did it. 

           William’s eyes land on the Lake -- 

           the water now moves like a river, coursing through the gaping 
           Dam, which crumples more with each second.

           William looks around. Shouts like a mad man. 

                                 WILLIAM
                        Maggie! Maggie! 

           But he knows she’s gone. 

           Crazed, he tries to go into the water, only to be pulled back 
           by Sheriff Holland.  

           William struggles but the Sheriff holds him tight. After a 
           moment, they break away from each other. 

           They stand upon the edge of Lake Balsam and look out at the 
           flowing water, slowly draining from the lake. 

           As we PUSH IN on the surface of the water...

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL - ELLIS' ROOM - NIGHT

           EXTREME CLOSE UP on Ellis’ face as his seizure gradually 
           dissipates. His breathing steadies. Finally, his eyes settle. 

           But, they settle so much so, it’s hard to tell if he’s dead 
           or alive. Gone from this world or returned to it. 

           If Maggie was right, or crazy. 

           If the curse was broken, or never existed at all. 

           If the Wanderlights were indeed specters -- lost souls 
           betrayed by the past -- or a folktale all along.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           FADE IN:

           EXT. LAKE BALSAM - DAY

           We began with the water from Lake Balsam. Now we end with it.

           PANNING over the surface of the lake, the water is low. 
           This man made reservoir slowly draining. Returning the past 
           to us.

           A motorboat idles nearby. Lenny sits inside, looking out over 
           the landscape. 

           Maggie’s voiceover breaks the silence: 

                                 MAGGIE (V.O.)
                        The hills of this land attached to 
                        us like strings to a puppet. 
                        Leading, guiding, never allowin’ us 
                        to stray too far. 

           CAMERA stops, low to the surface. 

           In far BACKGROUND, Black Mountain looms, the Mine attached to 
           its side like a leach. 

           Slowly PULL BACK until the FOREGROUND reveals the peak of a 
           CHURCH STEEPLE protruding from the water. 

           Lenny looks at the steeple. Thinking about everything Maggie 
           told him. 

                                 MAGGIE (V.O.)
                        We’re protected here...

           PULLING BACK further -- Lenny’s view becomes more clear. 

           The foreground is now filled with tips of ancient rooftops 
           from the town below -- forever a reminder of what was lost 
           under the iron fist of Miller Coal. 

           And the people who lived there...

           A deep quiet resonates as the water ebs and flows. Lowering 
           and rising in a soft current. 

                                 MAGGIE (V.O.)
                        ...So long as the hills’ll have us.

           Johnny Cash’s Long Black Veil plays us out as we...
