           FADE IN:

           ON GRASSHOPPERS.

           Hopping through the underbrush. We're so close they're
           frightening. Black lifeless eyes. Long spindly legs. Twitchy
           and frantic in their movements. They hop around erratically.
           Trying to escape...

           From the HANDS swooping in to grab them. Most of the
           grasshoppers evade, but one is too slow and gets snatched.

           The hands gently dump it into a GLASS JAR with an aerated
           lid and some grass. The grasshopper bounces around, trapped.
           Surrounded by several more of its imprisoned kin.

                                 WEN (O.S.)
                        It's okay... Relax...

           The jar rises to reveal WEN, a precocious seven-year-old
           girl, staring at the grasshopper, her features comically
           distorted by the curved glass.

                                 WEN
                        I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm just
                        gonna study you for a little while.
                        Is that okay?

           There's a sweetness in her tone. An innocence that the real
           world inevitably stomps out with time. But not yet.

           As she lowers the jar, we see that she's Chinese, with a
           subtle SCAR above her lip. Playing amidst the tall grass in
           the front yard outside of --

           EXT. CABIN -- DAY

           Old fashioned, built with logs. The perfect place to spend a
           long weekend. Weathered and worn, it's been through a lot
           over the years. But that's what gives it charm.

           It sits on a raised foundation, overlooking the shimmering
           LAKE. An SUV parked on the dirt driveway at the end of a
           gravel road that snakes away into the FOREST. It's
           incredibly peaceful out here... And isolated.

           Wen studies her new grasshopper as it hops around. A
           childish curiosity in her eyes.

                                 WEN
                        I'm gonna name you Caroline, after my
                        friend at school. She's really nice.
                        But she farts in class sometimes and
                        pretends like she didn't.
                                 (MORE)
                                 WEN (cont'd)
                        So please don't do that, 'cause
                        you're sharing this jar now and the
                        others won't like you if you smell.
                        Okay?

           The grasshoppers jump, having no say in the matter.

           Satisfied, Wen grabs her NOTEBOOK. She's drawn a CHART with
           headings - "Name" "Size" "Boy or Girl" "Energy-level."
           Pretty sophisticated for a seven-year-old. There are already
           entries for grasshoppers named Liv, Orvin, Sara, and Gita.

           She writes "Kerolien" in a new column and jots down notes.
           "6 inches" for size, obviously way off. For energy level,
           she thinks about it. Then writes "Hi."

                                 WEN
                        Now there's enough grass in there for
                        all of you, so make sure you share
                        it. And don't bite each other either
                        please. You're a family.

           As she continues to play, we can't help but notice that
           she's all alone out here. No people in sight. No boats on
           the lake. Just snow-capped mountains in the distance.

           Until we hear FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING ON GRAVEL. Wen turns to
           the road. And her young eyes go wide...

           There is a BEHEMOTH OF A MAN (30s) striding towards her.
           Wearing blue jeans with a white button-down shirt, neatly
           tucked in. A warm smile on his face. A smile that says he
           can be trusted.

           From the look on Wen's face, he must be the biggest person
           she has ever seen. An absolute giant compared to her.

                                 MAN
                        Hi there!

           He sounds friendly. But Wen doesn't respond, her spidey
           sense on high alert. Who is this guy?

                                 MAN
                        I'm not from around here, and was
                        hoping to make some new friends. Can
                        I talk to you for a little while?

           His smile doesn't waver.

                                 WEN
                        I... I don't talk to strangers.
                                 MAN
                        Of course you don't. And you
                        shouldn't, you're very smart. But I'm
                        here to be your friend. So hopefully
                        we won't be strangers for long.
                                 (
                                     )
                                  beat
                        What's your name?

           Wen hesitates... But he seems friendly enough.

                                 WEN
                        Wenling. But everyone calls me Wen.

                                 MAN
                        Well, it's nice to meet you, Wen. My
                        name is Leonard.

           LEONARD extends his meaty hand. After a moment, Wen shakes
           it, barely wrapping around a couple of his fingers.

                                 LEONARD
                        I see that you're catching
                        grasshoppers. Can I help you?

                                 WEN
                        Umm... I guess so.

           Leonard crouches next to her, moving his hand back and forth
           through the grass. Wen watches, intrigued.

                                 LEONARD
                        I loved catching grasshoppers when I
                        was your age.

                                 WEN
                        Just be careful with them please.

                                 LEONARD
                        Oh, don't worry. I'm very gentle.

           A grasshopper hops and Leonard SNATCHES IT out of the air.

                                 WEN
                        Whoa! You're really good!

                                 LEONARD
                        Thanks Wen. Could you grab your jar
                        for me, please?

           Wen begins to unscrew the lid and the grasshoppers inside
           bounce around, trying to escape.
                                 LEONARD
                        Wait, let the ones inside calm down a
                        bit... We don't want them to panic.

           He and Wen watch as the grasshoppers slow and stop jumping.

                                 LEONARD
                        There we go...

           Wen gently removes the jar's lid and Leonard drops the new
           one inside. Wen closes it back up. It would be such a cute
           moment if it was between a father and daughter. But it's
           not... Which makes his attitude all the more unnerving.

                                 LEONARD
                        Did someone teach you how to catch
                        grasshoppers? Or are you just a
                        natural?

                                 WEN
                        Daddy Eric taught me.

                                 LEONARD
                        You call your dad by his first name?

                                 WEN
                        It's so they know who I'm talking to.
                        There's Daddy Eric and Daddy Andrew.
                        All the other kids at school only
                        have one dad. All the Disney Channel
                        shows only have one dad too.

                                 LEONARD
                        I see... Does that bother you?

                                 WEN
                        No. Except when my guidance counselor
                        keeps saying how 'it's so great' that
                        I have two dads. It's like she's
                        trying to convince me. But I already
                        know.

                                 LEONARD
                        You want to know what I think? I
                        think you and your dads make a
                        beautiful family.

           That makes Wen smile.

           But Leonard's expression falters as he sneaks a glance at
           his WATCH and turns uneasily to the road behind him, as if
           expecting to see someone else coming down it.
                                 WEN
                        What's wrong?

           And just like that, his warmth returns.

                                 LEONARD
                        Nothing. Nothing at all. Hey, how old
                        are you, Wen?

                                 WEN
                        I'll be eight in six days.

                                 LEONARD
                        Well happy almost-birthday! In fact,
                        it just so happens... I have
                        something for you.

           He reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out a freshly-
           picked WHITE FLOWER.

                                 LEONARD
                        I saw it and thought it was pretty,
                        so I decided to keep it until I met
                        someone nice... Someone like you.
                        Consider it an early birthday
                        present.

           He holds it out to her. But Wen doesn't take it. As nice as
           he is, something about him still makes her uneasy. 

                                 LEONARD
                        If you don't like it, we could play a
                        game with it instead.

                                 WEN
                        What kind of game?

                                 LEONARD
                        We take turns pulling off petals and
                        asking questions. By the time we're
                        done, we'll know each other better.
                        We'll be better friends.

           Wen stares at him, his smile so warm and inviting.

                                 WEN
                        Okay.

                                 LEONARD
                        Great. I'll start, just since I've
                        played it before.

           He delicately pulls off a petal. Then lets it flutter off in
           the breeze.
                                 LEONARD
                        Alright. What's your favorite movie?

                                 WEN
                        Big Hero Six.

                                 LEONARD
                        I like that one too. It made me laugh
                        a lot. Okay, now your turn.

           Wen moves closer to him to pull off a petal.

                                 WEN
                        Everyone always asks what your
                        favorite food is. I want to know what
                        your least favorite food is. The kind
                        that makes you want to throw up.

                                 LEONARD
                        That's easy. Broccoli. Blargh!

           He pretends to vomit, making Wen giggle. Leonard pulls off
           another petal.

                                 LEONARD
                        Where are you from?

                                 WEN
                        Hong Kong. I don't remember it
                        though. I left with my dads when I
                        was little. But they say it's real
                        pretty.

           Wen smiles, now it's her turn. She pulls off another petal.

                                 WEN
                        Why are you here?

           A crack in Leonard's friendly facade. His eyes dart to the
           road again, unease growing.

                                 WEN
                        Leonard?

                                 LEONARD
                        Why am I here? Well, I suppose I'm
                        here to make friends with you. And
                        your dads too. And maybe catch some
                        more grasshoppers.

           He pulls off another petal.
                                 LEONARD
                        How did you get that tiny scar on
                        your lip?

           Wen's expression falls. That hit a self-conscious nerve.

                                 LEONARD
                        I'm sorry... I shouldn't have asked.
                        That's too personal, even for this
                        game.

                                 WEN
                        It's okay... My lip was broken when I
                        was born. My dads said it took a lot
                        of doctors to fix it.

                                 LEONARD
                        Well they did an amazing job. You're
                        beautiful just the way you are.

           The moment lingers as Wen doesn't quite believe him... It's
           impossible not to notice it's just the two of them out here.

                                 WEN
                        It's not fair. You can see what's
                        wrong with me, but I can't see what's
                        wrong with you.

                                 LEONARD
                        Oh, there's something wrong with me
                        too, Wen... I may not have a scar on
                        the outside, but if you could see
                        inside, you'd see my heart is broken.

                                 WEN
                        Why's it broken?

                                 LEONARD
                        Because of what I have to do today.

                                 WEN
                        What do you have to do?

           Before Leonard can answer, Wen hears MORE FOOTSTEPS
           crunching up the gravel road. Leonard turns with
           trepidation. Wen looks past him.

                                 WEN
                        Are there more people coming?

           Leonard nods.

                                 WEN
                        Are they your friends?
           Leonard shakes his head "no."

                                 LEONARD
                        You're my friend, Wen. No matter what
                        happens, I want you to remember that.
                        The others who are coming are more
                        like my... Associates.

           The footsteps get closer.

                                 LEONARD
                        You see, the four of us have a very
                        important job to do. In fact, it
                        might be the most important job in
                        the history of the world.

           Then Wen's eyes widen as she sees...

           THREE MORE STRANGERS coming up the road, two women and one
           man. Like Leonard, they all wear blue jeans with tucked in,
           button-down shirts - one black, one pale, one red.

           We will soon learn their names are SABRINA (pale shirt, 20s,
           thin and tan), REDMOND (red shirt, 40s, lots of tattoos),
           and ADRIANE (black shirt, 30s, short and stocky).

           And in their hands are BIZARRE LONG-HANDLED WEAPONS. Shovels
           and rakes modified with NAILS, RAKING CLAWS, and CURVED
           BLADES. Medieval weapons from tools of the present. The
           stuff of nightmares.

           Wen staggers back, alarm bells ringing.

                                 LEONARD
                        This isn't about you, Wen. Or your
                        dads. Nothing that's going to happen
                        is your fault.

           Wen stumbles up the cabin's front steps --

                                 LEONARD
                        WEN!

           The intensity of his voice startles her. She turns back to
           face him. Leonard takes a breath, trying to sound friendly.

                                 LEONARD
                        Your dads won't want to let us in.
                        Please tell them they must. Tell them
                        we need their help. Otherwise, we'll
                        have to find our own way inside. Do
                        you understand?
           Wen stares back as the others approach. Redmond carries a
           WORN BROWN SATCHEL over his shoulder. He holds out a BRUTISH
           WEAPON with a SLEDGEHAMMER HEAD on one end and spikes on the
           other. Leonard accepts it. Then turns back to Wen.

                                 LEONARD
                        Wen? Do you understand?

           Wen stands alone on the porch of the quaint little cabin,
           taking in the terrifying sight of these four strangers
           standing together, weapons in hand.

           Then she yanks the door open and runs inside, slamming it
           shut behind her.

           INT. CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

           Wen tears through, panic gripping her, nearly tripping on a
           rug, but she catches herself and keeps running. Throws open
           the back door --

           EXT. BACK PORCH, CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

           The door slams against the wall as it flies open, startling
           her DADS. They look up from their lounge chairs, books in
           hand. ERIC (30s), shaved head, conservative polo shirt.
           ANDREW (30s), ponytail, more casual attire.

                                 WEN
                        You have to come inside right now!
                        There are strangers and they want to
                        come in and they're scary!

                                 ERIC
                        Whoa, whoa, slow down --

                                 WEN
                        Hurry! NOW!

           She grabs their hands, tugging them both.

                                 ANDREW
                        Okay, okay, we're coming sweetie.

           They get up and she pulls them both into --

           INT. COMMON ROOM, CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

           As soon as they're inside, Wen closes the back door and
           locks it. Breathing fast. Fighting back tears. Eric and
           Andrew kneel down besides her.
                                 ERIC
                        Wen. Wen, it's okay. Listen, sweetie,
                        what happened? What scared you?

           Wen struggles to catch her breath, words flowing faster than
           she can control them.

                                 WEN
                        There -- There were four of them --
                        The big one -- His name's Leonard --
                        He -- He says we have to help them --
                        He says they have the most important
                        job in the history of the world.

           Eric and Andrew exchange a look. What?

                                 ANDREW
                        Jehovah's Witnesses?

                                 ERIC
                        Great...

                                 WEN
                        They have these weapons!

           Now that gets their attention.

                                 ERIC
                        What do you mean they have --

           KNOCKING ON THE FRONT DOOR.

           Wen jumps and the dads' heads snap around at the sound of
           SEVEN POLITE KNOCKS IN RHYTHMIC SUCCESSION.

           Wen stares at the FRONT DOOR across the room with wide eyes.
           CURTAINS cover the windows on either side, OBSCURING WHAT'S
           OUTSIDE. But she knows what's out there.

                                 ANDREW
                        Stay here, Wen. Stay right here.

           Wen steps behind the arm of the love seat for a sense of
           protection as her dads cautiously approach the door.

           KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! Wen gasps.

                                 LEONARD (O.S.)
                        Hello in there!

           His voice is eerily calm and friendly.
                                 LEONARD (O.S.)
                        My name's Leonard and I'm here with
                        some associates of mine. Could you
                        open your door, please?

           Wen vehemently shakes her head no. But she can only watch as
           her dads peek out the curtains.

                                 (
                                  whispering
                                 ANDREW
                                           )
                        This guy is freaking huge.

                                 ERIC
                                  whispering
                                           )
                                 (
                        What do we do?

                                 (
                                  whispering
                                 ANDREW
                                           )
                        I don't know. Tell them to go away
                        nicely?

           Eric takes a breath, steadying his nerves.

                                 ERIC
                        Hi, uh, hello Leonard. We --

                                 LEONARD (O.S.)
                        Is that Daddy Andrew or Daddy Eric? I
                        met your delightful daughter Wen
                        already...

           Wen stiffens upon hearing her name.

                                 LEONARD (O.S.)
                        ... She's so thoughtful and kind. You
                        two should be very proud.

                                 ERIC
                        This is Eric. Is there something we
                        can help you with?

                                 LEONARD (O.S.)
                        There is. Why don't you open your
                        door. It'll be easier if we speak
                        face to face.

                                 WEN
                        No... Don't listen...

           Eric motions with as much reassurance as he can manage. It's
           okay, Daddy's got this... Turns back to the door.
                                 ERIC
                        We weren't expecting visitors. I
                        don't want to sound rude, but we'd
                        like to be left alone.

                                 LEONARD (O.S.)
                        I understand, and I'm so sorry to
                        intrude on your vacation. Especially
                        in such a beautiful place as this.
                        But it is vital that we talk. I
                        cannot stress that enough.

           Tears stream down Wen's face as she clings to the love seat.

                                 WEN
                        Tell them to go away... Please make
                        them go away...

                                 LEONARD (O.S.)
                        You should know that this isn't easy
                        for us either. None of us have ever
                        been in this position before. But our
                        situation is bigger than any of us.

                                 WEN
                        Make them go away!

           Andrew sees the terror on his daughter's face.

           Then grabs an old PORTABLE PHONE and dials 9-1-1.

                                 (
                                  whispering
                                 ANDREW
                                           )
                        What the -- There's no dial tone!

                                 ERIC
                                 (
                                  whispering
                                           )
                        What? I checked it when we got here.
                        Is the battery dead?

                                 (
                                  whispering
                                 ANDREW
                                           )
                        The battery's not dead. It's not
                        dialing!

           Wen watches, panic rising, as Andrew frantically fiddles
           with the phone.

                                 LEONARD (O.S.)
                        Like I said... We need to talk. We
                        don't have a choice.
                                 ANDREW
                        Yeah, well, we don't have a choice
                        either! We're calling the cops!

                                 SABRINA (O.S.)
                        Hey, um, we know you can't do that.
                        None of our phones get service out
                        here either. And sorry, we had to cut
                        the landline.

           Wen picks up a cell phone from off the coffee table.
           Desperately tries dialing. The "No Service" message only
           amplifying her building panic.

                                 LEONARD (O.S.)
                        We don't mean to rush you, but I'm
                        afraid we're a little pressed for
                        time. Please open the door so that we
                        can have a real conversation.

                                 WEN
                        If you wanna talk, then why do you
                        have those scary weapons with you?!

                                 LEONARD (O.S.)
                        They're not weapons, Wen... They're
                        tools.

           Wen's eyes widen. What the hell does that mean?

           POUND! POUND! POUND!

                                 REDMOND (O.S.)
                        Open the goddamn door! We're coming
                        in either way.

                                 ANDREW
                        The hell you are! I have a gun!

           Wen and Eric turn. That's news to them.

                                 ERIC
                                 (
                                  whispering
                                           )
                        You brought it here?

                                 (
                                  whispering
                                 ANDREW
                                           )
                        Yes and no... It's in the safe in the
                        back of the truck.

                                 REDMOND (O.S.)
                        Show us what you're packing, Daddy
                        Andrew! We all like show and tell.
                                 ANDREW
                        You'll see it when I'm pointing it at
                        your head, asshole!

                                 LEONARD (O.S.)
                        We can't linger out here any longer.
                        I'm giving you one last chance to
                        open the door.

           Wen's eyes dart between her dads as they stare at each
           other, trying to figure out what to do.

                                 WEN
                        Leonard, go away! Just go away!

                                 LEONARD (O.S.)
                        I'm sorry, Wen... I wish it didn't
                        have to be this way.

           THE LOCKED DOORKNOB RATTLES. Followed by a THUNDEROUS THUD
           as the door shakes! Wen lets out a shriek.

                                 ERIC
                        Oh my God...

           THUD! THUD! THUD! THEY'RE TRYING TO BREAK IN! 

           Andrew springs to action, grabbing a CHAIR and WEDGING IT
           UNDERNEATH THE DOORKNOB.

                                 ANDREW
                        Get the windows!

           Wen watches, paralyzed with fear, as her dads frantically
           scramble about, closing all the windows, making the cabin
           darker and darker.

           Then she wipes away her tears and joins in, closing a nearby
           window and using all of her strength to twist the lock.
           Pulls the drapes shut.

                                 ERIC
                        Good job, Wen! Keep going.

           Wen rushes to the next window as Andrew and Eric wedge the
           COUCH at an angle up against the back door.

           Amidst the scramble, we get a general sense of the cabin's
           layout. There's ONE MAIN ROOM with TWO ADJACENT BEDROOMS, a
           BATHROOM, and a DOOR LEADING TO THE BASEMENT.

           Wen dashes to another window. Strains to pull it shut --
           LEONARD MOVES BY OUTSIDE, causing her to jump back. THE
           WINDOW IS JUST OUT OF REACH due to the cabin's raised
           foundation. Wen yanks the drapes shut before he can see her.

           The sound of SPLINTERING WOOD. Wen turns and sees --

           REDMOND'S FACE through a broken slit in the front door. He
           winds up and SMASHES IT AGAIN.

                                 WEN
                        Daddy Andrew?!

           Andrew picks her up with his steady hands.

                                 ANDREW
                        I got you, baby --

           CRACK! CRACK! The family turns at the sound of SOMETHING
           BANGING AGAINST A WINDOW.

           THUD! THUD! Someone trying to break down the back door.
           THEY'RE COMING IN FROM ALL SIDES.

           GLASS SHATTERS on the far side of the room. Wen screams.

           Eric rips open one of the drapes, throws open the window,
           and punches out the screen.

                                 ANDREW
                        What are you doing?!

                                 ERIC
                        Come on!

           But Eric moves away from the window and opens the basement
           door, motioning them down. WEN CLINGS TO ANDREW as he
           carries her, Eric closing the door behind them.

           BASEMENT

           Wen clutches her little arms around Andrew's neck as he
           carries her through the dark space. Cobwebs and dust. Rusted
           shelves full of boxes.

                                 ERIC
                        This way...

           There's a DOOR LEADING OUTSIDE on the far end of the space.
           A glimmer of hope. Andrew carries Wen towards it --

           A LOUD THUD on the door! Wen lets out a scream as the dads
           startle back. Someone's coming in this way too!

           SMASH! THE FRONT DOOR BREAKS OPEN UPSTAIRS.
           FOOTSTEPS creak on the wood above... They're inside now.

                                 WEN
                        We're trapped... We're trapped...

           Andrew sets Wen down and puts a finger to her mouth.

                                 (
                                  whispering
                                 ANDREW
                                           )
                        Listen to me... You have to be quiet
                        baby... Stay very quiet...

                                 ERIC
                                 (
                                  whispering
                                           )
                        We're not gonna let anything happen
                        to you. But you have to be brave for
                        us. Can you do that?

           MORE THUDDING on the door. Wen startles. Then nods
           emphatically to her dads.

           Eric motions to Andrew. Together, they move one of the dusty
           shelves away from the wall, making enough space to hide.
           They wave Wen over, and she crouches down behind the shelf.

           Andrew motions to Eric to hide with her. Eric shakes his
           head 'no' and points to Andrew.

           Smash! Smash! The basement door shaking with every hit.

           Andrew motions again, insisting. Eric acquiesces and
           crouches next to Wen, holding her close to him.

           Smash! Smash! The wood splinters, no strength left.

           Andrew glances around, searching for another place to hide.
           Then wedges himself between the furnace and the wall --

           SMASH! THE BASEMENT DOOR BREAKS OPEN --

           Revealing Leonard's hulking frame, eerily silhouetted by the
           sunlight behind him. The weaponized sledgehammer dangling
           from his massive hand.

           He dips his head to fit through the door and steps inside,
           footsteps the only sound in the silent space. Searching...

           WEN

           Huddles behind the shelf next to Eric, holding her breath as
           Leonard moves closer... Closer...

           Until his footsteps slow... And Wen realizes Leonard is
           standing right over them.
           LEONARD

           Looks over the shelves. Brushes aside some dust...

           WEN

           Struggles not to cough as the dust drifts over them. Eric
           quickly covers her mouth. They hold still, clinging to one
           another tightly, just out of Leonard's view.

           The sound of the DOOR OPENING at the top of the stairwell.

                                 ADRIANE (O.S.)
                        Are they down there?

                                 LEONARD
                        I don't think so.

                                 ADRIANE (O.S)
                        They might've gotten out. One of the
                        windows is open. We're gonna go look.

                                 LEONARD
                        Quickly. We don't have time for this.

                                 ADRIANE (O.S.)
                        Don't worry. Redmond slashed their
                        tires. They won't get far.

           Wen sees Eric cringe upon hearing this.

           LEONARD

           Takes another look around... Then heads up the stairs.

           WEN

           Lets out a relieved breath. But the dust is still in the
           air. Getting into her nose. She can't stop it --

           And she lets out the tiniest SNEEZE.

           LEONARD

           Snaps around, coming back down the stairs with purpose.

           WEN

           Covers her nose, trying not to cry. Not to scream. Eric
           holding her close. 

           LEONARD

           Approaches the shelf, knowing exactly where they are.
                                 LEONARD
                        I'm giving you a choice... Come out
                        now. It'll be much easier for you
                        this way.

           WEN

           Sits tight, on the brink, as the tense seconds pass...

           LEONARD

           Lets out a disappointed sigh. Then sets down his weapon.
           Grabs hold of the shelf --

           ANDREW LEAPS OUT from behind the furnace, PUNCHING LEONARD
           IN THE JAW!

                                 ANDREW
                        Go! Go!

           ERIC SHOVES THE SHELF FORWARD, tipping it and its contents
           ONTO LEONARD, staggering him back. Eric grabs Wen and
           scrambles for the door --

           But SABRINA STEPS INSIDE, her razor sharp weapon on guard.
           Wen screams at the sight.

           Eric picks Wen up, carrying her up the stairs. Andrew rushes
           to follow --

           But LEONARD SNAGS HOLD OF HIS LEG, yanking him back.

                                 WEN
                        Daddy Andrew!

                                 ANDREW
                        Keep going!

           COMMON ROOM

           Eric carries Wen up the stairs --

           Only to come face to face with Redmond and Adriane, holding
           their weapons, ready to strike.

                                 ADRIANE
                        It doesn't have to be like this...

                                 REDMOND
                        We just want to talk, daddy...

           Eric sets Wen down, shielding her with his body. She clings
           to him as Redmond and Adriane step closer.
           Eric glances around desperately, searching for anything to
           protect his daughter. He snatches a FIRE POKER from the
           nearby fireplace.

           Redmond takes another step forward, raising his weapon --

           And Eric swings the poker -- CLING! Metal meets metal as
           Redmond blocks. But ERIC KEEPS SWINGING and -- SLASH! His
           poker GASHES REDMOND'S FACE. Redmond steps back, seeing
           blood on his hand. He smirks.

           Eric white knuckles the poker, turning to Adriane.

                                 LEONARD (O.S.)
                        That's enough!

           Leonard emerges from the stairs, HIS BRUTISH ARMS WRAPPED
           AROUND ANDREW'S NECK, dragging him along. Sabrina follows.

                                 LEONARD
                        Drop it, Eric. It's over.

           Eric hesitates, locking eyes with Andrew. Andrew shakes his
           head 'no' as he squirms, helpless in Leonard's vice grip.

                                 LEONARD
                        Eric, please. For Wen's sake.

           Wen cries, clinging to Eric's leg. The other three intruders
           advance, circling them.

                                 ERIC
                        Just stay back! Stay away!

           He swings the poker, desperate, panicking.

                                 REDMOND
                        I'm through fucking around here!

           Redmond jabs his weapon at Andrew's stomach, stopping just
           short, a mere thrust away from stabbing him.

                                 REDMOND
                        You've wasted enough time already!
                        Now drop it or I'll end him!

           Andrew still shakes his head 'no,' but Eric staggers back,
           tears filling his eyes.

                                 LEONARD
                        Eric... Put it down...
           Eric feels everyone's eyes on him. He has one hand on Wen,
           one hand on the poker, completely surrounded. As the
           intruders move in on him, step by step...

           What's he going to do?

           And in this moment... OUR PERSPECTIVE SHIFTS TO ERIC. MOVING
           FORWARD, WE ARE IN HIS STORY AS WE --

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BMW -- EVENING (ERIC - 2 DAYS AGO)

           Eric sits in the driver's seat of his parked car. Wearing a
           sharp suit and tie. Restrained and polished.

           It's extremely quiet here. Just Eric.

           And yet, he's still tense. Weighed down by his thoughts. And
           that's when we see....

           His hand nervously fidgeting with the WEDDING RING on his
           finger. He eyes it. A decision he doesn't want to make...

           But he does, pulling his ring off in one swift movement. He
           places it into his pocket. Whatever he's about to do, he
           doesn't want anyone to see the ring. 

           With a fortifying breath, he opens his door and steps out
           into the --

           EXT. PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUS

           Eric walks across the pavement with purpose...

           Towards a towering CATHOLIC CHURCH.

                                 ERIC / CONGREGANTS (PRE-LAP)
                        Our Father, who art in Heaven,
                        hallowed be Thy name...

           INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH -- EVENING

           Eric stands amongst the CONGREGANTS, saying the prayer along
           with everyone else, blending in seamlessly.

                                 ERIC / CONGREGANTS
                        Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on
                        Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us
                        this day our daily bread. And forgive
                        us our trespasses as we forgive those
                        who trespass against us.
           As he mechanically recites the words, his eyes wander,
           taking in the other couples. Men and women holding hands.
           Mothers holding their children.

           He is decidedly alone. Separate.

                                 ERIC / CONGREGANTS
                        And lead us not into temptation, but
                        deliver us from evil.

           Eric lingers on the last phrase, its words sinking in.

           Then he straightens, putting on his Catholic mask again.
           Listening as the Priest continues the ritual.

           INT. SUV -- DAY (ERIC - EARLIER TODAY)

           Eric sits in the passenger seat, Andrew behind the wheel,
           Wen on a booster seat in back. All having a great time,
           belting out Justin Timberlake's "Can't Stop the Feeling!"
           and grooving in a silly fashion with the beat.

                                 ERIC/ANDREW/WEN
                        I got that sunshine in my pocket. Got
                        that good soul in my feet. I feel
                        that hot blood in my body when it
                        drops... Ooh!

           As they sing, Andrew reaches over and takes Eric's hand, now
           with his wedding ring back on. Eric returns a loving smile.

           EXT. BACK ROAD, FOREST -- DAY

           The music fills the air as their SUV rolls down the gravel
           road, driving alongside the beautiful lake, glistening in
           the sun. We can just make out the CABIN in the distance.

           EXT. CABIN -- DAY

           Eric and Andrew stand behind the cabin, looking out over the
           lake. Eric in his pressed khaki pants and button down, very
           out of place here. Andrew by contrast, in a vintage t-shirt
           and ripped cargo shorts, perfectly at home in the outdoors.

           Andrew takes a deep breath and exhales.

                                 ANDREW
                        Much better than the pine scent from
                        the car wash.

                                 ERIC
                        Anything is better than the pine
                        scent from the car wash.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ERIC (cont'd)
                                 (
                                  smiles
                                       )
                        Hey Wen, come check out the view!

           Wen comes scampering around the side of the cabin.

                                 ERIC
                        How many grasshoppers did you catch?

                                 WEN
                        Just one so far. Her name's Liv.

                                 ANDREW
                        You see any bears yet?

                                 ERIC
                        Andrew, I swear, don't even start.

           Andrew laughs. He loves giving his husband shit.

                                 ANDREW
                        Hey Wen, show Daddy Eric your scary
                        bear face.

           Wen stands tall, curling her hands into claws, barring her
           teeth, and letting out her best little girl roar.

                                 ERIC
                        I assume you taught her that?

                                 ANDREW
                        Of course not... But I'm very proud.

                                 ERIC
                        Well fortunately, I came prepared.
                        With my own specialty bear spray --

           He reaches into his pocket, and when his hand comes out, he
           grabs Wen and tickles her. She laughs hysterically,
           squirming to escape. Then gets away, fleeing towards the
           lake, giggling the whole way.

                                 ANDREW
                        I would pay to see you try to tickle
                        a real bear.

                                 ERIC
                        You know, if bears got tickled more,
                        maybe they wouldn't be so violent.

                                 ANDREW
                        Bears aren't violent!

                                 ERIC
                        Hey Wen, sweetie. Not too close.
           Wen steps out onto the RICKETY WOODEN DOCK that stretches
           over the water. It creaks beneath her.

                                 ERIC
                        That dock might have rusty nails.

           Wen slows, disappointed. Andrew smirks.

                                 ANDREW
                        Nails my ass.

           HE RACES PAST WEN, running across the dock --

                                 ANDREW
                        CANNONBALL!

           He triumphantly leaps into the water with a big SPLASH! Wen
           races after him with a giddy scream.

                                 ERIC
                        Wen, don't --

                                 WEN
                        CANNONBALL!

           SPLASH! Leaving Eric alone on the shore, shaking his head.

                                 ANDREW
                        Come on! The water's warm!

                                 ERIC
                        You mean the cesspool of germs is
                        warm?

                                 ANDREW
                        Oh, Daddy Fun is so strict...

                                 WEN
                        Come on, Daddy Fun!

           Eric sighs. Pulls off his shirt. Then halfheartedly runs
           down the dock and jumps into the water. But he screams the
           moment his head emerges.

                                 ERIC
                        Oh my God it's freezing!

           Andrew laughs, and Eric splashes him in return. Wen joins
           in, splashing both of them, loving it.
           EXT. BACK PORCH, CABIN -- DAY

           Eric and Andrew lounge on patio chairs, Eric in the shade,
           Andrew with his feet up, enjoying the sun. Eric sets down
           his book, getting a little antsy.

                                 ERIC
                        One of us should check on Wen.

           Andrew doesn't look up from his novel.

                                 ANDREW
                        It's too late. Bears ate her by now.

                                 ERIC
                                 (smirks)
                        You're such a dick.

                                 ANDREW
                        I'll go free the grasshoppers from
                        her torture chamber in a few minutes.
                        Can you just relax till then? The
                        sun's out. It would like to tan you.

                                 ERIC
                        Sorry... I'm trying not to hover.

                                 ANDREW
                        Listen, you're like the best dad in
                        the world. Give yourself a break.

           Eric nods. Goes back to his book. A few moments pass... Then
           he sighs, setting it down.

                                 ERIC
                        I'm just gonna check on her real
                        quick.

           Andrew sticks out his legs, blocking Eric's path.

                                 ANDREW
                        You... Shall not... Paaaass...

                                 ERIC
                        What are you, the world's hairiest
                        wizard?

           He pinches some of Andrew's leg hair, making him recoil.

                                 ANDREW
                        Ow! You're such a bully!

           Andrew grabs Eric and they wrestle around playfully. Until
           Eric winds up in Andrew's arms.
                                 ANDREW
                        Wen's having a great time here. And
                        so am I.

           Eric smiles. 

                                 ERIC
                        Me too.

           They share a sweet kiss.

           INT. COMMON ROOM, CABIN -- DAY (BACK TO PRESENT)

           Eric now sits at the kitchen table. Andrew beside him. Wen
           in between, held close by her dads. The tension hangs heavy,
           all of them on pins and needles as --

           Sabrina, Redmond, and Adriane pace around them, lurking with
           their weapons.

           Leonard pours glasses of water from a pitcher, the sound
           palpable. He sets a glass in front of each family member.

                                 LEONARD
                        Please. Drink. I'm sure you're
                        thirsty.

           None of them move. Andrew stares daggers.

                                 LEONARD
                        Wen, at least take a sip --

                                 ANDREW
                        Stop talking to her.

           Eric motions for Andrew to calm down. Then whispers to Wen.

                                 ERIC
                        Sweetie, if you're thirsty, it's
                        okay.

           Wen hesitantly picks up the glass and sips. Leonard nods,
           pleased. Then sits across from them.

                                 LEONARD
                        I understand what you're thinking.
                        Really, I do. But I promise you, we
                        are not here with hate in our hearts.

                                 ANDREW
                        Oh really. The fact that we're
                        married men has absolutely nothing to
                        do with why you're here.
                                 REDMOND
                                 (
                                  scoffs
                                       )
                        If it were only that simple.

                                 LEONARD
                        We're here, Andrew, because we have
                        to be. We don't have a choice.

                                 ERIC
                        There's always a choice.

                                 LEONARD
                        For you, yes... Not for us.

           His words linger, the dads uncertain what he means.

                                 ERIC
                        If you want money, you can take
                        everything we have --

           Redmond guffaws.

                                 LEONARD
                        Redmond, please.
                                        )
                                 (
                                  to dads
                        This is about something far more
                        valuable than money.

                                 ERIC
                        Then what's it about?

           Leonard forces a polite smile.

                                 LEONARD
                        I think it would be better if we
                        began with introductions.

                                 REDMOND
                        We don't have time to dick around,
                        Leonard.

                                 LEONARD
                        This is the way it's supposed to be.
                        They deserve to know who we are.

           An edge in his tone. Redmond doesn't press. Leonard takes a
           breath, smiling across the table at the family once again.

                                 LEONARD
                        My name is Leonard and I like
                        catching grasshoppers. Right, Wen?

           Wen just stares back, terrified.
                                 LEONARD
                        I'm from Chicago. I'm a second grade
                        teacher, and I run the after-school
                        program.

           Eric and Andrew exchange a look. WTF?

           Sabrina forces a smile, trying to act cordial in spite of
           the weapon in her hand. Her voice is soft and restrained. 

                                 SABRINA
                        Hi... I'm Sabrina. I'm a post-op
                        nurse from Southern California.

           Adriane shifts her weight. Perpetually antsy and impatient.

                                 ADRIANE
                        I'm, uh, I'm Adriane. I'm a cook at a
                        Mexican joint in DC.

           Redmond steps forward, playing with his weapon. Everything
           is a joke to this guy.

                                 REDMOND
                        Is it my turn now? Great! Well hello
                        freaked out family, my name's
                        Redmond. When I'm not brandishing
                        medieval death sticks, I enjoy long
                        walks on the beach, babes, and beer.
                        Preferably together.

           He laughs, but no one else does. Leonard glares at him.

                                 REDMOND
                        Alright, fine. I work for the gas
                        company and I'm single, if you can
                        believe that. Sabrina and Adriane
                        don't seem to care though.

           Sabrina rolls her eyes.

                                 ERIC
                        Okay... Thank you for introducing
                        yourselves. You want us to see you as
                        people, not as intruders. I get it.

           Calm and respectful. A negotiator.

                                 ERIC
                        If you're here to recruit us for
                        something, we're happy to listen. But
                        we'd be much more at ease if you
                        could please put your weapons down.
                        You're scaring our daughter.
                                 LEONARD
                        We're not here to recruit you, Eric.
                        We're not a cult, if that's what
                        you're thinking. The four of us are
                        everyday people. Just like you.

           Eric and Andrew sure don't believe that.

                                 ERIC
                        If you're not here to recruit us,
                        then what do you want?

           Leonard hesitates, weighing his words.

                                 LEONARD
                        It's important you know that the four
                        of us didn't meet until earlier this
                        morning. We didn't even know each
                        other existed until a week ago. We're
                        from different places. We work
                        different jobs. And yet... We all
                        received the same message, at the
                        same time. We were chosen... We were
                        called.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        The four of us are here to stop the
                        apocalypse.

           Sheer bewilderment all over Eric and Andrew's faces.

                                 ANDREW
                        Not sure we can help you with that
                        one, Leonard.

                                 LEONARD
                        Oh but you can... You see, whether
                        the world ends or doesn't end is
                        ultimately up to the three of you.

                                 ERIC
                        What makes you think that?

           Leonard takes a breath. This is hard for him to say.

                                 LEONARD
                        The only way to stop the apocalypse
                        is with a sacrifice... You must
                        willingly sacrifice one of your own.
                        After you make what I know is an
                        impossible choice... You must kill
                        whoever you choose before the sun
                        sets tonight.
                                 ANDREW
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa...

                                 ERIC
                        Leonard, whatever you think this is,
                        it's not real. So let's just --

                                 ADRIANE
                        It's real.

           From the looks on their faces, they all believe.

                                 WEN
                        Leonard... Please don't kill us.

                                 LEONARD
                        Oh Wen... If I killed anyone, it
                        wouldn't make a difference. Your
                        family must make the choice.

                                 ANDREW
                        We're not hurting anyone!

                                 LEONARD
                        If you fail to make the sacrifice
                        before the sun sets... Then it will
                        be the last time the sun ever sets.
                        The three of you will live, but the
                        rest of humanity, all seven billion,
                        will perish. Then you will witness
                        the horrors of the end of everything,
                        and be left to wander the devastated
                        planet... Alone. Knowing what you
                        could have saved.

                                 ANDREW
                        I don't even have words to describe
                        how utterly psychotic that sounds.

                                 SABRINA
                        We wouldn't have left our lives
                        behind and come all the way out here
                        if this wasn't real.

                                 ERIC
                        I'm sorry... I'm trying really hard
                        to understand this. Do you seriously
                        expect one of us to do something...
                        Something so horrific... Just because
                        you told us to?

                                 LEONARD
                        I can't imagine how hard this is for
                        you.
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEONARD (cont'd)
                                his is the way it's always been.
                        But t
                        It happens every few years. And every
                        time, the family makes the right
                        choice.

                                 ERIC
                        Wait, but you said that none of you
                        have ever been in this position. So
                        how do you know that it's happened
                        before?

                                 LEONARD
                        Because the world is still spinning.

           Eric and Andrew exchange a look, neither buying any of this.

                                 LEONARD
                        We're asking you to make a choice,
                        like many others have before you. And
                        the sooner you make that choice, the
                        more lives will be saved.

                                 REDMOND
                        It's like that song, you know? He's
                        got the whole world in his hands...

                                 LEONARD
                        Stop it.

                                 ERIC
                        None of us are gonna hurt each other.
                        Not now. Not ever.

           Wen vehemently nods.

                                 LEONARD
                        Perhaps I should be more specific
                        about what will happen if you don't
                        choose. The four of us have been made
                        to watch the end of times over and
                        over again. At first, I thought it
                        was a nightmare. But then the visions
                        started playing in my mind every
                        waking hour. They're unrelenting.

                                 ERIC
                        A lot of people have visions. That
                        doesn't make them real --

                                 LEONARD
                        First, the oceans will rise and the
                        cities will drown...
                                 ANDREW
                        There's something really wrong with
                        you if you actually believe that --

                                 LEONARD
                        Then a terrible plague will descend
                        and the infected will writhe with
                        fever and pain...

                                 ERIC
                        Leonard, let us get you help. If you
                        let us go, I swear we'll get you --

                                 LEONARD
                        Then the skies will fall and crash to
                        the ground like pieces of glass. And
                        finally... An everlasting darkness
                        will descend upon everything.

                                 ERIC
                        But who showed you this? Who showed
                        you these visions?

                                 SABRINA
                        Listen to them. They think we're
                        nuts.

                                 LEONARD
                        Who or what showed us the visions is
                        beyond any of our comprehension. We
                        are merely the messengers.

                                 ERIC
                        Okay, so you say you saw some
                        apocalyptic imagery. But you didn't
                        see any of us.

                                 LEONARD
                        We saw this cabin.

           Absolute sincerity in his eyes.

                                 LEONARD
                        It was part of our vision. It was our
                        glimmer of hope. Your family was
                        chosen... Just like each one of us.

                                 REDMOND
                        How do you think we got here, guys?
                        This is the middle of nowhere.
                        Nobody's phones work. We didn't have
                        an address.

                                                         a, I
                        Call me crazy, but I'm telling y
                        put my hands on that steering wheel
                        and I knew exactly where to drive.

                                 ANDREW
                        I'll just call you crazy.

                                 ERIC
                        Everyone, please... Now if this
                        really is the end, there's a major
                        flaw in your reasoning. You're
                        talking about saving the whole
                        world... But you're all Americans.
                        Isn't that a little nationalistic for
                        some greater power like God?

                                 LEONARD
                        I don't have all the answers, Eric.
                        We've already told you everything
                        that you need to know. Now you must
                        make a choice.

                                 ERIC
                        We're not choosing anything.

                                 LEONARD
                        I told Wen that I think you're a
                        beautiful family. And I do. But I
                        also believe that your family was
                        chosen because you're strong enough
                        to do what must be done.

           Redmond paces around the table, leaning down towards Andrew
           and Eric.

                                 REDMOND
                        Tick, tock, tick, tock... Hurry it up
                        boys. Everyone's countin' on ya. He's
                        got the whole world in his hands...
                        He's got the whole world --

           Andrew suddenly grabs his water glass and SHATTERS IT ON
           REDMOND'S HEAD! Redmond staggers back, yelling in pain.
           Andrew leaps to his feet, grabbing hold of Redmond's weapon.
           They struggle for it as Eric joins in the melee --

                                 ERIC
                        Wen, go! Run!

           Wen is just as surprised as the others, and by the time she
           runs for it, Leonard is on his feet. HE SHOVES THE TABLE
           ASIDE AND SCOOPS HER UP. SHE SCREAMS AND FIGHTS against him.
           ERIC RIPS REDMOND'S WEAPON AWAY. He swings it around,
           keeping the others back, yelling at Leonard.

                                 ERIC
                        Put her down! Let her --

           He doesn't see ADRIANE SWING HER STAFF LOW --

           IT SLAMS INTO ERIC'S KNEE, taking his leg out from under
           him. He falls, SMASHING HIS HEAD ON THE TABLE'S EDGE WITH A
           SICKENING CRACK --

                                                           CUT TO BLACK.

           Darkness...

           Then the sound of POURING RAIN...

           Suddenly we're hit with a SERIES OF GROTESQUE IMAGES,
           flashing from one to the next with jagged intensity --

           A WAVE OF WATER FLOODS BY US, filled with LIFELESS BODIES.
           Their DEAD EYES open, staring away. Others flail helplessly,
           screaming and crying as life leaves them --

           An empty street, DEAD BODIES strewn about, their bloody skin
           covered with LESIONS, FINGERTIPS BLACKENED. Some clutching
           onto others in one final embrace, still more lying alone and
           forgotten. FLIES buzzing around their carcasses --

           A RAGING STORM fills the sky, lightning cracking, thunder
           echoing, sheets of rain. The storm to end all storms. A
           lightning bolt strikes right in front of us, BLINDING US
           WITH LIGHT --

           But as it dissipates, we realize that it's SUNLIGHT...
           Streaming in through a crack in the drapes --

           INT. BEDROOM, CABIN -- DAY

           Eric's eyes dart about, trying to get his bearings. He's 
           lying on a bed in the darkened room. Lights off. Drapes
           closed except for the streak of sunlight --

           ERIC'S POV: The sunlight is SO BRIGHT IT'S BLINDING. Painful
           to look at. There's a PERSISTENT RINGING that makes it hard
           to understand the nearby voice. We can just make out a
           figure as our FOCUS BLURS IN AND OUT.

                                 SABRINA
                        It's okay... You're okay...

           Sabrina sits at Eric's side, wiping the GASH ON HIS
           FOREHEAD. Eric realizes it's her and struggles to sit up --
           But pain shoots through him and he clutches his head,
           groaning as she helps him lay back down.

                                 SABRINA
                        Just relax... I told you, I'm a
                        nurse. You may not be on board with
                        all the end of the world stuff yet,
                        but at least trust me on that.

           Eric turns away from the window, clenching his eyes shut.

                                 SABRINA
                        Sorry, that's as dark as I could get
                        it. Light sensitivity is common with
                        concussions. Do you know your name?

           Eric is still groggy from the blow.

                                 ERIC
                        Er... Eric... I'm Eric.

                                 SABRINA
                        Eric, do you know where you are?

                                 ERIC
                        At... At the cabin.

                                 SABRINA
                        And who am I?

           He locks eyes with her. Just the two of them in here.

                                 SABRINA
                        Yeah... You remember me.

           Eric tries to move again, but Sabrina gently holds him down.
           He's far too weak at the moment.

                                 SABRINA
                        Just lay still. Hurting yourself more
                        won't help your family.

                                 ERIC
                        Where's Wen?

                                 SABRINA
                        Your daughter and husband are fine, I
                        promise.

           Eric tenses as Sabrina wipes his wound again.
                                 SABRINA
                        None of us wanted it to go this way.
                        We need you in a clear state of mind.
                        You've got a big decision to make.

                                 ERIC
                        Why... Why are you...

           Sabrina picks up a large bandaid and opens the wrapper.

                                 SABRINA
                        You think I'm some kind of religious
                        freak, right? I would too. Truth is,
                        I haven't even been to church since
                        my grandma forced me to go when I was
                        little. I always thought that
                        religious stuff was so tired and
                        boring, from a different time when
                        people were scared of shadows.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        But then the visions started...

           She gently places the bandaid on his forehead.

                                 SABRINA
                        Leonard told you what's gonna happen,
                        but he didn't give you the details.
                        Yeah, I saw the ocean leveling a
                        city. My city. But that's not what
                        got me. What got me was the bodies...
                        All the dead bodies floating past
                        afterwards... Limp... Eyes still
                        open... Just bobbing in the water...

                                 ERIC
                        Why are you telling me this?

                                 SABRINA
                        Because I saw the look on your face
                        when you woke up. I know you saw
                        something too.

           She meets Eric's gaze. He squints his eyes, struggling to
           clear the haze and put words together.

                                 ERIC
                        That... That doesn't prove
                        anything... You've all been going on
                        about this crazy... Gave me a
                        nightmare... Doesn't mean anything. 

                                 SABRINA
                        I didn't believe it at first either.
                        But you will.
                                 (MORE)
                                 SABRINA (cont'd)
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        When I was a kid, my dad used to tell
                        me, 'Trust the process.' That's sorta
                        become my mantra these past few days.
                        No matter how hard it gets... Trust
                        the process. I said it when I saw the
                        visions. I said it when I built my
                        weapon exactly the way it was shown
                        to me. I said it over and over as I
                        passed every freeway exit on my way
                        out here. I said it when I walked out
                        onto the boardwalk and saw the
                        others, just like I'd seen them in my
                        head. That's when I knew I wasn't
                        alone. That all of this is real. And
                        I'm saying it to you now, Eric... You
                        need to trust the process. You may
                        not want to believe it, but we're all
                        on the same side.

                                 ERIC
                        I'm on my family's side.

                                 SABRINA
                        Your husband is stubborn. And Wen is
                        way too young to understand. That
                        means it's up to you. You're the only
                        one who can stop this. You're the
                        only one who can save all of us.

           Eric struggles to focus on her.

                                 ERIC
                        I could never... I could never kill.

                                 SABRINA
                        Trust the process, Eric. Trust the
                        process.

           The door opens. Eric groans as he tilts his head to see the
           hulking shape of Leonard, a solemn look on his face.

                                 LEONARD
                        It's almost time.

                                 SABRINA
                        Can we give him a few more minutes?
                        He's still pretty foggy.

           Leonard shakes his head, no. Sabrina nods, understanding.

                                 ERIC
                        Almost time for what?
                                 SABRINA
                        Help me move him.

           INT. COMMON ROOM, CABIN -- DAY

           Leonard and Sabrina help Eric out of the bedroom, an arm
           over each of their shoulders. Eric is still in bad shape,
           eyes scanning to see --

           Andrew sitting in a chair on the side of the room, his HANDS
           CUFFED BEHIND HIM. Wen crouched on the floor next to him.
           Other furniture pushed aside to open up the space.

                                 ANDREW
                        Eric! Eric, you okay?

           Wen races over to Eric, throwing her arms around him.

                                 WEN
                        Daddy Eric, make them leave! Make
                        them leave us alone!

           The sight of her brings tears to Eric's eyes. Wen clings to
           him as Leonard and Sabrina ease him into a chair.

           Adriane reaches into the satchel Redmond was carrying
           earlier, and we see that it's filled with HANDCUFFS, ROPE,
           DUCT TAPE, and other items. She pulls out a pair of cuffs
           and uses them to LOCK ERIC'S HANDS BEHIND THE CHAIR.

                                 ANDREW
                        Leave him alone you sick fucks! He
                        needs to go to a hospital.

                                 LEONARD
                        We didn't want it to be like this.
                        We'd hoped you'd open your door so we
                        could all talk in a civilized manner.
                        We gave you every opportunity.

                                 ANDREW
                        Fuck you!

           Leonard ignores him and checks his watch. Sighs.

                                 LEONARD
                        It's time.

           He looks to Eric and Andrew with pity in his eyes.

                                 LEONARD
                        You have to choose. A sacrifice must
                        be made.
                                 ANDREW
                        Like hell we're choosing anything.

           Leonard slowly nods.

                                 LEONARD
                        Then your first choice has been made.

                                 ANDREW
                        What?! We didn't --

           ADRIANE PICKS UP WEN, who starts screaming.

                                 ERIC
                        No! Let her go! Don't hurt --

           But Adriane places her on Eric's lap. Wen clings to him.

           Then Leonard, Sabrina, and Adriane PICK UP THEIR WEAPONS.

                                 ANDREW
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait! You said you
                        wanted to talk... Let's just talk!

           Andrew fights against his cuffs.

                                 WEN
                        What are they doing? What's
                        happening?

           Eric blinks hard, trying to focus his hazy mind, as --

           Leonard, Sabrina, and Adriane step away from each other,
           forming a triangle, their movements ritualistic --

           Leaving REDMOND IN THE CENTER. Not holding his weapon.
           Sarcastic smile gone.

                                 REDMOND
                        This isn't fair, Leonard... Come on,
                        man. We wasted so much time just
                        breaking into this damn place! I
                        deserve a few more minutes.

                                 LEONARD
                        This is the way it must be done.

                                 REDMOND
                        This is bullshit!

           Eric watches this unfold with a mix of confusion and terror.

                                 WEN
                        Daddy Eric... What's happening?
                                 ERIC
                        I don't know, baby...

                                 REDMOND
                        We've been waiting around out here
                        while Sabrina played nurse. Just give
                        me a few more minutes.

           He looks at Sabrina. To Adriane. But they just stare back.

                                 REDMOND
                        Come on. Sabrina. Adriane. Come on.

           They don't waver. Redmond turns to the family, desperate.

                                 REDMOND
                        You can still stop this... But you
                        better hurry the fuck up!

           With shaking hands, he reaches into his pocket. Pulls out a
           THIN WHITE CLOTH. He stretches it over his face, revealing
           it's a MESH MASK. A truly creepy sight to behold.

                                 WEN
                        What's he doing?

           Redmond sinks to his knees before them.

           Eric's mouth falls open, realizing what's about to happen...

                                 ERIC
                        Wen... Don't look...

           But she keeps watching as Leonard, Sabrina, and Adriane
           close in around Redmond. Taking deep, steadying breaths.
           Hands clenching their weapons.

                                 REDMOND
                        Please... You can stop this... Make a
                        choice... Make a fucking choice!

           The others raise their weapons... THEY CLOSE THEIR EYES,
           MUTTERING TO THEMSELVES... Redmond begins trembling.

                                 ERIC
                        Oh God...

                                 ANDREW
                                 (
                                          )
                                  realizing
                        No! Don't do that! Stop!

                                 REDMOND
                        I swear to God, this is all real!
                        It's all real!
           Behind him, the curtains flutter in the breeze, letting in a
           beam of BRIGHT SUNLIGHT.

           ERIC SQUINTS as the light flares. And through blurry vision
           he sees --

           AN AMORPHOUS GLOWING FIGURE hovering above Redmond...

           Eric blinks. And just like that, THE FIGURE IS GONE. Was it
           actually there? Or is his concussed mind playing tricks?

           Then Eric refocuses on Redmond, kneeling before them.

                                 REDMOND
                        PLEASE! YOU CAN STILL SAVE US! YOU
                        CAN STILL SAVE EVERYONE!

           Adriane opens her eyes. Then she swings her staff down on
           Redmond --

                                 ANDREW
                        Wen, close your eyes!

           Wen buries her face in Eric's shirt just as --

           ADRIANE'S RAKING CLAW SLAMS INTO REDMOND'S FACE WITH A
           SICKENING SPLAT! He lets out the high-pitched shriek of a
           wounded animal. The dads cry out in horror. Wen screams.

                                 ANDREW
                        Jesus Christ!

           Sabrina swings her bladed staff at Redmond's skull --

           Eric turns away, closing his eyes as WE HEAR THE GROTESQUE
           SOUNDS OF METAL MEETING FLESH.

           Adriane and Sabrina shower blow after blow upon Redmond. We
           don't see the impacts. But WE HEAR THEM. We hear Redmond's
           screams. And every time Sabrina and Adriane raise their
           weapons, we see more blood and gore layered on them.

           WE CATCH GLIMPSES of Eric and Andrew reacting, cringing,
           yelling. Wen crying as she holds onto Eric.

           All the while, Leonard just stands there. Watching. Waiting.

           We hear Redmond whimpering, writhing on the floor.

           Then, ever so stoic, Leonard raises his enormous
           sledgehammer over his head --

           AND SLAMS IT DOWN WITH A HORRIFIC CRUNCH. BLOOD SPLATTERS
           ACROSS HIS FACE AND WHITE SHIRT.
           And Redmond whimpers no more.

           An unnerving silence takes hold...

           Holy. Fuck.

           Eric opens his eyes... But nothing can prepare him for the
           sight before him. Horrified beyond words.

           Andrew yells out in agony, turning his head away. But Wen
           slowly looks, and the sight is far too much for her young
           mind to even process.

           Redmond's body is mangled. Lying in a pool of blood that
           continues to grow. His white mask now crimson, with more
           blood oozing out of it.

                                 (
                                  whispering
                                 ANDREW
                                           )
                        Wen... Wen, I love you. I love you so
                        much. I love you, Wenling.

           But his words do little to soothe her.

           Eric looks where the figure of light appeared. But it's
           gone... If it was even there in the first place.

           Leonard, Sabrina, and Adriane stand over Redmond's body,
           taking slow breaths... In and out...

           Then Leonard suddenly startles, his eyes widening, as if
           just noticing the body in front of him. He staggers back,
           looking nauseated, he might puke. The sledgehammer falls
           from his hand, thudding loudly on the floor.

           Sabrina and Adriane back away as well, overcome with the
           horror of what they've done.

                        Oh God... Oh God...

           Leonard's hand trembles as he checks his watch again. Then
           he staggers across the room.

                                 ANDREW
                        You're sick... You're all sick... The
                        fuck's wrong with you!

           Leonard picks up the REMOTE CONTROL and turns on the TV.

                                 ANDREW
                        What, now that your friend's dead,
                        it's time to catch a game?
                                 LEONARD
                        He wasn't my friend.

           Leonard flips through the channels. The volume barely
           audible. Stops on CNN. Commercials above the news scroll.

                                 LEONARD
                        Just watch.

                                 ANDREW
                        Watch what?

                        ... 6.4 earthquake that struck four
                        hours ago in the Aleutian Islands in
                        the Bering Sea. The US National
                        Tsunami Warning Center has issued a
                        cautionary advisory for the western
                        seaboard...

                                 LEONARD
                        We told you this would happen.

                                 ANDREW
                        You told us what would happen?

                                 LEONARD
                        If you didn't make a sacrifice, the
                        oceans will rise and the cities will
                        drown. I used those exact words. The
                        cities will drown.

                                 ANDREW
                        Are you even listening to what
                        they're saying? That earthquake
                        happened four hours ago! Long before
                        you said that. Not exactly some big
                        prophesy.

                                 LEONARD
                        Just watch.
           They all do so in silence as video shows several CAPSIZED
           BOATS in a harbor.

                        Thus far, we've had reports of ten
                        foot waves making landfall on the
                        Hawaiian islands. At this time, no
                        injuries have been reported and only
                        minimal property damage has been
                        sustained.

                                 ANDREW
                        No injuries and minimal property
                        damage. This is some doomsday.

                                 LEONARD
                        Just wait...

                                 ERIC
                        It's not real. None of this is
                        real... Please, just let us go.

                                 LEONARD
                        Wait...

                                 ANDREW
                        At least let Eric and Wen go. Let
                        them go and I'll stay.

           Leonard doesn't look away from the screen.

                                 SABRINA
                        I don't recognize any of this...

                                 LEONARD
                        We're supposed to keep watching.

                                 ADRIANE
                        There wasn't anything in my visions
                        about watching TV.

                                 LEONARD
                        Well how else are we supposed to
                        know?! What other option do we have?
                        We have to keep watching...

           He's getting desperate. Unsure of himself.

                                 LEONARD
                        It'll happen... It'll come...

                        the coast of Oregon...

           An ominous sense of relief sweeps through Leonard.

                        scientists have long feared would

           Wen cowers close to Eric, unable to watch anymore.

                                 WEN
                        I thought it wasn't real.

                                 ANDREW
                        It's not real, baby. It's just an
                        earthquake. They happen all the time.
                                 WEN
                        Daddy Eric?

           Eric stares at the TV with horror. Not wanting to believe...
           But...

                                 WEN
                        Daddy Eric!

                        Your parents are wrong, Wen. It is
                        real. It's very real.

           ON SCREEN: The broadcast cuts to SHAKY PHONE VIDEO that is
           chaotic and hard to make out. Then the image steadies...

           WATER EVERYWHERE. We're just above it. And then DEAD BODIES
           FLOAT PAST. So many bodies. Some bobbing face down. Others
           with unblinking lifeless eyes. Sounds of SCREAMING build.
           The injured crying out for help amidst the destruction.

                                 ADRIANE
                        Holy shit... This is what I saw!

                                 SABRINA
                        Me too...

           Eric takes it all in with wide eyes. Then looks away,
           shaking his head emphatically. Trying to un-see the images.

           Leonard turns off the TV.

                                 LEONARD
                        This will happen again, and again,
                        and again, until the sun has set.
                        Every minute you waste moves us one
                        minute closer to another tragedy...
                        Until we reach a permanent midnight.

                                 ANDREW
                        Leonard. Listen to yourself. What are
                        you talking about? Disasters happen,
                        man. It's terrible, but they happen.
                        This doesn't prove anything!

           But Eric doesn't look so sure. And Leonard seems to
           recognize it.
                                 LEONARD
                        I understand that you're all
                        frightened. But this choice you have
                        is a gift. Not all gifts are easy to
                        accept. In fact, I believe the most
                        important gifts are the ones we wish
                        we could refuse, and only later, do
                        we realize just how lucky we were to
                        receive them.

           He smiles reassuringly. Face and shirt splattered with blood.

                                 LEONARD
                        We'll let you think about it for a
                        little while. I'm afraid we've made
                        quite the mess.
                                 (
                                  to Sabrina and Adriane
                                                       )
                        I'll take care of Redmond's body.
                        Perhaps you two can start on the
                        blood.

           Adriane starts rummaging around the cabin, searching for
           cleaning supplies.

           But Sabrina lingers a moment longer, a hint of uncertainty
           shining through. Then she moves to join Adriane.

           Leonard grabs a BED SHEET from a nearby linen closet and
           drapes it over his shoulder. Picks up Redmond's weapon in
           one hand and grabs Redmond's collar with his other. Then
           begins to drag Redmond's carcass towards the front door,
           leaving a bloody streak in its wake.

           Eric stares at the black TV screen, still trying to process.

                                 WEN
                        Daddy Eric... Are you okay? Daddy
                        Eric?

           Her voice snaps him out of his daze.

                                 ERIC
                        Yeah baby. Daddy Eric's okay. We're
                        all gonna be okay.

           But his words are strained. Wen puts her arms around him.
           Eric instinctively tries to hug her back, but his cuffed
           hands clink on the chair.

           Andrew watches, pained by seeing his husband and daughter
           like this.

                                 ANDREW
                        Eric... Are you really alright?
                                 ERIC
                        My head's still ringing. But my
                        vision's clearer.

                                 ANDREW
                        You know that first earthquake
                        happened four hours ago, right?
                        Leonard's been checking his watch a
                        thousand times. They've been timing
                        all of this. 

                                 ERIC
                        I know.

                                 ANDREW
                        I just don't want you to be... You
                        know... To be spooked or anything.

           Eric turns, realizing what Andrew's suggesting.

                                 ERIC
                        You think I believe them?

                                 ANDREW
                        No, just, you know, with your head
                        and all, I want to make sure you're
                        thinking straight. With how they're
                        trying to manipulate us. How they
                        knew about the first quake and how
                        the second one was triggered by it.

                                 ERIC
                        I can't believe this... You think I
                        believe them?

                                 ANDREW
                        No, I... I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm
                        just scared, okay? I'm just really
                        scared of what they're gonna do.

                                 ERIC
                        I don't believe them.

           But there's tension in his voice and Andrew recognizes it.

           Adriane and Sabrina return with cleaning supplies and a
           trash can. The dads are quiet as they begin sopping up the
           pool of blood. Wen looks away and closes her eyes.

           Though Eric can't help but notice that Sabrina's breathing
           is labored.

           She's silently crying, tears running down her cheeks.
           EXT. CABIN -- DAY

           Leonard drags Redmond's body onto the porch, leaving a
           bloody trail behind him. Sets down Redmond's weapon.

           He sighs, taking in the remains of the human before him. And
           as we linger, we realize...

           WE'RE IN LEONARD'S PERSPECTIVE NOW. THIS IS HIS STORY.

           Leonard crouches down, looking at the dead man's face. One
           of Redmond's OPEN EYES peeks through his mesh mask. Leonard
           stares at it for a long moment.

           And we see a hint of regret on Leonard's face. A glimpse of
           the man behind the monster. With a shaky breath, he reaches
           down and gently closes the dead eye.

           Then the giant of a man stands up and shakes out the white
           bed sheet, guiding it to gently fall over Redmond's body. 

           He gives a small nod, this is the way it's supposed to be...

           But then a RED BLOOD STAIN slowly spreads through the sheet.
           Leonard stops and stares, watching it grow and grow... The
           sight of it unnerving to him, as we --

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A RED MARKER drawing a solid red circle on a white board.
           Then a green marker adds a leaf on top.

                                 LEONARD
                        So we know that Tommy has two
                        apples...

           We pull out to reveal we're in -- 

           INT. SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- DAY (LEONARD - 1 WEEK AGO)

           Leonard looks enormous in the room full of miniature
           furniture for the little SECOND GRADERS. But his excitement
           and verve are even bigger than his body. The passionate
           teacher you want your child to get in school.

           He's drawn two apples under a stick figure boy. Points to a
           nearby stick figure girl.

                                 LEONARD
                        And we know that Lilly has four more
                        apples than Tommy. So let's start
                        with what skill we're going to use to
                        solve this problem.
           Several hands rise around the classroom. He points.

                                 STUDENT
                        Addition.

                                 LEONARD
                        That's right. Addition.

           Leonard gets to work drawing additional apples on the board.

                                 LEONARD
                        We're going to take the number of
                        apples that Tommy has and add how
                        many apples --

           WHISPERS behind Leonard. He sighs, and turns to the class.

                                 LEONARD
                        Is there something someone would like
                        to add to the discussion?

           The students exchange confused glances. Leonard looks from
           student to student. But no one admits guilt.

                                 LEONARD
                        Alright... I'll let that one go.

           He goes back to drawing his red apples.

                                 LEONARD
                        So we're going to add how many more
                        apples Lilly has to figure out how
                        many total apples she --

           WHISPERS behind him once again, louder this time. Leonard
           snaps around.

                                 LEONARD
                        If you have something to say, please
                        raise your hand so that I can call on
                        you.

           But now the students are even more baffled, exchanging
           nervous glances with one another.

                                 ANOTHER STUDENT
                        Are you okay, Mr. Travers?

           Leonard sees the concern on their faces.

           Then the WHISPERS rise. Leonard tenses, looking around.

           But none of the students' lips are moving. Yet the WHISPERS
           PERSIST... Coming from nowhere and everywhere.
           INT. LEONARD'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           The cozy home of a man who chose to give back rather than
           live in luxury.

           But Leonard is far from comfortable as he paces around,
           WHISPERS COMING FROM BEHIND HIM no matter which way he
           turns. Surrounding him.

           HE CRANKS UP MUSIC, blasting classic rock. But THE WHISPERS
           ONLY BECOME LOUDER... Drowning out the music. 

           We can't quite make out what they're saying. But from the
           looks of it, Leonard certainly can.

           And it's freaking him out.

           INT. BEDROOM, LEONARD'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           LEONARD IS NOW CURLED UP IN BED, hands clenched over his
           ears. The MUSIC BLARES from the other room. But it's no use.
           The WHISPERS SURROUND HIM. Overwhelming him.

                                 LEONARD
                        Stop it... Stop it! Leave me alone!

           But they're not going away.

                                 LEONARD
                        Please... Please!

           EXT. SCHOOL YARD -- DAY (LEONARD - 5 DAYS AGO)

           Leonard moves aimlessly amongst the CHILDREN playing at
           recess, lost in a haze. He hasn't slept in days.

           The children are all around him, but their laughs and yells
           seem to echo in the distance. Drowned out by the INCESSANT
           WHISPERING. Leonard tries to ignore it but can't, every
           second of his life now a living hell.

           Then his eyes widen as he sees A GIRL LYING FACE DOWN ON THE
           GROUND by one of the play structures, not moving. 

           Leonard snaps back to reality.

                                 LEONARD
                        Chelsea?! Chelsea?!

           LEONARD RUNS TO HER. The whispers fading as he comes to the
           little girl's aid. Turns her over --

           Revealing that the GIRL IS COVERED WITH PLAGUE-LIKE LESIONS,
           FINGERTIPS BLACKENED. Like she's been dead for days.
           Leonard recoils at the horrifying sight, trying to make
           sense of it. Then he realizes -- the school yard is suddenly
           silent. No sounds of kids playing. He slowly turns...

           The bright sun has been replaced by dark storm clouds and
           fog. And all around him... EVERY CHILD IS LYING DEAD ON THE
           GROUND, COVERED IN LESIONS, FINGERTIPS BLACKENED, FLIES
           BUZZING AROUND THEM.

           Leonard staggers, overwhelmed by the sight...

           But then he blinks, and suddenly -- EVERYTHING IS BACK TO
           NORMAL. Children frolicking about. As if nothing happened.

           But Leonard doesn't move. Frightened beyond words.

           The WHISPERS RISE again. Only this time, Leonard doesn't
           fight them. Instead, he takes a deep shaky breath.

           EXT. BOARDWALK -- DAY (LEONARD - EARLIER TODAY)

           People everywhere. Headed to the beach. Perusing shops. On
           carnival rides. Enjoying a summer day.

           Leonard moves amongst them. Now dressed in jeans with a
           white button-down shirt, neatly tucked in. He's tense,
           filled with trepidation. Transformed by his experience.

           His eyes dart about the commotion, passing over the tan
           bodies with indifference. He's searching for someone. Then
           his gaze steadies and he slows...

           Standing at the boardwalk's rail are SABRINA, ADRIANE and
           REDMOND, all dressed in jeans and their colored button-down
           shirts. STARING RIGHT AT HIM. They've been waiting.

           Leonard stiffens. As if he was clinging to one last shred of
           hope that this wasn't real. But with a steadying breath, he
           steels himself and approaches. He stops in front of them.
           For a long moment, they all just stare at each other.

                                 LEONARD
                        Did everyone bring what they were
                        told to?

           The others nod. Leonard nods back, resolved.

           Then he steps to the railing, looking out over the CROWDED
           BEACH below. The others take in the sight with him, gazing
           at all the people.

                                 SABRINA
                        There's so many of them...
                                 LEONARD
                        That's why we're here.

           EXT. CABIN -- DAY (BACK TO PRESENT)

           Leonard stands alone on the front porch, looking out over
           the railing, surrounded by the beauty of nature.

           But on the horizon, DARK STORM CLOUDS LOOM.

           Leonard eyes them with trepidation, seeing more than just a
           coming storm.

           He glances down at his bloody hands, realizing that they're
           SHAKING. He wipes them on his shirt. But he can't get the
           blood off. The sight of it makes him shudder.

           He clasps his hands together. Bows his head, whispering a
           small prayer.

           When his eyes open again, his ice-cold facade has returned.
           And his hands are steady.

           INT. COMMON ROOM, CABIN -- DAY

           Leonard, Sabrina, and Adriane huddle near the front door,
           WHISPERING to each other. Sneaking glances at the family
           across the room.

                                 LEONARD
                        We all knew this would be hard... But
                        we have to stay the course.

                                 ADRIANE
                        That's pretty easy to say when you're
                        not the next one in line to get her
                        head split open.

                                 SABRINA
                        They think we're nuts. Hell, I'm
                        starting to think we're nuts too.

                                 LEONARD
                        They're going to believe us. We all
                        know what happens if they don't.

           An edge in his voice -- it's not an option. Sabrina and
           Adriane nod, they're all in this together.

           Leonard turns and approaches the family, the others right
           behind him.

                                 ANDREW
                        Our answer hasn't changed, assholes.
           Without a word of explanation, LEONARD GRABS WEN'S HAND AND
           PULLS HER AWAY as she screams and shouts in protest.

                                 ANDREW
                        What -- Wait! What are you doing?!
                        Wen! Wen!

           At the same time, SABRINA GRABS ANDREW'S CHAIR AND DRAGS HIM
           towards the bedroom.

                                 ERIC
                        Andrew! Wen! Don't hurt them!

                                 WEN
                        DADDY ERIC!

           Leonard carries her down the steps into the --

           BASEMENT

           Wen thrashes and struggles against Leonard, her dads' voices
           echoing from above.

                                 ERIC (O.S.)
                        WEN!

                                 ANDREW (O.S.)
                        Don't listen to them! Don't listen!

                                 WEN
                        DADDY ANDREW!

                                 LEONARD
                        Shh... Calm down, Wen. Calm down.
                        You're okay... You're okay.

           He sits her down on the workbench and takes a step back,
           raising his hands in a non-threatening manner.

                                 LEONARD
                        I just wanna talk, alright? I just
                        wanna talk.

           Wen's alarm diminishes, still on guard but listening.
           Leonard nods, pulls up a nearby stool and sits down.

                                 LEONARD
                        Listen... I know you're scared right
                        now. I know you probably don't like
                        me much either. And that's okay. But
                        I want you to know... When I said you
                        were my friend, I meant it. No matter
                        what happens, I'm not gonna let
                        anything happen to you.
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEONARD (cont'd)
                        And I know your dads won't either.
                        The world's a better place with you
                        in it.

           He smiles with sincerity. He means it. But she doesn't give
           an inch, still staring him down.

                                 LEONARD
                        Hey, do you like reading? I bet you
                        do.

           He waits for her to respond. Feeling the pressure, Wen
           hesitantly nods.

                                 LEONARD
                        Have your dads ever read you any of
                        the really old stories?

                                 WEN
                                 (
                                  hesitantly
                                           )
                        They read me Alice in Wonderland.

                                 LEONARD
                        I like that one a lot. But the story
                        I'm thinking of is much older. It
                        goes back thousands of years. It's
                        about a dad who had to make a really
                        hard choice. A sacrifice. Do you know
                        what a sacrifice is, Wen?

           Wen shakes her head no. Leonard speaks with the same gentle
           charm we heard from him in the classroom.

                                 LEONARD
                        Sacrifice means letting go of
                        something, or someone, that you
                        really love... In exchange for
                        something even greater.
                                     )
                                 (
                                  beat
                        You see, a long time ago... There was
                        this man named Abraham. He was a
                        wonderful person, thoughtful and
                        smart. In fact, he was a lot like
                        you, Wen. He was so perfect that God
                        chose him to lead a whole new nation.
                        A place where everyone would be safe
                        and happy.

           Wen listens, drawn in.

                                 LEONARD
                        But... God needed to know if He could
                        trust Abraham.
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEONARD (cont'd)
                        So God gave him a test, just like
                        your family's being given a test.
                        Abraham had to make a very difficult
                        choice, just like your family does.
                        God asked Abraham to take his son,
                        the person he loved most in the
                        world... And sacrifice him. So you
                        know what Abraham did?

           Wen shakes her head.

                                 LEONARD
                        Abraham took his son up to the top of
                        the highest mountain. Then he took
                        out his knife and put it to his son's
                        neck.

           Wen's eyes widen. Leonard smiles.

                                 LEONARD
                        But God told Abraham to stop. You
                        see, Abraham passed the test. He made
                        the right choice. He'd proven that he
                        believed. And his son got to live.
                        Abraham was willing to sacrifice
                        everything to help everyone.

           He leans in closer to her.

                                 LEONARD
                        And now, thousands of years later, we
                        still sing songs about him. He's a
                        hero. And your family, you can be
                        heroes too. Heroes who save the whole
                        wide world.

           Wen takes this in, realizing what he's saying.

                                 WEN
                        But... It's just a story. It's not
                        real.

                                 LEONARD
                        It wasn't just a story, Wen. Abraham
                        was chosen... Just like you and your
                        dads have been chosen. And I believe
                        what happened to Abraham will happen
                        to your family too.

                                 WEN
                        We wouldn't have to hurt anyone?
                                 LEONARD
                        That's right. If one of your dads
                        were to put a knife up to the other's
                        neck... I believe God would say,
                        that's enough. Do you think you can
                        help convince them to do that, Wen?

           Wen ponders this. It almost seems reasonable at first, but
           then her expression turns...

                                 WEN
                        What if he doesn't tell us to stop?

           Leonard hesitates.

                                 LEONARD
                        Well, then... Perhaps it's not meant
                        to stop.

                                 WEN
                        Daddy Eric told me God was about
                        love. But yours isn't about love.
                        Your God is a killer.

                                 LEONARD
                        He's not a killer. He's just...
                        Asking for a sacrifice. And if we
                        disobey, then others will die. That
                        would make us the killers.

                                 WEN
                        I don't believe you.

                                 LEONARD
                        Wen --

                                 WEN
                        You're not my friend. You never
                        were. 

           A newfound strength in her young eyes.

           Leonard leans back, genuinely hurt.

           EXT. CABIN -- EVENING

           The sun begins its descent as the dark clouds drift towards
           the little cabin. A jagged bolt of lightning flashes,
           followed by rumbling thunder.
           INT. COMMON ROOM, CABIN -- EVENING

           Leonard, Sabrina, and Adriane stand over Eric and Andrew,
           hands cuffed behind them. Wen back in Eric's lap, glaring up
           at Leonard.

                                 LEONARD
                        Once again, you have the opportunity
                        to choose.

           We don't yet know what happened in the other rooms, but Eric
           looks even more troubled. Whatever happened to him with
           Adriane, it has shaken him to the core.

           While Sabrina looks even more uneasy after her time with
           Andrew.

           Leonard glances at his watch as the seconds tick... Tick...
           Tick... Adriane tries to steady her breathing...

                                 LEONARD
                        I don't mean to rush you... But our
                        time is short.

                                 ADRIANE
                        You mean my time is fucking short.

           She turns to Eric. He can't meet her piercing gaze.

                                 ADRIANE
                        Don't make me do this...

           He doesn't respond. What does she mean?

                                 ADRIANE
                        Listen man, you and us and everyone
                        on this planet is gonna run out of
                        chances if you don't choose right
                        now!

                                 ANDREW
                        He doesn't believe you. None of us
                        believe you. Let your time run out,
                        we're not gonna do what you want.

                                 ADRIANE
                        Eric, this is your last chance...

           Her eyes plead with him. But he remains steadfast.

                                 LEONARD
                        Very well. Your second choice has
                        been made.
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEONARD (cont'd)
                                 (
                                  to Adriane
                                           )
                        I'm sorry.

           Wen clings to Eric, burying her head in his chest. Knowing
           what's coming.

           Leonard picks up his weapon. The sledgehammer head still
           coated with Redmond's dried blood. But Sabrina hesitates.

                                 ANDREW
                        You don't have to do this.

                                 LEONARD
                        Sabrina...

           Sabrina meets his gaze, conflicted. Then she obediently
           picks up her weapon.

                                 ANDREW
                        You don't have to do this!

           Leonard and Sabrina step to opposite sides of Adriane,
           taking deep, steadying breaths once again.

                                 ADRIANE
                        No, no, no, wait...

           We move in on her as tears well up in her eyes.

           AND WE ARE NOW IN ADRIANE'S PERSPECTIVE, SEEING HER STORY.

           She glances around, desperate, beginning to panic. Leonard
           and Sabrina step closer to her, weapons raised...

                                 ADRIANE
                        Please... I don't wanna die... I
                        don't wanna die...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. ADRIANE'S HOUSE -- EVENING (ADRIANE - 1 WEEK AGO)

           Adriane dabs her eyes with a dish towel, wiping the tears
           away. Then goes back to CHOPPING ONIONS. She's making
           fajitas with the finesse of a pro. The meat and vegetables
           sizzling in the pan. Looks so good you can taste it.

           She looks like a different person here, rested and carefree.

                                 MANUEL (O.S.)
                        Mama? Is it almost ready?

           Adriane smiles as MANUEL (5) comes in the back door.
                                 ADRIANE
                        You know it. Here, take these out.

           She hands him plates and silverware.

           EXT. BACK PATIO, ADRIANE'S HOUSE -- EVENING

           Adriane and Manuel sit at the table, eating the fajitas.
           It's a beautiful evening, the sky a tableau of colors.

           An AIRPLANE soars over them, flying low, en route to the
           nearby airport runway. Their modest suburban home is
           situated underneath the FLIGHT PATH, which for Adriane's son
           means constant entertainment.

                                 (
                                                  )
                                 MANUEL
                                  pointing to plane
                        I bet that one's coming from...
                        France! Or Italy!

                                 ADRIANE
                        Nah, that's a puddle jumper. I'm
                        thinkin'... Richmond. 

                                 MANUEL
                                 (
                                  re: the next
                                              plane)
                        Okay, that one's coming from...
                        Florida. Maybe someone brought an
                        alligator with them!

                                 ADRIANE
                        Actually that maple leaf probably
                        means it's coming from Canada, home
                        of your favorite maple syrup.

                                 MANUEL
                        Yes! Do you think we could have
                        waffles for dessert?

                                 ADRIANE
                                 (
                                  laughs
                                       )
                        No, no we cannot. But how about for
                        breakfast tomorrow. Deal?

           But Manuel's not listening... Eyes focused on the sky.

                                 ADRIANE
                        Honey?

                                 MANUEL
                        What's wrong with it?

           Adriane turns, following his gaze...
           Then she gasps as she recognizes the SMOKE TRAIL. AN
           AIRPLANE PLUMMETING TOWARDS THE GROUND in the distance.

                                 ADRIANE
                        Oh my God...

           Her jaw falls open as she sees a SECOND PLANE TRAILING SMOKE
           AND FALLING FROM THE SKY. Still distant, but closer to them.

                                 MANUEL
                        What's happening to them?!

                                 ADRIANE
                        I... I don't know --

           A SHRIEK OF GRINDING METAL above them. Adriane looks up --

           THERE'S A THIRD PLANE CRASHING RIGHT TOWARDS THEM.

           Adriane watches, paralyzed by the sight. Manuel screams --

           The plane CRASHES INTO A NEARBY HOUSE, sending out an
           ENORMOUS FIREBALL! Adriane wraps up Manuel as the FLAMES
           ENGULF THEM, OVERWHELMING THEIR SCREAMS --

                                                          SMASH BACK TO:

           Adriane still sitting on the patio.

                                 MANUEL
                        Mama? Mama, you okay?

           He stares at her quizzically. Adriane snaps around to look
           at the sky.

           But ALL THE PLANES ARE WHERE THEY’RE SUPPOSED TO BE, on
           their normal flight paths towards the airport.

                                 ADRIANE
                        It's... It's nothing. Mama's fine.

           She forces herself to pick up her fork and take a bite of
           food. But her hand is trembling.

           INT. KITCHEN, ADRIANE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Adriane leans against the counter, dirty dishes filling the
           sink in front of her, staring off in a daze.

           And once again, we hear the SAME WHISPERS that plagued
           Leonard, ECHOING AROUND HER.

           Adriane twitches one way. Then the other. Shakes her head,
           covers her ears, trying to drive the voices out.
                                 ADRIANE
                        No... No...

           But they persist... Incessant...

           INT. MANUEL'S ROOM, ADRIANE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           A nightlight projects stars across the ceiling, playing a
           soft lullaby. Manuel is fast asleep, curled up in bed.

           Adriane sits by his bedside. Gazing down at him with all of
           the love of a protective mother.

           But the whispers continue. Unrelenting.

           Adriane's hand trembles as she caresses Manuel's back. She
           blinks and tears run down her cheeks.

           But she sniffles hard and wipes her face. Then steadies her
           breathing, beginning to listen to the voices.

           INT. KITCHEN, CABIN -- DAY (ADRIANE - A FEW MINUTES AGO)

           Chop. Chop. Chop. Adriane slices another onion on a cutting
           board. She glances down at it, wiping her tears away,
           remembering...

           With a resolved breath, she sprinkles cubed onions over two
           restaurant-style sandwiches. Closes them up with another
           slice of bread and carries the plates into the --

           COMMON ROOM

           Where Eric has been pulled up to the table, hands still
           cuffed behind his back.

                                 ADRIANE
                        Didn't have a lot of options for
                        getting creative, but I'm betting
                        these will still be pretty good.
                        Someday you'll have to try my
                        fajitas. Will blow your mind.

           She sets a plate down in front of Eric and sits across from
           him. He glares back at her.

                                 ADRIANE
                        Eat up, man. No one makes good
                        decisions on an empty stomach.

           She picks up his sandwich and holds it out to him.

                                 ADRIANE
                        Come on... You must be starving.
           Eric turns away, refusing.

                                 ADRIANE
                        Listen, I know you think I'm batshit
                        crazy, but trust me, my food's top
                        notch.
                                 (
                                                     )
                                  takes a bite herself
                        Oh yeah... That's good. Seriously,
                        get in on this.

           But he won't look at her. Adriane chews and swallows. Sets
           the sandwich down.

                                 ADRIANE
                        Alright, I'm gonna level with you...
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        I'm the next one to go... I'm the
                        next sacrifice. So I'm counting on
                        you, man. You're like my last hope
                        here. I...

           A tinge of emotion breaks through.

                                 ADRIANE
                        I don't wanna die like Redmond did. I
                        don't wanna be butchered like some...
                        Like some animal.

                                 ERIC
                        Then maybe you should just leave.

                                 ADRIANE
                        I can't leave. None of this can stop
                        until you make a choice. Don't you
                        get that already? I mean, look at
                        me... Look at me.

           She waits until he does.

                                 ADRIANE
                        You think I wanna be here? I'm just
                        some fucking cook. But here I am,
                        begging you to do what has to be
                        done, 'cause if you don't, my son's
                        gonna die. Over the past few days,
                        I’ve had to watch him die over and
                        over and over again. I've watched my
                        little boy burned alive as I held him
                        in my arms. I can't get the sound of
                        his screams out of my head, even
                        right now. So as a mother... Believe
                        me when I tell you that this is
                        really happening. And it's up to you.
                                 ERIC
                        I won't do it...

                                 ADRIANE
                        You have to. Any moment now,
                        Leonard's gonna come up those
                        stairs... And then the next round
                        will begin. Unless you stop it.

           Eric breaks eye contact, defiant. Adriane sighs.

                                 ADRIANE
                        Listen... We're not supposed to hurt
                        any of you. We can't force you to
                        make a choice. I saw some crazy shit,
                        but I didn't see any visions like
                        that...
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        But that doesn't mean I won't do what
                        I have to do. You get me, Daddy Eric?

           A chill down Eric's spine.

                                 ADRIANE
                        I wanna be alive at the end of this.
                        I wanna be alive for my boy. So if I
                        have to hurt Andrew... Or Wen... If I
                        have to hurt them real fucking bad to
                        get you to do what has to be done,
                        I'll do it.

           She leans closer, whispering in his ear.

                                 ADRIANE
                        Don't back me into a corner. 'Cause
                        I'm telling ya, I'll fuckin' do it.
                        If I die, one of them dies with me.

           Eric takes a shaky breath.

           FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. Adriane turns to see Leonard coming
           up from the basement, dragging Wen along with him.

           And the sight of him makes Adriane turn pale.

           EXT. CABIN -- EVENING (BACK TO PRESENT)

           The sun has moved further across the sky, its light being
           gradually overtaken by the towering storm clouds.

           They're nearly upon us now...
           INT. COMMON ROOM, CABIN -- EVENING

           The tears are still wet on Adriane's cheeks as she glances
           from side to side. Leonard and Sabrina circle in around her
           with their medieval weapons. Their movements precise,
           ritualistic. Just like before.

                                 ADRIANE
                        Please... Oh God...

           She moves towards Eric, pleading with him. 

                                 ADRIANE
                        You're just gonna let this happen?!
                        Just gonna let thousands of more
                        people die?!

                                 ANDREW
                        Don't listen to her.

                                 ADRIANE
                        Oh, he's gonna listen to me! He's
                        gonna hear me scream and wail and
                        choke on my own blood, and I'll just
                        be the first of so many more!

           She glances at Leonard and Sabrina lurking behind her,
           clenching their weapons, getting ready to strike.

                                 ADRIANE
                        Oh, I'm sorry... You want me to put
                        my mask on first before you slaughter
                        me? Well, if that's how it's gotta
                        be. Gotta abide by the visions...

           She reaches into her pocket and pulls out her WHITE MASK --

           But then SHE PICKS UP HER WEAPON and lunges forward. SHE
           YANKS WEN TO HER FEET, AND HOLDS HER WEAPON TO WEN'S THROAT.

                                 ERIC / ANDREW
                        WEN! / LET HER GO!

           But they can't stop Adriane with their hands cuffed. Wen
           squirms and screams, but Adriane holds her tight. Leonard
           and Sabrina slow their advance, not expecting this.

                                 SABRINA
                        Adriane, stop!

                                 ADRIANE
                        Stay back! Stay back or I'll slice
                        her up!
                                 LEONARD
                        You can't do this. They need to make
                        a choice --

                                 ADRIANE
                        Sorry, but I don't want my blood and
                        guts spilled all over the floor!

                                 ERIC
                        Please don't hurt her...

                                 ANDREW
                        Leonard, fucking stop this!

                                 LEONARD
                        Adriane, just let her go... It can't
                        be like this... It won't stop --

                                 ADRIANE
                        They're just gonna wait us out till
                        we're all dead!

                                 LEONARD
                        They'll do the right thing... You'll
                        see...

                                 ADRIANE
                        Then why don't we trade places right
                        now and see if you still believe
                        that! 

                                 LEONARD
                        You'll ruin everything --

                                 ADRIANE
                        You're right, I'll ruin everything!
                        I'll damn it all to hell!
                                 (
                                  to Eric
                                        )
                        Unless you stop me right now. Come
                        on, Daddy Eric. It's up to you. Your
                        daughter or your husband.

           Eric meets her fiery gaze, breathing fast.

                                 ERIC
                        I... I can't...

                                 ADRIANE
                        You have three seconds to choose!

                                 ERIC
                        No... Please --
                                 ANDREW
                        Someone stop her!

                                 ADRIANE
                        Three...

           Everyone begins shouting, creating a CACOPHONY OF EMOTION
           AND VITRIOL. Eric caught in the middle of the maelstrom.

                                 ADRIANE
                        Two...

                                 ERIC
                        No, no, oh please God --

                                 ADRIANE
                        One...

                                 ERIC
                        STOP! I'LL DO IT!

           And just like that, EVERYONE GOES SILENT.

           Andrew turns to his husband, horrified.

                                 ANDREW
                        Do what?

           Eric doesn't answer. Can't look at him.

                                 ANDREW
                        Eric?

           Eric's gaze rises to meet the three intruders. But where he
           lacked conviction before, he has it now.

                                 ERIC
                        I'll do it. But only if Wen isn't in
                        the room.

           Adriane gives a small nod and moves Wen towards the bedroom.

                                 WEN
                        No!

           She tries to resist but Adriane pulls her along.

                                 WEN
                        No! Daddy Eric, don't do it! You
                        can't!

           Adriane pushes her into a bedroom, and closes the door,
           standing guard by it. Wen's cries echo from inside.
                                 ANDREW
                        Eric... You can't be... No...

           Andrew shakes his head, trying to come to grips with this.

                                 ANDREW
                        This is crazy... You know they're
                        crazy...

           Leonard pulls a SMALL KEY out of his pocket and UNLOCKS
           ERIC'S HANDCUFFS.

                                 ANDREW
                        You're my husband. I love you. Do you
                        hear me? I love you! We're a family!

           Adriane watches as Eric slowly rises from his chair. Relief
           sweeping through her. 

                                 LEONARD
                                 (
                                  to Sabrina
                                           )
                        Give him your weapon.

           Eric extends his hand towards her...

           But Sabrina hesitates. She looks down at the weapon in her
           hand, fingers locked around it in a death grip.

                                 ANDREW
                        Don't do it. Don't do it. Please.

                                 ADRIANE
                        Give him your fucking weapon,
                        Sabrina!

           But Sabrina doesn't move, conflict overwhelming her as she
           feels the weight of her choice. 

           AND NOW WE ARE IN SABRINA'S PERSPECTIVE. THIS IS HER STORY.

           Sabrina looks at Andrew sitting helpless in his chair. Then
           at the bloody weapon in her hand...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           The same weapon being SHARPENED WITH A METAL GRINDER.

           INT. GARAGE, SABRINA'S HOUSE -- DAY (SABRINA - 5 DAYS AGO)

           Sabrina stands in front of a workbench in her NURSING
           SCRUBS, illuminated by the SPARKS flying from the grinder.
           No conflict in her eyes, just focused intensity.
           We can't help but notice the jarring visual contrast. A
           nurse building something so horrific. She takes a break,
           wiping the sweat off her brow. Then listens as --

           The WHISPERS rise around her, unabated.

           She goes back to work.

           Then HER PHONE RINGS, sitting on the workbench nearby.
           Sabrina ignores it and keeps sharpening, just like she's
           supposed to. Ring... Ring... She glances over.

           "DAD" on the screen with a SMILING PICTURE of them together.
           Sabrina stares as it continues to ring.

           The WHISPERS GROW MORE INTENSE... She presses her grinder to
           the metal. Sparks continue to fly.

           Her phone chimes with a NEW VOICEMAIL.

           Sabrina tenses, resisting the urge. She steels herself. Then
           her phone chimes again.

           She drops the tool and grabs her phone. PLAYS THE MESSAGE.

                                 SABRINA'S DAD (FROM PHONE)
                        Sabrina, where in the world are you?!
                        I'm losing it here. You have to call
                        me, please. I just talked to your
                        boss at the hospital. She said you've
                        missed your last four shifts and
                        aren't returning her calls either.
                        What's happening? 

           Tears well up in Sabrina's eyes as she listens.

                                 SABRINA'S DAD (FROM PHONE)
                        I know you well enough to know that
                        something's very wrong. You have to
                        call me right now. If I don't hear
                        from you in the next hour, I'm going
                        to the airport and getting on a
                        flight out there to find you. If you
                        don't want to talk to me, that's
                        fine, but I have to know that you're
                        okay... I love you, no matter what. I
                        love you, Sabrina.

           The message ends. She lowers her phone, staring at the
           smiling image of her with her dad.
           EXT. BACK PORCH, SABRINA'S HOUSE -- DAY

           Sabrina steps out onto her porch. She takes deep breaths,
           trying to calm her anxiety as she looks out over the beach-
           side town and THE OCEAN IN THE DISTANCE. Hoping to find
           answers in its vastness.

           She unlocks her phone... Brings up her dad's number... Her
           thumb hovers over the "Call" button --

           But she's interrupted by a LOW RUMBLE. THE PORCH BEGINS TO
           TREMBLE BENEATH HER. DISTANT SCREAMS ECHO.

           Sabrina's gaze rises to the ocean... And sheer horror washes
           over her face...

           An ENORMOUS TSUNAMI approaches the shore at unbelievable
           speed... Careening towards her town.

           But she can't move, petrified by the sight. People run for
           their lives, grabbing loved ones, screaming in terror --

           And the CRASHING WATER OVERTAKES THEM. Their bodies flung
           about wildly, no way to survive.

           A moment later, SABRINA IS SWEPT AWAY IN THE DELUGE OF WATER
           that rips everything apart.

           INT. REDMOND'S TRUCK -- DAY (SABRINA - EARLIER TODAY)

           Sabrina sits in the backseat, in a daze. Staring out the
           window, watching the power lines go up and dip down, up and
           dip down.

           Redmond drives, Leonard and Adriane in the other seats. All
           dressed for their arrival at the cabin. Coldly focused.

           But Sabrina just stares away. Dreading what's to come.

           EXT. HIGHWAY -- DAY

           The truck suddenly pulls over. Sabrina opens her door before
           it's stopped and jumps out. SHE VOMITS into the dirt. More
           dry heaves follow, and then subside.

           She gathers herself, looking back. The others stare at her
           from inside the truck. She hesitates. 

           Then climbs back in. Pulling the car door closed --

           INT. BEDROOM, CABIN -- DAY (SABRINA - A FEW MINUTES AGO)

           The bedroom door closes. Sabrina's hand on the knob.
           She stands there for a moment, troubled by her thoughts.
           Then lets them pass as she takes a seat on the bed, facing
           Andrew, his hands still cuffed behind his chair. Just the
           two of them in here now.

                                 ANDREW
                        Look, I don't know what your plan is,
                        but you're wasting your time.

                                 SABRINA
                        Oh don't worry, I know you're too
                        closed-minded to ever open your eyes.
                        I'm just babysitting you while the
                        others talk sense into Eric and Wen.

                                 ANDREW
                        It'll never work.

                                 SABRINA
                        We'll see.

                                 ANDREW
                        You know, I've been wondering... What
                        happens when the clock ticks down to
                        sunset, and you're wrong?

                                 SABRINA
                        What happens when the clock ticks
                        down to sunset, and we're right?

           Andrew chuckles, shaking his head.

                                 ANDREW
                        I feel sorry for you. Not the others,
                        but I really, truly feel sorry for
                        you. I mean, you're a nurse, right.
                        You're someone who's trained to catch
                        mental illness. I mean, what the hell
                        happened to you? 

           Sabrina bristles, not liking where this is going.

                                 ANDREW
                        Your whole job is to heal people. To
                        save lives. And now you're here.

                                 SABRINA
                        We told you. We don't have a choice.

                                 ANDREW
                        And you really believe that?

                                 SABRINA
                        Yes. I do.
           But her confidence is waning.

                                 ANDREW
                        Bullshit. You're no harbinger of the
                        apocalypse. You're a nurse with
                        schizophrenia.

                                 SABRINA
                        I've seen plenty of schizophrenics.
                        There's a big difference between a
                        delusion and a vision.

                                 ANDREW
                        I'd call it more of a fine line. Or
                        more likely, no line at all.

                                 SABRINA
                        What are the chances four people had
                        the exact same visions?

                                 ANDREW
                        What are the chances one person had a
                        delusion and convinced others it was
                        real? I'd say that's a hell of a lot
                        more plausible.

                                 SABRINA
                        Now that's bullshit.

                                 ANDREW
                        Then how come you never told us how
                        you met?

                                 SABRINA
                        We met this morning. At a boardwalk
                        on the coast.

                                 ANDREW
                        So you came all the way across the
                        country from California... Randomly
                        showed up on a boardwalk... And just
                        happened to find three other people
                        dressed in jeans and fancy shirts who
                        were all ready for the apocalypse?

           Sabrina averts his accusatory gaze.

                                 ANDREW
                        You met before, didn't you?

                                 SABRINA
                        It doesn't matter.
                                 ANDREW
                        I'd say it matters a lot. Leonard
                        said we deserved to know who you
                        were.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        All I want to know is how you all
                        first met. It's a simple question.

           Sabrina hesitates.

                                 SABRINA
                        It was... It was on a forum.

                                 ANDREW
                        A forum? You mean, like, an internet
                        forum? Are you fucking kidding me?

                                 SABRINA
                        I told you it didn't matter.

                                 ANDREW
                        Oh it matters. It matters a lot. This
                        is all starting to make sense...

                                 SABRINA
                        Just stop talking. I shouldn't have
                        told you.

                                 ANDREW
                        You were suffering, right? Seeing
                        horrible things. Hearing horrible
                        things. Sound familiar?

           She looks away, refusing to engage.

                                 ANDREW
                        But instead of seeking professional
                        help, you went online. Then you found
                        a couple others who had the same kind
                        of delusions as you did. You became
                        your own echo chamber, and it got
                        worse and worse, until here we are.

                                 SABRINA
                        That's not what happened.

                                 ANDREW
                        It's not? Because it happens like
                        that all the time. That's why you
                        hear about some soldier killing
                        people on his base because he spent
                        all his time on a message board where
                        everyone thought there was a shadow
                        government stalking them.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDREW (cont'd)
                                           ought Hillary
                        Or why someone th
                        Clinton was running a pedophile ring
                        out of a pizza parlor and decided to
                        go shoot it up. Or a nurse comes to
                        believe that the apocalypse is coming
                        and she has to stop it. It's a shared
                        delusion.

                                 SABRINA
                        None of that has anything to do with
                        this!

                                 ANDREW
                        I don't think you really believe
                        that. I think you have doubts.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        I saw the tears in your eyes when you
                        were cleaning up Redmond's blood. Not
                        exactly the mark of a true believer.

                                 SABRINA
                        It doesn't mean I have to like what's
                        happening.

                                 ANDREW
                        You're not like the others. You want
                        to believe... But you know in your
                        heart that what you're doing here is
                        wrong and evil. You know it.

           Sabrina doesn't respond. Can't look him in the eye.

           INT. COMMON ROOM, CABIN -- EVENING (BACK TO PRESENT)

           Sabrina averts everyone's gaze as she stares at the weapon
           in her hand. Eric opens his hand, waiting for her.

                                 LEONARD
                        Give it to him, Sabrina.

           But she's still hesitant, she doesn't want this...

                                 ADRIANE
                        Give it to him!

           Sabrina looks to Andrew, whose hands are still cuffed behind
           the chair.

                                 ANDREW
                        Don't... You're better than this...

           She wavers, half of her believing him... 

           But then she extends her arm, holding out her weapon.
           Eric takes it and their eyes meet. She silently begs him not
           to go through with it... But then he moves behind Andrew,
           weapon in hand.

                                 ANDREW
                        Eric, for God's sake, listen to me!
                        You can't do this! I know you don't
                        believe them!

           Eric eyes HOW SHARP THE BLADE IS. The other three watch his
           every move, waiting for the inevitable.

                                 ANDREW
                        None of this is real! They weren't
                        called here by some shared vision.
                        They met on a fucking online forum!
                        They're insane!

           But Eric is unaffected by the news. He tightens his grip on
           the weapon. Steadies his breathing, preparing himself.

           Sabrina looks away, unable to watch.

                                 ANDREW
                        Please Eric, I love you! Do you hear
                        me? I love you, Eric! You can't...
                        You can't!

                                 ERIC
                        I love you too... Always.

           Eric lifts the weapon high... ANDREW SCREAMS AS ERIC SWINGS
           THE BLADE DOWN --

           AND CUTS CLEAN THROUGH ANDREW'S HANDCUFF CHAIN! It snaps in
           two, setting him free!

                                 ERIC
                        Get the gun! Get the gun!

           For the briefest moment, everyone is too stunned to realize
           what just happened...

           THEN ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.

           ANDREW RUNS FOR THE FRONT DOOR. Eric thrusts his weapon at
           Leonard, HITTING HIM IN THE GUT WITH THE BLUNT END. He
           swings it at Adriane, nearly taking her head off.

           Sabrina stands frozen, watching as Andrew runs out the door.

           Then she races out after him --
           EXT. CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

           The sunlight is fading as Sabrina comes outside. She quickly
           picks up REDMOND'S WEAPON off the porch and looks ahead --

           Andrew is nearly to their SUV. The TIRES HAVE BEEN SLASHED,
           the deflated wheels sitting on the rims. Andrew yanks open
           the SUV's door. About to climb in --

           But Sabrina closes the distance and swings her weapon,
           CLOBBERING THE BACK OF HIS KNEE. Andrew cries out in pain as
           he falls to the ground.

           Sabrina stands over him. She could kill him right now if she
           wanted to.

                                 SABRINA
                        This is all real, no matter what you
                        say...

           Andrew clenches his teeth as he clutches his already
           SWELLING KNEE. She extends her hand to him.

                                 SABRINA
                        Come on. We still need you.

           Andrew raises a hand to acquiesce and cautiously moves to
           get to his feet --

           But he suddenly throws a HANDFUL OF DIRT IN SABRINA'S FACE
           with his other hand. Then PUNCHES HER IN THE STOMACH,
           DOUBLING HER OVER.

           Sabrina gasps for breath, the wind knocked out of her as
           Andrew pulls himself into the SUV. Sabrina lunges for him --

           HE CLOSES THE DOOR JUST IN TIME. She yanks on the handle but
           he's locked it shut.

           She lets out a cry of frustration and SMASHES HER WEAPON
           INTO THE WINDOW. The glass spiderwebs, but doesn't break.
           Through the cracked glass, she can see Andrew frantically
           digging out a GUN CASE in the cargo area.

           Sabrina smashes the window again with the weapon and THE
           GLASS SHATTERS, showering Andrew in shards. But he's focused
           on the gun case.

           Sabrina reaches in, pops the lock, and yanks the door open.

                                 SABRINA
                        We don't have time for this!
           CLINKING METAL as Andrew fumbles with bullets, trying to
           load his gun.

           SABRINA SHOVES HER WEAPON IN, JABBING ANDREW IN HIS SIDE
           WITH THE BLUNT END. The bullets spill out of his hand as he
           cries out.

                                 SABRINA
                        Get out, now! 

           SABRINA JABS HIM AGAIN, but Andrew doesn't surrender, still
           trying to load the gun. Sabrina flips her weapon around to
           the sharp end --

                                 SABRINA
                        I don't want it to be like this!

           But ANDREW TURNS OVER WITH THE GUN IN HAND --

           BANG!

           THE BULLET HITS THE CEILING JUST ABOVE SABRINA'S HEAD, the
           explosive sound surprising both of them.

           Sabrina stumbles back as Andrew steadies his grip on the
           gun, aiming at her.

                                 ANDREW
                        Now you listen to me, you crazy
                        fucking bitch. Drop that thing and
                        back the fuck up.

                                 SABRINA
                        Okay... Okay...

                                 ANDREW
                        BACK THE FUCK UP!

           Sabrina shuffles back, knowing the tide has turned. She
           lowers her weapon, but doesn't drop it.

           Still holding the gun, Andrew maneuvers to get out of the
           SUV, face contorting with pain due to his SWELLING KNEE.

                                 ANDREW
                        Keep going! Move!

           Sabrina takes another step back. And another.

           Andrew cringes as he moves through the broken glass --

           SABRINA TURNS AND RUNS AWAY towards the forest.
           Andrew struggles to get out of the SUV, his KNEE ALMOST
           GIVING OUT UNDER HIM. He winces, aiming his gun --

                                 ANDREW
                        Stop! Stop!

           Sabrina doesn't look back. Andrew balances his weight on his
           good leg, taking aim --

           BANG! The bullet just misses her. But the recoil from the
           shot causes Andrew to lose his balance and fall.

           He looks up just as Sabrina disappears into the trees.

                                 ANDREW
                        Fuck!

           He grimaces, clutching his swelling knee, gritting through
           it. NOW WE STAY WITH ANDREW. THIS IS HIS STORY.

           Andrew struggles to get back to his feet. Grabbing hold of
           the SUV and pulling himself up, every movement causing him
           pain. He looks out to the trees. No sign of Sabrina.

           He limps forward, cringing, feet crunching on broken glass.
           The sound makes him look down --

           At the JAGGED PIECES OF GLASS scattered across the ground...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           THE CLINK OF GLASS MUGS as we find ourselves in --

           INT. DIVE BAR -- NIGHT (ANDREW - 8 YEARS AGO)

           Andrew and Eric toast their beers and drink. Each of their
           hairstyles a little different. As they set down their mugs,
           they both smile elatedly.

                                 ERIC
                        I can't believe we're actually gonna
                        do this.

                                 ANDREW
                        But you're excited, right?

                                 ERIC
                        Of course. I'm over the moon.

                                 ANDREW
                        You're freaking out, aren't you?
                                 ERIC
                        It's just... What if some huge
                        project comes up at work, or one of
                        us gets laid off --

                                 ANDREW
                        The timing's never gonna be just
                        right. Everyone says becoming a
                        parent is the most terrifying thing
                        you can ever do. So I say let's be
                        terrified together. 

           He takes Eric's hand, squeezing it. Eric smiles, reassured.

                                 DRUNK (O.S.)
                        Get outta here with that shit!

           Andrew and Eric turn, seeing a DRUNK (40s) holding a cheap
           beer bottle glaring at them.

                                 DRUNK
                        Do your gay thing behind closed
                        doors, you hear me? Not out here in
                        the open. Makes us all sick.

                                 ERIC
                        It's a free country, sir. If you'd
                        kindly mind your own business, we'll
                        mind ours.

                                 DRUNK
                        It ain't a free country for faggots.

                                 ANDREW
                        Actually it is. Unfortunately, it's
                        also a free country for ignorant
                        morons who waste their time getting
                        drunk and hating others instead of
                        fixing their own sorry ass lives.

           The Drunk glares at him. But Andrew stands his ground.

                                 DRUNK
                        Fuck you.

           He turns and wanders away. Andrew smirks. 

                                 ERIC
                        You shouldn't provoke them.

                                 ANDREW
                        I wasn't provoking. I was telling the
                        truth. And the truth hurts sometimes.
           THE DRUNK SUDDENLY SMASHES HIS BEER BOTTLE OVER ANDREW'S
           HEAD. Andrew collapses off his stool while Eric leaps to his
           aid. PATRONS grab the Drunk, pulling him away.

                                 ERIC
                        Andrew! Andrew!

           Andrew's out cold, a GASH STREAMING BLOOD on his head.

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM, HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

           Andrew sits on a bed with a DOCTOR STITCHING UP THE CUT ON
           HIS HEAD. Eric beside him, holding his hand tight.

           But Andrew's brooding. A simmering resentment bubbling
           within him...

           INT. GUN STORE -- DAY

           A CLERK sets a HANDGUN on the glass counter over a display
           case full of GUNS.

           ANDREW PICKS IT UP. Tests the weight of it in his hands.
           Flips open the cylinder. Flips it closed. Feels good.

           But then he hesitates, looking at the gun in his hand. Is he
           really going to do this?

                                 ANDREW
                        Yeah. I'll take this one.

           INT. ANDREW & ERIC'S BEDROOM -- DAY (ANDREW - EARLIER TODAY)

           Andrew closes up two suitcases spread across the bed, all
           packed up for their trip to the cabin.

                                 ERIC (O.S.)
                        You need a hand with those? I packed
                        for every possible weather condition.

                                 ANDREW
                                 (
                                  smiles
                                       )
                        Nah, I got 'em. You just worry about
                        capturing that rambunctious panda of
                        ours and getting her in her car seat.

           Sounds of Wen laughing and Eric chasing after her from a
           nearby room. Andrew chuckles as he picks up the suitcases.

           But he stops as a new thought comes over him. He glances
           back down the hall towards the sounds of Eric and Wen, but
           neither is in sight.
           He sets down the suitcases and opens the closet door.
           Reaches up to the top shelf and pulls out a small GUN SAFE.
           Looks it over, hesitating. Yeah... Just in case. He tucks it
           into his suitcase, out of sight.

           EXT. CABIN -- EVENING (BACK TO PRESENT)

           Andrew clenches that SAME GUN as he limps towards the cabin,
           favoring his good leg.

           What was once a quaint vacation home now feels like a
           foreboding haunted house under the murky gray sky. THUNDER
           CRASHES as the WIND HOWLS.

           Andrew passes by Wen's jar of grasshoppers, still where she
           left it. But the grasshoppers aren't moving anymore.

           Andrew eyes the BLOOD SOAKED SHEET covering Redmond's
           carcass on the porch. A TRAIL OF BLOOD leading from the body
           to the front door. Pieces of broken glass and splintered
           wood mixed in.

                                 ERIC (O.S.)
                        Stay back! Stay away!

           Andrew forces himself to go faster. He pushes the door open,
           gun at the ready as he moves back into --

           INT. COMMON ROOM, CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

           Where he's met with a chaotic scene. Eric swings Sabrina's
           weapon wildly, keeping Leonard and Adriane at a distance.

                                 ERIC
                        Stay back! 

                                 LEONARD
                        It's okay... We just wanna talk...
                        That's all...

           Leonard raises his hands in a gesture of peace, but he
           continues to stalk closer to Eric. Adriane approaches from
           the other side, weapon in hand, ready to strike.

           Andrew aims his gun at Adriane --

                                 ANDREW
                        Drop it!

           Adriane and Leonard look over, surprised to see the gun.

                                 ANDREW
                        Drop it now! Do it!
                                 LEONARD
                        Where's Sabrina?

                                 ANDREW
                        Drop the goddamn weapon!

           Adriane makes a show of lowering her weapon to the ground,
           then drops it with a loud clang.

                                 LEONARD
                        You're dooming us all, Andrew. You're
                        dooming your husband. You're dooming
                        your daughter --

                                 ANDREW
                        Shut the fuck up!

           He shifts aim to Leonard, who doesn't flinch.

                                 ANDREW
                        I'm done with you! I'm not listening
                        to another goddamn word you say!

                                 LEONARD
                        Just wait --

                                 ANDREW
                        Shut your mouth or I'll put a bullet
                        through it!

           His finger is on the trigger. Leonard doesn't move a muscle.

           Adriane watches, hands slowly lowering towards her weapon...

           A GUST OF WIND BILLOWS A CURTAIN to Andrew's side... He
           turns for the briefest moment --

           ADRIANE SCOOPS UP HER WEAPON AND CHARGES TOWARDS ANDREW FROM
           HIS BLIND SIDE.

                                 ERIC
                        Andrew --

           Andrew spins as SHE SWINGS AT HIM --

           BANG! THE BULLET HITS ADRIANE IN THE CHEST, sending her
           crashing onto the floor.

           Leonard rushes to her. Putting a hand on the wound, trying
           to stop the rush of blood.

                                 LEONARD
                        Shh... Just breathe. Breathe...
           Andrew looks down at her, watching as she clings to life.
           Her eyes meet his as she struggles to speak.

                                 ADRIANE
                        You know... You know what the worst
                        part is...

           Her bloody hand reaches out for her fallen weapon.

                                 ADRIANE
                        ... I knew I was dead as soon as I
                        started seeing all this shit. I knew
                        I was dead already.

           Her hand tightens around her weapon and SHE SUDDENLY SITS UP
           with a jolt towards Andrew --

           BANG! ADRIANE'S THROAT EXPLODES IN A GEYSER OF BLOOD,
           spraying Leonard as she collapses. She squirms, gurgling, as
           blood drains out of her... Until her body is still.

           Andrew and Eric stand frozen, staring at her dead body.

           But as Leonard looks into Adriane's lifeless eyes, his
           breaths quicken. And we see something new in him... Rage.

           With a thunderous yell, he charges at Andrew --

           Andrew tries to raise his gun, but LEONARD BULLDOZES INTO
           HIM, SLAMMING HIM AGAINST THE WALL.

           Leonard grabs hold of the gun, but Andrew hangs on as the
           two of them STRUGGLE VIOLENTLY FOR CONTROL OF IT.

           Eric races to Andrew's aid. But Leonard yanks the gun
           backwards -- CRACK! HIS ELBOW CLOBBERS ERIC IN THE JAW,
           dropping Eric to the ground, clutching his face.

           Amidst the struggle, the bedroom door opens...

           And WEN STEPS OUT.

           Andrew hangs onto the gun as Leonard tries to pry it away,
           pinning Andrew against the wall, smashing him into it over
           and over again.

                                 WEN
                        Stop! You're hurting him! Stop!

           Leonard looks back, momentarily distracted by her voice --

           And Andrew drops to his knees, causing Leonard to lose his
           balance and fall forward, HIS HEAD COLLIDING WITH THE WALL.
           Andrew tightens his grip on the gun, swinging it towards
           Leonard. But Leonard won't let go of it.

                                 WEN
                        Stop it! Stop!

           Leonard tries to pull the gun free, yanking Andrew's arms up
           and down, side to side, both still clinging to the gun --

           BANG!

           Everyone freezes in horror. Then turns as --

           WEN'S SMALL BODY CRUMPLES TO THE FLOOR. Blood spilling from
           the bullet wound in her chest.

           Time seems to stand still. Disbelief all over Andrew and
           Eric's faces.

           Then the reality hits. They run to Wen, holding her in their
           arms, screaming, crying.

                                 ANDREW
                        WEN! WEN! Wake up baby! You're okay,
                        please be okay! Wen!

                                 ERIC
                        OH GOD, NO! WEN! OH PLEASE GOD NO!

           Then they're just screaming. Indiscernible moans and cries.
           Agony that no parent should ever feel.

           Leonard watches, devastated. He collapses to his hands and
           knees, overcome with grief.

                                 LEONARD
                        I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

           He repeats the words again and again.

           Sabrina hurries back in through the open front door. But she
           stops in her tracks, taking in the horrific scene. Her
           weapon falls from her hand.

           She rushes to Wen's side, going into nurse mode. Checking
           for a pulse. Trying to stop the bleeding. But Wen's eyes
           remain open. Unblinking.

           Andrew and Eric cling to her body, screaming between sobs.

           Leonard forces himself to take deep breaths. Wills himself
           to crawl to Adriane's body. Takes her head in his hands.
                                 LEONARD
                        I'm sorry.

           He retrieves her WHITE MASK from her pocket. Gently slides
           it over her face. It remains remarkably white, in spite of
           the pool of blood beneath her.

           ANDREW rises to his feet, gun still in hand. He limps
           towards Leonard, hatred in his eyes.

                                 ANDREW
                        Get up. Get up!

                                 LEONARD
                        I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm so --

           ANDREW CRACKS LEONARD IN THE JAW WITH THE GUN, laying him
           out on the floor.

           Sabrina watches, not interfering. She can't help but look at
           Eric, holding little Wen in his arms, continuing to sob.

           Andrew grabs an upended chair and sets it upright. Points
           his gun at Leonard.

                                 ANDREW
                        Get up, you son of a bitch. Sit in
                        that chair and don't fucking move.

           Leonard struggles into the chair, still dazed. Andrew grabs
           a pair of fallen HANDCUFFS, pulls Leonard's arms behind the
           chair, and cuffs his wrists. Leonard doesn't resist.

                                 LEONARD
                        It's not your fault. It was an
                        accident. It just went off --

                                 ANDREW
                        Stop talking!

           Andrew points his gun at Sabrina, ushering her to move.

                                 ANDREW
                        Get in that other chair and don't
                        move or I'll blow your head off.

           Sabrina does as she's told. Andrew reaches into their
           satchel and pulls out another pair of HANDCUFFS. Uses them
           to cuff Sabrina's hands behind the chair.

                                 LEONARD
                        You don't have to worry about me
                        doing anything. But we have to check.
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEONARD (cont'd)
                        We have to check if Wen's death is
                        enough to stop the end.

           Andrew turns, becoming more incensed.

                                 ANDREW
                        What did you just say?

                                 LEONARD
                        It had to be a choice. A willing
                        sacrifice. Wen's death... She might
                        not count.

                                 ANDREW
                        She doesn't count? She doesn't
                        fucking count?!

           Andrew presses his gun against Leonard's temple and PULLS
           THE TRIGGER --

           CLICK. CLICK. He keeps pulling the trigger, but the gun is
           empty. Leonard just stares back at him, not blinking.

           Andrew throws the gun down. Then picks up Leonard's
           SLEDGEHAMMER. He steps towards Leonard and raises the
           sledgehammer high --

           Leonard merely closes his eyes, accepting what's to come.

           But Andrew hesitates. He just can't bring himself to do it.
           The sledgehammer slides from his fingers, falling to the
           ground with a loud clang.

           Andrew breathes heavy, glaring at Leonard.

           Then turns, seeing Eric still holding Wen's little body in
           his arms. The sight almost makes Andrew break down again.

                                 ANDREW
                        Eric, let's go. Let's get out of here
                        and never come back.

           Eric looks up, still shell-shocked.

                                 LEONARD
                        Eric... Turn on the TV.

                                 ANDREW
                        We're not turning it on! Eric, come
                        on. Let's take Wen and go.

           But Eric doesn't move, conflicted.
                                 ANDREW
                        Eric?

                                 LEONARD
                        We have to know if we stopped it. We
                        have to know if your daughter's death
                        was part of something greater. We
                        need to know if she saved the world.

           Andrew crouches down next to Eric, taking his hand.

                                 ANDREW
                        Please, let's just go. Let's get out
                        of here and bury our daughter --

                                 ERIC
                        Oh God!

           Eric begins FRANTICALLY SWATTING THE AIR OVER AND AROUND
           WEN'S BODY. Andrew stares at him, baffled by the sight.

                                 ERIC
                        Get away! Get away from her!

                                 ANDREW
                        What? What is it?

                                 ERIC
                        I'm getting them off her! I want them
                        off her!

                                 ANDREW
                        Getting what off her?

                                 ERIC
                        The flies!

                                 ANDREW
                        The what?

                                 ERIC
                        The flies!

           Andrew looks around. THERE AREN'T ANY FLIES. Not a single
           one. But Eric manically waves his hands around Wen's body.
           What the hell is he seeing?!

                                 LEONARD
                        Eric... Turn on the TV.

                                 ANDREW
                        We're not turning it on! Eric, there
                        aren't any flies. There's nothing
                        there. Let's go!
           But Eric doesn't move. Still fighting off the flies that
           only he can see. THUNDER CRASHES, right above them now.

                                 LEONARD
                        Remember what I said, Eric. The
                        oceans will rise. The cities will
                        drown. And a plague will descend.

           That clicks with Eric. He grabs the remote and TURNS ON THE
           TV --

           ON SCREEN: CNN. Images of an Asian City - bustling markets,
           crowded sidewalks, packed subways.

                                 ANDREW
                        Why'd you do that?

           Eric doesn't respond.

                                 ANDREW
                        Eric? Why'd you turn it on?

           ON SCREEN: Back to a NEWS ANCHOR. A caption reads - "CITY
           ZERO: HONG KONG AND THE FIGHT AGAINST THE BIRD FLU."

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)
                        ...Surging number of H5N1 bird flu
                        cases in Hong Kong over the past four
                        months, with a rapidly increasing
                        mortality rate that has crossed sixty
                        percent. Doctors believed they had
                        the virus contained...

           Eric stares in disbelief. Andrew eyes him, growing more
           concerned.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)
                        But now an explosion of bird flu
                        infections are being reported as far
                        away as England, India, South Africa,
                        and Tennessee, sparking fears of a
                        worldwide pandemic.

           ON SCREEN: Images of PATIENTS IN HOSPITAL BEDS, CROWDED NEXT
           TO EACH OTHER. Hooked up to every life support system
           available. Skin pale, eyes bloodshot. En route to death.

                                 LEONARD
                        We didn't stop it...

                                 ANDREW
                        Turn it off, Eric.
                                 ERIC
                        He said there'd be a plague...

                                 LEONARD
                        Wen's death was an accident. You
                        didn't choose to make a sacrifice.
                        The only way to stop it is to
                        willingly make a sacrifice.

           Sabrina watches, shaking her head in disbelief.

                                 SABRINA
                        This isn't right...

                                 ANDREW
                        Eric, there've been stories about the
                        bird flu for years. This isn't a
                        plague.

                                 ERIC
                        But it started in Hong Kong. Of all
                        the cities. That's where we met Wen. 
                        Hong Kong is our city.

                                 ANDREW
                        That doesn't have anything to do with
                        this.

                                 SABRINA
                        None of this is right...

                                 ANDREW
                        Eric, listen to me, we have to go
                        right now.

           But Eric doesn't move.

                                 ERIC
                        I... I saw something after Redmond
                        died. There was something in the
                        light. A figure.

                                 ANDREW
                        You have a concussion!

                                 ERIC
                        There was a presence. And I felt it
                        again when Adriane and Wen died.

                                 ANDREW
                        It was a hallucination. Listen, we
                        can't argue with each other. It's
                        what they want. Now please, let's go.
           Eric hesitates. Then MUTES THE TV, but doesn't turn it off.
           The horrible images continue to play.

                                 ERIC
                        I just need a minute, okay.

                                 ANDREW
                        Eric --

                                 ERIC
                        Just one minute!

           Eric's sharp tone catches Andrew off guard. Eric gazes at
           Wen with a sadness that will last forever.

                                 ERIC
                        It has to mean something. Our little
                        girl... It has to mean something.

           Everyone watches as he holds her in his arms.

                                 SABRINA
                        None of this is right. It should be
                        over. What kind of god wants this?
                        Demands this?

           Her question hangs.

                                 LEONARD
                        The one we have.

                                 SABRINA
                        Then maybe the world should end, if
                        it's meant to be like this.

                                 ANDREW
                        Shut up or I'll kill you both.

           Sabrina hesitates. Then looks up to him.

                                 SABRINA
                        I know you don't trust me. But if you
                        let me... I'll help you get out of
                        here.

           This gets everyone's attention.

                                 LEONARD
                        Sabrina? You can't --

                                 SABRINA
                        If a little girl dies and nothing
                        changes, I want no part of this. I
                        don't believe in this kind of god.
                                 ANDREW
                        We don't need your help.

                                 SABRINA
                        Yes you do. You can barely walk and
                        your husband has a concussion. You
                        won't make it far on foot, especially
                        if you're carrying Wen. But I can
                        take you to Redmond's truck.

                                 ANDREW
                        We'll find it ourselves.

                                 SABRINA
                        The keys are hidden under a rock on
                        the side of the road. You'll never
                        find them without me.

                                 LEONARD
                        You can't do this. They have to make
                        a choice. There's barely any time
                        left!

                                 SABRINA
                        Then we'll run out of time!
                                 (
                                  to Eric
                                        )
                        Trust the process. Please.

           Andrew turns to Eric.

                                 ANDREW
                        If we listen to her, will you leave
                        right now?

           Eric nods.

           Andrew picks up the handcuff key that had fallen in the
           earlier melee. Steps behind Sabrina, unlocking her cuffs.

                                 ANDREW
                        If you test me, it won't end well for
                        you.

           The cuffs click open. She doesn't make a break for it or try
           to attack him. She just stands up.

                                 SABRINA
                        Grab something to wrap up your
                        daughter.

           Andrew stares at her, not knowing if he can trust her. But
           then he limps towards the bathroom.
                                 LEONARD
                        Sabrina, don't do this... You can't
                        leave... We've come too far... We've
                        all sacrificed so much.

           Andrew grabs a large towel off the rack. Brings it to where
           Eric and Wen are, bending down alongside them.

                                 LEONARD
                        Once the sun sets, it's over for
                        everyone. You know it. You know it!

           Andrew and Eric gently wrap up Wen's body in the towel. It's
           so painful for them, more tears rising.

                                 LEONARD
                        Sabrina, you may try to resist, but I
                        know you still feel it. And it's not
                        gonna go away. It's never gonna go
                        away until they do what we were sent
                        here for!

           The sound of METAL SCRAPING against the wooden floor. Andrew
           and Eric look up to see --

           SABRINA PICKING UP ADRIANE'S WEAPON. Leonard merely closes
           his eyes as SHE SWINGS IT AT HIS HEAD --

           AND BLOOD SPLATTERS ACROSS SABRINA'S FACE AND SHIRT. She
           keeps swinging, again and again, eyes focused. All the
           while, Leonard remains silent. We only hear the splat of his
           blood and the crunch of his bones.

           Until Sabrina stops swinging. Her breathing steadies. She
           drops her weapon.

                                 SABRINA
                        The third choice has been made.

           Andrew and Eric stare at what's left of Leonard. His scalp
           mashed. White shirt now crimson.

           Sabrina digs into Leonard's pocket and pulls out his WHITE
           MASK. Stretches it over his bloody face. A shaky gasp
           escapes her. She backs away, horrified by what she's done.
           Another CRASH OF THUNDER rumbles through the cabin.

           Then she realizes something. With trembling hands, she picks
           up the remote, and turns up the volume.

           ON SCREEN: The report continues on the bird flu. But then a
           BREAKING NEWS BULLETIN FLASHES.

           Andrew's eyes widen. This can't be happening...
           ON SCREEN: The SMOLDERING WRECK OF AN AIRPLANE. An aerial
           shot of debris scattered in a suburban neighborhood as black
           smoke rises from billowing flames.

           Then the SCREEN SPLITS -- Showing MULTIPLE CRASH SITES WITH
           DIFFERENT SMOLDERING PLANES.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        We're just getting word that as many
                        as seventeen airplanes have crashed
                        without warning, and without issuing
                        any distress calls...

                                 ERIC
                        Then the skies will fall and crash to
                        the ground like pieces of glass...

           Andrew watches, jaw hanging open. This time, there's no
           quick retort from him.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        Little is known about the cause of
                        these crashes at this time, but
                        aviation experts are already
                        beginning to speculate that this
                        could possibly be a coordinated cyber
                        attack on the planes' --

           Andrew picks up Leonard's sledgehammer and lets out a yell
           as he SWINGS IT AT THE TV, SHATTERING THE SCREEN IN A SHOWER
           OF SPARKS.

           He turns to Eric and Sabrina. Sledgehammer in hand.

                                 ANDREW
                        We're leaving. Now.

           But Eric doesn't move. His eyes haven't drifted from where
           the TV used to sit.

                                 ERIC
                        We have a choice to make...

           Andrew steps in front of Eric and takes his shoulders.

                                 ANDREW
                        Listen to me... I just want to get
                        out of this cabin so we can bury
                        Wen... Please, let's just bury our
                        daughter. Make that choice with me.

           Eric blinks, coming out of his daze. He looks Andrew in the
           eye... Then looks down at Wen's body.
           EXT. CABIN -- EVENING

           Sabrina steps out, followed by Eric carrying Wen's body,
           wrapped in the towel. Andrew limps behind them, gun in hand.
           They all stop on the porch, staring up at the --

           VIOLENT STORM CLOUDS filling the sky. Rain falls, lightning
           flashes, and thunder roars. Trees creak under an onslaught
           of wind. ONLY A FAINT HINT OF SUNLIGHT left on the horizon.

           Eric moves forward with purpose, holding Wen's body tightly
           as he walks. Andrew limps behind.

           He stops at their SUV and opens the back door. Picks up
           several BULLETS he dropped earlier. RELOADS THE GUN as he
           hobbles to catch up.

           The three of them head down the gravel road towards the
           forest. IT BEGINS TO RAIN. Andrew looks up, letting the
           drops wash the blood from his face. He glances back --

           At the cabin. Once so peaceful... And now so horrific.

           Then he continues after the others.

           EXT. FOREST ROAD -- EVENING

           RAIN POURS as the three of them walk down the muddy path.
           Andrew and Eric side by side with Sabrina ahead.

           Andrew looks up at the GRAY AND PURPLE STORM CLOUDS, roiling
           angrily. He quickly looks down and keeps walking.

                                 ANDREW
                        How much further is it?

                                 SABRINA
                        Not far.

           Andrew eyes the blood-soaked towel in Eric's arms.

                                 ANDREW
                        I can carry her for a bit.

           Eric shakes his head no, mind swirling just like the storm
           clouds above.

                                 ANDREW
                        What is it?

                                 ERIC
                        Leonard was right. We haven't stopped
                        it yet...
                                 ANDREW
                        You're not thinking straight.

                                 ERIC
                        Everything that he said would happen
                        has happened. You just don't want to
                        believe it.

                                 ANDREW
                        All I want is to get to that truck
                        and bury our daughter.

           Eric stops, facing Andrew. Sabrina turns, watching them.

                                 ERIC
                        Do you really think that everything
                        that's happened today, everything
                        we've seen... Do you really think
                        it's all just a coincidence?

                                 ANDREW
                        Do you really think that one of us
                        killing the other would stop the end
                        of the world?

           Andrew stares at him as the rain pours around them.

                                 ANDREW
                        Do you?

                                 ERIC
                        You didn't answer my question.

                                 ANDREW
                        Yes, I think it's all a coincidence!
                        A horrible, tragic coincidence! I
                        have to believe that, because the
                        alternative is too horrifying to even
                        consider! Now answer mine.

           Eric just stares back.

                                 ANDREW
                        Do you really think that one of us
                        needs to kill the other?

           Eric can't bring himself to say it... But Andrew can see it
           in his eyes. He does. 

           SABRINA SCREAMING jars their attention.

                                 SABRINA
                        NO! NO!
           She puts her hands over her ears, closing her eyes, trying
           to drown something out, yelling to no one we can see.

                                 SABRINA
                        I'm helping them! I'm helping them!

           SHE TAKES OFF RUNNING, hands clenched over her ears.

                                 ANDREW
                        What the... Stop! Sabrina, stop!

           He raises his gun but she doesn't slow down, running into
           the forest.

           The dads follow, Andrew on guard with his gun, Eric still
           carrying Wen. They catch up with her and see --

           Sabrina frantically rooting around in the mud, MUTTERING TO
           HERSELF. Words drowned out by the rain.

                                 ANDREW
                        What are you doing?!

           SHE TOSSES SOMETHING towards them. It lands at their feet.
           Andrew picks it up. It's the TRUCK KEYS.

           Then Sabrina rises, now holding a DARK VINYL BAG.

                                 ANDREW
                        What's that?

                                 SABRINA
                        The truck's only a little ways down
                        the road. You can make it.

                                 ANDREW
                        What's in the bag, Sabrina?

           Sabrina opens the bag, reaches in, and lets it fall.
           Revealing a PISTOL in her hand that's bigger than Andrew's.

           Andrew tightens his aim on her. But she keeps her gun at her
           side. Tears in her eyes.

                                 SABRINA
                        I didn't know it was here. Redmond
                        must've left it. Or maybe Leonard. I
                        just saw the keys. I swear to you
                        both, I swear.

                                 ANDREW
                        Just drop it! Let it fall!
           Sabrina's other hand trembles as she reaches into her
           pocket, pulling out her WHITE MASK.

                                 ANDREW
                        No, no, no, put that away. Put it
                        away and drop the gun.

           She roughly pulls the mask over her head with her free hand.
           But it's askew, covering only the top half of her face.

                                 SABRINA
                        You have the keys. Just go! Please
                        just go!

           She begins to cry, open mouthed and silent.

                                 SABRINA
                        I'm sorry... I wanted to help you. I
                        wanted to help you more than this.

           Eric gently sets Wen's body down in the grass. Then stands
           to face Sabrina, taking it all in.

                                 ANDREW
                        Sabrina, listen to me, just --

           In one swift motion, Sabrina LIFTS THE GUN TO HER OWN HEAD.

                                 ANDREW
                        No!

           She sobs as her other arm waves furiously with objection.
           Her will fighting against her mission. Mouth twisted in a
           silent scream.

                                 ANDREW
                        Just put it down! Don't do this!

           Sabrina's wide eyes lock on Eric.

                                 SABRINA
                        You still have time to save everyone.
                        You still have a chance. Even after.
                        But you have to do it quick.

           She frantically shakes her head, "no." But her hand holding
           the gun is rock solid.

                                 SABRINA
                        Please Eric, you're our --

           BANG!
           Her body collapses against a tree, head lolling to the side.
           Blood rapidly spreading in the heavy rain.

                                 ANDREW
                        FUCK!

           He turns away, hands on his knees, unable to look.

           But Eric hasn't moved. Eerily unshaken by Sabrina's death.

           He calmly moves towards her body. Kneels down next to her.

                                 ERIC
                        She said we could still save
                        everyone...

           Then he stands up and turns back, revealing that HE NOW HAS
           SABRINA'S GUN IN HIS HAND, POINTING IT AT ANDREW.

                                 ERIC
                        But we have to do it quick.

           Andrew stares back at him, his gun at his side.

                                 ANDREW
                        I could never hurt you, Eric. And I
                        don't think you want to hurt me.

           Eric's aim doesn't waver.

                                 ANDREW
                        Forget about all the coincidences,
                        okay? They expect us to believe Wen's
                        death isn't a worthy sacrifice for
                        their god. So you know what? Fuck
                        them and their god. Fuck 'em all!

           His voice cracks as a sob escapes. On the verge of breaking
           down as Eric keeps the gun on him.

                                 ERIC
                        You can try to explain everything
                        away. But I saw something that you
                        didn't see.

                                 ANDREW
                        You just think you saw it --

                                 ERIC
                        I know I saw it! I felt it. And for
                        Wen to be taken from us... That
                        didn't just happen. He wouldn't have
                        taken her for nothing.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ERIC (cont'd)
                        And now all those other fathers and
                        daughters, and mothers and sons. It's
                        up to us. We can still save them.

           Andrew drops his gun.

                                 ANDREW
                        So which one of us is it gonna be
                        then?

           Eric holds his gun steady. Andrew limps towards him.

                                 ANDREW
                        Which one?

                                 ERIC
                        Don't try to take it away.

                                 ANDREW
                        I won't. I promise.

           He takes a step forward --

           And ERIC PUTS THE GUN UNDER HIS OWN CHIN. Andrew takes a
           sharp breath.

                                 ERIC
                        He said we have to willingly
                        sacrifice one of us. That's all it
                        takes. I'll do it. You don't have to
                        be here. Just take Wen and go.

           But Andrew moves closer.

                                 ERIC
                        Stay away from me! Don't you get it?
                        My life's already over. I don't want
                        to live without her.

           But Andrew takes another step towards him.

                                 ERIC
                        Stay back!

                                 ANDREW
                        I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
                                 (
                                  another step
                                             )
                        I'm not taking the gun. I'm just
                        gonna take your other hand, okay.

           He slowly reaches out, gently taking Eric's free hand in
           his, wrapping his fingers around it.
                                 ANDREW
                        I'm not taking the gun from you. I
                        promised I wouldn't.

           With his other hand, Andrew touches Eric's wrist that's
           holding the gun. Eric tenses.

                                 ANDREW
                        If you really want to do this, I'll
                        accept it. But it can't be you.

           He slowly moves Eric's arm, UNTIL THE GUN IS POINTED AT
           ANDREW'S CHEST.

                                 ANDREW
                        It's gotta be me. Because I can't
                        live without you.

           Andrew lowers his hand, leaving the gun pressed against his
           chest. Eric's finger hovers over the trigger. Second after
           excruciating second passes.

                                 ERIC
                        I... I don't know what to do.

                                 ANDREW
                        Yes you do. You'll throw the gun
                        down. It'll be hard, but you can do
                        it. Then we'll take Wen and walk down
                        that road. We'll get out of here and
                        we'll bury her. We'll bury her like
                        she deserves to be buried, with all
                        of our love for her.

           The storm rumbles above them.

                                 ERIC
                        You still don't believe it, do you.

                                 ANDREW
                        Yes, I do. I don't want to, but I do.
                        I know something is happening here.
                        Something horrible.
                                  beat
                                 (
                                     )
                        But how do you know it's God that's
                        doing it?

           Eric blinks, not following Andrew's line.

                                 ANDREW
                        What if it isn't God making these
                        things happen? What if it's someone
                        else? Someone cruel and evil?
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDREW (cont'd)
                        Because I know the God you believe
                        in, the God you love, would never...
                        Could never... Do anything like this.

           The statement lingers. Eric slowly draws a breath. Glancing
           up at the storm above. At the towel covering Wen's precious
           body. Suddenly seeing everything in an entirely new light.

                                 ANDREW
                        If you pull that trigger, you're
                        doing exactly what he wants you to
                        do. You're giving in to evil. You're
                        letting him win.

           Andrew slowly reaches up and takes Eric's free hand.

                                 ANDREW
                        But you wanna know how we overcome?
                        We overcome by showing him that we
                        love each other. And that bond is too
                        strong to break.

                                 ERIC
                        We can't go on... After all this...
                        We can't go on.

                                 ANDREW
                        We will go on. We have to. It's all
                        we can do. We'll go on.

           Eric's hand quivers, finger on the trigger...

           Then he lowers the gun from Andrew's chest... And drops it.

           He leans into Andrew, who leans back into him. Their heads
           side by side, cheeks touching. Leaning onto the only support
           they have left in the world.

           Together, they lift Wen's body, holding her in their arms
           with so much love.

           Then they set off down the road, carrying their daughter.
           Not looking back. Eyes focused on the journey ahead.

           While high above, the sky is a malignant black. Bright
           lightning flashes, thunder echoes, and the storm rages...

           But these two are walking through it...

           They're walking through it together. 

                                                           CUT TO BLACK.
