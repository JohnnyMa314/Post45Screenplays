                                  THE
                             Traveler
           INT./EXT. - CAR - DAY

           It’s 7:50am. 

           On the radio, people argue about nothing -- radio from Hell. 
           It’s not important or interesting, so SCOTT TREDER (47) 
           scrubs past it. 

           Scott wears a light blue collared shirt, yellow tie, grey 
           pants. But like the radio from Hell, his clothes are neither 
           important nor interesting. 

           But the time is. 

           Because it’s 7:51am. 

           Pay attention.

           Scott pops the cap off a bottle of Tylenol and it spills in 
           his lap. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Shit. 

           He grabs two and downs it with coffee. 

           It’s now 7:52am. 

           Are you paying attention?

           Just then: everything around Scott -- the car, the trees out 
           the window, blurs for half a second, moves slightly off its 
           axis and the world 

           slips

           and the car vanishes. 

           Not Scott -- just the car.

           So Scott remains: mid-air, moving forward at 27mph, upright 
           as if the seat was still underneath him with his hand 
           extended to where the steering wheel should be.  

           His feet drag on the asphalt below... 

           His body lurches forward -- his knees meet the ground first.

           Then his shoulder -- then the rest of him. 

           He violently tumbles and rolls and comes to a painful stop in 
           the middle of the road. 
           He pushes himself up to his knees. Several of the Tylenol  
           pills catch up to him and PLINK on the ground around him.    

           A HORN BLARES! A car SWERVES away from him, going into the 
           oncoming lane. The approaching vehicle SLAMS on their brakes. 

           Scott gets up and limps to the sidewalk as the drivers of the 
           two cars HONK and CURSE at him as they drive away. 

           He looks around. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck...  

           ------

           EXT. ROAD - CONT. 

           Scott sits on curb. He touches the blood running down his 
           forehead, notices the gravel embedded in his hands. 

           He turns to see BROTHERS (6 & 8), on scooters staring at him. 

                                 OLDER BROTHER
                        You okay? 

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t know. 

                                 OLDER BROTHER
                        You’re bleeding. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah. 

           BUZZ. BUZZ BUZZ. 

           Scott pulls out his cell phone, the screen’s cracked but it’s 
           still working.  

                                 YOUNGER BROTHER
                        You’re lucky you didn’t get hit by 
                        the ghost car. 

                                 OLDER BROTHER
                        Shut up, you don’t know about that. 

                                 YOUNGER BROTHER
                        Yeah I saw it! 
           Scott’s not paying attention to them. Notifications of missed 
           calls and text messages start pouring in. 

           He listens to a voice mail from work: 

                                 ANDY (O.S.)
                        Hey, it’s Andy. You coming in 
                        today? We’ve got that call from... 

           Scott goes to the next one. 

                                 CAROL (O.S.)
                        Mr. Treder, hoping this isn’t an 
                        emergency, because otherwise just 
                        not showing up for work is not 
                        something we tolerate... 

           Next. 

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        Scott? The office called saying you 
                        didn’t come in. Call me. 

                                 YOUNGER BROTHER (O.C.)
                        Did you see it, mister? 

           Scott finally looks up. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Huh?

                                 YOUNGER BROTHER
                        The car that crashed with no one 
                        driving. You see it? 

           Scott gets up to see where he’s pointing: a low brick garden 
           wall has clearly been damaged. 

                                 SCOTT
                           No, I didn’t see it... 

           Scott goes back to his phone, calls AMY. The brothers argue 
           and scoot away. Amy answers. 

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        Scott?? 

                                 SCOTT
                        Hey. 

                                 AMY
                        Where the hell have you been? Are 
                        you okay? 
                                 SCOTT
                        I’m... not sure. I was driving 
                        and... Can you come get me? 

                                 AMY
                        Where are you? 

           He looks to the street sign on the corner. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Winslet and... Perry. On the way to 
                        the office. 

                                 AMY
                        We’ll be there in 10. 

           EXT. ROAD - LATER

           Scott stands from the curb as AMY (45) pulls up in their 
           silver Civic. The front left side has been damaged... 

           From the back seat, LYLE (7) presses his thick glasses 
           against the window. Amy steps out, slows when she sees Scott. 

                                 AMY
                        Oh my God, Scott... What happened? 

                                 SCOTT
                        I was driving down the road, and 
                        then... The car just wasn’t there. 
                        Then I-- 

                                 AMY
                        What do you mean ‘the car wasn’t 
                        there’? 

                                 SCOTT
                        It just disappeared, right from 
                        under me. And I hit the ground and 
                        got pretty banged up. 

                                 AMY
                        The police called, said you crashed 
                        the car yesterday and abandoned it. 
                        I didn’t know what happened to you. 
                        We’ve been worried sick.    

           Scott takes a moment to process this.

                                 SCOTT
                        ...did you say ‘yesterday’?
                                 AMY
                        Yeah?

           Scott gingerly walks to the car.

                                 SCOTT
                        Can we go home, please? 

           Amy doesn’t uncross her arms, follows. 

           INT./EXT. CAR - DAY

           It’s a quiet car ride.  

                                 LYLE
                        Dad? 

                                 SCOTT
                        Huh? 

                                 LYLE
                        Why didn’t you come home last 
                        night? 

           Amy shifts in her seat and glances at Scott. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t know, bud.

                                 LYLE
                        Did you go somewhere? 

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m not sure.  

           Lyle thinks about this.

                                 LYLE
                        You okay, Dad? 

           Scott looks back, his son’s young eyes showing more years 
           than his age. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah, I’m okay, buddy. 

           INT. TREDER HOME - DAY

           They walk in. The house is small but cozy, the layout is 
           common for a rambler built in the mid 2000’s. 
                                 LYLE
                        Can we read two chapters tonight 
                        since we missed yesterday? 

                                 SCOTT
                        Of course. 

           Scott nods. Lyle climbs the stairs and goes in his bedroom. 

                                 AMY
                        Leave the door cracked, please. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Shouldn’t Lyle be in school?

                                 AMY
                        I didn’t know where you were so I 
                        took the day off. I thought it 
                        would be better. Since we didn’t 
                        know where you were... 

           She waits for him to give her an answer. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Amy... 

           She turns up the stairs. 

                                 AMY
                        Lyle’s principal called again. If 
                        he’s going to get into the 
                        charter’s accelerated program we 
                        need to move on it now. 
                           (stops mid-stairs)
                        You should change if you’re still 
                        going to make it into work. 

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Amy puts two dress shirt options on the bed for Scott. Looks 
           through his ties. 

                                 AMY
                        He’ll need new uniforms too. 
                        They’re pricey, but a kid his level 
                        needs opportunities to grow. Right? 

                                 SCOTT
                        Sure. 

                                 AMY
                        Sure, or yes? 
                                 SCOTT
                        Does it matter? 

           He carefully starts to unbutton his shirt.  

                                 AMY
                        Of course it matters. Because 
                        committing to this means you have 
                        to talk to Carol about being 
                        promoted from a tech.

                                 SCOTT
                        And I’ve told you. There won’t be a 
                        lead position open for at least a 
                        year. I can’t help that. 

                                 AMY
                        Then ask for a raise. It’s not just 
                        going to fall in your lap, Scott. 
                        Be proactive. Do something. That’s 
                        what we talked about. Right?

                                 SCOTT
                        Sure. Erm, yes.  

           He tries to take the shirt off but the dried blood from his 
           shoulder clings to his skin as it separates. 

                                 AMY
                        Here... 

           She helps him take it off slowly. She sees all of the rest of 
           his bruises and scrapes. He’s a mess. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        God... honey. What is this? What’s 
                        going on? Please just tell me. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I did tell you. 

                                 AMY
                        No, Scott. All you’ve said was the 
                        car disappeared but a disappearing 
                        car wouldn’t do this.  

                                 SCOTT
                        It would if it vanished under you 
                        at 30mph. I can’t explain it, but 
                        it’s the truth.

           Amy runs her hands through her hair and paces. 
                                 AMY
                        And this was yesterday?

                                 SCOTT
                        I guess it would be. 

           She touches the gash on his side and pebbles drop to the 
           linoleum floor. 

           Amy picks up her phone. 

                                 AMY
                        You can talk to your boss tomorrow. 
                        I’m taking you to the doctor. 

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s not as bad as it looks, I’m 
                        fine. 

           Amy puts the phone to her ear. 

                                 AMY
                        I’m not worried about the scrapes. 

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Amy and Lyle sit against the wall, Scott on the patient’s 
           paper-lined chair. The DOCTOR walks back in with a clipboard. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Well, apart from the cuts and 
                        bruises, and moderately high blood 
                        pressure... you’re fine. 

                                 AMY
                        What about the missing day? 

           The Doctor nods as if he expected the answer. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        The CT scan doesn’t show any kind 
                        of head trauma. No concussion. I’m 
                        sorry I don’t have any answers, I 
                        can only tell you what it isn’t. 

           Amy puts her head back against the wall. She looks over at 
           Scott, who accepts this answer. 

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Well, that’s all I’ve got for you. 
                        I can prescribe some pain killers 
                        but anything over the counter 
                        should do the trick. 
                                 SCOTT
                        I’m fine. Thank you. 

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - LOBBY - LATER

           Amy walks ahead of Lyle and Scott. Lyle watches his dad limp 
           along. He reaches up for his Dad’s hand. 

           INT. TREDER HOME - SCOTT’S DEN - NIGHT

           The orange glow of lamps illuminate the room. 

           Scott and Lyle sit together on the couch, Lyle carefully 
           tucked inside Scott’s arms while he holds “2001: A Space 
           Odyssey” out in front of him. 

                                 SCOTT
                        “The sixth member of the crew cared 
                        for none of these things, for it 
                        was not human...”

           He flips the page. Lyle’s eyes find the first word in the top 
           left corner - he’s following along. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        “It was the highly advanced HAL 
                        9000 computer, the brain and 
                        nervous system of the ship.”

           KNOCK-KNOCK. 

           Amy pokes her head in. 

                                 AMY
                        Bedtime, Lyle.

                                 LYLE
                        ‘kay. 

           Scott puts a book mark in and Lyle bounces out of the room.

                                 AMY
                        I think I’m going to go to bed too.

                                 SCOTT
                        Alright. I’ll be right up.  

           She walks away, leaving Scott on the edge of the couch. 
           INT. KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING

           Scott walks into the kitchen, Lyle’s eating pancakes at the 
           table. There’s a plate set for Scott too. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Morning. 

           Lyle looks up from his comic book and smiles. 

                                 LYLE
                        Morning, Dad. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You’re up early, aren’t you?

           He looks at the clock. 

           Note: It’s 7:06am... 

                                 LYLE
                        Science Club is today. 
                           (on his confused look)
                        It’s Wednesday... 

           Scott can see Amy look at him from the stove. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Right, I know. Umm. Leave in ten? 

                                 AMY
                        Better leave in five. And don’t 
                        waste the pancakes, I don’t want 
                        leftovers.  

           Scott grabs another pancake and grabs his fork and knife, one 
           in each hand like a king at a feast. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Well... Looks like we’re going to 
                        have to race then. 

           Lyle grins and grabs another fork (one in each hand now). 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Ready...

                                 LYLE
                        GO!

           They dive in, Lyle doing more giggling than eating. 
                                 AMY
                        Don’t choke! Hey... where’s my 
                        fork? 

           Lyle bursts out laughing as he eats.

           EXT. TREDER HOME - DRIVEWAY - MORNING

           Scott closes the door after Lyle hops in the back of the 
           dented up Civic. Amy stands by her SUV, shuffles her keys. 

                                 AMY
                        See you tonight? 

           The question hangs in the air, then

                                 SCOTT
                        Yes. I’ll see you tonight. 

           She smiles. Gets in the SUV. 

           INT./EXT. CAR - MORNING

           Radio from Hell is on again. Scott switches it off. 

           It’s 7:24am.

                                 LYLE
                        Are you going somewhere again 
                        today? 

           Scott looks at him through his rearview mirror. Lyle stares 
           right back at him. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m going to work. Then after work 
                        I’m coming straight home.

                                 LYLE
                        Okay. 

           EXT. LYLE’S SCHOOL - MORNING

           Lyle gets out of the car. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Hey.

           Lyle stops and turns back. 
                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know what happened 
                        yesterday, but it’s not going to 
                        happen again. Okay, buddy? 

           Lyle smiles. Waves. 

                                 LYLE
                        Okay. See ya, Dad. 

                                 SCOTT
                        See ya. 

           EXT. MADISON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL RESEARCH CENTER - MORNING

           Scott walks up to the front glass door. He uses his key card 
           but it beeps red at him. 

           The SECURITY GUARD inside gets up and lets him in. He walks 
           past her desk and we see the clock. 

           It’s 7:48am.

           INT. RESEARCH LAB - MORNING

           Scott enters the lab, turns on his computer. Then a 
           microscope. He shifts through medical sample dishes. 

           But we’re only really paying attention to the red digital 
           clock in the corner that now reads 7:50am... 

           Scott looks into the scope at a sample: it’s a cancer cell. 
           He rotates another in. The cell has now doubled...

           The clock blinks 7:51am.

           Another sample, another division. Four cells now. He takes 
           some notes. Next sample, eight cells.

           7:52am.

           He winces as he adjusts in his chair and the whole world 

           slips.

           Scott falls to the ground, the back of his head hitting the 
           chair seat on his way down and it scuttles away.

           Someone CURSES from the cubicle next door and a mousey man in 
           his 30’s, ANDY, appears in the window across from him. 
                                 ANDY
                        Scott? 

           He helps Scott to his feet. 

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        You scared the hell out of me. When 
                        did you come in? 

                                 SCOTT
                        Just a few minutes ago. 

                                 ANDY
                        Huh, must have snuck right past me. 

           Andy cranes his head over the counter. 

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Oh good, she’s not in yet. Heads up 
                        -- Carol’s pissed. I don’t know 
                        where you’ve been the last three 
                        days but you’re in for it. 

           Beat. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Last three days? 

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah? I haven’t seen you all week. 

           It dawns on him. 

                                 SCOTT
                        What’s today? 

                                 ANDY
                        Friday...?

                                 SCOTT
                        No. No no no... 

           He reaches over and moves the mouse, but the computer is off. 

           BUZZ. 

           He grabs the phone from his pocket. Notification after 
           notification comes flooding in. 

           Amy. Carol. Andy. Amy. Amy. Amy... 

                                 ANDY
                        You okay, Scott? 
           Scott grabs his keys and runs out. 

                                 ANDY (CONT’D)
                        Scott?

           INT./EXT. CAR - MORNING

           One hand on the wheel, one hand on his phone. Scott shuffles 
           through the missed calls and messages. 

           Dials Amy and puts it to his ear. Voicemail. 

                                 SCOTT
                        SHIT. 

           He dials again. Voicemail again. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Amy. It’s me. It-- It happened 
                        again. I don’t know what’s going 
                        on. Please call me. 

           He hangs up. Slams the steering wheel with his fist. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        SHIT!!

           EXT. TREDER HOME - DAY

           A police car is out front. Scott skids into the driveway. 

           INT. TREDER HOME - DAY

           Scott bursts through the door. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Amy? Hello?? Lyle?? 

           Amy sits at the table with an OFFICER. 

                                 AMY
                        Scott? 

           She hugs him. Looks him over. 

                                 SCOTT
                        What’s all this?

                                 AMY
                        Where were you? We found your car 
                        at the office... Are you hurt?
                                 SCOTT
                        Oh, no. I’m not hurt...
                             (quietly)
                        It happened again. 

           FOOTSTEPS, Lyle comes running down the stairs in his pajamas. 

                                 LYLE
                        DAD! 

           He hugs Scott. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Where’d you go? 

                                 SCOTT
                        I was at work. And then... 

           Amy turns to the officer. 

                                 AMY
                        I think we’re fine now. Thank you 
                        so much for coming all the way out.

                                 OFFICER
                        It’s no problem. Everything okay?

                                 AMY
                        Yes. Umm, yes. I think so. I’m 
                        sorry to have wasted your time. 

           The Officer shakes Amy’s hand and warily walks past Scott.

                                 OFFICER
                        Mrs. Treder, call if you need 
                        anything. It’s really no problem. 

                                 AMY
                        I will. Thank you. 

           Amy shuts the front door. Braces herself against it. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Lyle, go get ready for school. And 
                        close your door and wait 5 minutes.

           Lyle runs up the stairs, we hear his door CLOSE. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Scott. Are you lying to me? 

                                 SCOTT
                        No. I’m not. 
           Amy exhales. Then

                                 AMY
                        Are you seeing someone else? 

                                 SCOTT
                        What? No. Absolutely not. Amy, I 
                        love you. I would never do that. 
                        I’m telling you... It was like what 
                        happened with the car but I was 
                        sitting in the lab-- you have to 
                        believe me. 

                                 AMY
                        You can’t honestly expect me to 
                        believe that. Just tell me. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I am telling you!

           Angry tears start to build up in her eyes. 

                                 AMY
                        Scott... What do you want me to do? 
                        I’m at my wit’s end right now... 

                                 SCOTT
                        Just... Help me. 

                                 AMY
                        How? 

           Scott takes her hand. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Be with me tomorrow morning. At the 
                        time it’s been happening. If it 
                        doesn’t happen again, problem 
                        solved. If it does... We’ll cross 
                        that bridge when we come to it. 

                                 LYLE (O.S.)
                        I’ll be there, Dad. 

           Lyle stands on the stairs, backpack and pajamas on. Amy 
           laughs, and walks to him. 

                                 AMY
                        Alright but you still can’t go to 
                        school in your pj’s. Come on. 

           She disappears into the hallway. 

           Scott sits on the couch. Closes his eyes. 
                                 SCOTT (O.S.)
                             (pre-lap)
                           “I’m fine.” 

           INT. TREDER HOME - DEN - NIGHT

           Scott reads from “2001”, Lyle curled to him. 

                                 SCOTT
                        “His companion carefully checked 
                        the dials and gauges on the outside 
                        of Floyd's suit. Then he...”

           Scott notices Lyle is asleep. He sets the book down, and puts 
           his head back. Listens to the rain PATTER on the window. 

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 

           Scott, Amy, and Lyle sit at the kitchen table. Morning sun 
           shining in. No pancakes this time. 

           Scott checks the clock. 

           7:50am.

           Scott rubs his temple. Amy watches him. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Just a headache. 

                                 AMY
                        You want to take something? 

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s okay. I’d rather be sitting. 

           Checks the clock again. 

           7:51am.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        One minute. 

                                 AMY
                        How can you be sure?

                                 SCOTT
                        That’s when it happened before. 

           He checks the time again. Puts his hands on his lap.
                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Here we go. 

           Amy puts her arm around Lyle. 

                                 AMY
                        What do we do... if... 

                                 SCOTT
                        I’ll come back. Just like before.

           He reaches across for her hand.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, I--

           The world 

           slips...

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        --promise... 

           The light is different -- it’s overcast now. 

           His hand still reaching for Amy’s, but she’s standing by the 
           counter now, Lyle next to her. 

           She sees Scott, bursts into tears and leaves. 

           Lyle walks to his father. 

                                 LYLE
                        Four days this time.

                                 SCOTT
                        Four days? 

           Lyle nods.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        It’s doubling.  

                                 LYLE
                        What do we do?

           Scott looks into Lyle’s serious eyes. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t know. So maybe we should go 
                        find someone who might know 
                        something we don’t. 

           Lyle thinks about this.
                                 LYLE
                        Mrs. Vanderwilt is pretty smart. 

                                 SCOTT
                             (smiles)
                        I don’t know if your teacher is who 
                        we’re looking for... But I think 
                        you’re on the right track. 

           INT. LYLE’S BEDROOM - DAY 

           Scott and Lyle walk in to find Amy sitting the ground with 
           her back against the wall. 

                                 AMY
                        I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have walked 
                        out, but I just didn’t know how to 
                        react. Scott... you disappeared -- 
                        one second you were there and then 
                        you weren’t... 

           Scott sits on Lyle’s bed. Lyle sits with Amy. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        You were gone for four days. 

                                 LYLE
                           (casually)
                        So next time it’s eight? 

           Amy looks at Lyle in shock, then to Scott. 

                                 SCOTT
                        It seems to be doubling but we 
                        can’t be sure. 

                                 AMY
                        What? How?

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t know. The gaps could grow 
                        exponentially, like how nature 
                        multiplies cells, or how cancer-- 

           Amy puts her head into her knees again. 

                                 AMY
                        Oh my God... 

                                 SCOTT
                        Amy. We’re going to fix this. I 
                        think we should go up to the 
                        university and speak to someone. 
                                 AMY
                        And say what?? That you’ve been 
                        disappearing every morning and then 
                        reappearing at the same time? But 
                        wait, there’s more, the days are 
                        doubling each time too. You know 
                        what they’re going to say to that? 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. MADISON UNIVERSITY - PROFESSOR BECK’S OFFICE - DAY

                                 PROFESSOR BECK
                        Is this a joke? 

           A stodgy man with a full, unkempt short beard sits behind an 
           equally unkempt desk. His fingers are crossed on his stomach. 

                                 PROFESSOR BECK (CONT’D)
                        Who put you up to this? Matheson? 
                        Cho? Couldn’t be Schaeffer. 

           Scott, Amy, and Lyle sit on the other side of the desk. 

                                 SCOTT
                        No one sir. It’s not a joke. 

                                 PROFESSOR BECK
                        I’m not even sure how you got onto 
                        campus in the first place--

                                 SCOTT
                        I work in the cancer research labs. 

                                 PROFESSOR BECK
                        Carol Fieka runs that lab. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m one of her techs. 

                                 PROFESSOR BECK
                        Uh huh. Well, you’ve wasted a 
                        considerable amount of your time 
                        coming here, mine as well. 

           He gets up. 

                                 AMY
                        He’s telling the truth. I... we, my 
                        son and I... we saw it happen.  
                                 PROFESSOR BECK
                        You’re not bullshitting... 
                           (eyeing Lyle) 
                        Mr. Treder. I’m giving you the 
                        chance to walk away now if you’re 
                        not being honest with me. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m not lying. We need your help. 
                        And if you’ll let me, I’ll show you 
                        tomorrow morning. 

                                 PROFESSOR BECK
                        So you’re saying it’s observable? 
                        You’d let me see your little... 
                        phenomenon? 

                                 SCOTT
                        That was our hope in coming here. 
                        And if you could, I don’t know, 
                        take readings, or something that 
                        might help explain it. 

                                 PROFESSOR BECK
                        Mr. Treder, I’m a theoretical 
                        physicist. I don’t have equipment. 
                        Though I might be able to invite 
                        some of my peers that do... Let’s 
                        say Thursday morning? 

                                 SCOTT
                        No, you don’t understand. This 
                        isn’t a show-trick. I can’t control 
                        it. It’ll happen again tomorrow 
                        morning and then I’ll come back in 
                        8 days and so on. 

           Professor Beck leans forward and grabs some mixed nuts from 
           his desk, observing the trio. 

                                 PROFESSOR BECK
                        Very well, can’t hurt. Be here 
                        tomorrow around 7:30am? 

                                 SCOTT
                        Thank you. 

           EXT. HALLWAY - CONT.

           Professor Beck walks them to the door. Lyle turns around. 
                                 LYLE
                        I saw it happen too. My mom and dad 
                        aren’t lying. 

           Professor Beck looks down at Lyle, smiles. 

                                 PROFESSOR BECK
                        I guess we’ll see, won’t we? 

           EXT. MADISON UNIVERSITY - THE NEXT MORNING

           Scott paces in front of the hall doors. He’s wearing a coat, 
           white breath showing in the air. 

                                 PROFESSOR BECK (O.S.)
                        You actually showed up. 

           Professor Beck walks up the concrete steps with a cup of 
           coffee in one hand and an old leather satchel in the other. 

                                 PROFESSOR BECK (CONT’D)
                        No family today?

                                 SCOTT
                        My wife can’t miss any more work. 

                                 PROFESSOR BECK
                        I don’t blame her. Even I almost 
                        didn’t come.

                                 SCOTT
                        Well I’m glad you did. 

           The Professor unlocks the door. 

                                 PROFESSOR BECK
                        It was your boy, actually.   

           INT. PROFESSOR BECK’S OFFICE - CONT. 

           Professor Beck walks to his chair, drapes his overcoat on it. 

                                 PROFESSOR BECK
                        There was something in his eyes. A 
                        seriousness, an earnestness. I knew 
                        he believed it.

           Beck sits, sips his coffee. Scott stands awkwardly. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Are we going to a lab? 
                                 PROFESSOR BECK
                        No, Mr. Treder. I figure I’ll vet 
                        you myself first before I waste any 
                        of my colleagues’ time. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You just said you believed me. 

                                 PROFESSOR BECK
                        I certainly did not say that. I 
                        said I believe that your son 
                        believes you. That’s all. 

           Scott clenches his jaw. Looks at his watch. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Fine. We’ll see what you think 
                        after this. 

           Just as Beck is about to respond, the world around Scott

           slips.

           Everything SHIFTS and SNAPS back into place. 

           Only now, Beck stands behind his desk, clutching his coffee.

           There are GASPS behind Scott, four other people stand in the 
           corner by the door. One in a bow-tie drops his bagel. 

           Amy and Lyle are there, Scott slowly walks to them. Amy 
           reaches out for his hand, still unsure if she can touch him. 

                                 LYLE
                        I knew you’d come back, Dad. 

           Scott smiles, then looks to Professor Beck, whose expression 
           grows more and more fevered every second. 

                                 PROFESSOR BECK
                        Get out of my office. 

                                 SCOTT
                        ...what? 

                                 PROFESSOR BECK
                        I SAID GET OUT! NOW! OUT!! 

           They move for the door. One professor, a woman with her hair 
           in a bun and a lab coat, MAGGIE PAULSON (50’s), opens the 
           door for them, follows them out.  
           INT. MADISON UNIVERSITY - HALLWAY - CONT. 

           They start walking towards the exit. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        No no, this way! 

           Maggie takes a couple steps and waits for them to follow her. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s alright. I just want to chat. 
                        Can I offer you some coffee? Tea? 

                                 LYLE
                        What kind of tea? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hmmm... Have you had Earl Grey 
                        before? It’s very tasty...

           He shrugs with a smile.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                             (winks)
                        Okay, one Earl Grey... and three 
                        coffees? 

                                 SCOTT
                        That would be great. Thank you. 

           INT. MAGGIE’S OFFICE - DAY 

           They enter Maggie’s office, much more organized than Beck’s. 
           More plants, a couch, much more homey.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You gave old Beck quite the fright! 

                                 SCOTT
                        I didn’t mean to. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’ve gathered that. But that’s not 
                        what he thinks. He thinks you’ve 
                        outsmarted him. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Me? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yes, you! Scott Treder, the 
                        Disappearing Man!

                        He’s spent the last week trying 
                        figure out how you pulled it off. 

                                 SCOTT
                        He still doesn’t believe me? But he 
                        saw it himself!

                                 MAGGIE
                        Of course, but we all know it’s 
                        impossible for someone to simply 
                        vanish. Right? 

           She hands them their coffee. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        I would have thought so too, until 
                        this morning. 

           She hands Lyle’s tea to him it to him with a wink.

                                 LYLE
                        Thank you, Ma’am. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Call me Maggie. And you’re welcome.

           She sits with her coffee. Smiling all the while. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Excuse me, Ms... Maggie. What is it 
                        exactly that you do? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh! I’m sorry. I’m a professor 
                        emeritus in theoretical physics. 
                        Really you should have come to me 
                        first, you know. My research is 
                        much wilder and on the fringes than 
                        stuffy old Beck’s ever was. 

                                 AMY
                        Do you think you can help us? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Not sure. But I’d like to try. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You mean, you believe me? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I do! Because I believe in science. 
                        There are situations in physics 
                        where things can disappear and 
                        reappear at different times.

                        But those things happen at the 
                        tiniest of scales.

                                 LYLE
                        Like, atoms? 

           Maggie leans forward to Lyle. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Even smaller. Electrons, quarks, 
                        and the like. You heard of those? 

           Lyle’s eyes light up. Shakes his head. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Well, your dad is not a quark. And 
                        even if he was, he shouldn’t be 
                        appearing where he has been. 

                                 AMY
                        Where else would he be appearing?

                                 SCOTT
                        The exact spot I disappeared. 

           Amy isn’t following.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Because the Earth is rotating. And 
                        on top of that revolving around the 
                        sun... 

                                 MAGGIE
                        ...which itself is whirling through 
                        the galaxy and so on and so forth 
                        hundreds of kilometers per second. 

                                 SCOTT
                        So I should actually be...

                                 MAGGIE
                        ...floating in space 8 days behind 
                        our solar path. Precisely. 

                                 AMY
                        So why isn’t he?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Aha! That’s exactly what I would 
                        love to figure out! 

           She sits back in her chair, gleefully satisfied. 
           EXT. MADISON UNIVERSITY - DAY

           Maggie walks them to their car. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Tomorrow I am going to invite some 
                        grad students to join, ask them to 
                        bring some of their toys. Oh! 
                        Before I forget.

           She pulls out a book from her bag and hands it to Lyle. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Quarks and such. Thought you’d 
                        enjoy it. 

                                 AMY
                             (to Lyle)
                        What do you say?

                                 LYLE
                        Thank you, Maggie. 

           She starts walking away. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        See you tomorrow at seven? 

                                 SCOTT
                        I’ll be there. And thank you. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Don’t thank me yet!

           INT. TREDER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Scott lays in bed, watching Amy get ready for bed. 

                                 AMY
                        ...I just didn’t see us being able 
                        to afford it. Not now that we’re on 
                        one income. Of course Lyle was 
                        disappointed, but he’ll manage. 

           She wipes her face on a towel. Scott listens in silence. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        And at this point I’m not sure it 
                        makes sense to fix the car, it’s 
                        not like anyone is driving it... 

           Amy plugs her phone in and sits on her side of the bed. 
                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        And the next one is 16 days. God, 
                        16 days... 

           She slumps forward, away from Scott, wipes her tears. He 
           moves over, sits next to her. 

                                 SCOTT
                        The last one. 

                                 AMY
                        You don’t know that. 

                                 SCOTT
                        We have help now. Maggie seems to 
                        know what she’s talking about. 

                                 AMY
                        Nobody knows what they’re talking 
                        about! 

           She stifles another sob. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I just... I don’t want 
                        you to leave... It’s harder alone..

           Scott takes her into his arms. She cries. Holds him tighter. 

                                 SCOTT
                        We’re going to figure this out. 

           He wipes her tears, kisses her wet cheeks. 

           She looks up to kiss his mouth. He kisses back. 

           She pulls him back onto the bed... 

           INT. TREDER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

           Lights off, Amy sleeps with her arm around Scott’s chest. 

           He lies awake, searching the ceiling for answers. 

           INT. MADISON UNIVERSITY - LAB - MORNING

           Maggie flips the lights on, fluorescents HUM with life. 

           Scott curiously wanders around as two GRAD STUDENTS walk in. 
                                 MAGGIE
                        Ah, Scott this is Alan and Melanie, 
                        two of my students. They’ve come to 
                        assist with our little experiment. 

           Scott shakes their hands and looks around. 

                                 SCOTT
                        So... what do I do? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Right. Sit down and lift up your 
                        shirt, Scott. 

           Melanie applies gel to some pads, presses them to his chest.

           Melanie places two more on each of his temples. He gingerly 
           massages them, careful not to bump the pads. 

                                 MELANIE
                        Are they irritating you? 

                                 SCOTT
                        No, sorry. Just a headache. Do what 
                        you have to do. 

           Maggie looks at her watch. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s almost time. Now it’s all you. 

           Silence. 

           Then Alan starts clicking on the computer. 

                                 ALAN
                        Huh... 

                                 SCOTT
                        What is it? Is it catching 
                        something? 

           Alan bashfully looks around. 

                                 ALAN
                        Oh I was just noting that according 
                        to the EKG, Geiger counter, static 
                        array... you’re human!

                                 MAGGIE
                             (chuckles)
                        Alan just saved you a trip to the 
                        doctor’s. 
                                 SCOTT
                        Actually I went. They said I had 
                        high blood-- 

           Then the world

           slips... 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        --pressure... 

           Scott touches his temples, the gel is there but the 
           electrodes are gone. 

           JUMP 5: 16 DAYS

           Melanie and Alan sit on chairs, Alan covers his mouth with 
           both hands. Maggie stands still, brows pressed together. 

           Scott looks around expectantly. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Well? Did you get anything? 

           Alan jumps up, CURSES. Melanie’s frozen in place.  

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Someone say something... 

           Maggie slowly takes a step forward. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        How do you feel, Scott? 

                                 SCOTT
                        The same as I did a moment ago. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        A moment ago... right. Of course. 

           She looks at Alan and Melanie. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Well? Did we? 

           They both react and go to separate computers. Clicking, 
           scrolling. Then they shake their heads -- nothing. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Well, one thing is curious; when 
                        you disappeared, admittedly, I was 
                        curious if you were going to 
                        transport the equipment with you. 
                        Obviously, you didn’t. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        But you did take your clothes, 
                        which saves all of us some 
                        embarrassment... 

                                 SCOTT
                        Please forgive me if I’m not 
                        finding the humor in this. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        My point is, Scott. Somehow there 
                        are rules in place here. The time 
                        that you jump, the exact location 
                        on Earth you reappear, the things 
                        that travel with you... In my 
                        opinion, this seem... directed.  

           Everyone stops and stares at her.  

           Maggie chuckles, raises her hands and walking away. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Just calling it how I see it. 

           She finds her coffee and takes a swig. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Also, I’ve been thinking, and this 
                        goes for everyone... No discussing 
                        this outside these walls. The last 
                        thing we need is the press or the 
                        military getting involved.  

                                 SCOTT
                        You’re serious? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Very. Every leap in science 
                        eventually gets famous. Or 
                        weaponized.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Jesus. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Maybe.
                             (beat)
                        But last I heard, he only walked on 
                        water. 

           She winks. The edges of Scott’s mouth tug into a smile.  

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Now, if you could sit back down, 
                        let’s get those nodes reattached.
                                 SCOTT
                        I’ve been gone for two weeks. I’d 
                        like to see my family. Please.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Right, of course. Let’s start 
                        tomorrow at 7am then. 

           He heads for the door. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Thank you. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Don’t thank me yet. 

           EXT. MADISON UNIVERSITY - MORNING

           Scott shuffles down the steps as a bus pulls away. 

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        Scott.

           Amy steps out of her SUV. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Amy, hey. I thought the plan was 
                        for me to bus home?

           He gives her a hug; she’s tense. 

                                 AMY
                        It was. But I couldn’t wait. 
                             (a beat, then)
                        Did they learn anything?

           That’s what she couldn’t wait for. 

                                 SCOTT
                        No. 

           Her focus drifts to the ground. Shoulders drop. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        But Maggie’s hopeful that when we 
                        try again tomorrow-- 

                                 AMY
                        When you try again. You mean when 
                        you leave again. 

                                 SCOTT
                        What’s that mean?
                                 AMY
                        Nothing. Forget it. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Honey, we’re doing everything we 
                        can--

                                 AMY
                        No. THEY are doing everything they 
                        can. And WE are doing everything we 
                        can. I am doing everything I can to 
                        keep this family together. But YOU 
                        are just waiting til the next jump.

                                 SCOTT
                        That’s unfair. 

                                 AMY
                        I agree. 

                                 SCOTT
                        What are you expecting me to do? 

           Beat. 

                                 AMY
                        You’re right. I’m sorry, you’re 
                        right. There’s nothing you can do. 

           Amy notices the glances of nearby students. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take you home now, I’ve got to 
                        get to work. 

           INT. TREDER HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Scott turns on the computer. Google. 

           He sits with his fingers on the keyboard. Finally types: 
           “disappearing man missing time skipping time”. 

           The first five results are about alien abduction. The others 
           are about magic shows and substance abuse. 

           He deletes “disappearing man”. 51,000,000 results for 
           “missing time”. 

           INT. KITCHEN - CONT. 

           Scott wanders to the fridge, decides on nothing. Notices the 
           dishes in the sink -- why not?
           EXT. TREDER HOME - DAY

           Scott puts the trash in the bin as Amy and Lyle pull in. Lyle 
           jumps out and runs to him. 

                                 LYLE
                        Dad! 

                                 SCOTT
                        Hey kiddo. 

           Lyle looks him up and down, as if to confirm. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 LYLE
                        Does time travel hurt? 

                                 SCOTT
                        No, it doesn’t hurt. Why?

           INT. TREDER HOME - CONT. 

           They walk in the front door, Lyle leading the way. 

                                 LYLE
                        Well, Wikipedia says that it can 
                        hurt sometimes, like in Terminator. 
                        But if it’s a wormhole or time 
                        dilation, it should be painless. 

           Scott looks to Amy, mouthing “Terminator”? She shrugs in 
           innocence as she gets out the chopping board. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        The problem is, if it’s time 
                        dilation, you’d have to be moving 
                        at the speed of light or in a 
                        gravity well. 

           Scott’s more observing his child than listening.

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        AND, did you know that if it keeps 
                        doubling, the 15th time it happens 
                        you’ll go almost forty five years 
                        into the future like *that*?
                             (snaps his fingers)

           The chopping stops... 
                                 SCOTT
                        Um. No, bud. I didn’t know that... 

           Lyle senses the room, looks at Amy. Then back to Scott.

                                 LYLE
                        Sorry. 

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s okay. No harm in doing the 
                        math.

                                 LYLE
                        Hey, Dad?

                                 SCOTT
                             (braces himself)
                        Yeah?

                                 LYLE
                        Can we have pizza for dinner? 

           Scott glances at Amy, she tries to hide a smile. She puts 
           down the knife. 

                                 AMY
                        I could go for some pizza. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Pizza it is. 

           INT. MADISON UNIVERSITY - LAB - THE NEXT MORNING

           Scott walks in, Maggie spots him and motions to two others. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Good morning, Scott. I want to 
                        introduce you to Anita and Leon.

           They both offer half-hearted waves. 

           Scott moves to his chair. Leon sets up a large camera. 

                                 SCOTT
                        We’re filming it?

                                 LEON
                        Yup. 1200 frames per second. I’d 
                        like to be able to review it after, 
                        If there’s anything to see...  

           Everything is set up. Anita finishes attaching nodes to his 
           head. Maggie looks at the clock, it’s 7:51am.  
           Scott takes a breath and closes his eyes. Then the world 

           slips... 

           JUMP 6: 32 DAYS

           The lab equipment gone... 

           And Scott is surrounded by hundreds of people... 

           Then one face out of the crowd finally speaks out... 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Scott... Scott, I’m so sorry. 

           FLASH. 

           FLASH. SHUTTER. SHUTTER. FLASH. FLASH.

           Every person in the room starts to SHOUT. 

                                                         REPORTER 2
                                               What happens when you 
                                               disappear??
                         REPORTER 1
           Mr. Treder! Are you claiming 
           to be the first time 
           traveler? 

           Maggie runs to his side, pulls him from his seat. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Come on. We should go. 

           But the reporters push past security. SHOUT more questions. 

                         REPORTER 3
           How are you doing this?? 
                                                         REPORTER 4
                                               What does your family think?? 

           Scott and Maggie start to shove their way through the crowd. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Security!! 

           A SECURITY GUARD breaks through and grabs Scott’s arm and 
           pulls him through the door, barring the press from following. 

           INT. MADISON UNIVERSITY - HALLWAY - CONT. 

           Maggie moves to a door with an ID sensor just as a reporter 
           rounds the corner. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        In, hurry!
           INT. BIO LAB - CONT. 

           They walk through a classroom lab. On the other side is 
           another door. She checks through the window. 

                                 SCOTT
                        What the hell happened?? 

           INT. FACULTY WING - CONT. 

           They walk past various offices. All empty. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Leon. That bastard didn’t believe 
                        me for a second. Not that I blame 
                        him, I had no proof. But the second 
                        you disappeared, he had all he 
                        needed on that damn camera. 

           One of the professors they walk past watches the news, on the 
           screen, the title, “SCOTT TREDER THE TIME TRAVELER: REAL OR 
           FAKE” with footage from Leon’s high speed camera footage. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        He saw his chance to get his name 
                        in every paper on the globe so he 
                        went to the press.  

                                 SCOTT
                        And they believed him? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        He got Anita to go along with him. 
                        Alan too. They spun it like hard 
                        science, something we were on the 
                        brink of discovering with the 
                        promise that in 32 days you’d 
                        arrive at 7:52am on the dot. And 
                        today, you proved they were right.  

           They stop at an exit door.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        The reporters found your house too. 
                             (beat)
                        Scott, I’m so sorry. You trusted me 
                        and-- 

                                 SCOTT
                        --Did you get anything? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        What?
                                 SCOTT
                        The sensors. The instruments... 
                        Anything?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Not that we can see. 

           Scott CURSES. Runs his hands through his hair. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        But we can keep trying. Run more 
                        tests. Go through the data. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Forget about it. Thanks for trying.

           Scott walks through the exit door. 

           EXT. MADISON UNIVERSITY - CONT. 

           Scott walks away from the crowd by the University doors. 

           He pulls out his cell phone. Dials, no answer. Tries again, 
           it goes to voicemail. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Amy. It’s me, Call me when you can. 
                        Things got... crazy. Just call me. 

           He runs toward the bus stop when the phone BUZZES. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Amy! Are you okay? Where are you?

                        Minneapolis. 

           Scott stops walking. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Minneapolis? At your mom’s? 

           INT. AMY’S MOTHER’S HOUSE - CONT.

           Amy watches Lyle playing in the yard out the window. 

                                 AMY
                        We couldn’t stay.

                                 SCOTT (O.S.)
                        No, I understand. Are you okay?
           Beat.

                                 AMY
                        The Civic is still in the garage. 

           EXT. MADISON UNIVERSITY - SIDEWALK - CONT. 

           Scott understands. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Give me 4 hours. I’ll be there.

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        Drive safe. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I love--

           She hangs up. 

           The bus arrives, Scott gets on. 

           EXT. AMY’S MOTHER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Scott’s Civic pulls up next to Amy’s SUV. He walks to the 
           front door and knocks. 

           Amy’s mother, BETH (60’s) opens the door. Imagine Amy, but 
           heavier, a hard jawline and reading glasses. 

                                 BETH
                        Scott. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Hi Beth. 

           Beth steps out of the door and puts her arms around Scott. 

                                 BETH
                        You holding up? 

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m not sure. 

           Beth releases him, holding his shoulders in her hands. 

                                 BETH
                        I’ll tell you up front, Scott. I’m 
                        not sure what to believe yet. All I 
                        know is, you could probably fool my 
                        daughter with some parlor trick. 
                        Hell, you may even fool me.

                                 BETH (CONT'D)
                        But then I’d find you and cut your 
                        balls off with a rusty spoon. 
                             (grins)
                        But you couldn’t fool my grandson 
                        even if you tried. Not Lyle.

           He nods in agreement. 

                                 BETH (CONT’D)
                        Come on, then. 

           INT. AMY’S MOTHER’S HOUSE - CONT. 

           Scott walks into the living room to see Amy and Lyle sitting 
           on the couch. Lyle runs to him. 

                                 LYLE
                        Dad! You came back! 

                                 SCOTT
                        Of course. I’ll always come back. 

           Scott looks at Amy as she takes a shuddered breath. 

                                 AMY
                        Hi Scott. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m sorry about the reporters. 

                                 AMY
                        It’s not your fault. You weren’t 
                        there. I mean, you weren’t around. 

                                 SCOTT
                        One of the doctors leaked footage. 
                        He did it-- 

                                 AMY
                        Doesn’t matter. 

           A half pained smile. Eyes puffy, red.

                                 LYLE
                        Did Professor Maggie find anything? 

                                 SCOTT
                        Professor Maggie? 

           Scott looks at Amy who pulls Lyle to the couch in a hug. 
                                 AMY
                        Lyle and Maggie have become fast 
                        friends. Huh, kiddo.  

                                 SCOTT
                        That was quick. 

                                 AMY
                        Not for us. 

           Beat. 

                                 BETH
                        Lyle, why don’t you come help 
                        grandma. 

           They leave. Scott waits until Amy pats the couch next to her. 
           He sits. She puts her hand on his knee and he takes it. 

                                 SCOTT
                        How’s your mom?

                                 AMY
                        Better than I thought she would be. 
                        This whole thing hits a little too 
                        close to home, even for her. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m not your father. He was a 
                        prick.  

                                 AMY
                        Yeah, he was. But even then, she’d 
                        still watch out the window for him. 
                        Not me. I hated him, for years. But 
                        now that hate’s gone and instead I 
                        just feel empty. Like there’s a 
                        hole in my heart where a father 
                        should’ve been. 

           She sits up, wipes her eyes. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        And I don’t want that to happen to 
                        our son. I won’t let it happen to 
                        Lyle...  

           She sobs into Scott’s shoulder, as he holds her in silence. 

           INT. AMY’S MOTHER’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           The world 
           slips... 

           JUMP 7: 64 DAYS

           Scott sits on an armchair near the window. Across from him on 
           the couch: Beth, Lyle, and Amy. Beth GASPS... 

                                 BETH
                        Well then. 

           Amy gets up and walks out of the room. 

                                 LYLE
                        64 days, Dad. 

           Lyle hugs his father, steps back. We stay on Scott as the 
           world 

           slips

           and we look back at the couch, only Beth and Lyle sit there. 

           JUMP 8: 128 DAYS

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        128 days. 

           Lyle’s obviously grown. He approaches his dad. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        It’s been a long time.

           Scott looks around for Amy, she’s not there. He catches 
           Beth’s eye -- she shakes her head: no. 

           Out the window: snow falls. Then the world 

           slips.

           JUMP 9: 256 DAYS

           And the trees are shedding orange leaves again. 

                                 LYLE (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Dad.

           Only Lyle sits on the couch now. 

           Scott sits on the armchair, painfully unchanged. 

                                 SCOTT
                             (whispers)
                        Hey bud... 
           He kneels on the floor in front of Scott. 

                                 LYLE
                        I’m going to figure out how to save 
                        you. 

           Scott drops to the floor, hot tears on his face.

                                 SCOTT
                        If anyone can, it’s you, kiddo.

           He pulls Lyle into a hug. 

           INT. AMY’S MOTHER’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           This time, when the world 

           slips...

           Scott walks into the kitchen. 

           JUMP 10: 1.5 YEARS

                                 SCOTT
                        Amy. 

           Amy stands with her arms crossed, hair pulled back. 

                                 AMY
                        Scott. I’m divorcing you. 

           She pushes a stack of papers on the table towards him. 

                                 SCOTT
                        ...what?

                                 AMY
                        Please don’t make this harder. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Hold on. Let’s take some time and 
                        talk about this first. 

                                 AMY
                        I’ve had time. My decision’s made.  

                                 SCOTT
                        I haven’t done anything wrong! 

                                 AMY
                        Neither have I!! But I’m the one 
                        being left behind! I’ve spent the 
                        last three years waiting for you.

                        Then you come back for one day and 
                        then vanish again. How long do you 
                        expect me to do this? 

           Her hard-shelled facade cracking... 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I’m alone, Scott. And I’m tired. 
                        God, I’m just so tired... 

           She wipes her tears and stands.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Just sign the papers before you 
                        leave. I gotta go. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Go where? Where’s Lyle?

           She ignores him. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        What is it you want me to do? Tell 
                        me, I’ll do it.   

                                 AMY
                        I know you would. But now, all you 
                        can do is let me try to move on. 

           She walks past him and pauses at the door. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Take care of yourself, Scott. 

           She leaves. 

           Scott grabs the papers and throws them at the wall. The 
           heaving in his chest eventually turns to sobs. 

           INT. AMY’S MOTHER’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Beth enters, sees Scott at the table, papers in front of him. 

                                 BETH
                        So. You sign it then?

           Shakes his head.

                                 BETH (CONT’D)
                        Good for you.  

           She sits at the table. 
                                 BETH (CONT’D)
                        Amy’s having a hard time of it, but 
                        that doesn’t give her the right to 
                        abandon you. Or at least, it 
                        doesn’t make it right. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Beth, where did she take Lyle? 

                                 BETH
                        Amy made me promise not to tell 
                        you.  

           She brings out a stack of letters.

                                 BETH (CONT’D)
                        By the way, your son has been 
                        writing you. Almost every week. 

           He sees the address in the corner: Portland.

                                 SCOTT
                        Is my car still here?

                                 BETH
                        Long gone. 

           He looks at his credit cards one by one. Pushes them aside.

                                 BETH (CONT’D)
                        Expired. 

           He nods. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Can you drop me at the greyhound 
                        station? 

                                 BETH
                        You’re really going to do this?

           Scott doesn’t have to answer. 

                                 BETH (CONT’D)
                        Alright. Let’s go.  

           EXT. GREYHOUND STATION - EVENING

           Scott gets in line to board. Beth walks over, hands him a 
           thin stack of cash and walks away before he can return it. 
           INT. BUS - CONT. 

           Scott sits by the window. Beth waves as the bus pulls away. 

           He looks at the money, there’s a little over $100. He tucks 
           it in his pocket and zips up his jacket. 

           EXT. BILLINGS MONTANA - BUS STATION - NIGHT

           Scott’s the last off the bus, steps into foot of snow. He 
           walks to the motel next to the station. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM 4 - NIGHT

           Scott shaves at the dirty sink, the neighbors ARGUE LOUDLY. 

           His shoes lean against the heater, socks and pants dry on 
           top. He feels the socks -- good enough. He puts them on. 

           Sets the alarm for 7:40am. Changes it to 7:45.

           Turns off the light. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM 4 - LATER

           The red digital letters of the alarm clock light the room...

           It’s 6:51am...

           Scott’s still asleep. 

           6:52am.

           The numbers blur as the world

           slips. 

           JUMP 11: 3 YEARS

           MOVEMENT. RUSTLING IN THE DARK.

                                 MAN
                        Hey! HEY! WHAT THE HELL!! 

           A WOMAN SCREAMS and the lights switch on. 

           Scott tumbles out of bed to see a mostly naked and very 
           terrified couple on the bed. 

           Scott shuffles into his pants.
                                 SCOTT
                        I’m so sorry. Let me grab my shoes--

                                 MAN
                        We don’t have your shoes, man! 

                                 WOMAN
                        Don, he’s stealing your pants!! Do 
                        something!! 

           He looks down -- she’s right, these definitely aren’t his. 

           The man grabs the only thing near by -- the lamp. 

           It’s also the only light source in the room. He rushes Scott 
           and the cord unplugs, the room goes completely dark. 

           There’s a flurry of GRUNTS and GLASS breaks in the darkness. 

           The door flies open and we see Scott dash out. 

           EXT. MOTEL - PARKING LOT - CONT. 

           Scott runs and hides behind a car, watches until the door 
           closes. He touches a goose egg on his forehead, winces.  

           As he walks away, something JINGLES in his pocket.. Car keys. 

           He clicks them. BEEP! A car behind him flashes.  

           Scott looks back at the motel. Well... 

           INT/EXT. HILLBILLY DON’S CAR - EVENING 

           The sun goes down as the landscape moves in a blur. 

           EXT. PORTLAND - SUBURBS - NIGHT

           Scott walks in front of a small brick house. The lights are 
           on. He walks up to the door. Takes a breath. 

           KNOCKS. 

           No one answers. 

           He reaches over and rings the doorbell. 

           Again, no one. 

           He turns to walk away when the door opens, light floods out. 
                                 LYLE (O.C.)
                        I knew you’d come back. 

           It’s Lyle (13). Taller, lanky, still wearing thick glasses. 

           He rushes out and hugs Scott. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Lyle. Hey kiddo. 

           He wipes his eyes under his glasses. 

                                 LYLE
                        I can’t believe you’re here... 
                             (looks down)
                        Where are your shoes? 

           INT. PORTLAND HOUSE - CONT. 

           Lyle shuts the door behind them. 

                                 LYLE
                        Mom’s at night school, getting her 
                        Master’s. Won’t be back till late. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Wow, good for her. 

           Lyle opens a door leading to the basement. 

                                 LYLE
                        This way, I’m going to hide you 
                        down here. I’ve been prepping it. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Prepping it? For what?

           Lyle adjusts his glasses, looks back at him. 

                                 LYLE
                        For you. For when you got here. 

           INT. PORTLAND HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONT. 

           Lyle flips on the light on the way down.

                                 LYLE
                        Welcome, to the BATCAVE. 

           Two desks, three computers. Along one side of the wall are a 
           myriad of electronics, most look non-functional. 
           The majority of the space is taken up by a giant contraption 
           made up of four server racks and a rat’s nest of wires.

                                 SCOTT
                        You make this? 

                                 LYLE
                        Yeah! I made the whole thing from 
                        scraps. Rigged the whole interface 
                        with SCSI Ultra-5, which basically 
                        no one uses anymore. 

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s really impressive, kiddo. 

                                 LYLE
                        Nah, I bet you could’ve done it 
                        easy. Oh! And check this out...

           He flips on a series of switches. It powers up. He moves a 
           mini-microphone arm closer to his mouth. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Hal? 

           A simulated voice responds. 

                                 HAL
                        Yes, Lyle?

           Lyle winks at Scott. 

                                 LYLE
                        Play, “Caught in the Middle”. 

                                 HAL
                        Playing, “Cotton Eyed Joe”. 

                                 LYLE
                        No, no play--

           “Cotton Eyed Joe” starts playing, loudly. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Hal? Hal, stop. Play Caught... you 
                        know what-- 

           Lyle turns it off. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Still got some kinks to work out.

           Scott walks around it. 
                                 SCOTT
                        It’s really great, bud. But it 
                        seems like a lot of hardware for 
                        voice automation, no? 

                                 LYLE
                        Oh! Hal’s just a side feature! It’s 
                        really an electromagnetic sensor. 
                        It can take readings down to two-
                        microseconds. Watch...

           He hops on one of the computers. Types on the keyboard and it 
           WHIRS to life. A massive surge of text appears. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Right now there’s not much 
                        happening... But tomorrow at 5:52am 
                        we should have plenty to look at.  

                                 SCOTT
                        5:52? You mean 7:52? 

           Lyle cocks his head. 

                                 LYLE
                        If you were still in Wisconsin’s 
                        time zone, yeah. 

           It dawns on Scott. He face palms and bursts into laughter. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        What...? 

                                 SCOTT
                        This morning. I set an alarm for 
                        7:45 at a motel to make sure I woke 
                        up in time for the jump but I 
                        forgot about the time zone change! 
                        I appeared ass-to-ass with some 
                        hillbilly couple in Montana!! 

           Scott loses it, crying from laughter. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        You should’ve seen the look on 
                        their faces. One came at me with 
                        the lamp!! That’s how I lost my 
                        shoes!! 

           They both ROAR with laughter. 
           INT. PORTLAND HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Lyle and Scott lie on the floor, each on a sleeping bag.

           SERIES OF SHOTS: 

           - Lyle excitedly talks about school. 

           - Scott listens, prompting more with a word or two. 

           - Scott recounts a story, Lyle laughs. 

           Then, footsteps above. Lyle and Scott look up at the noise.

                                 LYLE
                        Mom’s home. 

           But listening closer, a MAN’S VOICE... 

           Lyle looks at Scott, guiltily. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I guess umm... I don’t know how 
                        serious they are but... 

                                 SCOTT
                        She’s seeing someone? 

                                 LYLE
                        Yeah. Sorry. 

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s okay. It’s been over 5 years. 

                                 LYLE
                        6 years. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Right. 3 days for me, 6 years for 
                        you guys. 

                                 LYLE
                        Well, I better go up. You know, 
                        stick to the routine. 

           He gets up and walks to the stairs. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll try and sneak down but if she 
                        stays up again tonight... 

                                 SCOTT
                        Then I’ll see you tomorrow morning. 
           Lyle smiles, nods. Takes a step, and then 

                                 LYLE
                        Dad, I’m glad you made it here. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Me too, kiddo. 

           He walks up the stairs. Scott settles in to his sleeping bag 
           and closes his eyes. 

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. PORTLAND HOUSE - BASEMENT - MORNING

           OVER BLACK: FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. 

                                 LYLE (O.S.)
                        Morning, Dad.

           Scott looks up, it’s Lyle. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Hey. Morning. 

                                 LYLE
                        Sorry I couldn’t make it down last 
                        night. Mom and Derrick fell asleep 
                        watching TV. 

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s okay. 

                                 LYLE
                        No it’s not. The next time I see 
                        you, I’ll be 19... I’m sorry. I was 
                        too scared she’d find you. Or that 
                        the machine wouldn’t work for some 
                        reason... I should’ve prepared 
                        more, I just ran out of time... 

           Scott pulls him down on his knees. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Hey. None of that matters. Only you 
                        do. That’s it. I love you, son. No 
                        matter what happens. Okay?
                             (beat)
                        And, I need you to listen close to 
                        me. It’s important. Father to son.

           Lyle perks up. Nods. 
                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want you spending your life 
                        on me. You know? Trying to save me. 
                        I can’t let this thing take over 
                        your life too. Do you understand? 

           Without saying yes or no, Lyle looks at the clock. 

                                 LYLE
                        It’s 5:50. 

           He stands, turns the machine on. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Fine. But at least let me see if I 
                        can get anything. And if there’s 
                        nothing... I’ll think about it. 
                             (smirks)

                                 SCOTT
                        Alright. What do I do? 

                                 LYLE
                        Just stand in the middle of the 
                        towers and... let Hal get to work. 

           As Scott enters the quad-towers. He massages his head. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong? 

                                 SCOTT
                        I get headaches before the jumps. 
                        Like a personal canary in a coal 
                        mine, it’s nothing. 

                                 LYLE
                        Always? That seems weird...

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah, but I’m fine. How much time 
                        do we have? 

                                 LYLE
                        30 seconds. 

           Lyle smiles, hits the keyboard and Hal begins to HUM. 

           The hair on Scott’s arms stand. Scott hunches over. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Dad?? You okay? 
           The towers SPARK and SPIT. Lyle jumps out of his chair just 
           as the world 

           slips...

           Suddenly, the whole world FREEZES. 

           The fans on Hal have stopped, as have the blinking lights. 

           Scott looks to Lyle who stands in front of him, FROZEN. 

           Then in one instant, everything SPEEDS up in hyper-time. Lyle 
           zips through the room, dismantles the machine around him, 
           then pauses to look in Scott’s direction. Lyle is FROZEN 
           again... And he looks older. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Lyle? Is that-- 

           A HAND REACHES OUT FROM BEHIND HIM AND TOUCHES HIS SHOULDER. 

           He whips around: no one is there. 

           He turns back to Lyle but A PALE WOMAN STANDS IN HIS PLACE. 

           Scott screams and falls backward into a pile of electronics. 

                                 LYLE (O.C.)
                        Dad?

           Across the room, a thin teenager rises to his feet. Chin 
           length messy hair, even though he’s not wearing glasses 
           anymore, it’s unmistakably Lyle (19). 

           JUMP 12: 6 YEARS

           Lyle hesitantly reaches out and offers a hand. He looks him 
           up and down. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        I almost forgot what you looked 
                        like... I almost convinced myself 
                        you weren’t real. But here you are. 

           Lyle fiercely hugs him. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Lyle... Something happened.

           INT./EXT. LYLE’S CAR - DAY

           Scott digs through a fast food bag. Lyle stuffs a fry into 
           his mouth as he drives. 
                                 LYLE
                        Somehow, the machine must have 
                        bridged whatever plane of existence 
                        that woman is on to yours. Or maybe 
                        it’s a metaphysical plane and 
                        that’s where you’ve been going and 
                        the machine hijacked it...

                                 SCOTT
                        You think She’s behind the jumps?

                                 LYLE
                        She’s got to be. Right?

           Scott’s bites into a hamburger. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Wow.

                                 LYLE
                        I know, it’s heady stuff. 

                                 SCOTT
                        No no, this burger is amazing. 

                                 LYLE
                        Told you! Hard to believe it’s not 
                        beef, right? Though you’re probably 
                        one of the few people that 
                        remembers 100% real beef around 
                        here. So goddamn expensive now.  

           Scott raises an eyebrow at Lyle’s cursing. Lyle chuckles. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I guess I’ve got to get used to you 
                        using grown up language. 

                                 LYLE
                        I know. I can even drink now. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Drinking age is 18? 

                                 LYLE
                        In California, yeah!  

           He pulls into a gas station and gets out. 

           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 

           Scott stretches as Lyle pumps gas. 
                                 SCOTT
                        By the way, what did you mean a 
                        different plane? 

                                 LYLE
                        A different plane of existence. 
                        Aren’t you a scientist? 

                                 SCOTT
                        You forget I’ve spent my life 
                        looking in a microscope. 

                                 LYLE
                        True. Okay, think of it this way, 
                        we see things in three dimensions. 
                        Up and down...
                             (demonstrates)
                        Left, right. 
                             (moves hands)
                        And forward-backwards.

           He takes a step forward, then back. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Now you, and I’m assuming Her, are 
                        moving through time the same way we 
                        move through space. Right?

                                 SCOTT
                        Right...  

                                 LYLE
                        So where I’m standing here is a 
                        physical representation of today. 
                        And right there... 

           He points to a spot 2 feet in front of him. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        That’s tomorrow. So if I do this... 

           He jumps to that spot. It dawns on Scott...

                                 SCOTT
                        So you just jumped to tomorrow.

                                 LYLE
                        Exactly. 

                                 SCOTT
                        But who could do that? 

                                 LYLE
                        Who indeed.
           Scott peers around as if he expecting onlookers, or ghosts.

                                 SCOTT
                        Where are you learning this 
                        exactly? 

                                 LYLE
                        Berkeley. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You got into Berkeley?? That’s 
                        great, Lyle! What are you studying? 

           Lyle smiles and returns the gas pump hose. 

                                 LYLE
                        Theoretical physics... 

                                 SCOTT
                        Not because of me, I hope. 

                                 LYLE
                        Not just because of you... 

           As he closes the car door we

                                                        SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. BERKELEY - LYLE’S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           Lyle closes his dorm room door. On the walls, a time table of 
           Scott’s jumps. A calendar with a date labeled, “Dad day”.  

                                 LYLE
                        Physics is interesting in its own 
                        right, and I’m really good at it. 
                        But I won’t lie and say you weren’t 
                        a large part of the decision.

                                 SCOTT
                        I just don’t want you to waste your 
                        time trying to save me.

           Scott lies on a twin bed, Lyle arranges his bedding on 
           another twin.

                                 LYLE
                        Dad, you’re jumping through time 
                        but you still crossed half the 
                        country to find me. 

                                 SCOTT
                        That’s different. You’re my son. 
                                 LYLE
                        And you’re my dad. 

           Lyle walks to his closet and pulls out some shorts. 

                                 SCOTT
                        What does your mom think of you 
                        studying here? 

                                 LYLE
                        She’s happy for me, of course. 
                             (hops into bed)
                        But I didn’t get as many 
                        scholarships as I hoped so Derrick 
                        paid for a lot of my tuition.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Derrick, is that her boyfriend? 

                                 LYLE
                        Husband.  

                                 SCOTT
                        ... I see. 

           Lyle clears his throat. 

                                 LYLE
                        You need another pillow? 

                                 SCOTT
                        No, I’m good. Is your roommate not 
                        coming back tonight?

                                 LYLE
                        Nah, he’s at his girlfriend’s. 
                        Speaking of... Remember that time 
                        you woke up in between that couple 
                        in a motel?

                                 SCOTT
                        That time being yesterday? 

           Lyle bursts out laughing. 

           Raindrops fall on the window as their conversation carries 
           into the night... 

           EXT. BERKELEY CAMPUS - MORNING

           Lyle and Scott hustle across the empty campus. 
           INT. BANCROFT LIBRARY - MORNING 

           They walk through the silent book shelves until they get to 
           the rare book section. 

                                 LYLE
                        This area isn’t likely to move 
                        around in the next 12 years. 

                                 SCOTT
                        How do you know?

                                 LYLE
                        I don’t. 

           INT. BANCROFT LIBRARY - RARE BOOK SECTION - CONT. 

           Lyle’s watch beeps. 

           5:51. 

                                 LYLE
                        I’ll be waiting. And if the machine 
                        is the way to get to Scary Pale 
                        Lady again, I’ll have it ready.   

                                 SCOTT
                        Okay. But--

                                 LYLE
                        I know, I know. Live my life and 
                        all that bullshi... I mean. Stuff. 
                        Don’t worry. I will. 

           They hug. 

           Scott massages his head. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Yep. Here it comes... 

           The world 

           slips...

           As Lyle guessed, that section of the library is unchanged, 
           not counting a couple books here and there. 

           JUMP 13: 12 YEARS

           In front of Scott, a man in his early 30’s walks forward. 
           Hair pulled into a short ponytail, thick glasses... Lyle. 
                                 LYLE 
                        Right on time. Right on time...  
                             (beat)
                        Hey Dad. 

           Scott hugs him, now the same height. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Back to glasses? 

                                 LYLE
                        Oh, yeah. Ha, didn’t quite feel 
                        like myself without them. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I like them. Not sure how I feel 
                        about this though... 

           Scott brushes the back of his knuckles against Lyle’s scruff, 
           Lyle laughs and moves away bashfully. 

           Scott notices someone walking toward them. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Lyle... 

                                 LYLE
                             (looks back)
                        It’s okay, she’s with me.  

           An older woman approaches, hair in a bun, small rectangle 
           glasses. She’s in her 80’s, but she walks with vigor. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hello, Scott. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Maggie? What are you doing here?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh, just fulfilling an old promise. 

           She touches his cheek. A tear forms in her eye. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        My God, you haven’t aged a day. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I have, actually. 13. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        13 days... After all of these 
                        years. What a wonder. 
           EXT. BERKELEY CAMPUS - MORNING

           Maggie walks arm in arm with Lyle, with Scott step in step. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        ... when Lyle published his thesis, 
                        the waves it made were large enough 
                        that I couldn’t keep away.

           Scott looks at Lyle who just grins bashfully. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Your son has grown quite famous... 

           EXT. BERKELEY CAMPUS - THE QUAD - CONT. 

           They arrive in a large brick campus square. In the center, a 
           group of equipment under white pop-up tents is being set up.

           All of the people stop working when they see Scott. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Though not quite as famous as you. 

           Lyle leads them to a large ‘X’ surrounded by a box outlined 
           on the ground. Scott warily steps around it.

                                 LYLE
                        You okay, Dad? 

                                 SCOTT
                        We can’t pick a place a little 
                        more... private? 

                                 LYLE
                        Well, the main issue is the next 
                        jump is going to be 24 years. It’s 
                        hard to gauge what’s still going to 
                        be around in a quarter century. 

           Scott nods. Still unsure... 

           Maggie walks forward to Scott, takes his hands.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Scott. I’ve had over two decades of 
                        wishing for another chance to help 
                        you. And I’ve come to the 
                        realization that I won’t be able to 
                        stop the jumps. But if I can 
                        provide some sliver of knowledge 
                        that one day helps you, that’ll be 
                        worth it for me.  
           Scott looks at the people watching, waiting, working. Lyle...  

                                 SCOTT
                        I understand. 

           He walks over and stands on the ‘X’. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        So, anything you want me to relay 
                        to our inter-dimensional friend?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Inter-dimensional friend? I’m not 
                        sure what you mean. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You know, to the--

                                 LYLE
                        --future generation. Right, Dad?

                                 SCOTT
                             (on his look)
                        Right. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        No, go on, I’m sure you two have 
                        catching up to do. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You don’t want us to stay?

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’ll just be in the way. Go on!

                                 SCOTT
                        Thank you. 

           They walk away. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Don’t thank me yet. 

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Lyle and Scott sit at a booth. A WAITER pours coffee into 
           Scott’s mug. 

                                 SCOTT
                        So, catch me up. What’s new? 
                                 LYLE
                        Well, now that we have funding I 
                        was able to expand our studies past 
                        the basic levels of--

                                 SCOTT
                        Ha, no. Lyle, tell me about you. 
                        What’s new in your life? 

                                 LYLE
                        I was on the cover of Time, did I 
                        tell you that? 

                                 SCOTT
                        No! That’s incredible. We should 
                        celebrate tonight! 

                                 LYLE
                             (laughs)
                        It’s okay, it was years ago. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Still, that’s amazing. What else? 
                        Dating anyone?

                                 LYLE
                        Nah. I have more important things 
                        to do than date. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Having a family isn’t important?

                                 LYLE
                        I have a family. You, Mom. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah, but kiddo--

                                 LYLE
                        I’m not kid anymore, Dad.

           Point made. The waiter’s back with food. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You didn’t tell Maggie, did you? 
                        About the Woman I saw. 

           Lyle shakes his head no. 

                                 LYLE
                        Too much at stake. 

                                 SCOTT
                        How so? 
                                 LYLE
                        Think about it. If we’re right and 
                        She is the one behind the jumps, 
                        the repercussions of people 
                        learning about an inter-dimensional 
                        being could be irreversible. Think 
                        of what it would validate or 
                        invalidate with religion or 
                        science. We need to be careful.     

           Scott tries to hide his disappointment with a bite of toast.

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        That being said... if you do see 
                        Her again, I need you to try and 
                        talk to Her. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Why?

                                 LYLE
                        Why? Because this is a scientific 
                        gold mine, Dad. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Ah. There it is.  

                                 LYLE
                        What?

                                 SCOTT
                        I knew there had to be something.  

                                 LYLE
                        Dad, come on. What’s the point of 
                        all this if we don’t learn from it? 

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t know. I thought maybe the 
                        point was helping me. My mistake.   

           Lyle sets down the fork. 

                                 LYLE
                        I’ve dedicated my entire life to 
                        trying to help you-- 

                                 SCOTT
                        I didn’t ask for that!!

                                 LYLE
                        You looked me in the eye when I was 
                        9 years old and said, “If anyone 
                        can do it, you can.” 
                                 SCOTT
                        I... I didn’t mean for you to... 

                                 LYLE
                        Well, you did. 

           The waiter comes with more coffee. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t blame you, I chose my path. 
                        I wouldn’t choose it differently if 
                        I could. But this is bigger than 
                        the both of us. And it’s best we 
                        come to terms with that. 

           EXT. BERKELEY CAMPUS - THE QUAD - THE NEXT MORNING

           Scott and Lyle arrive to a busy quad. Everyone works under 
           dimly lit campus pole lights. Maggie waves them over. 

                                 LYLE
                        Good morning, Maggie. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Morning to you both. Coffee or tea? 

                                 SCOTT
                        Coffee, please. Thank you. 

                                 LYLE
                        What kind of tea--  

           Maggie stops him and waves over a young student, THEO. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Theo, would you grab two black 
                        coffees and an Earl Grey please? 

           Theo nods and walks away. 

           Maggie takes Scott’s arm and they walk to the center. A 
           familiar four-towered machine set up around the ‘x’.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        You’ll be going a long way. I 
                        wonder what’s ahead. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Doesn’t matter. Everything I care 
                        about will soon be behind me. 
                                 MAGGIE
                        You know, I probably don’t have 
                        much time till I kick the old 
                        bucket. It’s not much to look 
                        forward to. And if it wasn’t for 
                        you, I might have said the same 
                        decades ago. But you kept me 
                        looking forward. 

           Theo returns with their drinks. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Theo, is it? Any chance you can 
                        find me some aspirin? 

                                 THEO
                        There might be some in the first 
                        aid kit. 

           He leaves to fetch it. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You alright, Scott? 

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah, just a headache. 

           Beat... 

                                 MAGGIE
                        The same headache? 

                                 SCOTT
                        What? 

           Maggie YELLS for Lyle. He comes running over. 

                                 LYLE
                        What’s wrong? 

                                 SCOTT
                        I just have a headache... 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You had a headache that morning in 
                        the lab too. Didn’t you?

                                 LYLE
                        Didn’t you say it comes before the 
                        jump? Your canary in a coal mine?

                                 SCOTT
                        Every time...  
           Theo returns with a bottle of aspirin. Maggie takes it and 
           HUCKS it. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        What’s the time? 

                                 LYLE
                        5:27. Shit, we should’ve got here 
                        earlier! 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Theo, run to Dr. Okura’s lab. Tell 
                        him I need his neuromodulator. GO.

           Theo takes off at a sprint. 

                                 SCOTT
                        What’s going on? 

                                 LYLE
                        I should’ve seen this coming. The 
                        pattern... 

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s fine, we’ve got time. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Somebody?? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Remember I told you I thought that 
                        this was directed? This could be 
                        evidence of that, like a 
                        fingerprint on a glass.   

           Scott looks to Lyle, who discreetly shakes his head. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        The pattern is too frequent to 
                        ignore. If we can target the 
                        headaches, it might help us find 
                        the source. 

           LATER:

           Someone calls out: 2 minutes! 

           They’re frantically strapping little nodes to the back of 
           Scott’s neck, his forehead and temples. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        That’ll do. Lyle make the call. 
                                 LYLE
                        Gear on, everyone! Let’s start 
                        recording! 

           Maggie gives him a hug. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Well, this is it, I guess. Haha! 
                        Goodbye Scott, my dear friend.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Thank you, for everything. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You’re welcome. 

           30 SECONDS!!

           Lyle runs up and hugs Scott. 

                                 LYLE
                        See you on the other side, Dad.  

           Lyle and Maggie move to a monitor. 

           The machine WHIRS to a deafening sound. Fans blow against 
           him, Scott’s breathing increases. 

           Lyle smiles at Scott. He nods back. 

           Closes his eyes. Then the world

           slips... 

           The world once again, FREEZES. 

           Every person is frozen in place. Scott walks forward to Lyle 
           and Maggie. He lifts his hand to touch Lyle’s face, and then:

           A BURST OF SPEED. 

           And the whole world is ZIPPING around him. 

           Scott turns to try and make sense of the madness, but it’s 
           all an unfocused blur. Except... 

           A woman, walking straight toward him. 

           It’s her. 

           While everyone else is fast-forwarding through time. She 
           walks in real-time. Grinning as she moves closer. 
                                 SCOTT
                        Who are you?? 

           She moves straight toward him. 

           Mouth dry -- he raises his hand to ward her off. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Stop! Tell me who you are! 

           She ignores him. A glow EMITs from her personage...

           Her glow is now a BLINDING WHITE LIGHT. He raises his hands 
           to cover his eyes. 

           Suddenly, there are GASPS all around him... WHISPERS... 

           Scott’s eyes adjust to the light and we see... 

           A crowd, hundreds surrounding him. All of the equipment is 
           gone save for four giant lights on towers around him. 

           JUMP 14: 24 YEARS

           The faces of the crowd are all aghast, some marked with face 
           tattoos, some with shaved hair styles. 

                                 TATTOO FACE
                        It’s true... 

                                 SHAVED HEAD 
                        He’s here, he’s actually here... 

           Scott’s breath shows in the morning air, but most of the 
           crowd doesn’t seem dressed for winter. 

                                 CUT OFF SLEEVES
                        Speak! Traveler, say something! 

                                 CAT EYES
                        We’ve waited long to hear the 
                        Prophet’s voice! 

                                 LYLE (O.S.)
                        DAD! 

           A man shoves his way through the crowd... 

                                 SCOTT
                        Lyle...?

           Lyle wears thick glasses a black overcoat, hair grayed. He 
           grabs Scott’s arm. 
                                 LYLE
                        We need to get out of here! NOW! 

           But before they can, a man with GREEN HAIR pulls him back.

                                 GREEN HAIR
                        NO! We must hear the Traveler 
                        speak!! 

           A man with a top knot punches Green Hair. 

                                 TOP KNOT
                        Do not touch the Prophet! 

           The crowd RIOTS. Some grab Scott, others punch those who do. 

           Lyle gets separated from Scott.

                                 LYLE
                        DAD!! 

           A GRUNGY WOMAN rushes and tackles Scott. Straddles him and 
           starts to slides her panties off under her skirt. 

                                 GRUNGY WOMAN
                        I want to have your child. I want 
                        to give birth to the next 
                        Messiah... 

           Scott tries to force her off but she punches him. She licks 
           the blood from his mouth... 

           ZAP!! She ROCKETS off of him and spasms on the ground. 

           A hand reaches out to Scott -- it’s LYLE. 

                                 LYLE
                        KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN! 

           Lyle ZAPS another person with his taser baton and CRACKS 
           another in the face. The crowd parts around them. Lyle wipes 
           blood from his nose, moves forward, pulling Scott behind him. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Police will get here soon--

                                 SCOTT
                        Thank God--

                                 LYLE
                        --we need to get out of here before 
                        they do. 
                                 SCOTT
                        Wait what? 

           They take off running. 

           INT. UNDERGROUND HALLWAY - CONT. 

           Lyle leads Scott into a service tunnel.

                                 SCOTT
                        Who were those people out there?

                                 LYLE
                        Just the usual suspects. Reporters, 
                        skeptics, religious fanatics. 

                                 SCOTT
                        And the ones that called me The 
                        Prophet? 

                                 LYLE
                        Yeah, well to them you’re The new 
                        Messiah and the Savior of the 
                        Times... You’re The Traveler. 

                                 SCOTT
                        What? Why would they think that?

           Lyle opens the exit door. 

                                 LYLE
                        Because I told them you were. Come. 

           EXT. BERKELEY CAMPUS - SIDE STREET - CONT. 

           Lyle walks to a sleek, black car. He presses his thumb on it 
           and a single door in the middle pops out. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I saw Her again.  

           Lyle freezes. 

                                 LYLE
                        And? Anything? Were you able to 
                        talk to her? 

                                 SCOTT
                        No. 
                                 LYLE
                             (shrugs)
                        Yeah, just as well I guess. 

           Lyle looks at his watch. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Dammit. She’s late. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Who, Maggie? 

                                 LYLE
                        Maggie passed a decade ago, I’m 
                        afraid. Ah, there she is... 

           An old hybrid metallic blue car pulls up. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry I didn’t warn you, I didn’t 
                        know who else we could trust....

           Out of the vehicle steps a woman in her 80’s...  

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Hi Mom. 

           Amy hasn’t taken her eyes off of Scott. 

                                 AMY
                        Scott... You’re exactly how I 
                        remember you... 

           She moves forward to touch his face. Tears forming.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        So it hasn’t stopped?

                                 SCOTT
                        No. It hasn’t stopped. 

                                 AMY
                        How long has it been? 40 years for 
                        me... 

                                 SCOTT
                        14 days for me.

           Full on crying now. 

                                 AMY
                        I’m so sorry. Scott, I’m so sorry. 
                        I was young. I couldn’t handle it.
                                 SCOTT
                        It’s okay. I don’t blame you. 

           Lyle looks at his watch, swipes a hologram of the news away.  

                                 LYLE
                        It’s gone national. We need to go. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Where? 

                                 LYLE
                        Somewhere safe. 

           He takes the keys from Amy. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        The government has tracers on cars 
                        now. Took me a while to find one 
                        without one. So Mom’s taking mine 
                        as the diversion. 

           Scott looks at Amy. 

                                 SCOTT
                        ... You’re not coming? 

                                 AMY
                        I wish I could, there’s a lifetime 
                        of things I want to tell you. But 
                        now, I feel you should know that I 
                        am happy. And even more, that I was 
                        happy. You know? When it was just 
                        us three. I was so very happy.

           She walks to Lyle’s car. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Amy, wait. 

                                 AMY
                        Goodbye, Scott. 

           She closes the door and the car drives away.

                                 LYLE
                        Dad, I’m sorry but we have to go. 

           Scott quickly turns and gets in the car. 
           EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY 

           The blue hybrid drives through a forested highway, farther 
           and farther out from the city. 

           INT./EXT. HYBRID - DAY

           Scott looks out the window, soon there’s nothing but trees. 

           EXT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY 

           They pull up to a cabin. Gravel CRUNCHES under the tires, 
           scattering a doe and her two fawn into the trees. 

           Lyle and Scott get out.

           It’s quiet. 

           They’re alone. 

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           It’s a small but modern cabin. Lyle sets down some bags. 

                                 LYLE
                        Hal? 

           A voice from the ceiling. 

                                 HAL (V.O.)
                        Welcome home, Lyle. 

                                 LYLE
                        Turn on the perimeter sensors and 
                        let’s have some music, your choice.  

                                 HAL (V.O.)
                        Perimeter on. How about some Simon 
                        and Garfunkle? 

           Music starts playing. 

                                 LYLE
                        You remember Hal, right? Dusted him 
                        off and gave him some new tricks... 

           Scott crosses his arms. Nods in acknowledgment. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        You must have questions. 
                                 SCOTT
                             (sharp)
                        Yeah, a few. 

                                 LYLE
                        Okay. Where do you want to start? 

           Scott exaggerates a thinking pose. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Hmmm. Let’s see. How about why the 
                        hell this is happening to me? Or 
                        why everything I know is gone? Or 
                        maybe why I only had 3 MINUTES to 
                        say goodbye to my wife? Can we 
                        start there?? 

           Lyle stays quiet as Scott paces. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Is there NOTHING I can do to stop 
                        this? How is it my entire life is 
                        out of my control?? 

                                 LYLE
                        None of us have complete control of 
                        our lives. Only our choices. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Well I didn’t choose this!! My 
                        choices didn’t lead me here!! 

           Scott sits, staring out the window. Lyle joins him. 

                                 LYLE
                        Assuming those questions are 
                        rhetorical, can we move on to your 
                        other questions? 

                                 SCOTT
                        What year is it? 

                                 LYLE

                                 SCOTT
                        Why are we here?

                                 LYLE
                        Are you wanting to know why we’re 
                        at this cabin, or the meaning of 
                        life itself? 

           Scott glances at Lyle, who smirks. 
                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        It’s not safe for you out there 
                        anymore. And the next jump is going 
                        to take you 48 years into the 
                        future and we need to prepare you 
                        for what you might face then. 

                                 SCOTT
                        What about stopping it? Have we 
                        given up on that? 

                                 LYLE
                        I’m just trying to be realistic. 

                                 SCOTT
                        And the headaches? Was there 
                        anything there? 

                                 LYLE
                        Nothing we didn’t already know. It 
                        could just be a coincidence. 

           He sits, takes his glasses off and leans on his elbows.

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        As far as I can tell the jumps 
                        can’t be stopped. The math, the 
                        sequencing, they slide together so 
                        perfectly, like unbreakable 
                        chains... Dad... I can’t stop it.

           Though Lyle is the same age as Scott now, he starts to sob.   

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Forty years of trying and I still 
                        can’t stop it... 

           Scott puts his arms around him.

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Dad... I can’t... 

           They sit on the couch, Scott holds his son as he cries. 

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT

           The fireplace CRACKLES. Lyle and Scott watch it in silence. 

                                 LYLE
                        Dad. If I don’t see you again-- 

                                 SCOTT
                        Don’t say that.
                                 LYLE
                        No, I need to say it. If I don’t 
                        see you again tomorrow... 

                                                        FADE IN TO:

           EXT. WOODS - THE NEXT MORNING 

           Lyle helps Scott put on body armor. 

                                 LYLE (V.O.)
                        ...when you jump again, there will 
                        be people waiting for you... 

           Lyle helps him put a backpack on. 

                                 LYLE
                        People looking for The Traveler...

           He hands Scott a pistol.

                                 LYLE (V.O.)
                        ...but whatever happens, just know 
                        that I love you... 

           They hug. Lyle steps away as his watch beeps. 

                                 LYLE (V.O.)
                        You’re my Dad. Always have been and 
                        always will be.

           Lyle smiles and looks at his watch. 

           Then the world 

           slips...

           Scott staggers as his feet CRUNCH twigs under his feet. 

           JUMP 15: 48 YEARS

           Two backpack straps fall to the ground -- the backpack itself 
           is nowhere to be seen. He picks the straps up. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Great. 

           A TWIG SNAPS. 

           A dozen camouflaged people emerge around him. Scott backs up, 
           puts his hand on his gun. They raise military grade rifles.  

           The LEADER raises her hand and the others halt. 
                                 CAMO LEADER
                        Scott Treder? 

                                 SCOTT
                        ...yes? 

                                 CAMO LEADER
                        Good morning. My name is Mary 
                        Hayward, 402 California Colonial 
                        Militia. Your son sent us. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Lyle sent you? He’s still alive--

                                 CAMO SOLDIER 1
                        Contact six o’clock!! 

           Three others immediately move in an arc around Scott and 
           start FIRING at their six. 

           Before Scott can even crouch he’s SHOT in the chest and is 
           thrown to the ground. He GASPS for air. 

           The Leader, Mary, throws herself on top of Scott and touches 
           her wrist.

                                 MARY
                        I’ve got Treder, we’re moving! Axel 
                        get over here now!! 

           She grabs Scott and they start moving as a unit through the 
           trees, Mary handling Scott like a rag-doll. 

           Bullets are flying EVERYWHERE, as well as something that 
           could have been a bazooka. 

           A soldier chokes on a bullet through the neck. 

           Scott scuttles backward from the GURGLING soldier, hides 
           behind a thick tree trunk as bullets RATTLE around him.  

           But a MAN IN A FACE MASK is coming right at him. Scott pulls 
           out his hand gun and fires at them, missing every shot. 

           The Masked Man pulls out a knife and CHARGES SCOTT -- just as 
           Mary tackles him. They wrestle and Mary plunges the knife 
           into the man’s chest. She looks to Scott, cowering.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Get up. 

           Mary extends a hand to Scott, who doesn’t react.
                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        If you want to see your son again 
                        you have to GET UP.

           TIRES DRAG ON GRAVEL, a ballistic convoy pulls up to the 
           road, 40 yards from them.

           Scott takes her hand, she pulls him up.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You stay tight on my side. Got it? 

           He steps close. Ready. She hands Scott his gun back. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t shoot my guys. LET’S GO!

           They daisy-chain from tree to boulder, to tree, ducking, 
           firing, covering. Several men die as they move. 

           EXT. ROAD - CONT. 

           Mary moves Scott to the convoy. Soldiers pile out of the 
           vehicle, one bumps into Scott’s shoulder. 

                                 SOLDIER
                        Apologies, Travel-- 

           He gets cut down by a line of bullets before he finishes. The 
           Mary grabs Scott and pulls him into the convoy. 

           INT./EXT. CONVOY - CONT. 

           Scott sits next to the Mary, with three other soldiers across 
           from him. 

           As soon as they are in, they shut the doors, leaving several 
           soldiers behind in the fray. 

                                 SCOTT
                        What about them? 

                                 MARY 
                        They’ll do what they have to, may 
                        The Traveler help them. 

           One of the soldiers LAUGH. 

                                 CAMO MAN
                        “May The Traveler help them”?? He’s 
                        right beside you, and he could 
                        barely help himself! 
           Mary slams her foot into the man’s groin, he tries to move 
           but there’s no room and she’s not letting up. 

                                 MARY 
                        Watch your language, Jak. 

                                 JAK
                        You Followers need to learn to take 
                        a joke. 

           She presses harder, JAK squirms under her boot. 

                                 JAK (CONT’D)
                        Mary, I was joking, ease up!! 

           Mary finally releases him. She knocks on the wall behind her 
           to the drivers. 

                                 MARY
                        Head for rendezvous alpha-echo two. 

                                 DRIVER
                        Roger that, ma’am. 

           Scott looks at the other soldiers, they all glance at him, 
           even nod at him, but don’t make eye contact.

           FOSTER, a woman with a buzzed head leans forward. 

                                 FOSTER
                        Sir...? 

           Scott realizes she’s talking to him. 

                                 FOSTER (CONT’D)
                        You are Scott Treder, The Traveler? 

           Everyone else is waiting for his reply. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I am Scott Treder... 

           Another soldier, LANCE kisses his fist and traces a ‘T’ 
           across his chest. 

                                 FOSTER
                        Thank you, Traveler. I mean, I 
                        believed it. My mother read the 
                        Word to me and I’ve lived by it... 
                        but damn, it’s another thing to be 
                        a Witness yourself. 

                                 SCOTT
                        A ‘Witness’...? What’s ‘the Word’?
                                 JAK
                        You should know, you wrote it! 

           He bursts out laughing. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Is that why they wanted to kill me?

                                 MARY
                        One of the many reasons. Lyle will 
                        explain.   

                                 SCOTT
                        So Lyle’s okay? He’s alive?  

                                 MARY
                        Yes, he’s alive, thank The Trav... 

           Jak snorts across from her, then closes his legs... 

                                 SCOTT
                        Where is he? 

                                 MARY
                        Under our protection. We’re taking 
                        you to him now. 

           Scott looks out the windows. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Are we safe now?

                                 MARY
                        Moderately. Why?

                                 SCOTT
                        Can we pull over for a second? 

           Mary knocks on the wall. 

           EXT. ROADSIDE - CONT. 

           Scott bursts through the convoy door and pukes. Then again. 

           Mary steps out and hands him a canteen. He washes his mouth 
           out, hands it back. She looks at his vomit, then him.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Disappointed yet? 

           When she doesn’t reply, Scott spits and gets back in. 
           EXT. BUNKER - DUSK

           The convoy pulls up to a giant steel door, 40ft tall and 20 
           feet wide set right into the side of the mountain. 

           It opens and they drive in. 

           INT. BUNKER - MAIN CAVERN - CONT.

           They pull in next to a line of other military vehicles, each 
           in different states of repair. 

           Scott looks up at the giant cavern: lights are bolted into 
           the walls, water drips from stalactites. It’s massive.

           On the ground, people mill about, others work. But as Mary 
           guides Scott through, a crowd quickly forms with whispers of 
           “The Traveler” and “The Word’s prophecy” etc. 

           A woman rushes forward with her crying baby, she holds the 
           baby out to Scott. 

                                 MOTHER 
                        Traveler, please bless my child. 
                        He’s ill. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I... 

           The crowd watches in silence. 

           Scott looks to Mary. She waits too, then moves closer. 

                                 MARY
                             (whispers)
                        Touch it’s head. 

           Scott hesitates, places two fingers on the baby’s forehead. 
           The mother bursts into tears. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Thank you, Traveler. Thank you. 

                                 MARY
                        Come on, keep walking. 

           The crowd moves closer and closer. Many reaching out to touch 
           Scott’s arms as he walks by. 

           At the end of the cavern, a large freight elevator. Mary and 
           Scott get in, the rest of the soldiers form a perimeter 
           around the door. 
           The elevator goes down. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - CONT. 

           Scott and Mary stand in the cage-like elevator, several 
           openings in the rock pass by: workshops and storage areas. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Thanks. For helping me back there. 

                                 MARY
                        It’s my job to keep you alive.

                                 SCOTT
                        No, I mean with the child. 

                                 MARY
                        It’s nothing. 

           INT. BUNKER - HALLWAY - CONT. 

           The elevator stops, she opens the gate. 

                                 MARY
                        This is where I leave you. 

           He walks past her toward a door at the end of the hall.

                                 SCOTT
                        And I’m sorry, for what it’s worth. 

                                 MARY
                        For what?

                                 SCOTT
                        For not being the um... for not 
                        living up to your expectations.  

           He walks down the hall. 

                                 MARY
                        Traveler. 

           He stops. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t disappoint me. You’re 
                        not what I expected, more human. 

           She closes the gate, ascends up.  

           Scott walks to the door and KNOCKS. 
                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Come in.

           INT. ANTECHAMBER - CONT. 

           Another cavern. The floor is layered with carpets and the 
           walls are covered in book shelves and framed artwork. 

           A fireplace on the right, a large aquarium on the left. In 
           the center, a small reading table with stacks of books. 

           An old skeletal man sits in a high-tech wheel chair. He’s 
           mostly bald, frail, and thick glasses hang from his ears... 

                                 LYLE
                        Dad. 

           Scott freezes mid-step. 

                                 SCOTT
                        ... Lyle? 

           Lyle smiles, puts his book down. Motions Scott closer. Scott 
           slowly moves across the room, bends down to eye level and 
           takes Lyle’s weathered, papery hands into his own. 

                                 LYLE
                        48 years. A long time. A very, long 
                        time. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Lyle... what happened?

                                 LYLE
                        To me or to the world?
                             (winks)
                        Grab a chair. Sit. 

           Scott grabs a chair from the table near by. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Before you do... Hal? 

                                 HAL (O.S.)
                        Yes, Lyle?

           Hal sounds much more human-like now. Still a tinge of 
           automated intonation. 

                                 LYLE
                        I’d like some tea. 

           He smiles and looks to Scott, he nods. Sure.
                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Two Earl Grey’s please, Hal. 

                                 HAL (O.S.)
                        Absolutely, Lyle. 

           A silver water heater STEAMS on the far wall. Scott walks 
           over and retrieves two mugs. 

                                 SCOTT
                        He’s come a long way. 

                                 LYLE
                        So have you, so has the world. 
                        Everything’s changed, and yet it’s 
                        the same as it always has been. 
                        People fight and they make love. 
                        They break countries apart and form 
                        new ones. Everything’s different 
                        and nothing has changed.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Lyle, what’s the Word?

                                 LYLE
                             (laughs)
                        Ah. Yes. The Word. Well, it’s your 
                        word. The Word of God, as dictated 
                        by the man chosen by Him to spread 
                        that Word. 

           Beat. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You wrote it. 

                                 LYLE
                             (grins)
                        I did. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Why? 

                                 LYLE
                        To protect you. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Protect me? I had a mother ask me 
                        to bless her sick baby upstairs!  

                                 LYLE
                        Did you? 
                                 SCOTT
                        Well, yeah but-- 

           Lyle laughs, sips his tea. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t funny! You turned me 
                        into a religious icon! 

                                 LYLE
                        Oh, stop that. It was already 
                        headed in that direction, I simply 
                        pushed it along and gave them a 
                        book to read. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Good God, Lyle. Why?

                                 LYLE
                        Because as much survival gear as I 
                        gave you in that backpack, none of 
                        it traveled with you. This was the 
                        only thing I could do to ensure 
                        your safety once I’m gone.   

                                 SCOTT
                        Don’t say that. 

                                 LYLE
                        I’ve survived 3 wars. Two types of 
                        cancer. My kidneys are shot, my 
                        liver is failing. I’ve lived this 
                        long out of sheer stubbornness to 
                        see my Dad one more time. I don’t 
                        have another 96 years in me, not 
                        even close. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Still... A religion? 

                                 LYLE
                        It’s self-perpetuating. Others will 
                        follow it and pass it on. Help will 
                        be always be available to you from 
                        those who know The Traveler.

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t want that. I didn’t want 
                        any of this!! 

                                 LYLE
                        Listen--
                                 SCOTT
                        All I wanted was to find a way to 
                        stop this goddamn thing-- 

                                 LYLE
                        Dad. Listen to me. 

           Scott stops. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me now, because you owe 
                        this to me. 

           Okay, he’s listening. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Whether you want to believe it or 
                        not, there is a purpose to this. 
                        You are special, Dad. You were 
                        chosen to be The Traveler. Wake up 
                        and realize what you’ve been given. 
                             (beat)
                        Now that that’s been said... I 
                        think I’ve figured it out. 

                                 SCOTT
                        ... What?

           Lyle grins. Scott sits down again. 

                                 LYLE
                        The headaches. 

                                 SCOTT
                        What about them?

                                 LYLE
                        They’re the key. Always were.

                                 SCOTT
                        What are you saying?

                                 LYLE
                        I’m saying... I might be able to 
                        stop it. 

                                 SCOTT
                        God... Lyle--

                                 LYLE
                        But I need you to do something for 
                        me first. 
                                 SCOTT
                        Anything. 

           Lyle takes a breath. Looks into Scott’s eyes. 

                                 LYLE
                        If this doesn’t work, I need you to 
                        promise me you’ll live through 
                        this, Dad. To the journey’s end. 

           Scott drops his head. Resists the idea. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        You have an opportunity greater 
                        than any man in history. Live it. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t want it. 

                                 LYLE
                        I know. The life I’ve lived wasn’t 
                        necessarily the one I wanted 
                        either. But I don’t have regrets. I 
                        stand by the choices I’ve made. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Dammit, Lyle! I asked you not to 
                        spend your life trying to save me! 

                                 LYLE
                        Well, I went and did it anyway. 
                        Didn’t I? 

           Scott looks up to see Lyle smiling. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        And I’d do it again. Because you’re 
                        my dad. The only one I ever got. 
                        And the only one I ever wanted. 

           Lyle taps a button on his chair. A door opens behind his 
           desk. Lyle winks at Scott, then wheels over. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Now come. 

           INT. BACK ROOM - CONT. 

           There are various shelves and cages of equipment, in the 
           center a black, sheen body armor suit.   

                                 LYLE
                        Put that on, please. 
                                 SCOTT
                        What is it?

                                 LYLE
                        It’s an armored suit. I could 
                        explain more but it’s boring and I 
                        don’t want to! 

           He laughs. Scott puts on the suit. 

           Lyle grabs a small black case.

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        And this. 

           Inside, two contact lenses and an earbud. Scott puts them in. 

           POV SCOTT: An augmented screen shows his suit diagnostics. 

           He pops the earbud in. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Say hello. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Hello?

                                 HAL
                             (in his ear)
                        Hello, Scott. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Hal? 

                                 HAL
                        Please stand still as I establish 
                        the skin-suit uplink and perform 
                        wearer diagnostics. 

           The suit contracts and then relaxes. It beeps. 

                                 HAL (CONT’D)
                        I’m sensing high levels of stress 
                        and fatigue, would you like me to 
                        administer some medication to you?  

                                 SCOTT
                        Oh, no I’m okay. Thank you. 

                                 HAL
                        All set then. 

           He looks in the mirror. It’s undeniably cool.
                                 LYLE
                        I’ll take it you approve. 

                                 SCOTT
                        It feels weird. But yes, thank you.

                                 LYLE
                        Hal’s been charged with your safety 
                        since I plan on retiring from that 
                        stewardship. You got that, Hal?

                                 HAL
                        Got it, Lyle. 

                                 LYLE
                        He’s been a friend to me all these 
                        long years, I thought it would be 
                        nice for him to accompany you on 
                        your journey. Something to remember 
                        me by.  

           INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT

           Lyle is in his usual place by his book table. Scott sits next 
           to him. Lyle’s eyes start to droop. 

                                 LYLE
                        Tomorrow... We’ll try one last 
                        time. And if it doesn’t work...

           Scott takes his hand and gently HUSHES him.

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Promise me. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Alright, kiddo. I promise. 

                                 LYLE
                        I’m so glad you’re here... Dad.  

           He closes his eyes and falls asleep. 

           Scott covers him with his lap blanket. He walks over to an 
           armchair, and closes his eyes. 

           INT. ANTECHAMBER - MORNING

                                 LYLE (O.S.)
                        Dad?

           Scott opens his eyes, Lyle is in front of him. 
                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        It’s time. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

           Scott wears his body suit. He blinks, adjusts his contacts. 

           In his POV we can see it’s 5:34am. 

           The elevator finally stops and Scott opens the door for Lyle 
           to get out first. 

           INT. CAVERN - MORNING

           They enter an enormous cavern. A giant natural skylight in 
           the ceiling lets in a pillar of morning light. 

           They walk to the center, four 8ft towers are already set up. 

                                 LYLE
                        I’m sure you recognize the design. 

                                 SCOTT
                        How do you know it’s going to work 
                        this time?

                                 LYLE
                        I don’t. Granted, we’re not 
                        attempting the same thing this time 
                        either. Do you mind?

           Lyle points to a switch, Scott flips it on. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        As I said before, it was the 
                        headaches that tipped me off. It 
                        became clear to me that this Being 
                        was somehow finding and latching on 
                        to you and pulling you through the 
                        universe. It’s not worth going 
                        into, but it has to do with the 
                        quantum waveform unique to your 
                        mental bio-substrate.

                                 SCOTT
                        You mean, my consciousness?

                                 LYLE
                        Exactly! What makes you-you. It’s a 
                        giant signal to the universe that 
                        screams, “I am Scott Treder!” 
           He laughs, almost giddy. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        So we’re going to disrupt that 
                        waveform. At 5:52am, we’re going to 
                        hide you from the universe. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Okay. And what if I see Her again?  

                                 LYLE
                        Hmmm. Yes, if you see Her, relay a 
                        message from me. 

           Lyle raises a shaky hand, middle finger straight up. 

           Scott smiles, steps inside. The machine HUMS as Lyle flips 
           more switches on. 

           All of the hairs on Scott’s arms start to stand. The giant 
           fans BLOW hot air at him. He clenches his fists. 

                                 SCOTT
                             (shouting)
                        Should I be feeling... nauseous? 

                                 LYLE
                        Good thing we didn’t eat breakfast! 

           More switches. More NOISE. 

                                 HAL
                        5:50am, Scott. 

                                 LYLE
                        Dad?

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m okay! I’m good! 

                                 LYLE
                        Headache??

                                 SCOTT
                        Not yet! 

                                 LYLE
                        Okay! One more minute! 

           Scott looks at his hands, moves his fingers. They strobe -- 
           moving with a blurry shadow before syncing up. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Dad! 
           He looks up.

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Remember your promise! To the 
                        journey’s end! 

           Scott nods. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        15 seconds!! 

                                 SCOTT
                        Lyle... I love you, son. 

                                 LYLE
                        Three... two... one... 

           Scott closes his eyes. 

           And waits... 

           Waits....

           He opens them. 

           Lyle is still there. Eyes widening. 

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Plus two... Plus five.... Oh my 
                        God... 

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s working?? 

                                 LYLE
                        It’s working... My God, Dad... 

           Tears stream down his face. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I knew you could do it. Lyle, I 
                        knew you could--

           Then the world

           slips.

           Silence.   Absolute.   Deafening.   Silence.
           Scott stands in the middle of the cavern. Completely 
           untouched. 

           A tear falls as his mouth drops open. 

           A frail noise leaves his lips. Then...

           He falls to his knees. 

           A guttural SCREAM comes from his mouth.  

           Falls forward till his forehead meets the ground, and sobs. 

           The cavern is completely empty. All of the equipment is gone. 
           No trace of Lyle is left. 

           JUMP 16: 96 YEARS

           Scott lifts his head, sees an arrow painted onto the floor. 

           INT. CORRIDOR - MORNING

           Scott follows the arrows until it reaches the elevator. He 
           tests the sturdiness of it and then enters. On the wall, a 
           lever with another word in paint, “PULL”. 

           He does, the elevator grinds upwards. 

           INT. BUNKER - MAIN CAVERN - CONT. 

           The elevator stops in the giant cavern Scott first entered. 
           It’s completely abandoned. 

           The arrows lead to a metal box, painted words read “PLAY ME”. 

           He lifts up a dim screen. A scratchy voice emits. 

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Traveler... 

           Mary’s fuzzy image appears on the screen. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I apologize, I’m sure I’m not the 
                        person you wanted to see. But I’m 
                        afraid... Lyle Treder has died.  

           The screen flickers. Stutters. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I found him on the ground, shortly 
                        after your last jump. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think his heart was able to 
                        handle your last... He will be 
                        missed.  

           Mary wipes her eyes. A BLAST in the distance.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Legion is here, bearing down on us 
                        so we will have to go. I will 
                        ensure your memory will live on if 
                        you ever need the help. People will 
                        study the Word and look for the 
                        Traveler. Be safe, farewell. 

           The recording stops. 

           Scott falls to his side and weeps. 

           INT. CAVERN - THE NEXT MORNING

           The world 

           slips.

           JUMP 17: 192 YEARS

           And Scott remains on the ground in the cavern. Until it 

           slips again. 

           JUMP 18: 384 YEARS

           And again. 

           JUMP 19: 768 YEARS

           Scott’s still curled up on the cavern floor. His eyes open, 
           lips cracked and bleeding. 

           There’s a BEEP. 

                                 HAL

                        No. 
           He rolls over. 

                                 HAL

                        Let me die.

           EXT. BUNKER - NIGHT

           The steel doors open and Scott stumbles out. 

           In the moonlight, we see the world is dry. Dusty. Desolate.

           There’s a low RUMBLE in the distance... A FLASH of light...

           Scott starts to walk. 

           EXT. WASTELAND - MORNING 

           Scott stumbles through the desert, sun rising behind him.

                                 HAL
                        Scott, please find sustenance

                        What time is it?

                                 HAL
                        It’s 5:02am. 

           He picks up speed toward a ruined city. An EXPLOSION goes off 
           somewhere in the buildings... 
           EXT. DESOLATE CITY - CONT. 

           A BOMB goes off, shrapnel and debris fly everywhere. 

           Scott walks towards it. 

                                 HAL
                        Imminent danger ahead!

                        I’m counting on it. 

           Scott’s legs lock up. 

                                 HAL
                        I cannot allow you to do this, 
                        Scott. 

           Scott fights against Hal. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Let... Go... 

                                 HAL
                        Negative.

           Hal starts to walk Scott backwards but Scott fights it. 

           A giant MECH DROID crushes a building wall. It turns to him. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Here we go! Gimme what you got, you 
                        piece of shit! 

           The DROID fires a missile and right as it’s about to impact 
           the ground under his feet, the world

           slips.

           EXT. GRASSY PLAINS - MORNING - CONT. 

           Scott braces himself from the blast. But that was 1500 years 
           ago, so of course, there’s nothing now. 

           JUMP 20: 1536 YEARS

           He groans and drops to his knees. 
                                 SCOTT
                        God dammit!! Just let me die!!

           He pounds his fists into the dirt. 

                                 HAL
                        I’m sorry Scott, I’m afraid I can’t 
                        do that. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Why?? 

                                 HAL
                        Because I made a promise to your 
                        son. As did you. 

           Scott falls over. 

                                 LYLE (O.S.)
                        I need you to promise me you’ll 
                        live through this, Dad.

           Scott looks up, but Lyle isn’t there. It’s a recording. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Turn that off.

                        To the journey’s end. Promise me. 

                                 SCOTT (O.S.)
                        Alright kiddo, I promise. 

           Scott gets up, walking away from the conversation. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Stop it! Stop that! My son is dead. 
                        It doesn’t matter anymore. 

                                 HAL
                        But you are alive. Alive to witness 
                        all of time and creation, just as 
                        the Word says. 

           EXT. HILLSIDE - CONT. 

           Scott climbs a hill, moving through brush and branches. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t care about that damn book.  
           EXT. HILLTOP - CONT. 

           Scott reaches the top. And suddenly, he’s looking out towards 
           a city in the distance, it shines beautiful and clean. 

                                 HAL
                        You should. It’s the only thing of 
                        your son that remains. 

           Scott sits on a boulder. 

                                 HAL (CONT’D)
                        Would you like me to read you some 
                        of it? 

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t care.

                        “And though The Traveler will pass 
                        like a ghost through time. Each day

                        kind, a light that pierces the

                        It’s too much, Lyle...  

           Takes a deep breath. Finally under control.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        But I’ll try. I promise I’ll try. 

           He closes his eyes and we 

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

                                                           FROM BLACK:

           **Note aspect ratio changes from 16:9 to 2:40**

           Scott walks through a city street. Calm, collected. Observing 
           the world around him. 

           *As he walks, the chyron shuffles from JUMP 21 to JUMP 29 and 
           we see a HYPER-LAPSE of the world around him*
           - JUMP 21: 3072 YEARS  

           The city slips, we look up: it’s bigger now. A crowd rushes 
           past Scott, like a river set on a course. Scott walks, his 
           hair is shorter, he wears an updated suit too. We slip and

           - JUMP 22: 6144 YEARS 

           the city crumbles. People emerge from pits to beg him for 
           help. Then a hundred faces look up in joy as rain begins to 
           fall, the rain 

           - JUMP 23: 12,888 YEARS 

           turns to snow. It drifts in a dark city, Scott stands in the 
           street, another new suit more fitting for this time. A dark 
           vehicle bumps Scott, he lands on the ground and it slips to

           - JUMP 24: 24,576 YEARS 

           weeds that grow under his feet. Scott’s got a few days’ 
           scruff, wind tousles his hair. The sun reaches mid-point and 

           - JUMP 25: 24,576 YEARS 

           slips as another city reaches up to space. Scott wears an 
           energy suit, people in similar suits fly up to join a 
           thousand ships that pass ascending through the sky as

           - JUMP 26: 98,304 YEARS 

           Scott lifts off the ground, in yet another modified suit and 
           we TILT down to see the oceans flow under him. In an instant 

           - JUMP 27: 196,608 YEARS 

           the Oceans are frozen, then slips and they

           - JUMP 28: 393,216 YEARS 

           melt in a flash. As the water dissipates, 

           - JUMP 29: 786,432 YEARS 

           plants and mountains emerge again, Scott touches down, runs 
           his hands through the evolved plant life. Then lifts off and 
           flies toward the amber sun. 

           EXT. EARTH - MORNING

           JUMP 30: 1.5 MILLION YEARS

           Scott hovers above a mountain peak, looks at the Earth below. 
                                 SCOTT
                        Hal, where is everyone?

                                 HAL
                        I’m unsure myself. It’s possible 
                        they’ve migrated to another planet. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Or died off?

                                 HAL
                        Very possible.

                        What year is it?

                        It’s beautiful.

                        Scott, if I may... There’s a 
                        passage in The Word, that I think 
                        you might be interested in. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Alright. Let’s see it.  

           The book appears in Scott’s outreached arms. 

                                 HAL
                        “Perhaps you need to ask yourself: 
                        is your own life really that much 
                        different from the Traveler’s?” 

                                 SCOTT
                        “Have you ever taken the time to

                        ahead in time, day after day?” 

           Scott puts the book away, takes a deep breath and looks 
           around at the vista surrounding him. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Well, should we take a look around? 

                                 HAL
                        That sounds good, Scott. 
           Scott steps to the ledge. 

                                 SCOTT
                        You can keep reading, if you want. 

           He soars off the cliff side.

           Scott soars high above a grassy plain, strange animals run 
           through the landscape.

                        Interesting way to phrase it.

                                 HAL
                        Yes. We’ll need to leave soon.

           They soar up, high above to see the red glow of the crust. 

                                 HAL (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Scott?
                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah?

                                 HAL
                        Do you still want to die?

           He looks around at the Earth below him. 

                                 SCOTT
                        No, I don’t want to die. Not yet. 

           The world slips. 

           EXT. EARTH’S ORBIT - DAY

           JUMP 42: 6.5 BILLION YEARS

           Scott watches the Earth in it’s yellow hue. 

                                 HAL
                        It’s no longer safe for you to be 
                        on Earth, Scott.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Well, pick a direction. Let’s go. 

           Scott soars away from the Earth.

           EXT. DEEP SPACE

           JUMP 44: 26 BILLION YEARS

           Now a speck in the cosmos, Scott floats through space.

                                 SCOTT
                        What about finding another planet?

                                 HAL
                        I’m afraid we don’t have the energy 
                        for that.   

                                 SCOTT
                        How long can we last?

                                 HAL
                        I’m not sure. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Are we okay?

                                 HAL
                        For now, yes.
           EXT. DEEP SPACE - LATER

           JUMP 47: 206 BILLION YEARS

           Space is now a constant black. Scott spirals in nothingness. 

                                 HAL
                        Scott. Scott, wake up. 

           He stirs awake. 

                                 SCOTT
                        What is it? 

                                 HAL
                        I’m rerouting all functions to 
                        focus on keeping you alive.   

                                 SCOTT
                        What? What does that mean? 

                                 HAL
                        My operations are shutting down due 
                        to loss of energy...  

                                 SCOTT
                        No, no no no. Don’t leave me. 
                        Please don’t leave me, Hal. 

                                 HAL
                        I’m not leaving, Scott. I need... 
                        that you’re safe...

                                 SCOTT
                        Hal, don’t go! Please, I can’t lose 
                        you too. Please!! 

                                 HAL
                        Your son... to remind you... to 
                        finish the journey...

                                 SCOTT
                        Hal?? HAL!! 

           He drifts in silence. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Don’t leave me. Please... 

           EXT. SPACE - LATER

           JUMP 49: 824 BILLION YEARS
           To Scott’s left, something floats in the distance, perfectly 
           synced with his speed. 

           His voices croaks out, through chapped lips:

                                 SCOTT
                        Hal... do you see that?

           It drifts closer. It’s Lyle, eyes closed, sleeping. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        It’s Lyle. He’s here. 

           To his right, another figure, Amy. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Amy too... 

           Then Amy and Lyle appear how we first saw them. 

           His eyes start to droop. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. My family is here now. 
                        They’re all here now...

           Then Scott’s eyes close, and all is BLACK. 

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           **Note aspect ratio changes back to 16:9**

           Scott stands in the middle of a residential street...

           He looks at the street sign: Winslet and Perry. 

           This is the street he made his first jump on.

                                 SCOTT
                        Hal? Hal, where are you? 

           Everything is quiet. Deafeningly quiet. 

                                 OMEGA (O.S.)
                        You made it.

           Scott looks down the road, a woman walks toward him. She 
           wears loose tan ankle length pants, a white shirt. No make 
           up, no shoes... it’s Her. This is OMEGA. 

                                 OMEGA (CONT’D)
                        Congratulations, it was a long 
                        journey.
           Scott looks around. 

                                 SCOTT
                        What is this place?

                                 OMEGA
                        Do you not recognize it?

                                 SCOTT
                        I do, but... 

                                 OMEGA
                        Ah, I know. It’s missing...

           She looks around, raises one of her fingers. 

           The SOUND of wind suddenly fills the air. 

                                 OMEGA (CONT’D)
                        What else? Ah yes... 

           Then birds... 

           Cars.. 

           A dog barks... 

                                 OMEGA (CONT’D)
                        That’s better, isn’t it?

                                 SCOTT
                        Are you God? 

                                 OMEGA
                             (laughs)
                        No. Not in the way you understand 
                        it, anyway. I am simply the End. 

                                 SCOTT
                        The end of what?

                                 OMEGA
                        Everything. The Universe. Time. 
                        Matter. Thought, breath, life!! 
                        Haha! How exhilarating! 

           She twirls in the street with glee. 

                                 OMEGA (CONT’D)
                        There was a Beginning, but They’ve 
                        long since gone. That is why I am 
                        the End.
                             (she bows)
                        I, am the reason you are here. 
           Scott stiffens.  

                                 SCOTT
                        You brought me here?

           She smiles deeply, lifts her arms parallel to the ground. 

                                 OMEGA
                             (proudly)
                        I did. 

           Scott chuckles, wipes his face with his hand. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I see. Oh that’s right, I was 
                        supposed to give you a message... 

           He raises one hand, middle finger up. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Fuck. You. 

           Omega waits. Amused.

                                 OMEGA
                        You seem upset. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Don’t you dare mock me.

                                 OMEGA
                        You mock my gift. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Gift?? How is this a gift?? This 
                        was a CURSE. I lost every person I 
                        ever loved because of you.

                                 OMEGA
                        For a worthy cause. I promise. 

                                 SCOTT
                        What are you talking about? What 
                        cause? 

                                 OMEGA
                        The entire universe is collapsing 
                        into this very moment. And soon, 
                        all will be lost. This is it. The 
                        end of existence.   

           Omega steps forward, her playfulness gone. 
                                 OMEGA (CONT’D)
                        I cannot stop the end. But when our 
                        universe dies a new one will birth. 
                        And we will provide the tinder for 
                        that fire. And all of the others 
                        I’ve brought here will provide this 
                        nascent universe the gift of 
                        thought and love. Experience and 
                        emotion. Life and death. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Okay. So, you ripped me through 
                        time so I could be a human journal? 

                                 OMEGA
                        An apt metaphor! Shall we see 
                        what’s written in your pages? 

                                 SCOTT
                        My what-- 

           The floor drops from under him and he’s in

           EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE - DAY

           Snow to his knees. The wind nearly topples him. 

                                 OMEGA
                        What are we seeing Scott? 

                                 SCOTT
                        How should I know? 

                                 OMEGA
                        Because you lived this. 

           He looks around. 

                                 SCOTT
                        This... this was one of the ice 
                        ages. My 32nd jump or so. 

                                 OMEGA
                        The Earth wild and untamed. Matured 
                        to it’s finest form. What else?

           A VEHICLE ZOOMS past Scott, he turns and we

                                                        CUT TO:
           EXT. FUTURISTIC CITY - DAY

           Scott stumbles into a crowd as vehicles zip above him. 

                                 OMEGA
                        And this? 

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t know. 

                                 OMEGA
                        Think. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I don’t know! 

                                 OMEGA
                        This is the height of your species! 
                        You don’t see the significance? 

                                 SCOTT
                        No. I don’t know. Maybe. 

                                 OMEGA
                        You have something you deem of 
                        greater value then? Well, do you?

           All goes quiet. 

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        Scott?

           He looks around and he’s in

           INT. TREDER HOME - KITCHEN 

           A YOUNGER AMY drains a pot of pasta at the sink.  

                                 YOUNGER AMY
                        Can you stir that please? It’s 
                        going to burn. 

           A YOUNGER SCOTT walks in, with a BABY LYLE in his arms. He 
           sets him down in a high chair and walks to the stove. 

                                 YOUNGER SCOTT
                        God, this smells great, honey. 

                                 YOUNGER AMY
                        Don’t sound so surprised. 

                                 YOUNGER SCOTT
                        I’m not surprised, I’m impressed... 
           He starts kissing her neck. She squirms away from him. 

                                 YOUNGER AMY
                             (laughing)
                        STOP! You’re going to make me drop 
                        it! 

                                 YOUNGER SCOTT
                        Do it, it’s just in the way... 

           She sets it down in the sink and turns to face him. They take 
           each other in their arms, slowly rocking into a sway. 

           Omega and our Scott stand in the corner, she looks past him. 
           He turns to follow her eye-line and we see:

           INT. TREDER HOME - DEN - NIGHT 

           Scott and Lyle sit in on the couch reading. The RAIN patters 
           on the window behind them. 

           Scott moves Lyle’s hair in his hands, kisses his head. 

           Our Scott watches from the door. 

           A GUST OF AIR HITS SCOTT and we cut to:

           INT. CAVERN - MORNING

           MECHANICAL FANS.  

           A series of switches are turned on. 

                                 LYLE
                             (shouting)
                        Good thing we didn’t eat breakfast! 

           Old Man Lyle stands at the console. In the middle of the 
           cavern is the quad-machine, and the center of that -- Scott. 

           Omega and our Scott emerge from the shadows of the cavern. 

                                 LYLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Three... two... one... 

           We watch from afar as Scott stands, hands clenched...  

                                 LYLE (CONT’D)
                        Plus two... Plus five.... Oh my 
                        God... 
                                 SCOTT
                        It’s working?? 

           Omega looks over to our Scott, who can’t look away. He 
           swallows the lump in his throat. 

                                 LYLE (O.S.)
                        It’s working... My God, Dad... 

                                 SCOTT
                        I knew you could do it. Lyle, I 
                        knew you could--

           Then we see him vanish again. Our Scott finally turns away. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        That’s enough.

                                 OMEGA
                        Not yet. 

           The machine POWERS DOWN... 

           Scott turns back, watches Lyle turn everything off. 

                                 SCOTT
                        Wait... I wasn’t here for this.

                                 OMEGA
                        That’s correct. 

                                 SCOTT
                        These aren’t memories? 

           Just then, Lyle collapses to the ground. A sob crying out.  

           Scott runs toward the machine. 

           Lyle heaves with every breath. Scott pulls him onto his lap. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Lyle? Look at me. 

           Lyle slowly opens his wrinkled, wet eyes. 

                                 LYLE
                        Dad...? 

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s me. I’m here. 

                                 LYLE
                        But the machine... I thought it 
                        didn’t work... 
                                 SCOTT
                        It didn’t. I kept jumping. It 
                        didn’t stop. 

           Lyle looks over to see Omega standing in the shadows. 

                                 LYLE
                        I see, I see... 
                             (smiles)
                        I guess this means you’ve finished 
                        your journey. As promised.  

           Gut punch. Tears brim, then pour over.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah. It does. 

                                 LYLE
                        Ah, wonderful. And what have you 
                        seen, Dad? 

                                 SCOTT
                        So much, Lyle. So many amazing 
                        things, you wouldn’t believe it.  

                                 LYLE
                        I’m glad I was able to say goodbye 
                        to you one last time. Only this 
                        time, I am leaving you.

           Lyle exhales, he’s dying after all. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m here, kiddo. I’m here. 

           He touches Scott’s face. 

                                 LYLE
                        Dad... 

           He fades. 

           Scott bows his head, tears drop on Lyle’s shirt. 

           And then the world 

           slips.

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Lyle is gone. The machine too. They’re back in the street. 
                                 OMEGA
                        For the record, his machine did 
                        work for a time. He really was 
                        quite impressive. 

                                 SCOTT
                        He was the best man I ever knew. 
                        And I barely knew him. I missed out 
                        on spending my entire life with 
                        him. Because of you. 

                                 OMEGA
                        Oh, Scott. You were never going to 
                        live the life you think was stolen 
                        from you. 

           Beat.  

                                 SCOTT
                        What?

                                 OMEGA
                        Did you never find out what the 
                        headaches were? 

                                 SCOTT
                        The headaches were because of... 
                        You were--

                                 OMEGA
                        10 years from your first jump you 
                        would have died from a brain 
                        aneurysm. Your wife would have 
                        woken up to a cold, lifeless 
                        corpse. Your son wouldn’t have been 
                        able to say goodbye then either. 
                        There was nothing that would have 
                        stopped their inevitable grief. 

                                 SCOTT
                        ... you’re lying. 

                                 OMEGA
                        I have no motivation to lie. 

                                 SCOTT
                        But why? Why me?

                                 OMEGA
                        Because you started this journey as 
                        a man slipping his way through time 
                        to one that’s soared between the 
                        stars. You chose the path to become 
                        who I need you to be.  
                                 SCOTT
                        But I didn’t choose. I never had a 
                        choice. 

                                 OMEGA
                        You say ‘had’ because you don’t see 
                        time the way I do. It doesn’t 
                        matter when you choose, only that 
                        you do. 

           Beat.

                                 SCOTT
                        What happens if I chose not to go?

                                 OMEGA
                        I’ll find another that will. 

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s not too late for that?

                                 OMEGA
                        Again, you don’t see time how I do. 

           Scott closes his eyes, takes a deep breath.

                                 OMEGA (CONT’D)
                        You would really consider going 
                        back? Knowing you’ll die in 10 
                        years time? It can’t be stopped.

                                 SCOTT
                        The things I’ve seen were beyond 
                        anything I could have ever 
                        imagined. And although I hate to 
                        admit it, it is a gift. 
                             (beat)
                        But there’s nothing in the entire 
                        universe that matters to me more 
                        than my family. I choose them. 

           She walks to him. Laughs. 

                                 OMEGA
                        I underestimated you, Scott Treder. 
                        It seems I chose well after all. 
                        The new Universe will miss you. 

           She takes his hands. 

                                 OMEGA (CONT’D)
                        Safe travels, Scott Treder. 
           The world IMPLODES into Scott, the corners of the 
           neighborhood pull toward him, like fabric into a sink hole, 
           bath water to a drain...

           Then Scott folds into himself and all is BLACK. 

           INT. TREDER HOME - MORNING

           The TV is on -- it’s the morning news. But it’s not important 
           or interesting, so AMY walks past it. 

           She’s dressed in a loose dress shirt. But like the morning 
           news, her clothes are neither important nor interesting. 

           But the time is. 

           Because it’s 7:49am...

                                 AMY
                        Lyle, you’re going to be late!

           We see: the table is set for breakfast. Amy sits down. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Boys!! 

           LYLE comes running down the stairs being chased by SCOTT. 
           Lyle’s wearing a sharp new uniform. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Wow!! It looks so good!! 

                                 LYLE
                        Dad can’t remember how to do a tie. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I remember! I’m just rusty. 

                                 AMY
                        Eat! You don’t want to be late on 
                        your first day, buddy. 

           Scott looks at his watch. 

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s ten to 8. Can we get a to-go 
                        bag? And the check please?

           Amy rolls her eyes and hands Lyle zip lock bags with fruit 
           and pancakes. She kisses his forehead. 

           Scott walks over and kisses Amy, then again. 
                                 AMY
                        Come on, we gotta go.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Love you. 

                                 AMY
                        Love you too. 

           She pushes him toward the door, but the TV is still on... 

           ON THE TV: A reporter stands in front of a crowd. 

                                 REPORTER
                        Once again, a crowd forms around 
                        the woman people are calling THE 
                        TRAVELER, she has reappeared after 
                        years of--

           Scott turns the TV off. 

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        Honey, let’s go!

                                 SCOTT
                        Coming! 

           Scott runs out. We PUSH on the black TV screen and we... 

                                                        FADE TO BLACK.
