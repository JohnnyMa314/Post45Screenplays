           In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, 
           nations, and epochs, it is the rule.

                                                       -Friedrich Nietzsche
           INT. MANSION - LAKE COMO, ITALY - NIGHT

           CLOSE UP ON: Two female hands, dark red fingernails, 
           unsheathing a vinyl record. The hands gently place it on a 
           VINTAGE RECORD PLAYER and drop the needle.

           Radiohead’s EXIT MUSIC (FOR A FILM) starts to play as we PAN 
           OUT to see -- a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN (30s, brunette), inside of 
           one of the most absurd bedrooms imaginable. A king-sized bed 
           with gold satin sheets. A movie theatre projector. Gold 
           chandeliers. Windows overlooking all of Lake Como.

           The woman -- who we’ll call ADALENE -- enters her walk-in 
           closet, filled with millions of dollars worth of designer 
           clothes. No emotion on her face.

                                 RADIOHEAD
                        Wake from your sleep / The drying 
                        of your tears / Today we escape / 
                        We escape...

           She drags her hand across the expensive, colorful dresses 
           until she finally finds the one she’s looking for.

           A simple white one, buried far at the end...

           LATER -- 

           The melody continues as Adalene sits in front of a vanity, 
           carefully applying RED LIPSTICK and HEAVY, BLACK EYE SHADOW. 
           Her hair is half up, half down.

                                 RADIOHEAD (CONT’D)
                        Pack and get dressed / Before your 
                        father hears us / Before all hell 
                        breaks loose...

           She finishes her makeup routine and grabs a LAPEL PIN off of 
           the vanity. It’s CRYSTAL and GOLD and says ‘SP’. She twirls 
           the sharp end in her fingers, looking out at the lake...

           EXT. MANSION - LAKE COMO, ITALY - NIGHT

           Adalene exits the mansion, which we finally see in it’s 
           entirety -- a massive white house, three stories, right on 
           the edge of the lake.

           She walks through the illustrious backyard -- past an 
           IRIDESCENT POOL with ‘SP’ painted on the bottom, ORANGE 
           trees, a FIRE PIT, a CABANA.
           As she approaches the edge of the water, we see BLOOD 
           dripping from her SLIT WRISTS. The crystal ‘SP’ pin is now 
           affixed to her dress, droplets of BLOOD surrounding it..

                                 RADIOHEAD
                        You can laugh a spineless laugh / 
                        We hope your rules and wisdom choke 
                        you...

           The dark water is covered in an eerie mist. She looks over 
           the blackness with hollow eyes before slowly WALKING INTO THE 
           WATER. She keeps walking, not blinking...until the water is 
           up to her WAIST...then her NECK...the music BUILDS...

                                 RADIOHEAD (CONT’D)
                        We hope that you choke, that you 
                        choke / We hope that you choke, 
                        that you choke...

           And finally, she disappears under the water. The haunting 
           song fades to silence as we STAY ON THE WATER --

                                 RADIOHEAD (CONT’D)
                        We hope that you choke...that you 
                        choke...

           The fog crawls over the water. Adalene is gone.

           TITLE CARD: DOLLHOUSE

           INT. CASTING STUDIO - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

           Two DOZEN MODELS stand side by side in black bras and 
           underwear, the four walls surrounding them nothing but 
           gleaming mirrors. They hold NUMBERED CARDS.

           We focus on one of them -- MIA (19, blonde) -- holding NUMBER 
           ELEVEN. The paper slightly trembles in her hand. 

           At the front of the room, a JAPANESE DESIGNER (50s, female) 
           sits behind a plastic fold out table with by her assistant.

           The model holding NUMBER TEN does her runway walk. Whatever 
           “it” is, she has it. The Designer whispers to her assistant, 
           who looks up --

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Please grab your things and move to 
                        the next room.

           Elated, NUMBER TEN grabs her things, shuffling out of sight.
                                 ASSISTANT (CONT’D)
                        Number eleven.

           Mia takes a deep breath, steps to the center of the room. 
           Alone. All eyes on her. Fluorescent lights BLINDING her. It’s 
           claustrophobic. A bead of sweat drips down her forehead.

                                 ASSISTANT (CONT’D)
                        Name?

                                 MIA
                        Mia Dawes.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Measurements?

                                 MIA
                        Five-ten. One-twenty-one.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Go ahead.

           Mia turns and does her runway walk to the back of the room. 
           It’s nothing like Number Ten -- Mia has a fake confidence, 
           one that can’t hide her nerves and insecurities.

           She returns. The Designer whispers to her assistant. Mia 
           breathes rapidly, eyes darting back and forth.

                                 ASSISTANT (CONT’D)
                        You may go.

           Crushed, Mia rushes to grab her things...

           INT. PENTHOUSE - MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           A massive party in the penthouse suite of a Manhattan high-
           rise. An infinity pool on the outside deck, where Wall Street 
           bros in suits and rich kids in Supreme suck Juuls and try to 
           pitch apps to disinterested, fucked up fashion models.

           INT. BATHROOM - PENTHOUSE - SAME

           Mia does her makeup in the mirror. ALIX (20, African-
           American), her best friend and roommate, snorts a line of 
           coke off the sink as their other best friend SOPHIE (20, 
           brunette) throws up in the toilet.

                                 MIA
                        Why do I keep getting sent on these 
                        bullshit auditions?
                                 ALIX
                        Who was it for?

                                 MIA
                        I can’t even remember.

                                 SOPHIE
                             (throwing up)
                        I think I have alcohol poisoning.

                                 ALIX
                        Maybe you’re pregnant.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Fuck off.

           Alix offers Mia a line. She shakes her head ‘no’.

                                 MIA
                        I haven’t booked anything in 
                        months. If I don’t get something 
                        soon I’m gonna have to work at a 
                        fucking Starbucks to make rent.

                                 SOPHIE
                        No way you can make your guys rent 
                        working at a Starbucks --

                                 ALIX
                        Why don’t you talk to Drew? 

                                 MIA
                        Fuck Drew.

                                 ALIX
                        I don’t understand why you hate him 
                        so much. He’s not that bad --

                                 SOPHIE
                        I mean at a managerial level, 
                        maybe. But even then, after taxes --

                                 MIA
                        Jesus Christ, I was joking.

           Sophie throws up again, wipes her mouth --

                                 SOPHIE
                        Okay, I for sure have alcohol 
                        poisoning.

                                 ALIX
                        Talk to him. He can help. If you’re 
                        not booking, why not?
           Off Mia’s face. Hating that Alix has a point.

           EXT. POOL - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

           Alix lights a cigarette as she and Mia overlook the Manhattan 
           skyline. THE STROKES ‘SOMEDAY’ play over speakers.

                                 ALIX
                        You’re gonna be fine. Everybody has 
                        dry spells.

                                 MIA
                        I don’t know if mine is just a 
                        spell.

           Sophie arrives with drinks, a MAN (late 20s, covered in 
           tattoos, man bun) helping her. This is DREW.

                                 DREW
                        Ladies, wonderful to see you. 
                        Thanks for coming.

           He makes eye contact with Mia. She barely offers a smile.

                                 ALIX
                        Of course. What’s the occasion?

                                 DREW
                        Well, you know that place we did 
                        your shoots? I finally put a down 
                        payment on it. I officially have my 
                        own studio now.

           Mia gives them an odd look. What? 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Ooh la la! Congratulations! What 
                        about the job? Did you get it?

                                 DREW
                        I did. And thank you both so much 
                        for helping, seriously.

                                 ALIX
                        It was fun. What campaign is it?

           He puts his finger to his lips and smiles.

                                 DREW
                        Can’t talk about it. Confidential.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Ah, Mr. Big Shot now, huh? 
                                 ALIX
                        Congratulations, Drew.

                                 DREW
                        Thank you. And congrats again on 
                        Dior. I’m happy I could help.

           Mia’s face goes white. So do Alix’s and Sophie’s. Drew senses 
           the tension -- they haven’t told her yet.

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        Anyways, uh -- nice to see you 
                        guys. Thanks for coming.

           He leaves. Mia turns to them --

                                 MIA
                        Did you shoot with him?

                                 ALIX
                        Not like that -- I mean, yes, I 
                        did. But he was trying to get this 
                        new job and I needed to update my 
                        portfolio anyways. He said he knew 
                        the casting director at Dior and --

                                 SOPHIE
                        -- we auditions. But they’re just 
                        auditions. But if he knows these 
                        people, why not use him for it? 

           Mia looks like she’s been betrayed. She looks out over the 
           city, and spots a BILLBOARD on a building in the distance. 

           It’s BRIGHT RED with BLACK SPLOTCHES on it that look like 
           DROPLETS OF BLOOD. In BLACK TEXT stretching from the bottom 
           left to the top right, it says -- COMING SOON.

           Mia fixates on it for a moment. It’s...unusual. But gripping.

           INT. UBER - NIGHT

           Mia looks out the window, an emptiness in her eyes as 
           Manhattan passes her by. It seems every second there’s 
           another fashion billboard -- BURBERRY. CHANEL. YSL. RALPH 
           LAUREN. She stares at the beautiful girls, feeling small.

           The radio plays --
                                 NPR (O.S.)
                        ...is reporting that notorious 
                        Parisian fashion designer Marceau 
                        de Saint-Pierre, who suffered a 
                        mental breakdown five years ago, is 
                        planning a return to fashion this --

           The driver changes it to a horrible song by The Chainsmokers 
           (all of them). She leans her head back and SIGHS.

           INT. BATHROOM - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mia stands naked on a scale. 124. She SIGHS and opens a 
           drawer filled with dozens of PILL BOTTLES. She finds one 
           that’s full and swallows three pills dry.

           She stares in the mirror, examining her features. Touching 
           the skin on her face, tugging at her waist, messing with her 
           hair, looking at her backside. She hates what she sees.

           She climbs into bed and puts in her AirPods, clicking play on 
           a podcast on her phone called ‘HOW TO CONQUER YOUR ANXIETY’. 
           A soothing, male voice starts to speak.

                                 PODCAST (O.S.)
                        Anxiety is a natural human 
                        response. It is a positive reaction 
                        from the central nervous system -- 
                        however, if it begins to intensify 
                        in everyday situations, it can make 
                        it difficult to function...

           Her eyes flutter as the drugs kick in.

           INT. DR. WOODARD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Mia sits on a couch across from psychiatrist DR. HELEN 
           WOODARD (50s) in a Manhattan high rise. She nervously picks 
           at her nails. 

                                 MIA
                        It’s not that they don’t deserve it 
                        but it’s just like -- I’ve been out 
                        here for three years and haven’t 
                        made a dent. Why isn’t anything 
                        good happening to me?

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        That’s a very reasonable response. 
                        You work just as hard, it must be 
                        tough to see them succeed while you 
                        struggle. 
                                 MIA
                        It is. It really is.

           She glances out the window where a group of CONSTRUCTION 
           WORKERS struggle with a giant, rolled up TARP on top of the 
           high-rise across the street.

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        How’s your weight?

                                 MIA
                             (lying)
                        One-thirty.

           Dr. Woodard gives her a look. Watches as she bites her nails.

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        Nails.

           Mia sits on her hands. It’s clear they’ve been over this. She 
           looks out the window again -- fascinated as the construction 
           workers secure the tarp with ropes...

                                 MIA
                        Okay, one-twenty-four. But I’ve 
                        been so stressed lately. I can 
                        barely eat, I have no money -- I 
                        might have to stop seeing you.

                                 DR. WOODARD 
                             (alarmed)
                        I really don’t think that’s a good 
                        idea, Mia --

                                 MIA
                        I might not have a choice.

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        Let me know if money is too tight 
                        and we will figure out a system. 
                        How are the night terrors?

                                 MIA
                        Fine. I haven’t had any in a while. 
                        But I was wondering if we could 
                        increase my medication? With my 
                        anxiety so bad I can’t sleep.

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        We could, but the goal of therapy 
                        is to conquer your anxiety without 
                        depending on a cocktail of 
                        chemicals. Have you been listening 
                        to the podcast I recommended?
           Mia nods as her eyes drift out the window, just as the 
           workers let the tarp go and it UNFURLS TO THE STREET BELOW -- 

           It’s the same BLACK and RED COMING SOON billboard she saw the 
           night before. Only this time, it’s MASSIVE, covering the 
           entire side of the building.

           Dr. Woodard sees she’s zoning out.

                                 DR. WOODARD (CONT’D)
                        Mia?

                                 MIA
                        What? -- no, yeah, I’ve been 
                        listening to it. It helps.

           Dr. Woodard sees something else as her attention. She SIGHS, 
           reaches for the her prescription pad --

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        We’ll increase the dosage to one-
                        point-five milligrams. But please, 
                        listen to the podcast. Talk with 
                        me. Don’t just take the pills. 

           She hands the script to Mia, eyes still on the billboard --

           INT. CASTING AGENCY - DAY

           Mia sits across from her agent, AMANDA (30s), in a sleek 
           office with framed fashion magazines on the wall. 

                                 MIA
                        You’re firing me?

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m not firing you Mia, I’m just --
                        thinking that you should start 
                        looking for other representation.

                                 MIA
                        That’s what firing means. I’ve been 
                        with you for two years. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I know. And I’ve -- we’ve -- loved 
                        having you here. But let’s just 
                        look at it for what it is. You’re 
                        not getting any work. 
                                 MIA
                        I’m not getting any work because 
                        the jobs you’re sending me on are 
                        bullshit. I’m doing my best --

                                 AMANDA
                        Right. But you’re not booking them. 

                                 MIA
                        But if you sent me on more high 
                        fashion auditions, something more 
                        tailored to my look --

                                 AMANDA
                        The auditions aren’t the problem, 
                        Mia.

           Ouch. Mia is visibly upset. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Listen. You’re great. You know I 
                        love you. But this -- relationship, 
                        partnership, whatever you want to 
                        call it -- is not lucrative. It has 
                        to be lucrative. 

                                 MIA
                        And where am I supposed to go? 

                                 AMANDA
                        There’s plenty of smaller agencies 
                        that might be a better fit.

           Mia looks around -- for the first time, we see the whole 
           office. There’s, like, five people there.

                                 MIA
                        A smaller agency? How much fucking 
                        smaller can you get? There’s 
                        literally five people here. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m sorry, Mia. It’s nothing 
                        personal. 

           Off Mia’s face, panic and dread setting in --

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Dejected, Mia walks into the apartment carrying an iced 
           coffee -- when a man in a HELLRAISER MASK JUMPS OUT AT HER. 
           She SCREAMS, drops her coffee. JOSH (34), Alix’s Wall Street 
           frat-bro boyfriend, takes the mask off, laughing.
                                 MIA
                        What the fuck!

                                 JOSH
                        I’m sorry. I thought you were Alix.

                                 MIA
                        Alix is black.

                                 JOSH
                        What? I know. It’s hard to see 
                        behind the mask -- here, let me 
                        clean that up.

           He goes to get a mop.

                                 MIA
                        Don’t you have a job or something?

                                 JOSH
                        I left early to surprise Alix. 
                        We’re going to Lavo to celebrate if 
                        you wanna come. My friend Kevin’s 
                        gonna be there, you would love him -

                                 MIA
                        I think your toxic masculinity is 
                        enough for me, thank you.

                                 JOSH
                        Very funny. You know who else has a 
                        great sense of humor? Kevin. You 
                        should really come.

           Mia walks to the kitchen, stepping over the spill --

                                 MIA
                        I don’t even know what I’d talk to 
                        your frat-boy friends about -- 
                        Entourage? Coachella?

                                 JOSH
                             (shrugging)
                        I mean, yeah, we love both of --

                                 MIA
                        Wait -- what are you celebrating?

           Alix comes in the door --

                                 JOSH
                        There she is! The new face of Dior!

           He picks her up and swings her around. Mia’s face goes WHITE. 
                                 JOSH (CONT’D)
                        I’m so proud of you. I’m proud of 
                        me too for dating a supermodel, but 
                        mostly you.

                                 ALIX
                        Thank you. What’s with the mask?

           Josh looks down at the Hellraiser mask in his hand --

                                 JOSH
                        Oh, I was gonna scare you but I 
                        thought you were Mia.

                                 ALIX
                        Mia? I’m black.

                                 JOSH
                        Jesus Christ, I know you’re black --

                                 MIA
                        You got it?

           Alix notices Mia for the first time.

                                 ALIX
                        Yeah. I got the call today. 

                                 MIA
                        Congratulations.

           Alix walks closer, sympathetic.

                                 ALIX
                        They should’ve at least given you 
                        an audition, Mia. Some of those 
                        girls were so out of place. It was 
                        more luck than anything.

                                 JOSH
                        Luck? It’s not luck, you earned 
                        this. You work so hard --

                                 ALIX
                             (snapping)
                        Shut up, Josh.

           He does.

                                 MIA
                        He’s right. You earned it. 

           Mia smiles and embraces her, trying not to fucking explode --
           INT. BACHELOR PAD - NIGHT

           Moonlight streams through the window as Mia rides Drew. We 
           CLOSE UP on her eyes -- emptiness. Self-hatred. Desperation.

           LATER --

           Drew lights a cigarette as Mia lays next to him. Tattoos 
           decorate his chest and stomach.

                                 MIA
                        I need help.

                                 DREW
                        I figured.

                                 MIA
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 DREW
                        I knew there was a catch.

                                 MIA
                        A ‘catch’? Fuck you. I’m talking to 
                        you as a friend right now.

                                 DREW
                        Yeah, a day after you wouldn’t even 
                        look at me at my own party. I know 
                        what you’ve said about me.

                                 MIA
                        I was seventeen when I moved out 
                        here. You were the first 
                        photographer I met and all you did 
                        was try to fuck me.

                                 DREW
                        Fuck you? I liked you, Mia. There’s 
                        a difference.

                                 MIA
                        Well I didn’t know that, okay? I’m 
                        sorry. But I’m really struggling 
                        right now. My agent dropped me and 
                        I haven’t booked anything in 
                        months.

           He exhales smoke. Looks at her for a moment.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        What about your new job?

           He considers. Debating on what to say...
                                 DREW
                        This new campaign is big. They’re 
                        not going through agencies or 
                        anything, it’s all really close to 
                        the chest. They’re going for a real 
                        specific look. I think you could be 
                        a good fit but --

                                 MIA
                        Really?

                                 DREW
                        Yes -- but it’s not a walk in the 
                        park. It isn’t a normal show.

                                 MIA
                        Then what is it?

                                 DREW
                        Marceau de Saint-Pierre’s new line. 
                        He’s calling it Dollhouse.

                                 MIA
                        Saint-Pierre? I thought he 
                        disappeared. Didn’t he have some 
                        kind of breakdown or something?

                                 DREW
                        Nobody really knows what happened, 
                        but he’s coming back. 

                                 MIA
                        And you think I’d have a shot?

                                 DREW
                        I got a picture of the kind of girl 
                        they want. I already submitted 
                        Sophie and she got an audition. 
                        You’d be great but...

           He looks away, voice trailing off. Hesitant.

                                 MIA
                        What?

                                 DREW
                        There are stories about him.

                                 MIA
                        What do you mean?
                                 DREW
                        He’s a perfectionist. Obsessive. He 
                        has a history of pushing people too 
                        far. And I know you had, you 
                        know...you were struggling, 
                        mentally, for a while --

                                 MIA
                             (snapping)
                        I’m fine.

           He nods. Not trying to press, but not sure he believes her.

                                 DREW
                        Okay. Come by tomorrow.

           A look of hope in Mia’s eyes --

           INT. MAKE-UP ROOM - DREW’S STUDIO - MORNING

           Mia sits in a make-up chair as a stylist, HANNAH (late 20s, 
           short hair) does her hair and makeup.

                                 HANNAH
                        You have beautiful skin.

                                 MIA
                        Thank you.

                                 HANNAH
                        You’re a stylist’s wet dream. 
                        Naturally beautiful. Easy.

           Mia blushes. Enjoys getting a compliment for once.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        I’m Hannah, by the way.

                                 MIA
                        Mia. Nice to meet you.

                                 HANNAH
                        So how do you know Drew?

                                 MIA
                        I met him a few years ago when I 
                        first moved here. You?

                                 HANNAH
                        I worked with him on the H&M 
                        campaign. I’ve been doing freelance 
                        for him and I’m hoping he can get 
                        me on Dollhouse. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HANNAH (CONT'D)
                        Working for Saint-Pierre would be a 
                        dream come true.
                             (then)
                        He’s had a few girls in here but 
                        none are like you. You have exactly 
                        what they want.

           Mia BEAMS.

           INT. DREW’S STUDIO - DAY

           The studio is pitch black, save for a few BRIGHT LIGHTS set 
           up illuminating a mattress. Drew stands on a LADDER above --

           MIA, laying naked in a bed of ROSES. An ode to the iconic 
           scene in AMERICAN BEAUTY. A few petals cover her, her hair 
           sprawled out. She looks exactly like MENA SUVARI.

           SLOW MOTION: A few petals rain down on Mia as the cameras 
           FLASH. For the first time, she seems confident. Proud. Like 
           she was born to do this.

           INT. DREW’S OFFICE - DAY

           Mia wears a robe while Drew pulls up the photos from the 
           shoot on his computer. We see the American Beauty shot, which 
           looks almost identical to the movie. 

           There’s another of her in a WHITE DRESS, smiling at camera, 
           with red lipstick and black eye shadow. Her hair half up and 
           half down. Looking exactly like...ADALENE...

                                 DREW
                        Amazing. This is exactly what he 
                        wants, you look just like her.

                                 MIA
                        Who?

                                 DREW
                        The girl. The picture he sent me.

           Mia can’t take her eyes off herself on screen.

                                 MIA
                        You’ll send them over today?

                                 DREW
                        As soon as I do some editing.

           Mia stares at the computer, a confidence building... 
           INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

           The train is empty save for four or five passengers. Mia 
           listens to her anxiety podcast and bites her nails. She 
           watches as a HOMELESS MAN across from her scratches at an 
           infection on his neck, laughing uncontrollably at nothing.

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        ...we have to face our demons and 
                        find the root cause of our 
                        anxieties. And remember, our fears 
                        and insecurities can manifest 
                        themselves in a variety of ways...

           Uncomfortable, Mia looks away from the man when --

           A DROPLET OF BLACK INK lands on her hand. 

           She stares at it when suddenly, ANOTHER DROPLET lands on her 
           thigh. Then on the ground. She looks up and sees --

           ‘DOLLHOUSE’ scrawled across the ceiling in WET, BLACK PAINT. 
           Fresh, as if it had just been painted. She looks around but 
           nobody else notices. Suddenly, she sees --

           A WOMAN. Staring at her from the end of the car. Her hair 
           half up and half down, wearing a glittery BLACK DRESS with a 
           GOLD MASQUERADE MASK on. Looking very out of place. BLOOD is 
           dripping from her mouth, down her neck. A lot of it.

           We recognize her as ADALENE.

           They stare at each other for a moment. Another drop of INK 
           lands on Mia’s skin. Her stop comes and she rushes out to --

           THE PLATFORM --

           Where she STOPS IN HER TRACKS.

           In front of her are THOUSANDS of BLACK AND RED ‘COMING SOON’ 
           POSTERS. Covering the subway walls entirely, in every 
           direction. Mia stares at them in a trance.

           We linger on her for a moment. When she turns --

           ADALENE IS RIGHT THERE, WAITING, GRABBING HER THROAT --

           INT. APARTMENT - MORNING

           Mia SHOOTS UP on the living room couch, dripping with sweat 
           and gasping for air. She gathers her surroundings.

           Alix and Josh are in the kitchen sipping coffee.
                                 JOSH
                        Damn. Must’ve been some dream.

                                 ALIX
                        Get her a towel, will you?

           Josh heads to the bathroom. Mia wipes sweat from her face. 

                                 MIA
                        What happened?

                                 ALIX
                        You were having a night terror. I 
                        heard you screaming and found you 
                        wandering around the kitchen so I 
                        put you on the couch and kept an 
                        eye on you until you fell asleep.

                                 MIA
                        Fuck. I’m sorry.

                                 ALIX
                        It’s okay.

           Josh returns with a towel.

                                 JOSH
                        You know, I heard that sleeping in 
                        a bed with another person can 
                        really help night terrors. 
                        Coincidentally, my friend Kevin is 
                        very available and --

                                 MIA
                        Please stop.

           He shrugs.

                                 ALIX
                        Want some coffee?

           EXT. HOT YOGA STUDIO - MORNING

           Mia and Alix sip green juices and wipe sweat off their faces.

                                 MIA
                        Wanna get brunch?

                                 ALIX
                        I have a fitting in two hours.

                                 MIA
                        How’s it coming?
                                 ALIX
                        It’s coming.

           She bites her tongue. Not wanting to say. Mia looks concerned 
           when her phone RINGS. She steps away to answer.

                                 MIA
                        Hello?

                                 CLAUDE (O.S.)
                        Mia Dawes?

                                 MIA
                        Yes?

                                 CLAUDE (O.S.)
                        This is Claude Bordeaux, I’m 
                        Marceau de Saint-Pierre’s 
                        assistant.

           Mia’s heart flutters. He speaks with a thick French accent 
           but very matter-of-factly. No emotion.

                                 CLAUDE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Monsieur Saint-Pierre was very 
                        impressed with your portfolio. He’d 
                        like to invite you to audition for 
                        his new campaign. 

                                 MIA 
                        Oh my gosh. Thank you so much --

                                 CLAUDE (O.S.)
                        The auditions will be tomorrow. See 
                        you then.

           CLICK. Mia is stunned. Alix appears behind her --

                                 ALIX
                        Actually, my fitting got pushed --

                                 MIA
                        I got Dollhouse!

                                 ALIX
                        Dollhouse?

                                 MIA
                        Well I didn’t get it, I got an 
                        audition but still --

                                 ALIX
                        What’s Dollhouse?
                                 MIA
                        Saint-Pierre’s new line.

           Alix looks bewildered. 

                                 ALIX
                        Wait -- Saint-Pierre? Like, Marceau 
                        de Saint-Pierre? He’s coming back?

                                 MIA
                        Yeah. But it’s very confidential, 
                        nobody knows yet. Sophie got an 
                        audition and I went to Drew like 
                        you said and I got it!

                                 ALIX
                        I thought he went insane. Didn’t he 
                        pull all of his clothes from stores 
                        and shut down his company?

                                 MIA
                        I don’t think anybody knows what 
                        really happened.

           Alix looks like she wants to say something.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        What? 

                                 ALIX
                        Nothing. It’s just, you know -- 
                        there are a lot of rumors out 
                        there. About him and why he 
                        disappeared.

                                 MIA
                        Why can’t you just be happy for me? 
                        I finally got an audition for 
                        something I really want. You got 
                        Dior and I was happy for you.

                                 ALIX
                        I am happy for you.

                                 MIA
                        You got a weird way of showing it.

                                 ALIX
                        I’m just saying. Be careful.

                                 MIA
                        I can handle myself.
           INT. WAITING ROOM - CASTING STUDIO - DAY

           Mia sits with a group of TWO DOZEN MODELS on matte black 
           couches in a Manhattan high-rise. They all check their looks 
           in the reflection of their phones. Mia bites her nails 
           nervously and listens to her podcast.

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        ...deep breathing is the most 
                        efficient way to calm the nervous 
                        system. When it is on high alert, 
                        oxygen can calm the muscles...

           Sophie enters the room, signs in, and rushes towards Mia. She 
           takes the seat next to her. Mia takes out her AirPods.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Well the secretary’s kind of a 
                        cunt. Are you excited?

                                 MIA
                        More nervous.

                                 SOPHIE
                        You’re going to be great. 

           Mia nods, trying to convince herself the same. The CASTING 
           ASSISTANT opens the door to the studio and leans out --

                                 CASTING ASSISTANT
                        We’re ready for you.

           INT. CASTING STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

           The same scene we saw before -- two dozen girls dressed in 
           black bras and underwear holding up NUMBERED CARDS, gleaming 
           mirrors all around. Mia holds NUMBER THIRTEEN. A table is set 
           up at the front with just a CAMERA and LAPTOP.

           CLAUDE BORDEAUX (40s, bald, glasses) wears a polka-dotted 
           suit and steps in front of the girls.

                                 CLAUDE
                        Good morning everyone. My name is 
                        Claude Bordeaux and I am Monsieur 
                        Saint-Pierre’s assistant. 
                        Unfortunately, he could not be here 
                        in person today as he is very busy 
                        designing the show. However, he is 
                        monitoring  via livestream from his 
                        home outside the city --

           Point to camera --
                                 CLAUDE (CONT’D)
                        -- and will be making his decisions 
                        in real time. So let us begin. 
                        Number one, please step forward.

           Mia takes another deep breath. She’s fucking terrified.

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           - A REDHEAD MODEL does her walk. We will come to know her as 
           CARA. She fucking crushes it. He stares at the laptop, then 
           nods to her. She heads to the next room.

           - A BLONDE MODEL up next. Tilts her head back and does her 
           walk. Claude looks to the computer and shakes his head.

           - SOPHIE goes. Does her turn, comes to the middle of the 
           floor. Claude looks to the camera...and NODS.

           - A BRUNETTE MODEL goes next. We will come to know her as 
           MELANIE. She stands confidently as Claude gives her a nod.

                                 CASTING ASSISTANT
                        Number thirteen.

           Mia steps to the middle of the room. Again, she’s all alone 
           under the lights, all eyes on her. The silence is DEAFENING. 

           She doesn’t see it, but Claude straightens up -- like 
           something about her has caught his eye. 

                                 CASTING ASSISTANT (CONT’D)
                        Measurements?

                                 MIA
                        Five-ten. One-twenty-one.

                                 CASTING ASSISTANT
                        Go ahead.

           Mia does her walk. The sound of her stilettos CLACKING 
           against the floor is THUNDEROUS. She nails her turn and 
           returns to the center of the room. 

           Claude is watching her very intensely -- much more intensely 
           than he was the other girls. He takes a long look at the 
           monitor. His eyes DARTING BACK AND FORTH like the person on 
           screen is motioning to him. Finally, he looks up --

           And NODS.
           INT. NEXT STUDIO OVER - LATER

           The girls sit in the next studio over where twelve chairs 
           have been arranged in a circle. Claude escorts in the last 
           MODEL inside. Mia sits next to Sophie, who’s losing her shit.

                                 SOPHIE
                        See? Didn’t I tell you? I knew you 
                        were going to kill it! 

           Mia looks too excited to speak, all of it too overwhelming. 
           The buzz dies down as the last model sits. The CASTING 
           ASSISTANT enters, trying to juggle a dozen clipboards --

                                 CLAUDE
                        Congratulations. You all have been 
                        selected to walk for Dollhouse -- 
                        the greatest fashion show the world 
                        has ever seen, from the greatest 
                        designer the world has ever known.

           He speaks coldly. Calculated. The Casting Assistant starts 
           handing out the clipboards --

                                 CLAUDE (CONT’D)
                        These are NDAs. There has been much 
                        speculation about Saint-Pierre’s 
                        return but we have yet to make a 
                        formal announcement. And until we 
                        do, you are not to speak about this 
                        to anybody. This campaign is to 
                        remain entirely confidential. If we 
                        find out you have spoken to anybody 
                        you will be removed from the 
                        campaign immediately. Understood?

           The girls nod.

                                 CLAUDE (CONT’D)
                        Wonderful. We start tomorrow.

           The girls get up and head to the door. As Mia grabs her 
           things, Claude GRABS HER ARM --

                                 CLAUDE (CONT’D)
                        Mia. 

           She looks up --

                                 CLAUDE (CONT’D)
                        Monsieur Saint-Pierre was very 
                        impressed with your audition today. 
                                 MIA
                        Wow -- really?

                                 CLAUDE
                        He would like you to join him 
                        tonight at his home in Montauk.

                                 MIA
                        I -- of course. I’d love to.

                                 CLAUDE
                        We’ll send a car.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mia sits in a chair in front of the TV as Hannah styles her 
           hair. A NEWS REPORT plays.

                                 TV ANCHOR
                        ...rumors continue to swirl that 
                        notorious Parisian fashion designer 
                        Marceau de Saint-Pierre is prepping 
                        a comeback nearly five years after 
                        he vanished from the public eye...

                                 HANNAH
                        I can’t believe how much hype this 
                        is getting. I mean I knew he was an 
                        icon but fuck -- it’s the only 
                        thing anybody’s talking about.

           Mia is too focused on the TV to hear her. The report shows 
           FOOTAGE from five years before -- dozens of NEWS VANS and 
           REPORTERS swarming the Lake Como house we saw in the opening.

                                 TV ANCHOR
                        ...the reason for his disappearance 
                        has never been confirmed, although 
                        sources close to him have alluded 
                        to a mental breakdown that sent him 
                        to Sainte-Anne psychiatric hospital 
                        in Paris for nine months...

                                 MIA
                        Jesus Christ.

           Hannah turns the TV off.

                                 HANNAH
                        Don’t concern yourself with that. 
                        People just love to talk.
                                 MIA
                        What do you know about him?

                                 HANNAH
                        Same things everyone else does. He 
                        was the biggest thing in the world. 
                        People treated him like God so he 
                        thought he was. And when he figured 
                        out he wasn’t, he couldn’t take it.

           Mia is panicky. Hannah notices, looks in her eyes.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Listen -- who knows what happened? 
                        All that matters is that he’s back 
                        and out of every girl in the world, 
                        he picked you. 

           She smiles at her. Mia forces a smile back.

           INT. CAR - HAMPTONS - NIGHT

           Mia sits in the back of a Cadillac SUV as it rolls through 
           BILLIONAIRE’S ROW in the Hamptons. Houses that look like 
           castles with courtyards filled with Italian sports cars not 
           on the market yet. Every house has tennis courts and 
           basketball courts and pools and guest houses.

           A private getaway for the ultra-rich.

           Mia, in a sleek black dress, dry swallows a pill. Breathes.

           EXT. SAINT-PIERRE’S MANSION - NIGHT

           The Cadillac pulls up to a gate blocking a very long driveway 
           winding through a FOREST. The driver hits the buzzer, says 
           something in French. The gate opens and they pull through.

           As they weave through the trees, we notice that this is not 
           like the other houses, designed to flaunt wealth. This one is 
           far away -- specifically designed not to be seen.

           The car disappears into darkness as it cuts through the 
           trees. It’s eerie. Quiet. And after a moment --

           They arrive at SAINT-PIERRE’S MANSION, which is the most 
           unbelievable home we’ve seen yet. It’s white with spiral 
           staircases on the outside and gold fountains. It’s literally 
           ON the beach, surrounded by the ocean. It’s an estate.

           Claude waits on the steps in a VELVET SUIT. Stoic as always.
           SUPER: 28 DAYS TO PREMIERE.

           INT. SAINT-PIERRE'S MANSION - NIGHT

           A ballroom with a massive ‘DH’ Dollhouse logo on the tile. 
           SERVANTS rush around in BLACK AND RED uniforms with ‘DH’ on 
           their sleeves. Mia walks to the back of the house, where the 
           floor to ceiling windows reveal the beach just beyond.

                                 MIA
                        This is amazing.

                                 CLAUDE
                        Come. Monsieur Saint-Pierre is in 
                        the basement.

           He leads her to a staircase...

           INT. BASEMENT/STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           And as the two descend, we recognize music playing -- the 
           same as in the opening. EXIT MUSIC (FOR A FILM) by RADIOHEAD. 
           And then we see --

           A SILHOUETTE OF A MAN, smoking a cigarette and holding a 
           sketch pad, sketching furiously. In front of him are a line 
           of a DOZEN MANNEQUINS, all dressed in a variety of outfits 
           and arranged in different poses. The one he’s focused on now 
           is wearing a plain but gorgeous WHITE DRESS.

           The same one we saw Adalene wearing in the opening.

                                 RADIOHEAD
                        We hope that you choke / That you 
                        choke... 

           The basement is filled with RACKS OF CLOTHES with ‘SP’ logos -
           - his old line. AWARDS and MAGAZINE COVERS featuring his FACE 
           adorn the walls. And on an old projector, footage from Saint-
           Pierre’s past shows are broadcast on a nearby wall.

           Claude lifts the needle from a VINTAGE RECORD PLAYER -- which 
           we also recognize.

                                 CLAUDE
                        Monsieur. Our guest has arrived.

           The Silhouette stands still for a moment. He then sets down 
           his sketchpad and emerges from the shadows, revealing --

           MARCEAU de SAINT-PIERRE.
           His jet black hair is slicked black, speckled with grey. He’s 
           got crows feet, his skin ashen from the smoking. We can tell 
           he was once glowing -- but the years have not been kind.

           He smiles and kisses Mia’s hand.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Mia -- it is a pleasure. 

                                 MIA
                        It’s -- an honor to meet you.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Welcome to my home.

           EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT

           A SERVANT arrives with two glasses of red wine. Saint-Pierre 
           takes them, hands one to Mia -- she eyes it for a moment. 
           Hesitant, she takes it at his urging. He offers a toast.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        To Dollhouse.

           She stares at her glass. She doesn’t drink normally. But...

                                 MIA
                        To Dollhouse.

           She does this time. He sets his glass down and smiles at her.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        I must say, I have seen many models 
                        over the years but seeing your 
                        audition today -- you have 
                        something I’ve never seen.

                                 MIA
                        Thank you.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        It’s exactly what I want.

           He says it like she’s a product. She sips her wine.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        Tell me about yourself.

                                 MIA
                        Okay, well, I’ve been modeling for 
                        about three years now. I haven’t 
                        really been in a lot but --
                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Not work. You. Who are you?

           Nervous, she starts picking at her nails. He reaches out, 
           touches her. An ELECTRICITY flows through her.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        Relax. You are safe.

           She nods. Gathers herself.

                                 MIA
                        I’m from Indiana. I left home at 
                        sixteen and came to New York.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Against your parents’ wishes, I 
                        presume?

                                 MIA
                        Actually, no. My father was an 
                        alcoholic. He was very abusive. My 
                        mother supported anything that 
                        involved me running away.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        I’m sorry to hear that. I’ve had my 
                        own -- very publicized -- battles 
                        with addiction. It is the devil.

                                 MIA
                        Yeah. So, I came out here to model. 
                             (then)
                        What about you? Where did you...go?

           A darkness comes over his face. He looks out over the ocean.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        That is a story for another night. 
                        All that matters is that I am back.

           He gives her a smile. She smiles back -- sips more wine. She 
           looks out over the backyard. An iridescent pool with ‘DH’ 
           painted on the bottom, orange trees, fire pit, a cabana --

           An exact replica of the backyard we saw in the opening.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        I want you to open and close the 
                        show for me.

           Mia almost spits out her wine.
                                 MIA
                        What?

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Dollhouse is not just another 
                        fashion show, Mia. It is my 
                        comeback. My rebirth. I have clawed 
                        my way back from places so dark 
                        they can swallow you whole and this 
                        my last collection. My greatest and 
                        my final statement to fashion. And 
                        I want you to be the face of it.

                                 MIA
                        This is your last collection?

           He nods.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Why?

           He takes another sip of wine. Chooses his words carefully.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Five years ago, I came to the 
                        realization that I had nothing left 
                        to give fashion. It had given me 
                        everything but I had nothing left 
                        to say. So I went away. And do you 
                        know what happened?

           She shakes her head ‘no’. His eyes light up, animated.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        I got more famous. Because once you 
                        take something away from people -- 
                        there is nothing they want more 
                        than to get it back.

           He steps towards her --

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        And now, I finally have something 
                        to say again. The theme of 
                        Dollhouse is death. It’s about 
                        taking control of what we are most 
                        scared of and seeing death as a new 
                        beginning. This is a new beginning 
                        for you, Mia. You are about to be 
                        the biggest model in the world. Is 
                        that what you want?

           Entranced, Mia nods. He caresses her face. She shivers.
                                 MIA
                        Yes.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Then I was right. You are who I 
                        have been looking for.
                             (then)
                        Come. I have a gift for you.

           INT. BALLROOM - SAINT-PIERRE’S MANSION - NIGHT

           Saint-Pierre sits on satin couch as Mia emerges in the WHITE 
           DRESS. She’s gorgeous. He stands, almost emotional --

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        You are stunning.

                                 MIA
                        It’s beautiful.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        It’s the first dress I ever 
                        designed. I was twenty-four and 
                        broke. This dress changed my life.

           He steps towards her, touches her face again --

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        Let this mark the beginning of your 
                        ascent to greatness, just as it 
                        marked mine. And one more thing --

           He takes out a CRYSTAL and GOLD LAPEL PIN -- ‘SP’ -- and 
           places it in her palm.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        A gift. For you.

           She looks at it, then at him. Transfixed. On cloud nine.

           INT. BASEMENT - LATER

           Mia has changed out of the white dress. She emerges from the 
           bathroom in her black dress, the white one folded under arm. 
           She takes a look around the basement. The mannequins, racks 
           of the clothes, piles of design books. She starts to wander.

           She walks past the dozen MANNEQUINS in different poses, 
           running her hand along their outfits as she goes. One of them 
           is naked -- the one that used to be wearing the white dress. 
           The projector footage still playing, Mia starts practicing 
           her own runway walk, just like the girls on the wall.

           Behind her in the darkness, we see the naked mannequin --

           TURN ITS FUCKING HEAD.

           Mia reaches the wall. Touches the girls being projected, 
           desperate to be one of them. Behind her, we see THE MANNEQUIN 
           STEP OFF ITS PODIUM -- it moves ROBOTICALLY, GANGLY, LIKE A 
           GIANT INSECT and disappears into the dark...

           Mia turns around. Nothing there.

           But she notices that the podium where the mannequin was in 
           EMPTY. Confused, she slowly walks towards it. Behind her, the 
           projector footage FREEZES on a FRAME of SAINT-PIERRE and a 
           WOMAN when suddenly --

           THE MANNEQUIN’S HAND EMERGES, CLINCHING HER THROAT.

           It steps out of the shadows and PINS HER TO THE GROUND. A 
           plain oval face, its neck cocks as it comes closer, as if 
           examining her. Like a wild animal studying its prey. It 
           SQUEEZES HARDER. She CHOKES.

           As Mia claws at its plastic face, beyond it, she sees the 
           FREEZE FRAME on the wall...Saint-Pierre and some WOMAN...but 
           her vision blurry, she can’t make out who it is...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Miss! Miss!

           Mia’s eyes bulge and her lips turn blue. She desperately 
           tries to flail but she can’t. Its grip is fucking strong.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Miss, what are you doing!

           Suddenly, her EYES ROLL BACK INTO HER HEAD and --

           EXT. ROOF - DAWN

           Then they open. 

           She’s standing on the edge of the ROOF OF HER APARTMENT 
           BUILDING, looking down twenty-two stories below. A 
           CONSTRUCTION WORKER behind her yells --

                                 CONSTRUCTION WORKER
                        Miss! Get down from there!

           She looks back at him. A blank stare in her eyes.
           INT. DR. WOODARD’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Mia picks at her nails, nervously taps her foot.

                                 MIA
                        And that was it. I woke up and he 
                        walked me back to my apartment.

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        And this is the first night terror 
                        you’ve had in a while?

                                 MIA
                        I had one three nights ago. Alix 
                        found me screaming in the kitchen.

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        Your parasomnia shouldn’t be this 
                        bad with the benzodiazepines you’re 
                        taking. Did you mix with anything?

           Mia looks at the floor.

                                 MIA
                        Alcohol.

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        I thought you didn’t drink. 

                                 MIA
                        I don’t. I felt pressured.

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        By who?

                                 MIA
                        Marceau de Saint-Pierre.

           Dr. Woodard looks up from her notes, bewildered.

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        The fashion designer?

           Mia nods.

                                 MIA
                        I got a job. Working for him on his 
                        comeback campaign. I’m opening and 
                        closing his new show. 

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        That’s...very impressive. I had no 
                        idea he was...returning.
                                 MIA
                        It hasn’t been announced yet. I was 
                        at his house and he offered me wine 
                        and I got caught up in the moment --

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        Nails.

           Mia takes her fingers from her mouth, sits on her hands.

                                 DR. WOODARD (CONT’D)
                        Alcohol exacerbates anxiety. Mixing 
                        it with benzos can kill you.

                                 MIA
                        I know.

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        He had a pretty publicized mental 
                        breakdown last I heard. Did he tell 
                        you why he left? What happened? 

                                 MIA
                        No. It’s not my business.

           A beat. Dr. Woodard purses her lips together, forces a smile.

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        I think we should see each other 
                        more often. Especially with this 
                        new added pressure and stress. 

                                 MIA
                        I can’t. I’ll be working everyday. 

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        Mia if you’re waking up on the roof 
                        of your apartment building --

           Her PHONE ALARM goes off.

                                 MIA
                        Shit. I have to go. I’ll see you 
                        next week. 

           Off Dr. Woodard’s dreadful look as Mia heads for the door.

           INT. THEATRE - MORNING

           The dozen models Saint-Pierre chose are sitting in a large, 
           empty theatre. An ALL-WHITE STAGE looms in front of them. 

           Mia and Sophie sit in the second row.
                                 SOPHIE
                        What was his house like? I bet it 
                        was fucking massive.

                                 MIA
                        It was enormous.

                                 SOPHIE
                        And him? What was he like?

                                 MIA
                        He was...incredible.

           In front of them, two girls turn their heads. We recognize 
           them as CARA and MELANIE, who we saw at the audition. 

                                 CARA
                        You went to his house already? 
                        Damn, good for you.

                                 MELANIE
                        Doesn’t take long for some to start 
                        sleeping their way up the ladder.

           They smirk and turn back. Sophie flips them off. SAINT-PIERRE 
           and CLAUDE emerge from the back of the stage and the girls 
           immediately sit up straight.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Good morning, ladies. I am Marceau 
                        de Saint-Pierre -- and welcome to 
                        your new home.

           The girls are enraptured by his voice, mannerisms, charm.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        It has been five years since I last 
                        debuted a new collection to the 
                        world. But this isn’t just a show -- 
                        it is an experience that nobody 
                        will ever -- ever -- forget.

           He smiles. A look of evil in his eyes.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        The theme of the show is always the 
                        most important, because it is the 
                        vessel that allows you to get your 
                        message across. The theme of 
                        Dollhouse is death. People will 
                        call it a resurrection but it is a 
                        rebirth. I am not who I once was. 
                        But who I am now is who I was 
                        always meant to be. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        I hope your experience is the same.
                             (then)
                        Fittings will take place shortly. 
                        And tonight, you will all join me 
                        at the Metropolitan, which I have 
                        rented out to officially announce 
                        my return and unveil you all to the 
                        world. Welcome to Dollhouse.

           He smiles and heads backstage as Claude steps up.

                                 CLAUDE
                        Please follow me. 

           The girls stand. A MODEL near Mia whispers to her friend --

                                 MODEL
                        Did he say the theme was death?

           INT. FITTING ROOM - DAY

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           - SOPHIE stands on a pedestal in the middle of the room, 
           wearing a stylized NURSE’S OUTFIT -- a white gown with a red 
           cross on her breast and BLACK CAP. A team of TAILORS and 
           STYLISTS swarm her as Saint-Pierre looks on.

           - MELANIE on the pedestal, wearing a PRIESTESS OUTFIT. A 
           black gown with a red collar and an upside down cross. 

           - CARA, dressed in a black and red SERVANT OUTFIT -- very 
           similar to the ones we saw the servants wearing in Saint-
           Pierre’s mansion earlier. A ‘DH’ logo on the sleeves.

           Mia steps on the pedestal in a gorgeous, glittery BLACK 
           DRESS. We’ve seen it before...somewhere...

           As the tailors and stylists swarm her, she stares at herself 
           in the mirror. Feeling the dress. Where have I seen this?

                                 TAILOR
                        It fits perfectly. I don’t see any 
                        changes that need to be made.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        I agree. It’s outstanding.

           Saint-Pierre steps in front of her, smiling. In awe.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        Just one final touch.
           He takes out a GOLD MASQUERADE MASK from his jacket. The same 
           one we saw the Adalene wearing in Mia’s night terror on the 
           subway. That’s where she’s seen it before. She looks 
           startled, even fearful as he slides it over her face.

           He steps back and marvels at her. 

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        Perfect.

           INT. MAKE-UP ROOM - LATER

           Hannah helps Mia wipe off her makeup. They’re the last two.

                                 HANNAH
                        That dress was incredible.

                                 MIA
                        I know.

           She’s staring at herself, lost in her own thoughts.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (O.S.)
                        Mia.

           She turns. Saint-Pierre approaches.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        Can I have a moment?

           Hannah politely smiles and leaves. Saint-Pierre sits.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        How did you feel about the dress?

                                 MIA
                        I loved it. 

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        I’m glad. It is very special to me.

           He stares at her for an uncomfortable amount of time.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        I would like you to dye your hair.

                                 MIA
                        What?

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        The aesthetic of the clothes I have 
                        designed to open and close the show 
                        were made with a brunette in mind.
                                 MIA
                        Oh. Uhm -- okay.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Every detail of this show has been 
                        planned for five years. Everything 
                        has to be flawless. You have what I 
                        want, but I need you to be a 
                        brunette.

           Mia sits there for a moment. Unsure of what to say.

                                 MIA
                        Okay. Yeah. Of course.

           INT. BATHROOM - BEDROOM - EVENING

           Mia’s hair is in a towel as she looks in the mirror. Hannah 
           is behind her, looking at her phone.

                                 MIA
                        Are you sure we left it in long 
                        enough? I don’t want it to look 
                        like I did it myself.

                                 HANNAH
                        That’s why I’m here. But it’s 
                        ready, you can take it off now.

           Nervous, Mia slowly unwraps the towel -- and her WET, BROWN 
           HAIR falls down to her shoulders. 

           Mia and Hannah are both TRANSFIXED.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ. You’re beautiful.

           INT. PRIVATE ROOM - UPSTAIRS - SAME

           The models are gathered in a small room the size of a 
           bedroom. They’re all dressed in identical WHITE GOWNS with 
           half-sleeves on -- one red, one black.

           Mia sits next to Sophie on a satin couch. Her brown hair 
           styled perfectly. She discretely SWALLOWS A PILL.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Seriously, I’ve been a brunette for 
                        twenty-one years. You look better 
                        than I do and you’ve been one for 
                        like forty-five minutes.
                                 MIA
                        I’m kinda surprised at how much I 
                        like it.

                                 CARA (O.S.)
                        Already morphing into his dream 
                        girl. Kinda sad.

           Cara and Melanie walk past, smirking.

                                 SOPHIE
                        I think they like you.

           Saint-Pierre and Claude emerge from an adjoining room in 
           tuxedos -- Saint-Pierre in black, Claude in red. Saint-Pierre 
           smiles at the models as they all STAND.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Well then -- shall we?

           Claude opens the giant doors leading to the staircase and 
           Saint-Pierre leads the girls in a single-file line out onto --

           A PLATFORM. STAIRS LEADING DOWN TO THE BALLROOM ON BOTH 
           SIDES.

           The crowd ERUPTS in cheers as Saint-Pierre reveals his face 
           to the public for the first time in five years. Cameras 
           FLASH. Six of the models take positions on the six stairs to 
           his left, the other six to his right.

           Mia is at the top, closest to him. She looks out over the 
           room, drinking in the adulation and attention. She spots 
           HANNAH in the crowd, who’s smiling and clapping.

           Saint-Pierre holds up his hands. The cheering dies down.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be 
                        back with you all tonight. I’ve 
                        waited for this a very long time.

           CHEERS.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        I have had much success in my life 
                        but over the last few years, I have 
                        finally learned what I am truly 
                        capable of. Ladies and gentlemen --

           He opens his arms wide, motions to his models --

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        -- welcome to Dollhouse.
           Behind him, a giant BLACK and RED POSTER is UNFURLED from the 
           ceiling -- but this time, it doesn’t say COMING SOON. 

           It says DOLLHOUSE.

           CLOSE ON: Mia, smile on her face as the crowd cheers and 
           cameras flash. A dream being realized.

           LATER --

           Hannah offers Mia champagne. She declines.

                                 HANNAH
                        You have to celebrate somehow. Look 
                        at this place! 

                                 MIA
                        I know. It’s packed.

                                 HANNAH
                        Everyone’s here. Literally, 
                        everybody who’s anybody. Probably 
                        all want to get a look at you. 

           Mia blushes, brings out her phone. Looks at it -- confused. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 MIA
                        Nothing. 
                             (then)
                        I’m gonna go get some air.

           She cuts through the crowd towards the door. But just before 
           she reaches it, something catches her eye.

           Saint-Pierre and Sophie, talking in the corner, out of 
           earshot of the others. Sophie LAUGHS. He smiles. She watches 
           for a moment. They’re just talking...it seems...

           EXT. METROPOLITAN CLUB - NIGHT

           It’s RAINING. Mia stands under the awning and dials her 
           phone. DREW picks up. He sounds EXASPERATED.

                                 DREW (O.S.)
                        Mia?

                                 MIA
                        Drew? 
                                 DREW
                        Where are you? I’ve been trying to 
                        get a hold of you all night --

                                 MIA
                        I’m at the Metropolitan. Why aren’t 
                        you here?

                                 DREW
                        Listen to me very carefully, Mia. I 
                        fucked up. I made a mistake, you 
                        shouldn’t be there.

                                 MIA
                        What?

                                 DREW
                        You have to leave. You’re in 
                        danger.

                                 MIA
                        In danger? Danger of what?

                                 DREW
                        Saint-Pierre. There are some things 
                        you don’t know, some things I need 
                        to tell you. Meet me at my studio --

                                 MIA
                        Wait -- what are you talking about? 
                        I’m not leaving here.

                                 DREW
                        Listen to me -- he has a plan. This 
                        isn’t a normal fashion show. You 
                        need to get out of there, now --

                                 MIA
                        I’m not leaving. You can come here.

                                 DREW
                        No, I can’t. I was fired. 

                                 MIA
                        Fired?

                                 DREW
                        He knows I know. Claude came to see 
                        me. I’m leaving town tomorrow, he’s 
                        a fucking psychopath. You need to 
                        quit right now --
                                 MIA
                        Claude? Drew, what’s going on? I’m 
                        not quitting the campaign -- 

                                 DREW
                        You’re not listening --

                                 MIA
                        Just because you lost your job 
                        doesn’t mean I have to quit mine. 

                                 DREW
                        I’m not -- (static) -- Mia, before 
                        he -- (static) --

                                 MIA
                        Drew?

           The call DROPS. Mia stares at her phone. A feeling of 
           uneasiness, but she shakes it off. Turns around --

           Where CLAUDE is standing in the doorway. She JUMPS -- drops 
           her phone. It’s unclear how long he’s been there, but he 
           looks intense. He bends down and picks up her phone for her.

                                 CLAUDE
                        Must’ve been an important call for 
                        you to step out of such a wonderful 
                        celebration.

                                 MIA
                        Oh -- yeah, it was nothing big. 
                        Thanks.

           She rushes by him. He watches her as she goes...

           INT. DREW’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Drew’s studio is completely dark, save for the light in his 
           office where he frantically packs his things, zipping up his 
           camera equipment and tossing whatever he can in a suitcase.

           Suddenly, the sound of the FRONT DOOR SLAMMING.

           Drew FREEZES.

           He steps into the darkness, using his phone for light.

                                 DREW
                        Mia? 

           HIS POV: We see his iPhone flashlight light up a few feet in 
           front of him as he scans the area. 
           The light catches one of the studio MIRRORS and we get a 
           QUICK glimpse of a DARK, BLURRY FIGURE BEHIND HIM --

           He WHIPS AROUND. 

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        Who’s there?

           Silence. The phone trembles in his hand.

           The faint sounds of FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HIM. He whips around 
           again. Sees nothing but darkness.

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        Mia? Stop fucking around --

           His office door suddenly SLAMS SHUT. He JUMPS and drops his 
           phone, the light streaming up towards the ceiling. And in the 
           SHADOW OF THE LIGHT, we see a HAND GRAB HIS THROAT, DRAGGING 
           HIM OFFSCREEN --

           We hear the brutal sounds of CHOKING in the dark. Drew’s 
           boots SQUEAK against the wood floor as he struggles. It’s 
           brutal. Disturbing. Almost...intimate.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mia swallows four pills, stares at herself in the mirror. 
           Still in her white gown and black and red half sleeves. She 
           plays with her new brown hair -- and smiles.

           She walks to her bed and lies down, waiting for the pills to 
           kick in. The smile on her face still there when --

           A FLOORBOARD CREAKS.

           She opens her eyes and sees --

           ADALENE STANDING OVER HER. 

           Her body has decomposed. Her eyes black holes, her dark hair 
           stringy -- like she’s just RISEN FROM THE DEAD. She’s 
           DRIPPING WET in that same WHITE DRESS from the opening. Mia 
           SCREAMS as her DEAD HAND CLASPS OVER HER MOUTH --

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Mia shoots awake, gasping for air and covered in sweat as her 
           ALARM BLARES. She’s still in the dress and half sleeves from 
           the night before. Light pours through the windows. 
           She takes a moment to gather herself. Another night terror. 
           She looks at her phone. DREW - 7 MISSED CALLS. As she pulls 
           herself out of bed, she notices --

           DROPLETS OF WATER, falling from her bed frame to the floor.

           EXT. DREW'S STUDIO - MORNING

           Now looking slightly better with an iced nonfat latte in her 
           hand, Mia knocks on Drew’s studio door. Nothing.

                                 MIA
                        Drew? It’s me.

           She knocks again. Nothing. She sighs and looks down the alley 
           next to the studio and spots a door. 

           INT. DREW'S STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

           It’s pitch black. Mia searches for the light.

                                 MIA
                        Drew? I got all seven of your 
                        fucking calls, if I don’t answer 
                        the first time I probably --

           She turns on the light and --

           Drew is HANGING FROM THE CEILING, A NOOSE AROUND HIS NECK. 
           His insides have been RIPPED OUT, his entrails on the floor 
           in a POOL OF BLOOD.

           She SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER, collapsing to the floor...

           EXT. DREW'S STUDIO - LATER

           SILENT, SLOW-MOTION:

           A cascade of POLICE CARS and AMBULANCES. Mia wipes tears from 
           her face as she talks to OFFICER BAILEY (30s, mustache), and 
           OFFICER HOLLOWAY (30s, chubby). 

           A few EMTs lead Drew’s body out of the studio on a gurney, 
           his body covered in a white sheet. Spots of BLOOD have seeped 
           through. As Mia turns away, she looks up and sees...

           A DOLLHOUSE BILLBOARD.
           INT. MAKE-UP ROOM - MORNING

           Mia and Sophie sit in make-up chairs before the fittings 
           start. Both glowing. Hannah sits on the counter between them. 
           Both she and Mia wipe tears from their eyes.

                                 MIA
                        He was just...swaying there...

                                 SOPHIE
                        Jesus Christ. What’d they say? 

                                 MIA
                        Not much. Just that they’d follow 
                        up after the autopsy.

                                 HANNAH
                             (sniffling)
                        He was probably my best friend out 
                        here. I can’t believe this.

           A heavy silence hangs in the air.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Well. Fuck. This sucks. It’s all 
                        high fashion until somebody dies.

                                 MIA
                        He called me last night. Told me he 
                        was fired and that I was in danger.

                                 HANNAH
                        Fired? And in danger of what?

                                 MIA
                        I don’t know.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Drew hangs out with some sketchy 
                        people. Who knows what he was 
                        really involved in.

           Mia notices Hannah sitting on a newspaper.

                                 MIA
                        What’s that?

           Hannah lifts her thigh and hands it over.

           It’s the front page of the NEW YORK TIMES. A picture of Saint-
           Pierre with his arms out and all the models on the staircase 
           under the headline -- ‘NOTORIOUS PARISIAN FASHION DESIGNER 
           SAINT-PIERRE ANNOUNCES TRIUMPHANT RETURN WITH DOLLHOUSE.’
           Mia is fixated on her picture. Behind her, Claude approaches.

                                 CLAUDE
                        Mia.

           EXT. ROOF - THEATRE - DAY

           Saint-Pierre smokes a cigarette and sips an espresso as Mia 
           looks over the massive concrete jungle of New York City.

           They sit at a table, underneath a black umbrella.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        The papers asked me to comment 
                        about Drew. I have yet to come up 
                        with the right words. But I am very 
                        sorry. I know you were -- close.

           He says ‘close’ weird. Like he’s alluding to something...

                                 MIA
                        Thank you.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        He brought you to me, which I am 
                        very thankful for. And he was a 
                        very good photographer. It’s a 
                        shame we had to get rid of him.

                                 MIA
                             (shocked)
                        Get rid of him?

           Saint-Pierre smiles. Grabs her nervous hand.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Poor choice of words. Sorry. Fire 
                        him. Let him go from the campaign.

           Mia’s heart is beating out of her chest. She nods.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        Are you familiar with Lucinda 
                        Fournier?

                                 MIA
                        The photographer?

           He nods, exhales smoke. Smiles. 

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Of course. Everybody knows her.
                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        She is joining the campaign. She 
                        will be shooting for us going 
                        forward and she found you to be 
                        very impressive.

                                 MIA
                        She did?

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Yes. She knows the vision I have 
                        for the show and she’s very excited 
                        to work with you.

           Mia BEAMS. Trying to make sense of it all.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        Now you understand why we had to 
                        get rid of Drew.

           A smile creeps across her face. She nods. Like all of her 
           sadness has just been washed away...

           INT. FITTING ROOM - NIGHT

           At the Dior headquarters, Alix stands on a pedestal in her 
           fitting room wearing a tight dress. The tailors obsess over 
           her features. She looks weary.

                                 TAILOR #1
                        It’s right here, see? The hip just 
                        kind of...juts out at this weird 
                        angle, I don’t know why --

                                 TAILOR #2
                        It’s not the hips, it’s the upper 
                        thighs that are disproportionate.

           A knock at the door -- a MODEL slides inside, wearing sweats.

                                 MODEL
                        Sorry -- forgot my phone charger.

           She grabs it from the wall and looks at Alix.

                                 MODEL (CONT’D)
                        We’re all going to the 27 Club if 
                        you want to come, you 
                        know...whenever you’re done.

           She gives her a soft, sad smile. 
                                 ALIX
                        Thanks. I might be here for a bit.

           The Model nods, departs.

                                 TAILOR #1
                        If only the legs were a little 
                        longer --

                                 ALIX
                        Well they’re not, so deal with it!

           EXT. SOHO - NIGHT

           Alix runs down the streets in the pouring rain. She ducks 
           underneath a stretch of sidewalk under construction. The 
           plywood wall is covered in DOLLHOUSE POSTERS. She stops and 
           stares at them, envious.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Alix enters the apartment, dripping wet, where Mia, Hannah, 
           and Sophie are gathered in the living room. 

                                 SOPHIE
                        Hey.

                                 ALIX
                        Hey. How are you guys holding up?

                                 HANNAH
                        Alright. Considering.

           Alix comes over and sits on the couch, exhaling.

                                 ALIX
                        What did the cops say?

                                 MIA
                        They’re looking for prints and DNA 
                        at the studio.

                                 ALIX
                        Fuck.

           Alix looks around the room. Debating whether to ask...

                                 ALIX (CONT’D)
                        Do you think...him getting fired 
                        had anything to do with it?
                                 MIA
                        What do you mean?

                                 ALIX
                        He told you that Claude guy 
                        threatened to kill him, right? And 
                        that you were in danger?

                                 MIA
                        I mean, yeah, that’s what he said. 
                        But he sounded out of his mind. 

                                 ALIX
                        You don’t think he was telling the 
                        truth? Why else would he call you 
                        fourteen times in one night?

                                 SOPHIE
                        He was probably high.

           She and Alix catch eyes. Sophie sits up.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        Hold on -- you don’t think Saint-
                        Pierre had something to do with 
                        this, do you? 

                                 ALIX
                        I’m just saying it’s not out of the 
                        realm of possibility --

                                 SOPHIE
                        Wait -- Alix, you’re talking about 
                        murder.

                                 HANNAH
                             (softly)
                        I saw him throw a chair at a girl 
                        earlier today.

                                 ALIX
                        Last I heard, he went insane.

                                 MIA
                        Not everything you hear is true --

                                 ALIX
                        This is. I know it is.

                                 SOPHIE
                        And how’s that?

           Alix looks at the skeptical eyes in the room. She SIGHS.
                                 ALIX
                        I had this stylist once. She styled 
                        this girl who was the real deal -- 
                        Burberry, Marc Jacobs, Dolce. Then 
                        she got the Saint-Pierre job and 
                        started modeling for him 
                        exclusively. He was going to make 
                        her the biggest thing in the world 
                        but he was so obsessive and 
                        demanding that she had a breakdown. 
                        Moved back to Florida, changed her 
                        name. My stylist said he threw her 
                        into a mirror and choked her in 
                        front of everybody. They had to pay 
                        her off not to press charges.

           Sophie SCOFFS.

                                 SOPHIE
                        So he’s a perfectionist. So is 
                        everybody else in this business. 
                        I’ve been verbally abused a hundred 
                        times. It’s part of the job.

                                 HANNAH
                        Jesus, he threw her into a mirror?

                                 ALIX
                        Have you even read the stories 
                        about him? Ten models of his have 
                        been hospitalized with heart 
                        problems after losing weight too 
                        fast. Two more killed themselves. 
                        He’s a fucking serial abuser 
                        addicted to drugs who went broke 
                        and wants a power trip --

                                 SOPHIE
                        You don’t even know him --

                                 ALIX
                        Do you?

                                 SOPHIE
                        You’re just jealous because you 
                        know Dollhouse is better than Dior 
                        and your big break has been ruined 
                        by ours.

           Silence. Alix’s jaw drops. Mia bites her nails. Overwhelmed.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        Mia doesn’t need to hear this 
                        either. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        She’s opening and closing the show. 
                        This has nothing to do with 
                        Marceau.

           Alix looks to Mia, who’s still biting her nails. She rips off 
           some skin. BLOOD starts to bubble --

                                 ALIX
                        Congratulations.

                                 MIA
                        Thanks.

           The mood is heavy. Nobody knows what to say. Then, Alix 
           stands, heads towards her room and shuts the door. Sophie 
           SCOFFS, goes to the kitchen, pours a glass of wine.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        That was kind of harsh.

                                 HANNAH
                        Have his models really killed 
                        themselves? Is that true?

                                 SOPHIE
                        She needed to hear it. 

           She sits back down. Sips her wine.

                                 MIA
                        What’d you guys do after I left the 
                        launch party?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Who?

                                 MIA
                        You and him.

           Sophie shrugs.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Talked. I went home. Why?

                                 MIA
                        Just wondering.

           Sophie sips her wine again. Hannah looks very tense.

                                 SOPHIE
                        It is odd though, isn’t it?

                                 MIA
                        What?
                                 SOPHIE
                        The way he looks at you.

           Mia doesn’t like the look on her face.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mia runs her hand under the faucet, watching the blood pour 
           out of her finger and swirl with the water. She goes to peel 
           back an extra piece of skin when --

           She RIPS her ENTIRE NAIL OFF, revealing the raw flesh 
           underneath. She GRITS her teeth in pain as the flesh of her 
           finger GLOWS PINK.

           INT. FITTING ROOM - DAY

           Mia stands on the pedestal wearing a stylized HOSPITAL GOWN 
           that’s been modified as a tight dress. Her eye shadow streams 
           down her face -- designed to look like she’s been crying.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Needs to be tighter. And shorter. 

           Mia catches Saint-Pierre’s eyes in the mirror. He’s intense, 
           focused -- but gives her a smile. She smiles back.

           SUPER: 21 DAYS TO PREMIERE.

           INT. CHANGING ROOM - LATER

           Mia stands behind a makeshift curtain as she prepares to 
           change. Suddenly, the DOOR OPENS.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (O.S.)
                        Mia?

           She freezes.

                                 MIA
                        Yes?

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (O.S.)
                        Sorry to disturb you -- but I have 
                        a bit of news.

           She waits for him to continue.
                                 SAINT-PIERRE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I have decided to do an interview 
                        with Vogue that will come out the 
                        day after the show. I will be on 
                        the cover, announcing my return.
                             (then)
                        I have chosen you to accompany me.

           Mia’s heart skips a beat.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        In addition, you will be the face 
                        of the Dollhouse editorial. Lucinda 
                        will shoot it.

           Mia opens the curtains. Stunned.

                                 MIA
                        You’re serious?

           He smiles and nods, walking closer to her. They stand inches 
           apart for a moment, letting the tension build...until...

           Saint-Pierre pulls her in and kisses her passionately. He 
           takes off his jacket, she undoes his belt. Her make-up is 
           still on -- runny mascara and eyeliner down her cheeks.

           He picks up her legs and shoves her into the MIRROR as he 
           enters her. It CRACKS -- the glass SPIDERWEBS. He puts his 
           hand over her mouth and drives her back into the wall over 
           and over again, the sharp cracks of the mirror DIGGING INTO 
           HER BACK, BLOOD DRIPPING DOWN ON THE FLOOR BETWEEN THEM...

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mia enters, a smile on her face -- and is surprised to see 
           OFFICER BAILEY and OFFICER HOLLOWAY (the mustached and chubby 
           cop from Drew’s death scene) in her living room with Alix.

           Her mood instantly changes. 

                                 MIA
                        Oh...hello.

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        Evening, miss. Sorry to stop by 
                        unannounced. We just had some 
                        questions about your friend Drew.

           Apprehensive, she takes a seat. Alix wipes away tears.

                                 MIA
                        Have you found anything?
                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        Unfortunately, no. We found no sign 
                        of forced entry and no unexpected 
                        DNA. Whoever did this had been 
                        there before.

                                 MIA
                        What happened to him?

           The cops glance at each other, hesitant to go into details. 

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        He was strangled pretty severely, 
                        but it didn’t kill him. The 
                        official cause of death was 
                        hypovolemic shock.

                                 MIA
                        So he was --

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        He was gutted alive, yes.
                             (then)
                        Is there anything you can tell us 
                        about the night before? Anything he 
                        might have said? Alix has told us 
                        he called you a number of times?

           Mia turns to her. Alix’s face begging her to tell the truth.

           She slowly shakes her head ‘no’. 

                                 OFFICER BAILEY (CONT’D)
                        We understand he was just fired 
                        from his job. You were working 
                        together for Mr. Saint-Pierre?

                                 MIA
                        Yeah.

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        Did they have a falling out?

                                 MIA
                        He was fired. That’s all I know.

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        There’s nothing you can recall he 
                        was upset about? Nothing he said 
                        that alarmed you?

           Mia looks at the floor. Avoids their gaze -- and Alix’s.
                                 MIA
                        No.

           Alix stares a hole through her, angry.

           EXT. ALLEY - THEATRE - DAY

           Leaning against the wall, Sophie smokes a blunt as Mia chews 
           her nails, covered in NEON BLUE POLISH. Mia looks upset.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Can you fucking believe it? The 
                        Vogue cover?

                                 MIA
                        Yeah. I know. When did he tell you?

                                 SOPHIE
                        This morning. He said we start 
                        shooting with Lucinda next week.

           Mia nods.

                                 SOPHIE (CONT’D)
                        How are you not freaking the fuck 
                        out right now? Two weeks ago you 
                        couldn’t get an audition for a 
                        fucking antique shop and now you’re 
                        modeling for the biggest designer 
                        in the world, for the biggest 
                        comeback in fashion history. We’re 
                        gonna be on the cover of Vogue.

                                 MIA
                        I know, I just -- I don’t know. The 
                        Drew thing is still upsetting me.

           We get the hint that that’s not what’s upsetting her.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Look, I don’t mean to be cold but 
                        Drew was an asshole. You said it 
                        yourself. It’s not our fault. 
                             (then)
                        Let’s go celebrate tonight. Get our 
                        minds off of this and enjoy this.

                                 CARA (O.S.)
                        Ah yes -- the Vogue cover.

           Cara and Melanie appear in the alley, both with cigarettes 
           dangling from their mouths. Cara takes hers away, exhales --
                                 MELANIE
                        Pretty impressive for a girl who 
                        nobody’s heard of.

           Mia shrinks into herself.

                                 SOPHIE
                        Says more about you than us, no?

                                 CARA
                        I’ve seen you around. At least 
                        you’ve done something. As for Mia -- 
                        tell us your secret. How are you 
                        swinging this?

                                 SOPHIE
                        Somebody finally wised up and saw 
                        her for what she is. Now why don’t 
                        you both fuck off?

           Sophie goes to leave, Mia following. Cara sticks her hand out 
           and STOPS HER. She leans in --

                                 CARA
                        Be careful. You never know which 
                        bitches bark and which ones bite.

           She smiles and winks. Mia walks away.

           INT. CLUB - NIGHT

           FLASHING LIGHTS and TRAP MUSIC. The kind of place where you 
           can literally hear people sweat and the drinks are watered 
           down. I’m having a panic attack just thinking about it.

           Mia and Hannah sit in a booth. The DJ plays TRAVIS SCOTT.

                                 MIA
                        I’m not upset -- I just don’t 
                        really get it.

                                 HANNAH
                        She’s your best friend and you’re 
                        going to get to do Vogue together. 
                        That’s like a dream come true for 
                        best friends everywhere. 

                                 MIA
                        I know. I just kind of thought it 
                        was my moment. Only me.
                                 HANNAH
                        Well, that’s what fucking the 
                        designer gets you.

           Mia’s face goes white.

                                 MIA
                        How did you know that?

                                 HANNAH
                        Sophie told me.

                                 MIA
                        Sophie?

           An awkward beat. Slowly, they both realize -- they’re talking 
           about different people.

                                 HANNAH
                        Shit.

                                 MIA
                        Wait -- Sophie fucked him? What did 
                        she say?

                                 HANNAH
                        It doesn’t matter --

                                 MIA
                        What did she say?

           Hannah SIGHS. Swirls her straw in her drink. 

                                 HANNAH
                        She said they fucked in the Met 
                        bathroom before she left. But 
                        again, she could’ve lied --

           Mia looks like her world has just been turned upside down. 
           She glances around the club, trying to regain her breath --

           And sees ADALENE, dripping wet in the WHITE DRESS, watching 
           her from the other side of the club. A few people obscure her 
           vision and suddenly -- she’s gone.

                                 SOPHIE (O.S.)
                        Ladiessss. How’s it goin’?

           Sophie has stumbled over, slurring, drunk as fuck.

                                 HANNAH
                        Are you okay?
                                 SOPHIE
                        Just took a shit ton of ecstasy in 
                        the bathroom. Never been better.

           Mia looks uncomfortable. Bitter. Anxious.

                                 MIA
                        I’m gonna go. These places make me 
                        anxious. I’ll see you tomorrow.

           She gives Sophie a kiss on the cheek and then she’s already 
           on her way to do shots with some other razor thin brunettes. 
           Hannah follows Mia, grabs her hand --

                                 HANNAH
                        Wait.

           Mia turns around.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        You need to be happy for yourself. 
                        It’s great that you’re so 
                        ambitious, but be proud when good 
                        things happen. If you don’t, this 
                        relentless pursuit of something 
                        unachievable will ruin you. 

           Mia listens. Nods. We’re not sure if she got the message.

           EXT. CLUB - NIGHT - LATER

           Sophie stumbles out on the sidewalk, all sorts of fucked up. 
           She takes a look around -- it’s late. The streets are empty 
           save for a few parked cars. 

           She takes out her phone to call an Uber and drops it, 
           SHATTERING the screen. Cursing under her breath, she begins 
           the walk home...

           As one of the parked car’s HEADLIGHTS TURN ON.

           EXT. SOHO - NIGHT

           Sophie can barely stand upright as she closes in on her 
           apartment building. She doesn’t notice the car following her, 
           it’s headlights OFF as it slowly creeps down the street. 

           Sophie takes her keys out of her pocket and goes to cross the 
           street, stumbling over her own two feet.
           Suddenly, the headlights TURN ON. Before Sophie even knows 
           what’s happening, the car FLOORS IT, SLAMMING INTO HER, 
           sending her sprawling across the concrete...

           She lays in agony, COUGHING UP BLOOD, a mess of broken bones 
           as the DRIVER (who we don’t see) approaches. Her terrified 
           eyes RECOGNIZE whoever it is as they pick up her KEYS. 

           A fist GRABS HER HAIR and DRAGS her towards the building, the 
           concrete BURNING the flesh exposed by her backless dress, 
           leaving a TRAIL OF BLOOD as she’s dragged up the stairs...

           LATER --

           The streets are quiet. Serene. Calming. Then, suddenly --

           SOPHIE’S BODY SPLATTERS ON THE PAVEMENT. 

           The sound of a million bones breaking as her body lays 
           twisted and mangled, DARK BLOOD pooling around her...

           EXT. STREET - SOHO - NIGHT

           Mia listens to her anxiety podcast as she walks home.

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        ...the most important distinction 
                        we can make in our daily lives is 
                        what we can and cannot control...

           She doesn’t see the ADALENE emerge from an alley as she 
           passes, shrouded in darkness.

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        ...there are certain things that no 
                        matter what we do, we will never be 
                        able to control...

           Adalene walks faster...

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        ...for instance. Death. We’re all 
                        dying. You will die too, Mia. Death 
                        comes for us all.

           Mia stops walking. What did that just say? 

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        Don’t fight it. Sometimes, it’s 
                        better to give in. Death is coming.
           Mia hits PAUSE on the podcast. It doesn’t stop. Adalene gets 
           CLOSER. And suddenly, the podcast spews out a DEEP, 
           DISTORTED, HORRIFYING VOICE --

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        There is nowhere to run. Death has 
                        come for you.

           As she looks down at her phone in shock, she sees a SHADOW 
           MOVING BEHIND HER. She whips around and sees ADALENE.

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        Tonight, you will die.

           Mia sprints towards her building. Adalene races after her. 
           She climbs the steps, unlocks the door, steps inside and 
           SLAMS the door just as Adalene reaches for her, SNAPPING HER 
           WRIST. She lets out a HORRIFYING, GUTTURAL SCREAM --

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Mia sprints up the stairwell, hyperventilating --

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        Everything you are afraid of is 
                        coming true.

           INT. APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Mia rushes into her apartment and locks the door. She throws 
           her AirPods across the floor where they land at the feet of --

           ADALENE. Dripping wet, holding a KNIFE in her hand. 

           Mia races for the stairs but Adalene POUNCES as she reaches 
           the first steps. She DRAGS her back down and climbs on top of 
           her, dripping water, plunging the knife towards her chest...

           Mia grabs Adalene’s wrist, desperately trying to fight her. 
           The knife gets CLOSER...PUNCTURING THE SKIN...

           INT. KITCHEN - APARTMENT - MORNING

           Mia shoots up on the kitchen floor, clutching her chest. 
           Sweating. Disoriented. What is happening to me?

           She pulls herself up by the counter. Looks at the floor. 
           PUDDLES OF WATER where she was laying. We can’t tell if they 
           are sweat...or something else...

           SUPER: 17 DAYS TO PREMIERE.
           INT. MAKE-UP ROOM - THEATRE - MORNING

           Mia leans in close to the mirror as Hannah does her hair. She 
           has bags under her eyes from lack of sleep. She looks pale. 

                                 HANNAH
                        You okay?

                                 MIA
                        I’m fine. Just not sleeping well.

           She reaches in her purse and swallows three pills. She looks 
           down at her nails. She’s bitten them down HALFWAY -- they’re 
           jagged and raw.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Have you seen Sophie?

                                 HANNAH
                        No. I left right after you did last 
                        night. Have you called her?

           Mia stares at Sophie’s empty chair.

           INT. FITTING ROOM - DAY

           Mia stands on the fitting room pedestal. She’s dressed in the 
           BLACK DRESS and GOLD MASQUERADE MASK again, FAKE BLOOD 
           dripping. More pale than before, she sweats under the lights.

           Saint-Pierre stands with the Tailor. Frustrated.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        It doesn’t look the same.

                                 TAILOR
                        We didn’t touch it --

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        I know what I’m looking at. Check.

           The tailor grabs tape and wraps it around her waist.

                                 TAILOR
                        You’re right. She went down a size.

                                 MIA
                        What?

           Mia looks concerned. Saint-Pierre puts his hand over his 
           mouth and steps in front of her. A scary look in his eye.
                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        You’re losing weight. Why?

                                 MIA
                        I don’t know. I’m not trying to --

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        We’ve already done ten fittings. If 
                        you lose weight then we have to 
                        redo all of them.

           He GRABS and JERKS her JAW. The room is silent, 
           uncomfortable. Mia is terrified as he inspects her face.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        You’re pale. Why?

                                 MIA
                        I -- I don’t know --

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        This is not what I asked of you. 
                        This is not what I want. This is 
                        not what Lucinda wants, or Vogue 
                        wants, or what the face of 
                        Dollhouse should look like. 

                                 MIA
                        I’m sorry --

           He GRABS HER THROAT and SQUEEZES. The tailors GASP. Claude, 
           watching in the back, steps forward, concerned. She CHOKES. 
           He is as incensed as any man can be.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        This has to be perfect. Do you 
                        understand me? I am giving you the 
                        opportunity of a lifetime. You’re 
                        the face of a vision that took me 
                        five years to create. Five fucking 
                        years. You have to be perfect. Bad 
                        things will happen if you are not. 
                        Do you understand?

           Mia nods. He holds for another second as she struggles to 
           breath and releases her. She collapses, gasping for air. He 
           looks at her in disgust. Straightens out his suit.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        Good.

           A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. Immediately, Saint-Pierre is furious --
                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                             (French; subtitled)
                        I said I did not want to be fucking 
                        disturbed --

                                 CLAUDE
                             (French; subtitled)
                        I’m sorry. I will handle this.

           He opens the door. We hear unintelligible voices as Saint-
           Pierre LOOMS over Mia. Like the power is a rush to him.

                                 CLAUDE (CONT’D)
                             (French; subtitled)
                        Monsieur. It is urgent. 

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Non je suis occupé --

                                 CLAUDE
                        C'est la police.

           Everybody looks up. Saint-Pierre looks at Claude for a 
           moment, then heads for the door. As the door opens, we catch 
           a glimpse of OFFICER BAILEY and OFFICER HOLLOWAY in the hall.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - PRECINCT - NIGHT

           Mia’s makeup runs as she wipes tears from her eyes. She’s 
           still in the black dress. Her GOLD MASK lays on the table as 
           she wipes the fake blood off her neck with a paper towel.

           Officer Holloway sits across from her.

                                 OFFICER HOLLOWAY
                        Again, you are not in trouble. We 
                        just wanted to talk with you away 
                        from...everything else.

           Officer Bailey comes in with a glass of water for her.

                                 MIA
                        Who found her?

                                 OFFICER HOLLOWAY
                        One of the other tenants heard the 
                        sound. Called it in. You said you 
                        guys were out celebrating?

                                 MIA
                        Yeah. We had just learned we got 
                        the Vogue cover.
                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        Vogue? Damn.

           Holloway glares at him. Bailey clears his throat.

                                 OFFICER HOLLOWAY
                        And there were drugs consumed? 

           Mia is silent.

                                 OFFICER HOLLOWAY (CONT’D)
                        You’re not here because we want to 
                        lock you up for taking some pills. 
                        We just want to know what happened.

                                 MIA
                        She had been drinking. Took some 
                        ecstasy, I don’t know what else. 
                        But she does that all the time. She 
                        wasn’t suicidal. I would’ve known 
                        if something was wrong.

                                 OFFICER HOLLOWAY
                        Sometimes we don’t always notice --

                                 MIA
                        She wouldn’t have killed herself. 

                                 OFFICER HOLLOWAY
                        So you think she was murdered?

           She doesn’t know what to say. Or what to think.

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        Tell us about Mr. Saint-Pierre.

                                 MIA
                        What about him?

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        Has he ever been violent towards 
                        you? Have you felt...unsafe?

           Mia has a FLASHBACK TO:

           - Saint-Pierre CHOKING HER just moments before.

           - Saint-Pierre fucking her as her back is sliced by shards of 
           the broken mirror, his hand CLASPING HER MOUTH SHUT.

                                 MIA
                        No.
                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        And Sophie? What was their 
                        relationship like?

           She has another flashback to:

           - Sophie bent over a sink in the Met bathroom as Saint-Pierre 
           PRESSES her face down onto the counter, fucking her --

                                 MIA
                        I don’t know. Normal? Why? You 
                        think he killed the girl he had 
                        just given the cover of Vogue to?

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        You tell us.

                                 MIA
                        He’s a fashion designer.

                                 OFFICER HOLLOWAY
                        I’m not sure anyone knows what he 
                        truly is.

                                 MIA
                        What do you mean?

                                 OFFICER HOLLOWAY
                        This isn’t the first time he’s been 
                        on our radar. A model killed 
                        herself on his first campaign. 
                        There were signs of foul play but 
                        we could never prove anything.

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        Three girls since then have died on 
                        his campaigns. Two of which he was 
                        allegedly fucking. 

                                 OFFICER HOLLOWAY
                        I don’t know where he’s been. But I 
                        know that before he left, there 
                        were questions.

           Mia wipes the fake blood off her neck. Avoiding their gaze.

                                 MIA
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about. He’s been great to me.

           Officer Bailey leans closer to her...

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        What happened to your neck?
           For the first time, we see BRUISES.

           EXT. PATIO - NIGHT

           Alix and Mia sit on their balcony. Alix sips Vodka.

                                 ALIX
                        There has to be something.

                                 MIA
                        I don’t why everyone’s asking me 
                        this --

                                 ALIX
                        Because he likes you --

                                 MIA
                        Why do you think that? Because I 
                        got Vogue it must be because the 
                        designer wants to fuck me?

                                 ALIX
                        Two of our friends are dead. And 
                        both of them are working for him 
                        and you don’t even seem sad, or 
                        worried, or suspicious at all.

                                 MIA
                        Don’t tell me I’m not sad. I’m not 
                        suspicious because I know him.

                                 ALIX
                        Do you? Because to me, it looks 
                        like he has you wrapped around his 
                        finger. He’s turning you into 
                        something I don’t even recognize 
                        anymore.

                                 MIA
                        He’s turning me into a supermodel.

                                 ALIX
                        What happened to Mia? Don’t you 
                        want to be her?

           Mia stares out at the lights of Manhattan.

                                 MIA
                        I want to be somebody.

           She plays with her nails -- they start to BLEED. Alix looks 
           at her with sad eyes. Takes a sip of Vodka.
                                 ALIX
                        I think I’m quitting Dior.

                                 MIA
                        What? Why?

                                 ALIX
                        It’s just not fun anymore. Josh got 
                        a job offer in Philly and I’m 
                        thinking of going with him.

                                 MIA
                        So, what -- you’re just going to 
                        leave me here by myself?

                                 ALIX
                        There’s more to life than ‘being 
                        somebody’, Mia. I hope that you’ll 
                        see that someday soon.

           Alix heads inside. Mia sits alone. Emotions overcoming her. 

           INT. BATHROOM - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mia steps on the scale. 119 lbs. Shit.

           She dumps five pills in her hand and swallows them dry. She 
           looks down at her hand and sees another one of her NAILS 
           BLEEDING. The blood starts coming faster and faster...

           Suddenly, TWO OTHER FINGERNAILS start to bleed. Both bitten 
           down near the cuticle. Mia turns on the faucet and runs water 
           over them, GRIMACING as the water touches the raw flesh. 

           But the blood doesn’t stop -- it just keeps coming, more and 
           more, thicker and thicker until the ENTIRE SINK IS BLOOD RED.

           She tries to suck the blood out and another NAIL comes off in 
           her mouth. She spits it out and it gets lodged in the drain. 
           The bloody water then OVERFLOWS THE SINK, seeping onto the 
           counter and dripping down the cabinets --

           She goes to remove it when TWO MORE NAILS CRACK and COME OFF 
           HER HAND. She winces in pain. Brings her trembling hand out 
           of the water. ALL OF HER NAILS ARE GONE. Just bright red, raw 
           flesh. Panicking, she looks up in the mirror --

           AND SEES ADALENE STANDING RIGHT BEHIND HER.

           She SCREAMS and whips around -- but nobody’s there.

           She collapses on the ground in a panic attack. Her hands 
           trembling, her breathing rapid. She clutches her chest...
           INT. DR. WOODARD'S OFFICE - MORNING

           All of the fingers on Mia’s left hand are wrapped in band-
           aids. The bags under her eyes have gotten more pronounced -- 
           her cheekbones are visible. She’s paler, getting skinnier.

           SUPER: 9 DAYS TO PREMIERE.

                                 MIA
                        I know she wasn’t suicidal. I 
                        would’ve known.

           She picks at the band-aids. Dr. Woodard watches.

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        I think we should leave the 
                        speculation for the authorities. 
                        What I can best help you with is 
                        your grief. How are you feeling?

                                 MIA
                        Awful. Two of my friends are dead. 
                        Alix might be leaving me. I can’t 
                        eat. I can’t sleep. And I’m 
                        supposed to be on the cover of 
                        Vogue in a week.
                             (then)
                        Every time something good happens 
                        to me, something a thousand times 
                        worse follows.

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        Are you having night terrors?

           Mia looks up from her band-aids. Considering telling her...

                                 MIA
                        I’m seeing somebody. In my dreams. 
                        Sometimes during the day, too. A 
                        woman. Skinny. Brunette. Pale with 
                        dark eyes. 

           Dr. Woodard sits silently. We realize that the woman she is 
           describing sounds eerily like...Mia.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        She’s dripping wet sometimes and 
                        looks like some kind of corpse.

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        What does she do when you see her?

                                 MIA
                        She’s trying to kill me.
           Dr. Woodard stares for a beat. Sets her notes aside.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        I know it sounds crazy but she’s 
                        wearing the same clothes I am in 
                        the show. She follows me --

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        I think you should step away from 
                        work for a bit.

                                 MIA
                        What? No. I can’t --

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        Mia, this is something that goes 
                        way beyond anxiety. You’re 
                        experiencing intense trauma from 
                        recent events which is very 
                        understandable, but it has to be 
                        dealt with.

                                 MIA
                        If you could just increase my meds 
                        while I get through this --

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        I can’t do that. You’re on a very 
                        high dose of benzodiazepines as it 
                        is and this has nothing to do with 
                        medication. Your emotions are in a 
                        tailspin and they’re manifesting 
                        themselves physically.

                                 MIA
                        I just need something to get me 
                        through the show, then we can --

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        That’s not how this works. I 
                        wouldn’t be doing my job if I just 
                        handed you a bunch of pills.

                                 MIA
                        Then maybe I should find a new 
                        doctor.

           Dr. Woodard raises her eyebrows, taken aback. We see 
           something in Mia’s eyes. Anger. But also...desperation.
           INT. HANNAH’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The blinds are drawn and room is dark as Mia and Hannah watch 
           AMERICAN BEAUTY. The scene where Mena Suvari performs a dance 
           routine at the basketball game.

           Hannah lights a BONG, inhales and exhales. Offers it to Mia.

                                 MIA
                        I’m good, thanks.

           Hannah shrugs, sinks into the couch and eats gummy worms. Mia 
           is waiting for her new NEON BLUE FAKE NAILS to dry. In her 
           other hand, she twirls the ‘SP’ crystal and gold LAPEL PIN.

                                 HANNAH
                        I love this movie so much. 

                                 MIA
                        She’s beautiful.

                                 HANNAH
                        Drew really nailed that style for 
                        your shoot.

           A heavy silence in the air. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        I helped his parents clean out his 
                        studio yesterday. I have all the 
                        files and hardcopies from your 
                        shoot if you want them.

                                 MIA
                        Oh -- sure. Thanks.

           They watch in silence as the iconic scene unfolds where Mena 
           is isolated on the basketball court, a spotlight illuminating 
           her. Mia’s anxiety is through the roof.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Fuck it. I’ll try it.

           She leans over, grabs the bong. Hannah sits up.

                                 HANNAH
                        You sure?

                                 MIA
                        You just have to light it for me.

           She does -- Mia inhales and starts hacking up a lung.
                                 HANNAH
                        Have you smoked before?

           Mia shakes her head, her trembling hand reaching for water.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        It’ll burn for a second. Just keep 
                        drinking.

           Mia drains the water. Keeps coughing. Sits back in her chair. 
           Her eyes start getting heavy. In a daze. The coughing slowly 
           subsides. She’s high. 

           She watches in a trance as Mena seductively unzips her 
           cheerleading outfit and the red roses fall out. She watches 
           it all...seeing HERSELF as the center of attention...

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Hey, by the way -- I need to talk 
                        to you about something. I’m --

           Suddenly, Mia’s PHONE RINGS on the other side of the room, 
           charging on Hannah’s vanity. She slowly gets up and goes to 
           grab it. It’s CLAUDE. As she picks it up, she notices 
           something underneath...

           A PICTURE. STICKING OUT FROM A FOLDER LABELED ‘DOLLHOUSE’. 

           Mia slowly pulls it out, revealing --

           A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADALENE. In the white dress, taken some years 
           before. She looks young, vibrant, but in the same makeup.

           It looks exactly like the photograph we saw of Mia on Drew’s 
           computer after her shoot.

           Mia’s hands tremble as she holds it. Can’t tell if it’s real 
           or if she’s just really fucking high. 

                                 MIA
                        Who is this?

                                 HANNAH
                        What?

                                 MIA
                             (frantic)
                        This woman. Who is she? Where did 
                        you get this?

                                 HANNAH
                        Calm down, you’re freaking me out --

           Mia takes the photo, thrusts it in Hannah’s face.
                                 MIA
                        Who is this!

                                 HANNAH
                        I don’t know! Saint-Pierre gave it 
                        to me as a reference for your look! 
                        Why, what’s wrong?

           Mia puts her hands over her head, tries to breathe. Then, 
           abruptly, she takes the photograph and heads for the door...

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Mia!

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE - EVENING

           Mia emerges from the subway in Times Square, photograph in 
           hand. Anxious. She looks up and FREEZES in her tracks.

           EVERY SINGLE BILLBOARD, TICKER, POSTER, VIDEO is BLACK and 
           RED with DOLLHOUSE written on it. Like a million billboards 
           in different formats and sizes. A complete overload.

           Mia looks around, sees people walking by and tourists taking 
           pictures as if nothing is out of the ordinary. She is 
           confused -- but completely hypnotized.

           INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

           Mia enters the theatre where production is almost complete. 
           The stage is BRIGHT WHITE, fake RED and BLACK BLOOD 
           splattered over the runway and all over THE THEATRE WALLS. A 
           dozen BLACK COFFINS standing upright on stage. 

           The back of the stage is covered with a myriad of enlarged, 
           stylized NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS and HEADLINES --

           THIRTY SAINT-PIERRE STORES CLOSE, DESIGNER DISAPPEARS...

           It’s a FASHION HOUSE OF HORRORS. Unsettling and disturbing.

                                 MELANIE (O.S.)
                        Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
           Mia turns, sees Melanie and Cara fresh from their fittings. 
           Cara walks closer. Brushes Mia’s HAIR out of her face --

                                 CARA
                        Odd when the dead friend is the 
                        better looking one --

           Mia GRABS her wrist. Her fake nails barely puncture the skin, 
           a single droplet of BLOOD running down Cara’s wrist. Both 
           girls try to hide their surprise at her flash of violence.

                                 CARA (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t going to end the way you 
                        think it will. I promise.

           Mia’s eyes show a spark of evil. Like she’s transforming...

           EXT. ROOF - THEATRE - NIGHT

           It’s raining. The bright lights of New York in a blurry glow. 
           Claude carries an umbrella for Mia as she approaches the same 
           table as before, where Saint-Pierre sips an espresso.

           She sits. Eyes him. A mixture of suspicion and wonder. He 
           grabs her hand and she lights up.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        I have heard about Sophie. I cannot 
                        express to you how my heart breaks. 
                        I feel a great sense of loss, but I 
                        know it pales in comparison to the 
                        pain you feel.

           Mia nods. Trying not to cry.

                                 MIA
                        Thank you.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        If you need anything at all, please 
                        -- I am here for you.

           She smiles. Feels infinitely better already. He takes a long 
           look at her. Her pale skin, wet, stringy hair, skinny body, 
           jutting cheek bones, dark eyes with bags...

           He chooses his words carefully as he cups her hand in his.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        Mia, it is very apparent to me that 
                        you are struggling. It is very 
                        important to me that everything in 
                        this show is absolutely perfect. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        But right now, you are not perfect. 
                        And I cannot let you be the face of 
                        it.

           Her heart shatters. Jaw drops.

                                 MIA
                        What?

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        I think it’s best for us to pull 
                        back on your role in the show. Cara 
                        and Melanie will do the shoot --

           Mia stands, infuriated, desperate.

                                 MIA
                        No! You promised me I could do 
                        this! This is supposed to be mine! 

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Mia --

                                 MIA
                        The theme of the show is death, 
                        right? I’d think that with all the 
                        shit I’ve been through since you 
                        brought me on, that makes me a 
                        pretty fucking good candidate.

           Saint-Pierre glances at Claude -- his face stoic.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        I can do this.

           Saint-Pierre sips his espresso. Thinks.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Okay. I will keep you on the cover. 
                        But let’s be clear. If it is not 
                        perfect, or exactly what I want --

                                 MIA
                        Thank you --

           He SLAMS his fist on the table. The coffee cup rattles.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Do not fucking interrupt me.

           Mia stands terrified as the rain pours around them.
                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        Get some rest and go back to being 
                        who you were during your audition. 
                        That’s the Mia I want.

           She nods. Alix’s words echoing in her mind. She gets up --

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        One more thing. Hannah came to see 
                        me yesterday. Seems she’s quitting 
                        the campaign.

                                 MIA
                             (shocked)
                        She’s what?

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        What we are doing here is 
                        confidential. And she has already 
                        proven she can get me the exact 
                        look I want with you. She cannot 
                        leave. Not this late.

                                 MIA
                        I’ll talk to her.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        So will I.

           The soft PATTERING OF RAIN on the umbrella as Mia stares back 
           at Saint-Pierre, a menacing and threatening look in his eyes.

           INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

           Mia hustles down the stairs of the subway. She checks her 
           phone -- 5% battery. She dials.

           It goes STRAIGHT TO VOICEMAIL.

                                 MIA
                        Fuck!

           She hears the *BEEP* as the subway arrives.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Hey, it’s me. I need to talk to 
                        you. You didn’t tell me you were 
                        going to fucking quit the campaign, 
                        the show is in three days. I need 
                        you.

           Mia moves pushes through the crowd towards the subway door --
                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        And Saint-Pierre was really angry. 
                        He said he was going to come and 
                        talk to you but I --

           *BEEP*. Mia checks the phone. CALL FAILED.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

           The subway doors close. She slips inside --

           INT. HANNAH’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Hannah grabs things from her bathroom, shoving them in a 
           travel bag and into a massive suitcase on top of her bed. Her 
           window is open, rain leaking inside.

                                 HANNAH
                        Dammit --

           She SHUTS IT.

           She walks to the LIVING ROOM and to the vanity, where she 
           gathers her stylist supplies. As she grabs her pair of 
           STYLIST SCISSORS, she notices the manila DOLLHOUSE folder. 
           She opens it -- Adalene’s picture is gone.

           A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

           She freezes for a moment. Checks her watch. 10:41 P.M. She 
           carefully walks towards the door...

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Who is it?

           No answer. She walks closer, grabs the doorknob, debating 
           whether to open it...

           And finally, she DOES. But nobody’s there. Just the rain.

           She shuts the door and goes back to her vanity. She gathers 
           her supplies -- but the scissors aren’t where she left them. 
           She checks the bag, her pockets. Nothing.

           Confused, she turns OFF the living room lights and heads back 
           to her bedroom where she sees --

           THE WINDOW IS OPEN. Rain leaking in again.

           She stands completely still, terrified. She starts to walk 
           back out of the room when we see -- 
           The SILHOUETTE OF A DARK FIGURE BEHIND HER. 

           Before she can turn around, a CLEAR PLASTIC BAG is THROWN 
           OVER HER HEAD. She’s wrestled to the floor as she suffocates, 
           her limps flailing and clawing at the bag --

           As she struggles, she’s able to identify the figure standing 
           over her and her eyes WIDEN with terror. We catch a glimpse 
           of her STYLIST SCISSORS as they are PLUNGED INTO HER THROAT --

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           A crowd emerges from the subway. Mia’s frantically trying to 
           call Hannah -- but her phone DIES. Fuck.

           Exasperated, she looks around and notices a brunette woman 
           just hanging up her phone. Mia rushes towards her --

                                 MIA
                        Excuse me, ma’am, but could I --

           The woman turns around and --

           It’s ADALENE. Her BLACK EYE SHADOW running down her face, 
           just how it was styled for Mia in the hospital gown. She 
           stares at Mia, CRYING and WAILING...

           Mia RECOILS IN HORROR and sprints in the other direction.

           LATER --

           Mia takes two pills from her pocket and swallows them, hands 
           trembling as she hails a TAXI. She finally flags one down -- 
           on the top of it is a black and red advertisement. DOLLHOUSE.

           INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS

           Mia jumps inside the back seat --

                                 MIA
                        228 East 54th --

           The driver turns around. It’s ADALENE in the GOLD MASK, BLOOD 
           DRIPPING DOWN HER MOUTH AND NECK. She smiles.

           Mia SCREAMS, reaches for the door -- the car is LOCKED. 
           Adalene starts crawling into the backseat, reaching for Mia. 
           Mia KICKS wildly, hitting her in the jaw, blood splattering 
           on the windows and all over Mia.  

           She frantically reaches for the locks and is able to pull it 
           up. She falls out of the car --
           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           -- and races down the street, blood on her face and clothes. 
           She turns a corner, running as fast as she can, runs through 
           an alley, emerges on a street and finds herself at --

           The DOLLHOUSE THEATRE.

           INT. THEATRE - MOMENTS LATER

           It’s pitch black. Mia feels her way through the seats and 
           towards the runway. She climbs up and searches for a light on 
           the wing of the stage. She pulls a lever.

           EXIT MUSIC (FOR A FILM) starts to play and the entire theatre 
           ILLUMINATES. The fashion house of horrors suddenly feels much 
           more harrowing when she’s here by herself. The coffins 
           onstage, the fake blood on the runway and walls...

                                 RADIOHEAD
                        Wake from your sleep / The drying 
                        of your tears / Today, we escape / 
                        We escape...

           She walks to the center of the stage. Looking out at all of 
           the empty seats. Suddenly, there is STATIC on the video board 
           behind her. When she turns to see, it changes to --

           A picture of ADALENE. The same one she saw on Hannah’s desk.

           As she stares at it, she doesn’t see THE REAL ADALENE, 
           DRIPPING WET in the white dress, slowly walking the runway 
           behind her. 

                                 RADIOHEAD (CONT’D)
                        Pack and get dressed / Before your 
                        father hears us / Before all hell 
                        breaks loose...

           Mia looks around, confused. Tears in her eyes. On the verge 
           of a breakdown. Under the lights, she looks even skinnier and 
           paler than every before. The blood on her skin GLISTENS.

                                 MIA
                        What is happening to me?

           The hairs on her forearms stand up. She turns around and sees 
           Adalene, standing a few feet away from her. Tears roll down 
           Mia’s cheeks. Adalene just stares. Looking dead as fuck.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                             (screaming)
                        What do you want from me!
           Adalene steps towards her, just inches away now. Mia trembles 
           in fear. Adalene touches her hair, brushes it out of her 
           face. Then, just as she’s about to finally SPEAK --

           INT. HANNAH’S HOUSE - MORNING

           She sits up, GASPING FOR AIR. Another night terror. Only this 
           time --

           There’s still blood on her face.

           She looks around -- realizes she’s in Hannah’s house. Wipes 
           sweat from her face and slowly stands.

                                 MIA
                        Hannah?

           The window is open where rain has leaked in. She looks around 
           the bedroom -- most of her clothes and belongings are gone. 

           She walks into the LIVING ROOM -- nothing is out of the 
           ordinary. All pristine. But the vanity is clear of all of her 
           stylist supplies.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Hannah, are you home?

           She looks into the mirror, sees the blood on her face. Rushes 
           into Hannah’s --

           BATHROOM --

           And frantically splashes water on her face. She looks down at 
           her right hand -- a NAIL is hanging off.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Fuck. Fuck fuck.

           She tries to somehow reattach it but RIPS IT OFF. As it 
           bleeds, she runs it under the water and TWO MORE NAILS RIP 
           OFF, blood swirling in the sink. She grimaces.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Fuck! God fucking dammit!

           She looks at herself in the mirror. Her lips are cracked and 
           bleeding. Her skin is white as a ghost. Her eyes are black 
           holes. Cheek bones jagged. She touches her face, as if she 
           can’t believe it’s really her.

           She turns around, sees her shoulder blades jutting through 
           her shirt. She lifts it up. Her ribs visible. 
           She tries to smooth her hair -- and pulls out a CLUMP in her 
           fist. She stares in horror. 

           She’s literally falling apart.

           She reaches into her pocket for pills, her bloody hand 
           shaking, and as she pulls it out, the pills go SPILLING 
           ACROSS THE FLOOR along with --

           A folded up picture.

           She stares at it for a moment, then bends down and picks it 
           up. Opens it. Sees Adalene. She lets it fall to the floor and 
           collapses against the wall. Puts her heads between her knees 
           and tries to breathe. Losing all control.

           SUPER: 5 DAYS UNTIL PREMIERE.

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Alix pours Mia a glass of water as she sits at the island in 
           the kitchen, wiping tears away.

                                 ALIX
                        She didn’t even tell you?

                                 MIA
                        No. She was already gone.

                                 ALIX
                        Jesus. That’s kinda fucked.

                                 MIA
                        I feel like I’m going crazy.

           She takes a sip of water. Alix bites her tongue...

                                 ALIX
                        Josh and I are leaving tomorrow.

                                 MIA
                        What?

                                 ALIX
                        You should come with us. We’re 
                        staying in a hotel while we try to 
                        find a place.

                                 MIA
                        You’re leaving already? Why? What 
                        am I supposed to do without you?
                                 ALIX
                        I’m saying you should come with us. 
                        This job is killing you. It’s made 
                        you into -- this.

           That last part stings.

                                 MIA
                        My job has nothing to do with --

                                 ALIX
                        Mia.

                                 MIA
                        He’s given me everything! I 
                        couldn’t afford rent a month ago 
                        and now I finally have something to 
                        be proud of. He’s making me 
                        somebody I’ve always want to be.

                                 ALIX
                        This is who you always wanted to 
                        be? Look at yourself!

                                 MIA
                        You can’t leave. Everyone else has 
                        left, you can’t leave me too --

                                 ALIX
                        He’s hurting you --

           Mia THROWS her glass against the wall. It shatters.

                                 MIA
                        No! He’s not! You don’t know him!

           There’s a scary spark in her eyes. Alix takes a step back.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mia stands on the scale. 111 lbs. That can’t be right, can 
           it? She gets off, SHAKES THE SCALE, gets back on. 110 lbs.

           Horrified, she walks in front of the mirror. She is 
           HORRIFICALLY SKINNY. Nothing but bones and flesh. Her eyes 
           catch the crystal and gold ‘SP’ lapel pin by the sink. All of 
           the sudden...

           The BONES START BURSTING THROUGH THE SKIN. The flesh starts 
           to RIP, like it’s a piece of clothing thats too tight, and 
           BLOOD starts to GUSH out of her. Her skin looks like it’s 
           MELTING.
           Panicked, she feels her face and watches as the skin MELTS 
           OFF HER FACE, like her body is RAPIDLY DECOMPOSING in front 
           of her very eyes. She SCREAMS...

           INT. MAKE-UP ROOM - THEATRE - MORNING

           Mia stares in the mirror, touching her face. Examining her 
           ghoulish features and ghostly skin. 

           Cara and Melanie enter, drinking green smoothies. Cara kneels 
           behind her chair, looking into the mirror with her.

                                 MELANIE
                        Heard you lost your stylist. Tough 
                        break. But don’t worry -- I’m sure 
                        things will work out spectacularly 
                        for you. Again.

           She gives a wicked smile and leaves. Mia looks at all the 
           other girls -- their stylists applying make-up, transforming 
           them from normal to supermodel.

           Mia turns back to her own mirror. Alone. Pathetically, she 
           starts to apply her own makeup...

           INT. FITTING ROOM - LATER

           Mia stands on the pedestal in the infamous WHITE DRESS. The 
           ‘SP’ crystal and gold LAPEL PIN affixed on the front. Her 
           chest bones visible. Pale. Sweating. As the tailors check her 
           waistline, Saint-Pierre watches in the corner. FUMING.

                                 TAILOR
                        It’s falling off of her.

           Saint-Pierre just stares. A violence in his eyes. 

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        She is closing the show in this. 

                                 TAILOR
                        We need more time --

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Everybody out.

           They don’t have to be told twice. Mia’s heart lurches into 
           her throat. He walks towards her, slowly...

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        I’m taking you off the Vogue shoot.
                                 MIA
                        What?

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        It was a mistake. Melanie and Cara 
                        will do it. And they will open and 
                        close the show as well.

                                 MIA
                        No, wait, I can do this --

           He PUNCHES THE MIRROR, BLOOD spurting out his hand --

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        No you can’t! Look at yourself. You 
                        don’t have what I need. I need 
                        perfection. I thought you could 
                        handle this opportunity but you 
                        can’t. You will walk in the middle 
                        of the show with the others.

           Mia’s eyes bubble with tears.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        This dress is the most important 
                        part of the show. It is the end to 
                        the masterpiece. It is everything I 
                        have to say. It is why I fucking 
                        chose you. It’s what makes you her.

                                 MIA
                        Please --

           Mia’s eyes glisten with tears. As one rolls down her cheek, 
           he GRABS HER THROAT, YANKS HER OFF THE PEDESTAL, THROWS HER 
           UP AGAINST THE MIRROR --

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        I have given you everything you 
                        could ever want. You are never 
                        going to be who I thought you could 
                        be. This is my fucking magnum opus. 
                        And you are nothing to me.

           He storms out of the room. She sinks to the floor, sobbing.

           INT./EXT. HANNAH’S HOUSE - SUNSET

           Officer Bailey and Holloway get out of their police cruiser 
           and walk towards the small house.

                                 OFFICER HOLLOWAY
                        Does her mom live in the city?
                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        No. She lives in Portland. Says her 
                        daughter was supposed to fly in 
                        this morning but never did.

           Officer Bailey knocks on the door. Nothing. He knocks again.

                                 OFFICER BAILEY (CONT’D)
                        NYPD! Anybody home?

           Nothing. Looks to Holloway, he shrugs. He knocks again, 
           harder, and the door CRACKS OPEN.

           He gently pushes it open --

                                 OFFICER BAILEY (CONT’D)
                        Anybody home? 

           They step INSIDE THE HOUSE --

           Everything looks normal. Officer Bailey heads to the bedroom. 
           Notices the open window and streaks of rain. He turns back, 
           roaming around the room. Opens the closet --

           Most of the clothes are gone. But at the bottom -- HANNAH’S 
           SUITCASE and STYLIST bag. He walks back to the living room, 
           where Holloway is looking around with a flashlight.

                                 OFFICER HOLLOWAY
                        Anything?

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        Her bags are here.

                                 OFFICER HOLLOWAY
                        Maybe she hasn’t left?

           Bailey thinks. Heads for the GARAGE. Opens the door --

           Her car is there. He opens the front door, inspects the 
           inside. Nothing. As he goes to get out he notices -- the 
           button for the TRUNK. Presses it.

                                 OFFICER HOLLOWAY (CONT’D)
                        Anything?

           Bailey ignores him, goes to the back of the car. Pauses for a 
           moment...then lifts the trunk...

           And RECOILS IN HORROR. We get a quick glimpse of --

           HANNAH, her face covered in the bloody clear plastic bag. Her 
           eyes are open and her tongue has been CUT OUT. 
           Her neck has been SLICED from EAR to EAR. Her scissors 
           STICKING OUT OF HER CHEST.

           INT. DR. WOODARD'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Dr. Woodard packs up for the night. There’s a KNOCK at the 
           door. Surprised, she checks the clock -- 9:23 P.M.

           She opens the door and sees Mia standing there. Distraught.

           LATER --

           Dr. Woodard takes out a pill bottle and water bottle as Mia 
           sits on the couch, rambling, in a panic.

                                 MIA
                        I know it was him. All of this is 
                        him. He’s trying to turn me into 
                        something. Or someone.

           Dr. Woodard sets down a water bottle and two pills. Mia is 
           picking at her EYELASHES -- they’re coming off.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        What is this?

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        Librium. It will calm you down.

           She shoves them in her mouth and gulps them down. Dr. Woodard 
           watches with a keen eye as she takes a seat.

                                 DR. WOODARD (CONT’D)
                        What do you mean he’s trying to 
                        turn you into someone?

           Mia reaches into her pocket, pulls out the folded photograph 
           and hands it over. It’s covered in DRIED BLOOD. She opens it.

                                 MIA
                        I don’t know who she is but he 
                        wants me to look exactly like her. 
                        Made me dye my hair, dresses me 
                        like her. He probably did to her 
                        what he’s doing to me.

           She takes a sip of water. Her vision starts to get a bit 
           blurry. She shakes her head. Drowsy.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        He’s a monster. And he killed Drew 
                        and Sophie. I know he did.
                                 (MORE)
                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                             (then)
                        How strong are these pills?

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        Where were you the night that Drew 
                        died?

                                 MIA
                        What?

           Dr. Woodard says nothing. Waiting for her to answer.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        I was at the Metropolitan. For the 
                        launch party.

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        And where did you wake up?

                                 MIA
                        Home? 

           Dr. Woodard grabs her notes.

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        According to our session two days 
                        after, you woke up on the couch 
                        after Alix heard you screaming.

                                 MIA
                        Oh. Yeah. I’d had a night terror --

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        And on the seventeenth, you woke up 
                        on your kitchen floor. Sophie was 
                        found dead that morning.
                             (then)
                        You said you woke up at Hannah’s 
                        last night. Where was she?

           Mia is confused. Her brain is foggy. Eyes heavy.

                                 MIA
                        I’ve had night terrors my entire 
                        life. I don’t see how --

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        They’re not night terrors. It’s not 
                        parasomnia. You’re having a 
                        psychotic break with reality.

                                 MIA
                        A psychotic...what?
                                 DR. WOODARD
                        The human brain has the ability to 
                        protect itself from traumatic 
                        events that it knows will harm the 
                        psyche. What you thought were night 
                        terrors are blackouts.

           Mia is struggling to keep her eyes open.

                                 MIA
                        You think...I killed my friends?

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        I wondered why the benzos weren’t 
                        working. But when you started 
                        losing weight and your physical 
                        appearance deteriorated, I realized 
                        -- hallucinations. Persecutory 
                        delusions. Apathy. This is 
                        psychosis. Your mind has conjured 
                        up a reality where you are in 
                        danger and need to protect 
                        yourself. You don’t know what 
                        you’ve done.

           She goes to her CONFERENCE PHONE. Dials. Mia is barely awake.

                                 MIA
                        What did you give me?

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        Extra-strength Haloperidol. It’s a 
                        sedative-antipsychotic.

           Mia tries to stand. She’s wobbly. Holds herself up.

                                 VOICE (THROUGH PHONE)
                        Bellevue Hospital.

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        This Dr. Helen Woodard. I’d like to 
                        request the transport of a patient -

           Mia stumbles over a table, makes her way to Dr. Woodard --

                            MIA
           I’m not crazy. Please. Stop. 
           Put the phone down --
                                                  DR. WOODARD (CONT'D)
                                              -- from 184 East 9th Street, 
                                              Unit 7B -- 

                                 VOICE (THROUGH PHONE)
                        Voluntary or involuntary?

                                 DR. WOODARD
                        Involuntary. Patient name is Mia --
                                 MIA
                        I said stop!

           Mia LUNGES and WRESTLES Dr. Woodard to the floor. She climbs 
           on top of her, her vision blurry and head heavy, SEIZING HER 
           THROAT and SLAMMING the back of her head into the floor.

                                 VOICE (THROUGH PHONE)
                        Dr. Woodard?

           Dr. Woodard pries Mia’s hands from her throat but before she 
           can escape, Mia grabs a LETTER OPENER and THRUSTS it into her 
           eye. She SCREAMS, blindly clawing at Mia’s face, ripping off 
           EYELASHES and grabbing a FISTFUL OF HAIR OFF OF HER SCALP --

                                 VOICE (THROUGH PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Dr. Woodard? 

           Mia YANKS the letter opener out of Dr. Woodard’s eye socket 
           and STABS it DEEP into her HEART, DRAGGING IT DOWN HER CHEST. 
           Blood SPLATTERS on her face.

                                 VOICE (THROUGH PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Emergency vehicles are on their 
                        way. Stay where you are.

           Mia stands, grabs the phone off the table and SMASHES it on 
           the floor. Dripping with blood, she stands over her doctor.

           CLUMPS OF HER HAIR are on the floor and Dr. Woodard’s fist. 
           Her fake nails have fallen off and her eyelashes have been 
           ripped off. Her lips are cracked. Blood on her face.

           She is a fucking corpse.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           Mia walks out into the busy streets of New York. 

           Mia’s POV: All of the lights and her surroundings are blurred 
           together. Her breathing is slowing. She’s sedated.

           She tries to read street signs but she can’t. She uses all 
           her strength to walk but sedation overtakes her and she 
           collapses. Slowly, she crawls to a nearby ALLEYWAY and we --

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           FADE IN:
           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           A CELL PHONE RINGS incessantly. Mia SHOOTS UP in bed her 
           brain foggy. She takes in her surroundings -- how the fuck 
           did I get back home? The phone rings -- she grabs it.

                                 MIA
                        Hello?

                                 CLAUDE (O.S.)
                        Mia.

           Her heart sinks. 

                                 MIA
                        Yes?

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (O.S.)
                        Something has come up. Are you at 
                        your apartment?

                                 MIA
                        Yes.

                                 CLAUDE (O.S.)
                        We are sending a car to you now. 

                                 MIA
                        For what?

                                 CLAUDE (O.S.)
                        The Vogue Shoot. Cara and Melanie 
                        have disappeared. 

           Mia’s face falls. She gets up, walks towards the bathroom --

                                 CLAUDE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Monsieur Saint-Pierre is apologetic 
                        for how he behaved towards you 
                        yesterday. He is under immense 
                        pressure. But he would like you to 
                        do the shoot.

           Mia looks at herself in the mirror -- pale, skinny, corpse-
           like. Like she’s deteriorated into a grotesque monster. She 
           is somebody not even she recognizes anymore.

                                 MIA
                        I’d love to.

           She hangs up. As she goes to the bathroom, we ANGLE ON:

           HER NIGHTSTAND. Where BLOOD DRIPS FROM THE CORNER...
           EXT. SAINT-PIERRE’S MANSION - DAY

           A photoshoot is being set up on the beach just beyond Saint-
           Pierre’s incredible backyard. The infinity pool with ‘SP’ 
           painted. Orange trees. Fire pit. Cabana. 

           CREW MEMBERS and ASSISTANTS race around setting up lights and 
           equipment. The design looks almost like...a wedding...

           INT. BALLROOM - SAINT-PIERRE'S MANSION - SAME

           Mia sits in a chair in the same massive ballroom where she 
           first emerged in the white dress. A full length mirror in 
           front of her as three STYLISTS -- ASHLEY, GABRIEL, and QUINN -
           - look at the job facing them in horror.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Alright, well -- you’ll be in this 
                        chair for a while, just so you 
                        know. We’re only doing one style 
                        but...we have a lot of work to do.

                                 GABRIEL
                        We’ll start with the wig, and then 
                        we can move onto the skin...and the 
                        lips...and eyes...

           He talks like he’s about to try and solve world hunger.

           Lucinda walks into the ballroom, aggressively speaking on the 
           phone while her assistant follows her with a cappuccino.

                                 LUCINDA
                        Tell him I’ll call him back, I’ll 
                        be in London after Dollhouse and 
                        then we go to Singapore before --

           She looks at Mia. Stops in her tracks. Hangs up the phone.

                                 LUCINDA (CONT’D)
                        What is this?

                                 MIA
                        I’m Mia --

                                 LUCINDA
                        No, no -- this is not the same girl 
                        Marceau sent me pictures of. What. 
                        The Fuck. Is this?

           She takes off her glasses, steps forward, examining her --
                                 LUCINDA (CONT’D)
                        You’re to be on the cover of Vogue. 
                        With Marceau de Saint-Pierre. Is 
                        this some kind of joke?

                                 MIA
                        He asked me to do it.

                                 LUCINDA
                        Then maybe he’s insane after all,  
                        because I can do fuck all with 
                        this. 

                                 MIA
                        He said he wanted me. Ask him.

           A heavy silence. Lucinda SIGHS.

                                 LUCINDA
                        Okay. Fuck it. But I don’t want her 
                        out of that chair for the next 
                        three hours and if she doesn’t come 
                        out looking like Marilyn fucking 
                        Monroe, I’m firing everybody.

           She leaves in a huff. Her assistant follows. The stylists and 
           Mia turn back to the mirror -- ready to get to work.

           LATER --

           Ashley adds some finishing touches to Mia’s face. WE ONLY SEE 
           HER FROM THE BACK, and what we see is a gorgeous, full head 
           of brown hair. Half-up half-down.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Alright. I think you’re just about 
                        ready. The dress is upstairs in the 
                        hallway bathroom.

                                 MIA
                        Thank you.

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Still following from the back, Mia walks into the bathroom 
           where the white dress hangs from the shower. She eyes it for 
           a moment, running her fingers across the cotton before 
           carefully undressing and slipping it on.

           She turns to the mirror and -- we finally see her.

           Her hair is a dark brown, thick with glued-in EXTENSIONS. Her 
           fake EYELASHES look lush and real. 
           She has sparkling BLACK EYESHADOW over her eyes, which are 
           now an electric BLUE from contacts. Her cracked LIPS are now 
           full and scarlet red. 

           She looks IDENTICAL to Adalene’s photograph. Her makeup 
           identical, hairstyle identical, and dress identical.

           She is entirely fake. But she is flawless.

           EXT. HALLWAY - LATER

           Mia exits the bathroom, carrying herself with a new sense of 
           confidence. As she walks down the hall, she notices -- a 
           DOOR. CRACKED OPEN. 

           Her curiosity getting the best of her, she carefully pushes 
           it open and walks in.

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           It’s Saint-Pierre’s bedroom. A gold chandelier above his red 
           satin sheets with the ‘SP’ logo imprinted on them. Movie 
           screen with a projector. An incredible room that looks like --

           THE EXACT SAME ROOM FROM THE OPENING.

           Down to the very last detail, from the closet to the vanity, 
           we recognize it as being an exact replica. Mia wanders 
           around, looks out the window and sees Saint-Pierre talking 
           with Lucinda on the beach, where an ALTAR has been set up. 

           She then notices something on the nightstand. A picture. She 
           carefully picks it up and her face drops when she sees --

           ADALENE, cuddled up to a stoic but joyful Saint-Pierre on 
           their wedding day. She’s in the exact same makeup, wearing 
           the exact same white dress. 

           The woman that has been haunting her is his wife.

           She turns the picture over and sees a note scribbled on the 
           back -- “TO MARCEAU - I LOOK FORWARD TO WATCHING YOU TAKE 
           OVER THE WORLD. FOREVER YOURS, ADALENE.”

           She stares at the picture again. Her HEAD is on his chest, 
           smiling, with her LEFT ARM DRAPED OVER HIS RIGHT SHOULDER. 
           They’re on the beach, an altar behind them. Just like...

           Mia rushes to the window. Sees the altar. The white set. The 
           flower decorations. To her horror, she realizes --

           IT’S THE SAME WEDDING.
                                 CLAUDE (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?

           Mia SCREAMS and JUMPS, dropping the picture. It SHATTERS.

           Claude rushes to pick up the glass. We can see in the urgency 
           with which he tries to salvage the frame that he is upset.

                                 CLAUDE (CONT’D)
                        You should not be in here. 

                                 MIA
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t know.

           She watches as Claude carefully picks up the picture --

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Why am I dressed like her?

           Surprised, Claude FREEZES for a moment -- then continues.

                                 CLAUDE
                        I do not choose the outfits.

                                 MIA
                        Where is she?

           Claude stands and looks her dead in the eyes. Emotionless.

                                 CLAUDE
                        Marceau is ready for you.

           EXT. BEACH - SAINT-PIERRE’S MANSION - SUNSET

           IN SLOW MOTION: Mia approaches Saint-Pierre, who’s standing 
           in the sand with a stoic but joyful look on his face. 
           Surrounded by white flowers, an altar behind him... 

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        You look incredible.

           She gives him a faint smile.

                                 LUCINDA
                        Stylists are heroes, I swear to 
                        God. Okay Mia, you’re going to be 
                        to his left. Head on his chest. 
                        Left arm draped across him. 

           Her heart stops. She doesn’t move. Lucinda comes closer with 
           her camera, FLASHING a few to get a feel of the angles.
                                 LUCINDA (CONT’D)
                        Mia, head on his chest.

           Unsettled, Mia gently puts her head on his chest...

                                 LUCINDA (CONT’D)
                        Put your arm across him.

           She puts her arm across but it hovers off of his suit. 

                                 LUCINDA (CONT’D)
                        Closer!

           Although not visible to Lucinda, we see Saint-Pierre 
           discretely GRAB the back of her neck and shove her face into 
           his chest. He grabs her arm and jerks it across him, closer. 
           He’s not fucking around.

                                 LUCINDA (CONT’D)
                        There you go! Now give me a look, 
                        Mia. Show me what you’re made of.

           Uncomfortable, she gives a model stare.

                                 LUCINDA (CONT’D)
                        Smile! This is fucking Vogue for 
                        God’s sake!

           Mia offers a faint smile. The CAMERAS flash. She’s getting 
           anxious. Overwhelmed. Saint-Pierre still holding her neck.

                                 LUCINDA (CONT’D)
                        Smile Mia! Come on, Smile!

           She looks around at the DOZENS of people watching, crew 
           members holding multi-colored light reflectors, stylists 
           gazing on, tailors at the ready, editors on laptops, 
           assistants, PAs, Vogue executives staring... 

           Her eyes dart back and forth, panic setting in --

                                 LUCINDA (CONT’D)
                        FUCKING SMILE!

           Terrified, Mia looks at the camera and -- SMILES.

           FLASH!

           FREEZE FRAME: Mia is wearing the exact same smile that 
           Adalene was. Her posture and look are identical. 

           It’s almost impossible to tell they’re different people.
           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mia walks in. It’s pitch black. She heads upstairs --

                                 ALIX (O.S.)
                        Mia.

           Mia JUMPS. Terrified.

                                 MIA
                        Jesus fucking Christ.

           She walks down a few steps, turns on the light. She’s still 
           in the white dress, her hair and makeup still perfect. 

           Alix and Josh are on the couch. Suitcases nearby.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        I thought you’d left.

                                 ALIX
                        Not yet.

                                 MIA
                        Thank God. I have to talk to you. 
                        Everything you said about Saint-
                        Pierre? I think it’s true. There’s 
                        this reference photograph he’s been 
                        using of this woman and --

                                 ALIX
                        Mia --

                                 MIA
                        -- he’s dressing me like her, my 
                        hair and makeup and in the same 
                        dress, like he wants me to be her, 
                        and it’s his fucking wife. I looked 
                        her up but I can’t find anything --

                                 ALIX
                        Mia.

           She notices their faces. Josh stares at her, fear in his 
           eyes. Alix looks like she’s been crying.

                                 MIA
                        What’s going on?

           Alix can’t find the words. Tears falling.

                                 JOSH
                        The kitchen.
                                 MIA
                        What?

                                 JOSH
                        Look in the kitchen.

           Confused, Mia goes to the kitchen, turns on the lights --

           AND SEES BLOOD SPLATTERED EVERYWHERE. Sprayed across the 
           white cabinets, dripping down the countertops, puddling all 
           over the floor.

           She watches, disturbed, as the blood leaks through the 
           crevices in the hardwood, slowly crawling towards her...

                                 ALIX
                             (tearfully)
                        What happened to you, Mia?

           Mia can’t take her eyes off the blood.

           EXT./INT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Officer Bailey and Holloway walk towards Mia’s door.

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        When did the call come in?

                                 OFFICER HOLLOWAY
                        Twenty-five minutes ago. Said she’d 
                        be home soon.

           They reach the door. Bailey knocks.

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        NYPD! Open up!

           The sound of something METAL hitting the floor inside. Bailey 
           knocks again, placing his hand on his gun -- when suddenly, 
           the door swings open.

           Mia stands there, still in her Vogue outfit. She’s eating 
           yogurt. Looks eerily calm, but surprised.

                                 MIA
                        Oh -- hello.

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        Hello, Mia. Is Alix home?

                                 MIA
                        Alix? Yeah, she’s in her room with 
                        her boyfriend. Is something wrong?
                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        May we come in?

                                 MIA
                        Of course.

           She steps aside as the officers enter. They take a look 
           around. It’s dark, but we notice that the kitchen is 
           SPOTLESS. No blood. They try a light switch. It doesn’t work.

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        Where’s her room?

                                 MIA
                        At the back. Over there.

           Bailey looks to Holloway, nods towards the stairs. Holloway 
           climbs the stairs and Bailey heads back to Alix’s room.

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        Did you see your psychiatrist last 
                        night? Dr. Helen Woodard?

                                 MIA
                        Yeah, I did. Why?

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        What time did you leave?

           He knock on Alix’s door. Nothing. The door is cracked. He 
           pushes it open. There’s NOBODY INSIDE.

                                 MIA
                        I’m not sure. Nine-thirty maybe?

           Bailey hits the light switch. It doesn’t work.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. Power’s out.

                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        Was working fine in the hallway.

           Bailey takes out his flashlight, glances around the room.

                                 OFFICER BAILEY (CONT’D)
                        Thought you said she was here.

                                 MIA
                        I thought she was.

           Mia walks into the doorway. Holloway goes to the closet --
                                 OFFICER BAILEY
                        Dr. Woodard was found stabbed to 
                        death last night. There was a lot 
                        of DNA at the scene. And your 
                        friend Hannah was found in the 
                        trunk of her car, her tongue cut 
                        out and throat slit --

           Opens the closet door -- we notice that Mia has VANISHED --

                                 OFFICER BAILEY (CONT’D)
                        -- turns out that the DNA on both 
                        of them was a match. Same with 
                        Sophie and Drew -- 

           And then, ALIX AND JOSH’S DEAD BODIES TUMBLE OUT OF THE 
           CLOSET ON TOP OF HIM. Alix’s face has been SMASHED IN and 
           Josh has a KNIFE stuck in his stomach. He’s still alive, 
           barely, in excruciating pain, MOANING...

           Bailey falls, pushes the bodies off him, crawls backwards --

                                 OFFICER BAILEY (CONT’D)
                        Jesus fucking Christ --

           -- to where Mia now stands. She wraps a GARROT AROUND HIS 
           THROAT and PULLS as hard as she can --

           INT. BEDROOM - SAME

           Nervous and sweating, Holloway uses his flashlight to look 
           around. He opens a drawer and finds DOZENS of pill bottles -- 
           ALPRAZOLAM, CLONAZEPAM, LORAZEPAM.

           He heads back towards the bedroom and sees --

           The BLOOD on the corner of the nightstand. Bends down, sees a 
           pool of dried blood leaking under the bed. Carefully, he 
           lifts the comforter and sees --

           CARA’S DEAD, GASHED FACE STARING BACK AT HIM.

                                 OFFICER HOLLOWAY
                        Fuck. Jesus fucking --

           He takes a deep breath, reaches under, grabs a fistful of her 
           hair and PULLS HER BODY OUT.

           Her shirt is soaked in blood. As he goes to grab her legs, he 
           catches a glimpse of -- MELANIE’s DEAD BODY, TWISTED IN AN 
           UNFATHOMABLE POSITION, HER NECK AND BACK BROKEN.
                                 OFFICER HOLLOWAY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck me.
                             (yelling)
                        TOM! I’VE GOT TWO BODIES UP HERE --

           BAM!

           He’s struck in the face with an UMBRELLA, sending him 
           sprawling backwards. He reaches for his gun but Mia THRUSTS 
           the umbrella into his HEART, then STOMPS on the handle three 
           times until it GOES THROUGH HIS ENTIRE BODY. Impaled.

           She stands over him. Still gorgeous. No remorse whatsoever.

           EXT. THEATRE - MORNING

           Dozens of NEWS TRUCKS and COP CARS block the street, barriers 
           and officers keeping the massive crowds back. There’s a line 
           of people waiting to get in, snaking around the block.

           VENDORS stand on sidewalks selling knock off Dollhouse 
           clothes already. CHURCH GROUPS stand on corners with signs 
           about how God hates fashion or some dumb shit like that.

           A NEWS REPORTER talks to a camera out front --

                                 NEWS REPORTER
                        ...all eyes are on Manhattan today 
                        as Marceau de Saint-Pierre prepares 
                        to unveil his comeback line 
                        Dollhouse to the world. In what is 
                        being called the fashion event of 
                        the decade, we’ve been told that 
                        hundreds have already been turned 
                        away at the door...

           Around him, we see several other news anchors for 
           INTERNATIONAL broadcasts doing the same. A worldwide event.

           SUPER: DAY OF SHOW.

           MIA steps out of her Uber and walks through all the madness. 
           She shows a cop her ID badge and gets through.

           She takes it all in for a moment. All of the excitement, the 
           crowds, the anticipation. She stares up at the marquee, which 
           reads -- MARCEAU de SAINT-PIERRE PRESENTS: DOLLHOUSE. 
           INT. MAKE-UP ROOM - THEATRE - DAY

           Mia stares in the mirror, her podcast playing. She looks at 
           her silk skin, perfect makeup, fake nails, fake hair. She 
           feels them -- making sure there is still a person underneath.

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        Once you conquer what you’re afraid 
                        of, it can no longer control you. 
                        You become the master of your own 
                        life and your own decisions. You 
                        can become...who you really are.

           The Podcast ends. Mia takes out her AirPods as Claude enters.

                                 CLAUDE
                        Marceau would like to speak to you. 
                        He’s waiting in your dressing room.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER

           Mia walks into a private room with white satin couches and a 
           glass coffee table. A dozen roses in a vase, a bottle of 
           whiskey. A vanity in the corner.

           On the floor is a WHITE TARP. ‘DOLLHOUSE’ written across it 
           in black, just like the billboard.

           All that’s missing is the blood.

           Saint-Pierre is standing on the far side of the room, 
           inspecting her outfits that have been hung up. The black 
           dress and gold mask. The hospital gown. The white dress.

           Claude locks the door behind them. Mia looks terrified. 

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        I’ve decided we won’t need the 
                        hospital gown. You’ll open in the 
                        black dress and close in the white.

           He turns to her. Smiles. Sits on the couch. She doesn’t move. 
           He pours himself a glass of whiskey.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        I must confess...five years working 
                        on this and it still doesn’t feel 
                        real.

           He takes a drink. Mia notices Claude looming behind her.

                                 MIA
                        What happened to Adalene?
           Saint-Pierre stares daggers at her, like the mere mention of 
           her name wakes up something vicious inside of him.

                                 MIA (CONT’D)
                        Why are you dressing me like her?

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Why do you think I chose you? You 
                        didn’t think I actually thought you 
                        were something special, did you? I 
                        chose you because you looked like 
                        her. You’re a nobody.

           Mia fights back tears, stands tall --

                                 MIA
                        What happened to her?

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        The same thing that’s about to 
                        happen to you. She died.

           Mia’s face twists in horror. Her breathing gets rapid. Saint-
           Pierre starts to pace around the room, sipping his whiskey.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        I met her when I was twenty-four, 
                        working as a shoe salesman in Paris 
                        trying to get my own designs off 
                        the ground. We fell in love quicker 
                        than either of us realized. She was 
                        my model, my assistant, my toughest 
                        critic -- she was everything.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           A small, cramped apartment outside Paris. Saint-Pierre sits 
           on a dingy couch, nervously tapping his foot.

           Suddenly, Adalene emerges in the WHITE DRESS. Spins. She’s 
           smiling, elated. He is mesmerized by her. 

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (V.O.)
                        Shortly after, we were married.

           EXT. BEACH - LAKE COMO - SUNSET

           Saint-Pierre kisses Adalene at the altar as hundreds of 
           wedding guests cheer. We recognize CLAUDE in the front. They 
           turn to the crowd, she leans into him, smiling --

           And the PHOTOGRAPH we saw on his nightstand is taken.
                                 SAINT-PIERRE (V.O.)
                        But before we knew it, I became an 
                        overnight sensation. I went from 
                        being a shoe salesman to being the 
                        savior of fashion in a year.

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           -- Saint-Pierre at a KOREAN MAGAZINE COVER SHOOT, flanked by 
           two Korean models in his dresses. He wears a devilish grin.

           -- On stage at the BEVERLY HILTON, Saint-Pierre accepts a 
           ‘DESIGNER OF THE YEAR’ award. The screen behind him says, 
           “WINNER - SAINT-PIERRE - THIRD YEAR IN A ROW.”

           -- Saint-Pierre presenting a dress to the QUEEN OF ENGLAND at 
           BUCKINGHAM PALACE, Claude by his side. A smile on his face.

           -- At the Met Gala, Saint-Pierre stepping out of a limousine 
           in a purple suit. Claude by his side. Hundreds of cameras 
           FLASH as he strides along the carpet. They scream his name.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (V.O.)
                        Fashion is a cutthroat business. I 
                        tried to keep Adalene away from the 
                        ugliness. But she didn’t see it 
                        that way. And it seeped in anyways.

           INT. MANSION - LAKE COMO, ITALY - NIGHT

           Adalene sitting at a massive dinner table by herself. Dozens 
           of SERVANTS move around, preparing her meal, all dressed in 
           black and white outfits with ‘SP’ logos on the sleeves.

           Sadness fills her as she looks across the table at nobody.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (V.O.)
                        She begged me to be home more. 
                        Wanted us to start building the 
                        family we never had. But I had 
                        become a God. I was the most 
                        successful designer in the world 
                        and all it did was make me want 
                        more.

           INT. MANSION - LAKE COMO, ITALY - NIGHT

           Adalene and Saint-Pierre are dressed in black, wearing 
           masquerade masks. We recognize Adalene’s as the black dress 
           and gold mask Mia is wearing in the show.

           They’re in the kitchen, arguing. It’s getting ugly.
                                 SAINT-PIERRE (V.O.)
                        Five years ago, we went to a 
                        masquerade party. We had both been 
                        drinking. We got into an argument 
                        about my work, my drug abuse, 
                        infidelities. She wanted me to take 
                        a break. But I couldn’t.

           Suddenly, Adalene says something that sends him into a RAGE. 
           He GRABS her throat and THROWS her through the GLASS DOOR 
           leading to the backyard. She SLAMS her head on the pavement.

           He stares at her as she sits up, tears streaming, BLOOD on 
           her mouth and neck and gold mask -- 

           Looking just like Mia looked in the outfit.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        She was pregnant. I didn’t know. 
                        She’d wanted me to be home because 
                        we were starting a family. But I 
                        couldn’t leave what I had built. 
                        She gave me an ultimatum. Leave 
                        fashion, or she’d leave me.
                             (then)
                        I went to Milan for a show the next 
                        day.

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Adalene sits in a hospital gown as a doctor stands over her, 
           his face ominous. Explaining something. Suddenly, she bursts 
           into tears. Her black eye shadow RUNNING...

           Looking exactly like Mia’s hospital gown dress and makeup.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (V.O.)
                        We lost the child. And I lost her.

           EXT. MANSION - LAKE COMO, ITALY - NIGHT

           A REDHEADED SERVANT steps out onto the back porch, lighting a 
           cigarette. She looks just like CARA in her stylized ‘DH’ 
           servant outfit. As she exhales smoke, she sees...

           A BODY. FLOATING IN THE WATER.

           She walks closer...her eyes growing WIDE WITH HORROR...
           INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

           The ambulance races through the night as a team of NURSES 
           perform CPR, water SPUTTERING out of her mouth. Desperately 
           trying to restart her heart and clear her lungs.

           The nurses look like SOPHIE in her stylized NURSE’s OUTFIT.

           INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

           A priest stands over Adalene’s naked body on a cold steel 
           slab. He gives her last rites. 

           The outfit looking like MELANIE’s STYLIZED PRIESTESS OUTFIT. 

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - THEATRE - PRESENT

           Mia stares at Saint-Pierre in horror.

                                 MIA
                        So this was all some...twisted 
                        fantasy? 

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Fashion gave me everything I 
                        thought I wanted -- but it took 
                        away everything that mattered. 
                        Dollhouse is my farewell to 
                        fashion, to life. My last show, and 
                        a love letter to what I lost.

                                 MIA
                        You’re a psychopath.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        And what about you? I could smell 
                        your desperation the night I met 
                        you. You’d do anything to become 
                        who you want to be, just like I 
                        did. Think of what your shallow 
                        dreams have made you do. You killed 
                        everybody that stood in your way, 
                        and for what? To be someone? You 
                        could’ve walked away from me at any 
                        point. But you didn’t.

           A tear starts to roll down Mia’s cheek. What has she done?

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        We are both monsters. And tonight, 
                        we will pay for what we’ve done.
           INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

           The theatre is packed, buzzing with excitement. Reporters sit 
           up front while hundreds of spectators crowd the aisles.

           The VIDEO SCREEN LIGHTS UP -- DOLLHOUSE.

           The crowd cheers, the anticipation building, cameras FLASH --

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER

           Mia is now in the black dress and gold mask, fake blood on 
           her mouth and neck. She stares at herself in the mirror.

           Saint-Pierre watches from the couch, drinking another whiskey 
           -- he’s getting increasingly drunk.

           A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. Claude opens it, then shuts it.

                                 CLAUDE
                        The show is about to begin.

           Saint-Pierre nods. Stands, approaches Mia.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Claude will escort you to the 
                        stage. After you walk, you will 
                        come back here. And we will prepare 
                        for the finale.

           He smiles at her. Claude comes, grabs her arm. She seems 
           resigned to her fate as she walks away --

                                 SAINT-PIERRE (CONT’D)
                        And think of it this way. You’ll be 
                        more famous now than you could’ve 
                        ever imagined.

           She looks back at him, then continues to the stage --

           INT. STAGE - THEATRE

           Mia stands on the wing, shrouded in darkness as Claude hovers 
           over her. A Production Coordinator at her side. MODELS in 
           various outfits lined up behind her. She takes a deep breath.

           The stage is macabre and horrifying, but beautiful. Bright 
           white with black and red blood splotches. 

                                 PRODUCTION COORDINATOR
                        Ten seconds.
           EXIT MUSIC (FOR A FILM) by RADIOHEAD starts to play and the 
           ENTIRE THEATRE GOES PITCH BLACK. The crowd CHEERS...

                                 PRODUCTION COORDINATOR (CONT’D)
                        Five...four...three...

                                 RADIOHEAD
                        Wake from your sleep / The drying 
                        of your tears / Today, we escape...

           Suddenly, the LIGHTS BLAST ON and Mia walks on stage.

           All eyes are on her as she walks, a knew sense of confidence 
           overtakes her. Like she belongs here and she knows it. Like 
           everything else has just faded away.

           A smile creeps across her face as she strut the runway. When 
           she reaches the end, about to hit her turn, she sees --

           DREW. SOPHIE. HANNAH. DR. WOODARD. CARA. MELANIE. OFFICER 
           HOLLOWAY. OFFICER BAILEY. All in the front row.

           She pauses for a moment, glances back at them -- and they’re 
           gone. Random people in their place. As she walks back to the 
           stage, a model wearing the HOSPITAL GOWN passes her --

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER

           Mia returns to the room, Claude guiding her, and finds Saint-
           Pierre sitting in front of the vanity. The whiskey bottle 
           empty. He looks drunk, upset, and all around fucked up.

           He offers a bleak smile.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Fun, isn’t it? Room full of people 
                        paying attention to nothing but 
                        you. There’s nothing else like it.

           He stands, holds the vanity to keep himself upright. Mia 
           watches, horrified, the high from the show coming down --

                                 MIA
                        What are you going to do to me?

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Put on the dress. We have fifteen 
                        minutes.

           LATER --

           Saint-Pierre is collapsed against the wall, his head heavy as 
           he scrawls what appears to be a suicide note. 
           Mia sits in front of the vanity in the white dress. She 
           finishes straightening her hair with a flat iron and sets it 
           aside. She applies the red lipstick and black eye shadow and 
           gives herself one last stare in the mirror.

                                 MIA
                        I’m ready.

           Saint-Pierre stands. Hands his note to Claude.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        Lay down on the tarp.

                                 MIA
                        Tell me what you’re going to do to 
                        me first. I at least deserve that.

           Saint-Pierre walks over to her. Brushes her hair back. Smiles 
           at her, like he’s seeing his wife again.

           His eyes turn into a RAGE as he clutches her throat and 
           THROWS her down on the tarp. She looks up to see Claude 
           unsheathe a DAGGER from his suit.

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        I am going to kill you. Then, I 
                        will take you down the runway to 
                        present my final contribution to 
                        this glamorized, fucked up world, 
                        where I will kill myself. The only 
                        way I can escape this hell. And 
                        Claude will hang this tarp from the 
                        rafters. So nobody will forget.

           Claude hands him the dagger. Mia’s eyes filled with terror.

                                 MIA
                        Do you think this is what she 
                        would’ve wanted?

           He walks closer, manic, holding the knife out --

                                 SAINT-PIERRE
                        We’ll never know, will we?

           He wipes tears from his bloodshot eyes and leans down, the 
           blade inching towards her throat as --

           She suddenly THRUSTS THE CRYSTAL AND GOLD ‘SP’ LAPEN PIN IN 
           HIS THROAT. She DRAGS it across his neck, blood EXPLODING 
           onto her face and the tarp around her.

           Mia shoves his body off of her and grabs the knife from his 
           hand. She PLUNGES it into his heart, and RIPS IT BACK OUT --
           But CLAUDE comes from behind and GRABS HER. She wrestles free 
           but drops the knife. Claude picks it up as she backs up to 
           the vanity, cornered in, blood dripping down her neck...

                                 CLAUDE
                        You have no idea what you’ve done.

           He RUSHES towards her -- she DODGES him, throws the chair in 
           his way and then grabs the still-on FLAT IRON and HITS HIM 
           ACROSS the FACE. His flesh burns as he falls to the ground.

           She yanks the flat iron chord from the wall and climbs on top 
           of him, HITTING him across the face twice more. He JAMS the 
           knife into her shoulder. 

           She lets out a HORRIFYING SCREAM before SHOVING THE FLAT IRON 
           INTO HIS MOUTH. His eyes are panicked as his mouth and cheeks 
           literally MELT. Mia uses all her strength to push the iron AS 
           FAR DOWN HIS THROAT AS SHE CAN --

           His eyes start rolling into the back of his head. He reaches 
           for the flat iron, dropping the knife -- she grabs it and 
           THRUSTS IT IN HIS STOMACH. He stops moving. His face 
           literally melting off his bones. A horrifying sight.

           Mia stands, exhausted. She looks around the room -- Claude’s 
           melted face, Saint-Pierre’s slit throat, the Dollhouse tarp 
           covered in blood. The deep wound in her shoulder leaks blood.

           She picks up the bloody LAPEL PIN from next to Saint-Pierre’s 
           dead body. Affixes it to her dress.

           She walks back over to the vanity. As she takes a paper towel 
           and starts to wipe the blood away, her makeup starts coming 
           off, exposing the cracks in her skin underneath. She looks at 
           her hands -- her fake nails have been pulled off.

           She stares at herself in the mirror again. Feels her hair -- 
           her fake hair. She tugs at the extensions, some of them 
           coming off in her fist. She lets them fall to the floor.

           And suddenly, the plastic, doll-like version of herself 
           doesn’t hold the same glow it used to. She looks at her half-
           gorgeous, half-brutally-natural face. It looks like two 
           different versions of herself are fighting for dominance.

           She pulls her wig off and reaches for the crystal lapel pin.

           She is Mia. And that is all she will ever be.
           INT. STAGE - THEATRE - NIGHT

           Mia is shrouded in darkness on the wing of the stage again. 
           EXIT MUSIC (FOR A FILM) is playing. An ELATED MODEL who just 
           finished her walk looks at Mia in HORROR as she passes.

           We follow Mia from behind as she slowly walks onstage and 
           down the runway. Suddenly, the faces in the audience turn to 
           HORROR. Some stand, alarmed -- others SCREAM.

           She has wrapped herself in the white tarp.

                                 RADIOHEAD (O.S.)
                        We hope your rules and wisdom choke 
                        you...

           As we track her down the runway, we see BLOOD DROPLETS 
           falling -- REAL BLOOD mixing with the FAKE BLOOD SPLATTERS.

                                 RADIOHEAD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Now we are one / In everlasting 
                        peace...

           Mia reaches the end of the runway and we SWING AROUND to see -

           She’s stripped herself of her makeup, wig, fake nails -- it’s 
           just her now. The corpse-like, natural Mia with hollow eyes 
           and jutting cheek bones and missing hair and cracked lips and 
           no fingernails. A monstrous sight.

           She looks out at the frightened crowd. Her eyes get blurry as 
           she smiles. Finally, her true self -- Mia -- on stage, in 
           front of everybody, captivating an audience...

           She spreads her arms wide, unfurling the white, bloodied 
           DOLLHOUSE tarp behind her. She’s wearing a BLACK BRA and 
           UNDERWEAR, the exact same thing she wore in that casting 
           studio earlier almost a month before, when she first started 
           this maniacal journey. Blood drips over her underwear from...

           The word ‘BEAUTIFUL’ CARVED DEEP INTO HER STOMACH. She starts 
           hyperventilating, but still smiles victoriously as --

                                 RADIOHEAD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        We hope that you choke / That you 
                        choke...

           -- her eyes ROLL BACK INTO HER HEAD and SHE COLLAPSES.

                                 RADIOHEAD (CONT’D)
                        -- We hope that you choke / That 
                        you choke...

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
           EXT./INT. SAINT-PIERRE’S MANSION - DAY

           Three massive MOVING TRUCKS are parked in the driveway as 
           dozens of MOVERS carry items out of the house and throw them 
           in the back. We recognize some of them -- the VINYL RECORD 
           PLAYER, the PROJECTOR, old RACKS OF CLOTHES.

           A young police officer, OFFICER STARKS (20s), oversees the 
           operation as a MOVER approaches him with a SAINT-PIERRE 
           designer t-shirt in his hands.

                                 MOVER
                        Hey -- can I take this?

                                 OFFICER STARKS
                        No. Put it in the truck.

                                 MOVER
                        But you said he had no next of kin. 
                        Do you have any idea what I could 
                        sell this shit for?

                                 OFFICER STARKS
                        He had no next of kin so all of 
                        this belongs to the state now. Put 
                        it in the truck.

           Annoyed, the Mover heads to the truck, discretely tucking the 
           shirt into his waistband as Starks heads inside...

           INT. BASEMENT - SAINT-PIERRE’S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Starks steps down into the basement where FOUR MOVERS are 
           packing up the clothes and dismantling the mannequins. It 
           looks bare compared to the last time we saw it.

                                 MOVER #1
                        Why does he have so many goddamn 
                        mannequins? This place is a fuckin’ 
                        haunted house.

                                 MOVER #2
                        No wonder that girl killed him.

           Starks KNOCKS on the wall, announcing himself.

                                 OFFICER STARKS
                        Hurry up. The trucks are leaving in 
                        a half hour.

           The movers grumble as he heads upstairs --
           INT. BEDROOM - SAINT-PIERRE’S MANSION - DAY

           Boxes are scattered around the bedroom as Starks enters. The 
           chandelier gone, furniture moved, bed bare. He takes a look 
           in the closet -- all the clothes are gone.

           He wanders around the room for a moment, getting a sense of 
           how big it is. Then he notices something on the nightstand, 
           still sitting in the corner of the room...

           It’s a picture. He picks it up and sees Saint-Pierre with a 
           WOMAN, dark black eye shadow, red lips, her head on his 
           chest, left arm across him, smiling --

           We can’t tell if it’s Mia or Adalene.

           He turns the picture over. 

           There is no note on the back.

           He turns it over again, looks at it for another moment...

           And then tosses it in the box and leaves the room.

           We CLOSE IN on the picture, the two smiling people on the 
           beach, the world famous fashion designer and the woman who 
           brought him death and despair...

           We just can’t tell who she is.

                                 THE END
