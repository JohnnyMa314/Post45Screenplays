           “I'm Marion Morrison, and I never was and never will be a 
           film personality like John Wayne. I know him well. I have to. 
           I make a living out of him.”

           CU: Q & A with JOHN FORD: FIVE-TIME ACADEMY AWARD WINNING 
           DIRECTOR

                                 JOHN FORD (O.S.)
                        Darryl Zanuck sent me to make a 
                        puff piece, little R ‘n R.

           GRAINY PROJECTOR MONTAGE: WORLD WAR TWO, PACIFIC NAVY BASE 

           - SERVICE MEN SMILING

           - SWIMMING

           - SUNBATHING

                                 JOHN FORD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I had no interest in R ‘n R nor, as 
                        we found out, did the Japanese.

           We PAN up to the stage and the owner of the voice...

           JOHN FORD (60s), unapologetically dressed in stained khakis, 
           a wrinkled dress shirt, and a beaten blue Dodgers hat. He 
           peers at the inferior interviewer with his one functional 
           eye. A BLACK EYE PATCH hangs over the other, his iconic BLACK 
           THICK RIMMED GLASSES encasing both sockets.

           PETER BOGDANOVICH (25), a journalist, cinephile, and aspiring 
           artist, meets John Ford’s gaze and quickly retreats to his 
           note cards. He is attempting to conduct a retrospective in 
           front of an AUDIENCE of New York Intellectuals.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        You see, they sent me to Midway.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        But they told you to evacuate--
                                 JOHN FORD
                        --Two days prior. I asked if the 
                        boys were gonna be evacuated. They 
                        said no. They were digging in for a 
                        fight. I said so am I.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BUNK - MIDWAY ISLAND - NIGHT - STYLIZED FLASHBACK

           BOOM...

           --Ford kicks out of his BUNK. He’s TWENTY YEARS YOUNGER and 
           in a CRISP NAVY UNIFORM. 

           He looks out his window as a JAPANESE ZERO FIGHTER roars 
           past. 

           He grabs his HANDHELD 16MM CAMERA and rushes out the door.

           EXT. NAVY BASE - MIDWAY ISLAND - NIGHT - STYLIZED FLASHBACK

           MAYHEM... 

           --SOLDIERS shoot into the night sky, silhouetted against FIRE 
           AND SMOKE.

           EXT. WATER TOWER - MIDWAY ISLAND - NIGHT - STYLIZED FLASHBACK

           Ford climbs up a massive WATER TOWER. He reaches the top and 
           begins to film. 

           A JAPANESE ZERO FIGHTER dives towards him. Ford plants his 
           feet and captures its approach.

           The Fighter releases its bombs...

           --The building next to Ford explodes and the shrapnel rips 
           into his arm and leg-- 

                                                             SMASH CUT:

           INT. MAIN HALL - MUSEUM OF MODERN ART - DAY

                                 JOHN FORD
                             (dangling his leg)
                        They gave me a souvenir.

           Peter is looking at the MASSIVE SCAR just below Ford’s knee.
                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                             (tracking his eyeline)
                        No, that scar is from They Were 
                        Expendable. Broke my kneecap. 
                        Bedridden for a month.

           Ford rolls down his socks further. Revealing the WAR WOUND.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        But the battle was the easy part. 
                        The army is no different than any 
                        studio, trying to take over any 
                        picture. I had to sneak the footage 
                        stateside in cigar boxes. Told my 
                        editor to hide out at his mother’s 
                        place, cut in secret.
                             (lighting a cigar)
                        I informed him it’s an act of 
                        treason for a non-enlisted man to 
                        handle top-secret material, 
                        punishable by death... So if anyone 
                        knocks on the door, your best bet 
                        is to tell’em to fuck off. 

           Everyone claps. Ford is directing his legend in real time. 

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Remarkable. Shall we pivot to your 
                        historical run of Oscar success--

                                 JOHN FORD
                        --Look here, I’m no artist. I’m 
                        simply an Irishman from the state 
                        of Maine who came out to Los 
                        Angeles to do stunts for his big 
                        brother. The only reason they let 
                        me direct was because I could yell 
                        real loud.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Ha! That’s one way to put it, Mr. 
                        Ford. You and John Wayne, in my 
                        view, are the signature authors of 
                        American Myth.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Duke is borderline illiterate.

           Peter is puzzled by that answer. He pivots and hits a BLACK 
           REMOTE. The wall behind them morphs...

           --into John Wayne as “Ethan Edwards” From The Searchers. 

           Ford anxiously fidgets when presented with his “creation.” 
                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        The Searchers. Your masterpiece.

           On cue, the crowd claps. 

                                 JOHN FORD
                             (oddly dismissive)
                        It’s a solid western.

           Peter clicks the BLACK REMOTE. 

           John Wayne appears this time holding his left arm, through a 
           doorway. The iconic ending of The Searchers.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        With John Wayne as your instrument, 
                        and the Western as your canvas, you 
                        defined the masculine archetype for 
                        the American public.

           Peter clicks the BLACK REMOTE again.

           John Wayne is replaced with a PAINTING of an ANCIENT ROMAN 
           MAN wrestling a BULL. 

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH (CONT’D)
                        Carl Jung argues we all have an 
                        inner bull.

           John Ford anxiously rubs his They Were Expendable SCAR. Peter 
           doesn’t notice. He’s too busy playing to his surroundings and 
           his own ego.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH (CONT’D)
                        Through your work with John Wayne, 
                        you illustrate how to conquer one’s 
                        passions--

                                 JOHN FORD
                             (angry and uncomfortable)
                        --I never worked with John Wayne. I 
                        worked with Marion Morrison.
                             (beat)
                        And we made some pictures, that 
                        made some money. 

           Peter is puzzled by this answer finally he hits the REMOTE 
           again. 

           The projection behind Ford changes to his iconic Monument 
           Valley vista -- “God’s unfinished construction site.”
           We PAN UP from Ford’s face to the striking beauty of the 
           desert plain. 

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           THE AMERICAN FRONTIER. wide open blue sky, barren but endless 
           with possibilities... 

           --RIP. The fantasy is shattered by a DRUNK MAN in a black 
           cape falling through a cheap PAINTED CANVAS.

           MARION MORRISON (30s) watches this with disdain. His imposing 
           frame is brutally hunched, the rugged masculinity we will 
           come to know as “John Wayne” is absent, replaced by the 
           innocence of a soulful man rudderless.

           Marion rubs his dirty fingers against his smooth face 
           attempting to camouflage his innate beauty. 

           The portly DIRECTOR and lanky PROPMAN discuss how to handle 
           this “crisis.”

                                 DIRECTOR
                        Can we fix it?

                                 PROPMAN
                        I mean, it can’t look worse. The 
                        kids won’t notice.

                                 DIRECTOR
                             (chuckling)
                        Might actually be an improvement. 

           TITLE: POVERTY ROW - LOS ANGELES - 1938

           Poverty is apt, these sets are built quickly and cheaply, 
           movies are shot in six days for under four thousand dollars.

           The sweatshop of cinema. 

           Marion rehearses his lines. No one else does.

           The DRUNK MAN sits down next to Marion. He places a BLACK HAT 
           on his head, and we realize he is not merely a drunk but THE 
           SHADOW... The Batman of his day.

                                 THE SHADOW
                        You can stare at your lines as much 
                        as you want Marion, they ain’t 
                        gonna change.

                                 MARION
                        I... like to be prepared.
           Marion’s voice is wobbly. Indecisive. 

                                 THE SHADOW
                        You’re lip syncing! 
                             (loudly belching)
                        You got a kid in particular you’re 
                        trying to impress or you just don’t 
                        want anyone under four feet to 
                        think small of you?

           The Shadow slaps his knee.

                                 MARION
                        I heard there might be a studio 
                        scout here.

                                 THE SHADOW
                        For you?!
                             (aggressively laughing)
                        Oh Marion, I’m just horsing around.

           The Shadow takes a long pull from his flask and wipes his 
           mouth with his BLACK CAPE

                                 THE SHADOW (CONT’D)
                        Only thing lower than a nickel 
                        cowboy is a comic strip hero. Have 
                        a drink.

           Marion shakes his head. 

                                 MARION
                        Just leave me be.

                                 PA (O.S.)
                        COWBOYS NOW!

           Marion stands up and walks towards a SALOON that thirty 
           minutes ago was a GANGSTER WAREHOUSE. We see no grace, no 
           fluidity. He’s oafish. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SET OF “RIDE HIM, COWBOY!” - POVERTY ROW - DAY

                                 DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        Don’t lean on anything, the paint 
                        ain't dry!

           The music starts to play, Marion stands on the cheap stage 
           and starts lip syncing while dancing like a clown.
                                 DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        Smile! Wider... WIDER!

                                 MARION 
                             (lip syncing)
                        A cowboy sang his song of fate as 
                        he wandered the desert wide.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MODEST HOUSE - LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Marion walks up to his house. The front lawn has not been 
           attended to in some time. 

           Through the thick turf of neglected grass we see a 
           PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN SIGN for Franklin Roosevelt with the 
           bold letters:

           “THE MAN WITH A HEART. THE PARTY WITH A SOUL. VOTE STRAIGHT 
           DEMOCRAT.” 

           INT. MODEST HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           MICHAEL MORRISON (10) dutifully waits for his father.

           Marion opens the door. Notices Michael and pulls two 
           imaginary guns.

                                 MARION
                        Hold it, Pilgrim.

           Michael beams back. Pulls his own imaginary pistols. They 
           have a shoot-out. Marion mimes getting hit. He slumps against 
           the wall. Michael runs over.

                                 MICHAEL
                        But you were meant to win.

           Marion smiles and takes off his PROP HAT and places it on 
           Michael’s small head. Dwarfing him.

                                 JOSEPHINE SAENZ (O.S.)
                        My father needs to talk to you.

           Marion looks up, sees JOSEPHINE SAENZ (20s), a Latin American 
           women, a former debutante, chipping away at herself one hard 
           drink at a time.
                                 MARION
                             (unsure)
                        I’m... not taking your father’s 
                        money.

                                 JOSEPHINE SAENZ
                        You said we would be in this house 
                        temporarily--

                                 MARION
                        --I’m not taking your father’s 
                        money.

                                 JOSEPHINE SAENZ
                        Then make some of your own.
                             (to Michael)
                        Go to your room. 

           Michael’s eyes pleads for his father to intervene but Marion 
           retreats to the kitchen.

           INT. KITCHEN - MODEST HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Marion opens the ICE BOX. Nothing to eat. Bottles of liquor 
           litter the sink. He picks them up. All empty. He looks up at 
           the ceiling.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ATTIC - MODEST HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Messy and cluttered. Marion digs through OLD BOXES, 
           searching. He throws out FADED USC JERSEY’S and FOOTBALL 
           PADS. 

           CRACK!

           He looks down at a broken framed poster. He stares at it.

           CU: The Big Trail. The Major Motion Picture Event of the 
           Decade. Directed by Peter Walsh and Introducing a New Star... 

           Marion wipes away the dust, revealing...

           --John Wayne!

           He looks at the picture of himself. So full of promise. Then 
           the light catches something deep in the box. He reaches down 
           and finds a TEQUILA BOTTLE.

           He uncorks it. Sniffs, takes a pull... Not bad. He pockets it 
           in a leather satchel and grabs a well-used fishing pole.
           Marion moves to the door but turns, starring down at the 
           poster... He walks back and buries it deeper than he found 
           it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MODEST HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Marion reaches for his front door.

                                 JOSEPHINE SAENZ (O.S.)
                        That was fast. Even for you.

           Marion opens the door. This enrages Josephine who walks into 
           frame.

                                 JOSEPHINE SAENZ (CONT’D)
                        It’s time you found a real 
                        profession. Instead of those B-
                        Movies that have us living like a 
                        pack of bums.

                                 MARION
                        I can get us back to studio movies--

                                 JOSEPHINE SAENZ
                        --You don’t think I know where you 
                        go every Friday? Waiting on the 
                        pier like some lost fool--

                                 MARION
                        --If I can just talk to him, he 
                        might put me up for a job.

                                 JOSEPHINE SAENZ
                        It’s pathetic.

           Stare down. Finally...

                                 MARION
                        I’ll catch us something nice for 
                        dinner.

           Marion walks out.

           EXT. MODEST HOUSE - LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Marion notices the FDR SIGN has fallen over. He picks it up 
           and firmly places it in the dirt and moves on.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. PIER - LONG BEACH - DAY

           The California sunlight drapes Marion’s massive frame as he 
           heads to the end. 

           He plants himself on a wooden bench and performs his weekly 
           ritual. A sip from the tequila while setting his fishing pole 
           and staring out into the horizon.

           The SUN blinds him. He tilts his head down and blinks back 
           into focus and looks up... still nothing and then he sees...

           --The USS ARANER heading straight for the PIER.

           THE USS ARANER is a 110-foot, two-masted yacht. Sixty Souls. 
           Piloted by self proclaimed but factually accurate genius 
           alcoholic.

           Marion knows the vessel, but more importantly he knows the 
           Captain. 

           At the last moment, The USS Araner executes a dramatic tack 
           and drops its ANCHOR.

           A SMALL BOAT nonchalantly detaches.

           A woman with wild red hair is being escorted by a BUTLER in a 
           TUXEDO. She is lean, she is strong, and she is acutely aware 
           of our gaze.

           She is KATHARINE HEPBURN, (30s).

           Marion walks down to the DOCK and extends his hand to her. 
           She ignores and athletically jumps onto the dock. 

                                 KATHARINE HEPBURN
                        Can you swim?

                                 MARION
                        Last time I tried.

                                 KATHARINE HEPBURN
                        Marvelous. It’s a miracle that 
                        vessel is afloat. Best of luck.

           And like that's she’s off to the next adventure. 

           Marion stares at the Butler. He stares back unimpressed.

                                 BUTLER
                        Is the Captain expecting you?

           Marion reaches into his pocket and pulls out his last buck.
                                 MARION
                        I’m an old friend.

           EXT. MAIN DECK - USS ARANER - MOMENTS LATER

           Marion steps off the small boat and onto the USS ARANER.

           Silhouettes splash against the water.

           He puts his hand in the ocean, pushes his hair back, and 
           stares at his reflection in the window.

           He takes a deep breath and climbs up the steps. This is the 
           moment he’s been waiting nearly a decade for...

           EXT. UPPER DECK - USS ARANER - MOMENTS LATER

           Marion enters a lavish party. 

           This is the STUDIO 54 of 1934.

           CU: Champagne spills out of glasses as the boat disembarks. 

           WARD BOND (30s), a broad-shouldered man with a LARGE MUSTACHE 
           and SLICKED BACK HAIR, takes a break from harassing an 
           ACTRESS and notices Marion.

                                 WARD BOND
                        DUKE!

           Marion is glad to see a familiar face. Ward barges over and 
           claps Marion on the back.

                                 WARD BOND (CONT’D)
                        You a stow-away?

                                 MARION
                        Coach invited me.

           This gets Ward’s attention. He’s not convinced.

                                 WARD BOND
                        Did he?

                                 MARION
                             (changing the subject)
                        You seem to be doing well.

                                 WARD BOND
                        By the grace of our Lord.

           They turn to a GIANT PORTRAIT of John Ford.
                                 WARD BOND (CONT’D)
                        He’s downstairs.

           Marion walks towards the stairs but is blocked by...

           --JAMES STEWART and HENRY FONDA engaging in a heated 
           intellectual debate. Marion attempts to sneak by without 
           being noticed.

                                 JAMES STEWART
                        Hitler isn't some errand boy you 
                        can slap across your knee and bend 
                        into shape. He’s dangerous.

                                 HENRY FONDA
                        And if he crosses the line we will 
                        be there to knock him back.

           They pause and turn in unison. They’ve met Marion before. 
           Just can’t remember his name.

                                 JAMES STEWART
                        Murphy... Morrison is it?
                        You performed at Ford’s sons 
                        birthday party a while back?

                                 MARION
                        People call me Duke.

                                 HENRY FONDA
                        Weigh in for us cowboy. You think 
                        Americans will answer when their 
                        country calls to arms?

           Marion contemplates this question. His military persona still 
           unformed.

                                 MARION
                        I... Yes... Well, a man ain’t much 
                        of a man if he doesn’t fight for 
                        his country. 

                                 JAMES STEWART
                        Fighting doesn’t make you a man--

                                 HENRY FONDA
                        --I’ll see you in Berlin, Duke!
                        We’ll toast to freedom while Jimmy 
                        here stays at home knitting with 
                        the girls.

           Henry Fonda claps Marion on the back. Time for you to go.

           Marion defers and heads below deck. 
           INT. CAPTAIN’S CABIN - USS ARANER - MOMENTS LATER

           Smoke. Snapping of cards. Ice dropping into liquor.

           The cabin has the charged energy of a locker room right 
           before a championship game.

           John Ford (40s) sits at a POKER TABLE. He is at the pinnacle 
           of his vigor and power. With two functioning eyes and a full 
           head of hair. He is surrounded by his disciples -- HARD MEN, 
           RODEO MEN and BIT ACTORS -- the “Ford Company.”

           These gruff, masculine men are in sharp contrast to their 
           captain. It’s as if Ford were trying to camouflage his poetic 
           disposition with sweat and muscle.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        --Film and the Western are twins 
                        born out a man’s stubborn need to 
                        prove something. The first moving 
                        picture in the United States was 
                        captured at a horse track in San 
                        Francisco 1878, Eadweard Muybridge 
                        had a bet that horses did indeed 
                        gallop with all four feet off the 
                        ground. Which he used film to 
                        prove!

           Everyone laughs. Marion enters through the back door.

           Ford takes a long draw from his cigar.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        A running horse remains one of the 
                        finest subjects for a movie camera.

           And then, like a cat to a canary Ford flicks his still 
           functioning right eye towards Marion. 

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                             (disdain)
                        Look, if it isn't John Wayne!

           Marion winces at the name that will immortalize him. 

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                             (turning to the table)
                        I told him he wasn’t ready to carry 
                        a major motion picture.
                             (to Marion)
                        But you didn’t listen and what 
                        ended up happening?

           Marion lowers his head in shame.
                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        THE BIGGEST FLOP OF THE DECADE!
                             (ashes his cigar)
                        Or am I misremembering the front 
                        page of Variety?

           YAKIMA CANUTT (40s), legendary stuntman and record-holding 
           rodeo champion, comes to Marion’s aid.

                                 YAKIMA 
                        Easy boss. The kid just wanted to 
                        say hello.

                                 JOHN FORD
                             (to Yakima)
                        He’s box office poison.

           Marion opens his mouth to speak...

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        I wouldn’t if I were you.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. UPPER DECK - USS ARANER - SUNSET

           Marion looks at the horizon as the USS Araner approaches a 
           DOCK. He is fighting back tears. 

                                 JOHN FORD (O.S.)
                        No one likes a pussy, Duke.

           Marion turns and tries to collect himself. Ford moves next to 
           him.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        I heard you insisted on John as 
                        your stage name.

                                 MARION
                        Walsh wanted Peter.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Peter Wayne is a horse shit name.
                        You made the right decision.

                                 MARION
                        It was for you, a gesture--

                        I got a new picture. Western, but 
                        not some milk for babies lips. No 
                        soundstages. No B-List cowboys.

                             (dangling)
                        You know of anyone?

                        --Looking for someone hungry.

                        Ward?

           Ford presses his hand on Marion shoulder. Squeezing tightly.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        No. He’s an instrument. A talented 
                        apparatus, but not someone you can 
                        draw myth from. Which is what I 
                        intend to do.

           Marion stares at Ford. Scared to think it, let alone ask...

                        And then he got in a little boat. I 
                        threw down a copy of the Stagecoach 
                        script and yelled “idiot!” And he 
                        looked up, and I said, “you’re the 
                        lead.”

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Incredible.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BACKSTAGE - MUSEUM OF MODERN ART - DAY

           Peter is on the phone while SYCOPHANTS chit-chat around him.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                             (into the phone)
                        --You’re not listening. Something 
                        happened on the set of The 
                        Searchers...

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH (CONT'D)
                        But Ford will only discuss his war 
                        service... and John Wayne’s hidden 
                        away at The Alamo. 
                             (quietly)
                        Well, he kinda has to -- I’ve 
                        already spent the publisher’s 
                        advance.

           John Ford hobbles into the room. He is a shell of what we 
           just saw on the USS Araner twenty two years ago. Peter slams 
           the phone down.

           Ford smells the desperation and is turned off by it. He heads 
           to the BAR to steady himself out.

           Peter anxiously walks over to Ford.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Ford thank you so much for--

                                 JOHN FORD
                        --Spit out whatever you’re 
                        struggling to swallow.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        I would, with your approval of 
                        course, endeavor to write a book 
                        about your seminal work. The 
                        Searchers.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        I shot my work on film, so it 
                        wouldn’t need to be read.

           Ford wants to be admired but won’t be seen desiring praise. 
           Peter understands this and plays along.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        I suppose I could focus on John 
                        Huston--

                                 JOHN FORD
                        --Maybe if your planning on a 
                        coloring book for slow children.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Capra? It’s a Wonderful Life is 
                        having a second life as “Christmas 
                        Movie”. 

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Who said it deserved a first?
                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        George Steven’s then.

           Steven’s name unbalances Ford. 

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH (CONT’D)
                             (dangling)
                        How he channeled his war service 
                        into his films... 

                                 JOHN FORD
                             (flustered)
                        You can do the book, but I’m not 
                        answering anymore of your pompous 
                        fuckin’ questions.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        I’ll need to interview Mr. Wayne of 
                        course.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Mr. John Wayne is currently 
                        shooting The Alamo.

           John Ford flashes a devious grin and chomps on his cigar.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        It’s a disaster.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        He’s in that kinda trouble?

                                 JOHN FORD
                        No. He just mortgaged his home and 
                        his sad excuse for an aquatic 
                        vessel because he finds the idea of 
                        being the world’s first destitute 
                        movie star utterly enthralling.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                             (egging him on)
                        He clearly bit of more than he 
                        could chew.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        You don’t know the half of it. The 
                        studio asked for a known director. 
                        They asked for me. Duke wouldn’t 
                        have it. The picture’s SELF 
                        FINANCED. Two harmless words. Made 
                        terrible combined. He decided he’d 
                        prefer to risk it all AND DIRECT 
                        HIMSELF!
                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Why? 

                                 JOHN FORD
                        You’d have to ask him.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        But he’s barred all press from set.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        You say you’re with John Ford and 
                        he’ll quack like a duck if you ask 
                        him.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                             (quickly)
                        Fantastic. I’ll leave tonight.

           John Ford tilts his head in surprise. Did this punk just play 
           him?

           He recovers, downs his drink, and drops his CIGAR on the 
           floor. Fuck this pretentious building and walks out.

           Peter looks down at the cigar and picks it up...

           --holding it like an artifact.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. PETER BOGDANOVICH’S APARTMENT - NYC - NIGHT

           Peter stands in the middle of his apartment holding Ford’s 
           cigar.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        And then he told me, Peter, only 
                        you can write this book.

           He’s surrounded by MOVIE MEMORABILIA. An excessively gigantic 
           CITIZEN KANE POSTER covers the entire wall behind him.

           His coffee table is littered with copies of Arts-Lettes-
           Spectles. A Parisian film criticism newsletter. The Cover is 
           splashed with the name FRANCOIS TRUFFAUT.

           His wife, POLLY PLATT (30s), heavily pregnant, pops her head 
           out from the kitchen. She is in love with Peter but starting 
           to question the feasibility of that decision.

                                 POLLY PLATT
                             (weary)
                        That’s nice.

                                 POLLY PLATT (CONT'D)
                        But can’t you write about somebody 
                        else? John Wayne is such a racist 
                        bloodthirsty conservative--.

           Peter aggressively packs.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH 
                             (snapping his suitcase)
                        --The man’s a patriot.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NEW YORK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Peter is running through the terminal. Late for his flight. 

                                 POLLY PLATT (V.O.)
                        Why don’t you just telephone him?

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH (V.O.)
                        Because I have a ticket to the man 
                        no one can speak with. 

                                 POLLY PLATT (V.O.)
                        A phone call is talking, Peter.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH (V.O.)
                        You don’t understand, rumor is John 
                        Wayne’s having a mental breakdown. 
                        Which means his guards down.

           INT. TWA AIRPLANE - NIGHT

           Peter is arguing over the French New Wave with a GENTLEMAN 
           seated next to him.

                                 POLLY PLATT (V.O.)
                        And that’s a good thing because...

           EXT. HIDALGO COUNTY - TEXAS - DAY

           Peter glides through a SMALL TEXAS TOWN in his rented 
           CADILLAC ELDORADO SEVILLE.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH (V.O.)
                        The Searchers! Ford hasn’t made a 
                        western since and Wayne hasn’t 
                        worked with him. There’s a story 
                        there. I can feel it. 
           INT. CADILLAC ELDORADO SEVILLE - DAY

           Peter sees a large ALAMO CATHEDRAL.

           He stops his car.

           KNOCK KNOCK

           A GRUFF MAN indicates he wants Peter to roll down his 
           window.... That’s the last thing Peter wants to do.

           The Gruff Man KNOCKS harder.

           Peter reluctantly lowers the window.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        I’m here to see John Wayne.

           The Gruff Man looks up and then starts frantically running 
           away from the car.

           Peter looks down at the tobacco in his pipe. It’s VIBRATING.

           And like clockwork FIFTY CATTLE come crashing past the car. 

           - Smashing Glass

           - Tearing off Mirrors

           - Ripping off the Bumper

           After the last COW has passed. The Gruff Man calmly walks 
           back to Peter.

                                 THE GRUFF MAN
                        I was trying to tell you. You 
                        parked in the middle of a live 
                        stunt.

           Peter pats himself down. He’s okay.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        You couldn't have yelled?

           Peter tries to get out of the driver side. But the door has 
           been twisted shut. 

           He attempts to crawl out of the passenger’s side gracefully 
           as the Gruff Man looks at him with puzzlement.

           TITLE: THE SET OF “THE ALAMO” 1960
           EXT. SET OF “THE ALAMO” - TEXAS - DAY

           Thousands of extras coming in and out of the WARDROBE TENTS, 
           like automobiles off an assembly line.

           This is a GIGANTIC PRODUCTION and in the center of it...

           --John Wayne (50s). Marion’s beauty is gone. In it’s place, a 
           face full of wrinkles and a barely camouflaged toupee.

           He is standing on a ladder. With a viewfinder in his eye. He 
           is trying to “find” the shot. 

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Here.

           A CAMERA OPERATOR takes a measuring tape. Logs the exact 
           height of the shot and drops a marker.

           John Wayne indecisively walks to the next shot.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Here.

           The same production. John Wayne moves to a place. Sets a 
           shot.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Here.

           Peter looks to John Wayne. Then at the crew.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                             (under his breath)
                        He’s lost.

           The crew linger around John Wayne, everyone has something 
           that can’t wait, and he's overwhelmed. 

           MICHAEL WAYNE (30s), now a chubby doppelganger of his father, 
           walks over. Followed by a CAMERA CREW.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        I don’t have time for a promo.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        Banks say they need it.

           John Wayne turns to face the camera crew and drops his voice 
           low. Slows it down. Controls his posture and stares steadily 
           into the camera lens. His strength penetrates us and our 
           worries disappear. This is the John Wayne immortalized. 
                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        This town here. This wonderful old 
                        mission. We got them pretty close 
                        to right. We took the measurements 
                        from old original plans. But the 
                        men that fought here.

           We hear chatter in the background. It bothers John Wayne, but 
           he keeps going. He tilts his hat low.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        How can you measure men? How can 
                        you measure courage and human 
                        dignity? A desire for freedom? 
                        You’ll have to decide when you see 
                        our version of history that 
                        Americans have been telling 
                        forever.

           The chatter grows louder.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Will whoever is talking up a storm. 
                        PLEASE BE QUIET FOR ONE DAMN 
                        MINUTE?!

           The chatter instantly stops. And John Wayne turns to see the 
           culprits. THREE NUNS. Dressed tip to top. Conversing by the

           John Wayne is mortified. 

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry sisters. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JOHN WAYNE’S QUARTERS - TEXAS - MOMENTS LATER

           John Wayne splashes water on his face from a dirty sink and 
           then lights a cigarette. He looks up and sees FOUR MEN who 
           are clamoring for his attention. He has at least fifty 
           decisions to make and not the strength for one.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Get out!

           All disappear except for Peter.

           John Wayne moves for a RIFLE, maybe its a prop, maybe it’s 
           not.
                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                             (pointing the rifle)
                        You don’t hear so good. So I’ll 
                        speak louder. This is Texas. I’ll 
                        split you in two and charge your 
                        family for the cleanup.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                             (hands raised)
                        John Ford sent me.

           Abra Kadabra. John Wayne lowers the rifle.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Well, that’s a name.

           Peter hesitantly walks in.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        I’m Peter Bogdanovich, I write for 
                        Esquire, I’d like to ask you some 
                        questions about The Searchers.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                             (nonchalantly)
                        Good picture. Well directed.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        John Ford has commissioned me to 
                        write a book about it’s production.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                             (flatly)
                        You’re lying.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Well... I mean--

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        --Ford doesn’t talk about The 
                        Searchers. Let alone invite 
                        strangers to dissect it. 

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Would you rather we pivoted from 
                        Ford’s Searchers to your Alamo?

           John Wayne sits down. Revealing how bone tired he is.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Tell me, do the press realize that 
                        I’m broke, or do they know that the 
                        pictures unfilmable?
                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        They presume both.

           John Wayne turns to his window, the sun setting.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Figures. See I’ve got damn near 
                        perfect light. Three Thousand Men 
                        at my beck and call. But the rain 
                        dashed my sets, and the Mexicans 
                        won’t work until I pay them money I 
                        ain’t got.

           John Wayne looks to the East.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Ford sent you to document my 
                        failure... Didn’t he?

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        This isn’t a hatchet job. I just 
                        want to talk about your partnership 
                        with Ford.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Well that’s simple. I did my best 
                        work with him and owe my career to 
                        em.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Everyone knows that. But no one 
                        knows what fractured your 
                        relationship.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        So you’re a gossip columnist?

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        No. I’m someone who believes that 
                        The Searchers is the greatest 
                        western ever made, and your 
                        greatest performance. But that’s 
                        not a story. Those are just facts.

           John Wayne turns to Peter. Sizes him up. 

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Whose your favorite director Mr. 
                        Bogdanovich?

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Orson Welles said the three 
                        greatest directors of all time are 
                        John Ford, John Ford and John Ford.

                        And I think he under rates him.

           John Wayne sadly shakes his head.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Then you won’t care for my answers.

           John Wayne moves for the door. Peter summons the courage to 
           block him.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        You and Ford created the ruler by 
                        which a man measures himself and if 
                        you broke each other, I wanna know 
                        why. 

           John Wayne dwarfs this punk kid. He looks down. Almost  
           admires his guts.

           Beat.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Everything I tell you, has to be 
                        approved by Ford before print.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Of course.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Alright, pilgrim. I’ll tell you 
                        about John Wayne’s “relationship” 
                        with John Ford. Except I didn’t 
                        become John Wayne on the set of The 
                        Searchers.

           John Wayne lights another cigarette.

                         It happened on Stagecoach.

           INT. FORD’S ESTATE - HOLLYWOOD - DAY - 1938

           TITLE: LOS ANGELES 1938

           John Ford, (40s, two working eyes) walks through his massive 
           home. HUNTING TROPHIES and TRIBAL ARTIFACTS line the walls. 

                                 JOHN FORD
                        My keys!
           He is yelling through a tight hallway. He finally arrives at 
           the end, and a door with a LOCK, like it belongs on the 
           outside of a home, not inside it. 

           He knocks loudly on the door. Finally it opens...

           --Revealing, MARY FORD (40s). She’s very Irish, as if from 
           another century. 

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Keys for the Royce. I’m late!

                                 MARY FORD
                             (thick accent)
                        You know the rules.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        I’m not going to smoke.

           She pats him down, feeling cigars.

                                 MARY FORD
                        You can’t smoke in the Royce.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Stop treating me like a child.

                                 MARY FORD
                        Then stop acting like one.

           He quickly snatches the keys and walks off. 

           We hang on Mary and through the background, we get a glimpse 
           of her world. It’s delicate. Full of flowers and bright 
           fabrics. PATRICK FORD (6) plays with a TOY CAR wearing a NAVY 
           SAILORS OUTFIT. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FORD’S ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ford passes a BATTERED GREEN FORD ROADSTER and opens the 
           PRISTINE PHANTOM II ROLLS ROYCE CAR DOOR with a cigar in his 
           mouth.

           Mary Ford pops her head out. 

                                 MARY FORD
                        I dare you to get into that car.

           She is Wendy and he is her Lost Boy.
           EXT. GUARD STATION - RKO STUDIO LOT -  DAY

           A GUARD picks his teeth and then spits it out his mouth as...

           --John Ford pulls up in his BATTERED ROADSTER, smoking like a 
           chimney. The car is packed with garbage.

           Ford impatiently waits for the GUARD to raise the gate. But 
           in his rumpled jacket, messy hair and hoarder-packed 
           automobile, he does not resemble a prominent studio director.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        I am late.
                             (beat)
                        And I am John Ford. 

                                 GUARD
                        Ahh...I... Do you have any 
                        identification sir? Need to make 
                        sure you are John Ford.

           Ford turns the car off. Which makes quite the musical 
           production.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Turning the car off means you’re in 
                        trouble. Opening the door means 
                        you’re in danger, letting me get 
                        out of the car... would be a form 
                        of suicide.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RKO STUDIO LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Ford speeds through the bungalows, finally spinning his car 
           into RKO PRESIDENT OF PRODUCTION: DAVID O SELZNICK’s marked 
           spot.

           A STUDIO GUARD anxiously runs over. Ford throws the car keys 
           at him.

                                 STUDIO GUARD
                        You can’t park here

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Then move it.
                             (dead serious)
                        Not a scratch.

           The Studio Guard is left puzzled, staring at the battered 
           automobile. 
           INT. THEATRE - RFO STUDIO LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           ON SCREEN: Grainy BLACK AND WHITE FOOTAGE of Marion, 
           shirtless, muscular and sweaty.

           We pull back. Ford and legendary producer DAVID O SELZNICK 
           (40s) sit in plush leather seats watching Marion’s screen 
           test. Kingmaker seats.

                                 DAVID O SELZNICK
                        Look, I want Stagecoach at RKO, but 
                        this kid. He’s got one major studio 
                        credit and it’s the biggest box 
                        office flop of the last ten years.

           Ford stares up, as Marion’s beautiful body SPLASHES OVER his 
           face. As if he where caressing his chest.

                                 JOHN FORD
                             (enthralled)
                        I first saw Duke herding geese on 
                        the set of Mother Machree. He was 
                        merely a prop assistant. But I 
                        couldn’t take my eyes off him.

           Marion is lifting weights. Muscles glistening.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        What I saw was a canvas, on which I 
                        could craft a true American. With 
                        none of the softness of Fonda or 
                        Stewart.

                                 DAVID O SELZNICK
                        But Fonda and Stewart are stars! In 
                        no small part, thanks to you--

                                 JOHN FORD
                        --We think the public wants to be 
                        inspired by intellect.

                        Americans want to be inspired by 
                        strength.

                                 DAVID O SELZNICK
                        Then why exile the kid to Poverty 
                        Row?

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Because he didn't trust me! So I 
                        had to make defying me the worst 
                        decision of his life.

           Awkward beat.
                                 DAVID O SELZNICK
                        What about Gary Cooper? He’s avail, 
                        a big draw and loves the script.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Gary Cooper is a faggot.

           Selznick peers over. How badly does he want a Ford picture?

                                                                CUT TO:

           Mary looks out the window and sees Ford driving down the 
           driveway like a madman.

           Ford gets out of the car, smoking... naturally.

           Mary is waiting for him.

                                 MARY FORD
                        How’d it go?

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Man’s a damn fool. Won’t let me 
                        cast Duke.

                                 MARY FORD
                        So who are you going to cast?

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Duke.
                             (beat)
                        I’ll get the money somewhere else.

           Ford storms to his front door. Mary blocks him.

                                 MARY FORD
                        You have a guest. And she brought a 
                        guest...

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Ahh yes, I’m considering her for a 
                        part--

                                 MARY FORD
                        --Don’t think me a fool. BUT be 
                        careful. It’s not her I’m concerned 
                        people finding out about. 
           Mary straightens Ford’s collar.

                                 MARY FORD (CONT’D)
                        We are safe if we are hidden.

           Ford kisses her on the cheek and walks into his home.

           INT. PARLOR - FORD’S ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ford opens the door, and we see Katharine Hepburn, making a 
           drink at the bar. 

           And on the couch, a HANDSOME YOUNG ACTOR who looks nervous.

           Ford closes the door behind him and locks it. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. AUTOMOBILE - HIGHWAY - MORNING

           An automobile turns off a PAVED HIGHWAY, onto a OPEN DESERT. 

           INT. AUTOMOBILE - DESERT - MORNING

           Marion sits in a car packed with FORD’S STOCK COMPANY. They 
           are passing around a FLASK. Heading deeper into the desert. 

           Ward Bond hands it to Marion.

                                 WARD BOND
                        I’d have a hit if I were you. Once 
                        we get onto set, strictly no 
                        drinking.

                                 MARION
                             (smiling)
                        Is that a fact?

                                 YAKIMA
                             (deadly serious)
                        It’s no laughing matter. It’s best 
                        for you to realize the rules, and 
                        fast. Pappi don’t take no breakage.

                                 WARD BOND
                        No drinking. No cursing. Pappi 
                        employs a bugler to play reveille 
                        at dawn and taps at night.
                                 YAKIMA
                        And every night by the campfire 
                        their is a performance.

                                 MARION
                        It sounds like camp.

                                 WARD BOND
                        Now you’re getting it. But I 
                        wouldn’t bank on finishing the 
                        production. Ford chews ‘n spits out 
                        Academy Award winners, can’t wait 
                        to see what he does with a singing 
                        cowboy.

           And then Marion sees it... 

           MONUMENT VALLEY. 

           It feels like coming home to a place you never knew existed.

           NOTE: Monument Valley is one of America’s most remote 
           locales. Ninety miles from the nearest paved road and reputed 
           to be the farthest point in the continental United States 
           from a railroad line. Why did Ford bother? Because its mesas 
           soar through the vacant sky like cathedrals to God himself.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (V.O.)
                        Marion Morrison went to Monument 
                        Valley.
                             (beat)
                        John Wayne came back.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH (V.O.)
                        But you already had the name.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (V.O.)
                        A man can be given any name. What 
                        makes it real is when you say it 
                        out loud, they don’t laugh.

           EXT. BARBARA’S LODGE - MONUMENT VALLEY - MORNING

           A simple Spanish style brick two-story building surrounded by 
           dozens upon dozens of tents.

           The automobile pulls up into the hornet’s nest of a live 
           production.
           INT. AUTOMOBILE - MONUMENT VALLEY - MORNING

           Marion looks to the East. Hundreds of NAVAJO INDIANS come 
           down from the ridge like a human train.

                                 YAKIMA
                        They always show up for Ford.

                                 WARD BOND
                        ‘Cause he pays them drunk savages 
                        more than they deserve.

           Ward Bond gets out of the car. Yakima doesn’t -- he just 
           stares at the tribe passing.

                                 YAKIMA
                             (respectfully)
                        They show up ‘cause when he says 
                        he’ll pay them an honest wage for 
                        an honest day’s work, he delivers.

           Yakima exits the car and saunters past. His is a slow walk, 
           forged by a lifetime of hard deeds and rough action. 

           Marion studies him like a Con Man examining a mark.

           Finally, Marion takes a deep breath and pops opens the car 
           door.

           TITLE: SET OF “STAGECOACH” - 1938

           INT. PORCH - BARBARA’S LODGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Coffee in hand, Ford looks over his vista, his crew, his 
           motion picture.

           The acting troupe walks towards him.

           He is chewing on his HANDKERCHIEF.

           Ford zeroes in on Marion and puts it in his pocket.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        If you plan on skipping about like 
                        a prancing fairy, then you best 
                        turn right around and get back in 
                        that automobile.

           Marion freezes.

                                 MARION
                        I... umm, I--
                                 JOHN FORD
                        --SPIT IT OUT

                                 MARION
                        W- we aren’t filming.

           A devilish grin creeps along Ford’s face. Ward Bond shakes 
           his head -- this’ll be good.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Everyone! Everyone! Stop what 
                        you’re doing.

           The Production machine SCREECHES to a halt...

           --Everyone in earshot immediately looks to Ford. 

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Duke. Why don’t you tell everyone 
                        what you just told me?

           Marion is a deer in the headlights.

                                 MARION
                        Well... I was just saying--

                                 JOHN FORD
                        --If you don’t form a complete 
                        sentence I’ll put you right back in 
                        the wet shit I sprung ya from.

                                 MARION
                        I said that we aren’t... filming.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        That right there! That’s the issue.

           Ford turns to Ward Bond.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        When you step foot on my set. You 
                        step foot--

           He knows the answer.

                                 WARD BOND
                        --Prepared.

           Awkward beat. Ford waits, allowing the eyes of the group to 
           really dig into Marion.
                                 JOHN FORD
                        Stars do not simply walk in front 
                        of a camera and speak a written 
                        line. Their life. Every moment. Is 
                        a performance. They lead by 
                        example. WHETHER THEY ARE FILMING 
                        OR NOT.

           Ford walks up to Marion and AGGRESSIVELY SLAPS him across the 
           face. Marion shakes his head in shock, but collects himself.

           This violent outburst is met with blank stares by the crew.

           Marion tastes the blood from his lip.

                                 MARION
                             (quietly)
                        Yes, Coach.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Then lead.

                                 MARION
                             (louder)
                        Yes, Coach.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Then walk.

           Marion hesitates. Ford takes out a knife and cuts two lines 
           twenty paces apart in the dirt.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        I said walk!

           Marion tries again.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Wrong. Again.

           Marion moves towards Ford... crawling upright.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Are you a shit sniffer?

                                 MARION
                        Wh... I--

                                 JOHN FORD
                        --THEN STOP STRUTTING AROUND LIKE 
                        YOUR LOOKING FOR A COWBOY TO STRAP 
                        YOU DOWN AND FUCK YA LOOSE!
           Marion turns. Everyone is watching. He can feel the eyes on 
           him. He tries again.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ. I’m asking you to 
                        walk, not dance!

           The crowd is getting annoyed. GRUMBLING. It’s hot and their 
           work isn’t gonna get done by anyone else.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        People pay a day’s hard wage to sit 
                        in a dark room. They need to be 
                        given a hard day’s work. They need 
                        to be taken.
                             (kicking the dirt)
                        AND YOU’RE NOT TAKING ANYONE 
                        ANYWHERE WALKING LIKE THAT.

           Marion keeps trying. Darting his eyes frantically, as if they 
           where trying to escape his own body.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Again.

                                                              TIME JUMP

           The SUN is starting to set. Everyone is exhausted.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        There will be no supper or 
                        performance this evening. Not until 
                        Mr. John Wayne here learns to walk 
                        like a god damn man.

           Marion keeps walking. He’s sweat through his clothes.

                                 YAKIMA
                        Boss, don’t you think that’s 
                        enough?

           Ford will cut down any man except Yakima, because everyone 
           else is merely playing a cowboy. Yakima is one.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Do you want me to go easy on you 
                        Duke? 
                             (leaning in)
                        Everyone else can work but you 
                        can’t?

           Marion rubs his brow with his bandana. Gives Ford a hard 
           stare and walks like John Fucking Wayne, which we realize is 
           Yakima’s saunter, choreographed by Ford’s self-loathing.
           --And on cue. Taps starts playing from a LONE BUGLE.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Suppose that’ll do for today boys.

           Like a platoon, they disembark. Towards their bunks, tents 
           and hard floors, knowing tomorrow the real work begins.

           Ford leads them, with a walk that is... delicate.

           Yakima passes Marion.

                                 YAKIMA
                        Welcome to a John Ford picture Mr. 
                        Wayne.

                                                             SMASH CUT:

           INT. SET OF “THE ALAMO” - SUNSET - 1960

           John Wayne stares out of the window with a deep weariness on 
           his wrinkled face. 

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        So he tormented you?

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                             (confused by the question)
                        No. He made me John Wayne.

           Michael Wayne stands at the door. It looks urgent but he 
           doesn't want to talk in front of a journalist.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        I can leave--

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        --He’s Ford’s man.

           Michael reluctantly walks into the room -- he has all the 
           physical characteristics of his father but none of Ford’s 
           training -- a living memory of a buried past.

                        The bank says they won’t give us 
                        any more credit.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Then try the local banks.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        That’s... who I’m talking about.
           That hits John Wayne like a brick. 

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        So what you’re saying is, if I want 
                        to buy a piece of gum in the state 
                        of Texas, I’ll need a co-signer.

           Michael’s silence confirms it.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                             (hesitantly)
                        And the Mexican soldiers still 
                        won’t work until they’re paid.
                             (positively)
                        The Americans will work without 
                        pay.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Te’rrific.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        If I might interject.

           Both Wayne men turn.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH (CONT’D)
                        John Ford could stabilize this 
                        picture.

           John Wayne laughs.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        That would be manslaughter.
                        He’d die of satisfaction.

           John Wayne gently pats his son on the back.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        It’s not your fault.

           Michael Wayne hesitantly walks out.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Starring. Producing. Directing.
                        I forgot how long it took me to 
                        master the first one.

           John Wayne looks out the window as a MEXICAN SOLDIER jumps 
           onto a horse.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:
           EXT. MONUMENT VALLEY - SET OF “STAGECOACH” - AFTERNOON - 1939

           Yakima gracefully lands on a horse, handling the saddle and 
           rope with ease.

           Marion watches. Taking it all in.

                                 YAKIMA
                        Look, Duke. Here’s the truth, Ford 
                        uses the same actors over and over 
                        again. He teases ‘em with a 
                        starring role.

           Yakima dismounts in one smooth motion. Holds the ROPE to 
           Marion.

                                 YAKIMA (CONT’D)
                        And then he gives the picture to 
                        you.

                                 MARION
                        So I just... turn it down?

           Marion mounts the horse. Sloppy.

                                 YAKIMA
                        No. But Ford’s not wrong. There are 
                        people like me who can ride a 
                        horse, and there are people like 
                        Fonda who can deliver a line. My 
                        guess is he wants you to be the 
                        first to do both.

           Marion dismounts. It’s still ugly and choppy.

                                 YAKIMA (CONT’D)
                        Again.

                                 MARION
                        Sorry.

                                 YAKIMA
                        Never apologize. It’s a sign of 
                        weakness.

           Marion absorbs Yakima.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PORCH - BARBARA’S LODGE - EVENING

           Marion is far dirtier than we last saw him. He’s spent the 
           day falling but getting back up. A hard-earned satisfaction.
           Yakima walks out with two glasses of cold water.

           The two men lean back in their rocking chairs, taking in the 
           untouched beauty of the landscape.

                                 MARION
                        It really is something.

                                 YAKIMA
                        As long as I’ve been doing stunts 
                        Ford’s wanted to shoot here.
                             (tilts his hat up)
                        Expensive location shoot like this 
                        with no established star...

           Yakima lets the last word hang. 

                                 YAKIMA (CONT’D)
                        He’s all in, and with an off-suited 
                        pair no less.

                                 MARION
                        I ain’t nothing.

           Yakima takes a large sip of water. 

                                 YAKIMA
                        You can spend this time cussin’ 
                        that he’s breaking you in like he 
                        caught ya stealing somethin’. Or, 
                        you can realize that any actor, 
                        anywhere, would kill to have his 
                        attention.

           Marion looks into the distance.

                                 MARION
                        What does he want from me? 

                                 YAKIMA
                        Legend.

           And with that, Yakima gets up and walks to his tent. Marion 
           watches him go and then looks up. Ford’s light is on.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY - BARBARA’S LODGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Marion walks up the stairs and hears--

                                 JOHN FORD (O.S.)
                        Lock the door.
           He walks down the hallway. 

           Whoever walked into Fords room didn't listen to him -- the 
           door is slightly a jar.

           Marion looks through the crack and sees Ford massaging a 
           SHIRTLESS HANDSOME DAY PLAYER’s neck.

           Ford reaches deeper into the man’s tissue and then...

           --His still functioning right eye flickers up and he sees 
           Marion. 

           For what feels like an eternity, Ford doesn’t react. He just 
           stares at Marion... caught in this act of intimacy.

           And then like a shook up bottle of fizz, popped open, Ford 
           charges at the door and SLAMS it.

           Marion freezes, face inches from the door, contemplating what 
           just happened.

           He quickly retreats to his room.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MARION’S ROOM - BARBARA’S LODGE - LATE NIGHT

           KNOCK KNOCK.

           Marion walks to the door. It’s Ford. He is holding something 
           behind his back.

           Marion waits for him to acknowledge what just happened...

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Do you have a minute Duke?

                                 MARION
                        ‘Course Coach.

           Ford walks in. Still hiding something behind his back.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Tomorrow is a big day. For both of 
                        us.

                                 MARION
                        It’s my first scene--

                                 JOHN FORD
                        --It’s more than that. This is your 
                        introduction as John Wayne.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN FORD (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        John Ford’s John Wayne.

           Ford reveals what he was hiding. A bottle Of TEQUILA.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Remembered you had a taste for 
                        Latin women and Latin hootch.

           Ford grabs a glass of water and dashes it onto the floor. 
           Marion moves for a second glass... 

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        --I never drink during a picture.
                        One drink is one too many, and a 
                        thousand is never enough. Thank my 
                        Irish roots for that.

           Ford pours the tequila into Marion’s glass. Marion holds the 
           liquor to his mouth. Is this a test?

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                             (as if reading his mind)
                        This isn’t a test.
                             (beat)
                        I saw you practicing today with 
                        Yakima, and you deserve a hard 
                        drink for a hard day’s work.

           Marion takes a sip. He savors it.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Do you realize why I selected you 
                        for this picture?

                                 MARION
                        Still can’t say that I do.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        I wish most days - no, every day - 
                        I wish I was born in Ireland. But I 
                        was born in a saloon. An American 
                        saloon. With eight siblings. A 
                        place full of drink, cards, and men 
                        of few words. Real men. I used to 
                        watch them through the wooden 
                        banisters outside my bedroom. I 
                        wanted to be them, but I was cursed 
                        with a disposition...
                             (recovering)
                        A poet’s disposition.

           Ford looks out the window. A long pause. 
                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        I see you in the men I watched 
                        through the banisters.

           Marion stares at Ford intently. Finally summoning the courage 
           to speak.

                                 MARION
                        My father never amounted to much.
                        Wonder if it’s something that gets 
                        passed down.

           Ford sits down on the bed.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Every man makes his own destiny, 
                        Duke. If I can’t inherit the 
                        history of Ireland, together we’ll 
                        create the Myth of America, because 
                        America and cinema are twins born 
                        of a need-

                                 MARION
                        --To prove something.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        That’s right my boy. 

           Ford stands. He reaches down and softly kisses Marion’s 
           forehead and then he moves to the door. 

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Get some sleep my boy. You’ll need 
                        your strength for tomorrow.

           Ford walks out of the room. Marion moves to the window, looks 
           up as the MOON falls.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           The SUN rises up. 

           The BUGLER walks to the center of camp.

           He plays Reveille.

           Marion still stands next to the window. He hasn’t slept.

           The entire Stagecoach script is laid out on the wooden floor. 

           Marion gently picks up each page. Like scripture.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. BASE CAMP - MONUMENT VALLEY - MORNING

           The CREW is lined up for inspection. Ford walks along like a 
           drill Sargent.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        I heard a nasty rumor someone’s 
                        been drinking.

           Ford stops at Marion. Marion’s stomach sinks.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        What are the rules about drinking 
                        while filming?

                                 MARION
                        But...

                                 WARD BOND
                             (teacher’s pet)
                        Absolutely Forbidden.

           Ford stares Marion down and then...

           --deftly moves three paces down the line to the Handsome Day 
           Player we saw last night.

           Ford moves right up to his face and SNIFFS.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Have you been drinking?

                                 HANDSOME DAY PLAYER
                        I--

                                 JOHN FORD
                        --Wrong answer.

           EXT. TENT - MONUMENT VALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           SMASH! Personal items are being thrown out. 

           The Handsome Day Player moves towards a cracked photo of a 
           beautiful young woman. 

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Ahhh ha!

           Ford walks out triumphantly with the contraband Tequila he 
           offered to Marion last night.

           The Handsome Day Player face crumples in anguish, then his 
           body as Ford slugs him in the stomach and he hits the dirt.
           Ford turns to Ward Bond.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Demonstrate the consequences of 
                        rule breakage.

           Ford leans down towards the Handsome Day Player.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                             (quietly, regretfully)
                        If you had just locked the door.

           Ford moves away.

           Ward Bond and a couple other crew members circle and start to 
           kick the Handsome Day Player...

           --Blood spits out of his lips and beads in the dry dust.

           Ford turns to Marion, staring at him as the beating 
           intensifies. Marion twitches in reaction to each blow.

           We hear a CRACK. Then a CRUNCH.

           The Handsome Day Player nose has been flattened. The 
           temptation has been erased. Which has finally satisfied Ford. 
           He signals Ward Bond to stop.

           Ford walks to his HORSE DRAWN CARRIAGE.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                             (jumping on)
                        Stop standing around. We have a 
                        picture to make.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CREEK - SET OF “STAGECOACH” - MONUMENT VALLEY - DAY

           The crew are all set up for a shot. The morning beating still 
           hangs in the air.

           Ford walks to the director’s chair. He begins aggressively 
           chewing on a HANDKERCHIEF, a tick when he’s dry. The worse 
           the condition of the Handkerchief, the worse shape he’s in 
           and it’s in tatters.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Action!

           We see a WAGON. Marion stands hesitantly in COWBOY WARDROBE.
           The wagon approaches. Marion walks into frame and spins his 
           RIFLE.

                                 MARION
                             (as Ringo Kid)
                        HOLD IT!

                                 JOHN FORD
                        CUT!

           Ford walks calmly over to Marion. He has instructed him with 
           the stick, now we see him use the carrot.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                             (softly)
                        What did you do wrong?

                                 MARION
                        You told me to walk into frame--

                                 JOHN FORD
                        --But from the East.

                                 MARION
                        I’ll do it again--

                                 JOHN FORD
                        --If there is one thing. One thing 
                        I want you to take from me.

           Ford grabs Marion’s shoulder, shifting his body, so the light 
           breaks on his face. 

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        The hero always comes with the 
                        light. Always.

           Marion listens as Ford walks out of the shot.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Reset! Action.

           The wagon comes up the hill. Marion walks into frame. 

           BLACK AND WHITE CAMERA POV: Ringo Kid cocks his rifle with a 
           sharp swing of his right hand. We DOLLY towards him while 
           briefly losing focus before coming back in a close up of a 
           strong, masculine face bathed in light.

                                 MARION JOHN WAYNE 
                             (as Ringo Kid)
                        Hold it!
           A STAR IS BORN... And like that Marion is scrubbed from 
           history.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Cut.

           Ford walks over to John Wayne, smile plastered across his 
           face.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Beautiful. That is John Ford’s John 
                        Wayne.

           Ford claps John Wayne across the back.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PORCH - BARBARA’S LODGE - MONUMENT VALLEY = DUSK

           John Wayne sits in a rocking chair. Yakima walks up the 
           steps.

                                 YAKIMA
                        Nice work, Duke.

           Yakima walks inside. 

           John Wayne’s smile evaporates as he watches the bandaged 
           Handsome Day Player being helped onto a WAGON. 

           As the wagon sets off, he and John Wayne lock eyes, seeing 
           themselves in one another.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CAMP FIRE - SET OF “STAGECOACH” - EVENING

           The MAIN CAST is settled around a ROARING FIRE. 

           A FIDDLER plays a Gaelic tune as a large group of NATIVE 
           AMERICANS EXTRAS fill their stomachs in the background. 

           We notice SMALL CHILDREN and ELDERLY WOMEN. Most of this 
           tribe isn’t fit for manual labor.

           Ford smokes his pipe, a calm joy radiating from him.

           WAGNER, (40s, Jewish-German, a hands-off producer who is 
           about to get hands on), interrupts Ford’s tranquility.

                                 WAGNER 
                        Mr. Ford, can I have a moment?
           Ford doesn’t even look up.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        No.

                                 WAGNER
                        I need to speak with you.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        When I agreed to let you produce 
                        this picture, we decided you were 
                        the type of producer who doesn’t 
                        produce.

           Wagner kicks a log that was leaning out of the pit. SPARKS 
           FLY. Ford does not flinch. 

                                 WAGNER
                        You can’t hire these Indians for 
                        three more days!

           Ford twists his devilish grin. You think you give orders?

                                 WAGNER (CONT’D)
                        You wanted to shoot on location 
                        with no stars, and here we are.
                             (looking at John Wayne)
                        But we can't afford to finish the 
                        dialogue interiors back in Los 
                        Angeles unless we leave tomorrow.

           Ford picks up his script. He moves to a specific section and 
           RIPS out several pages. 

                                 JOHN FORD
                        A good picture is long on action 
                        and short on dialogue.

                                 WAGNER
                        Those are pivotal scenes--

           He tosses the pages into the fire.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        --I’m not lookin’ for words, I’m 
                        looking for motion.
                             (turns to John Wayne)
                        And Duke’s performance is better 
                        than a thousand words.
           Ford’s approval is a drug, John Wayne ravenously accepts it 
           and will spend the rest of his life searching for another 
           dose. 

                                                             SMASH CUT:

           INT. JOHN WAYNE’S QUARTERS - “THE ALAMO” SET - NIGHT - 1960

           John Wayne splashes water on his face. 

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Why did he stay in Monument Valley 
                        those extras days?

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        'Cause the Indians were starving. 

           John Wayne places a cigarette in his mouth

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Or maybe he never planned on doing 
                        the interiors in LA.

           John Wayne lights his cigarette and takes a large drag.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        The Navajo tribe survived because 
                        of John Ford shooting in Monument 
                        Valley. He paid the elderly and the 
                        young for work they couldn’t 
                        possibly do. They called him 
                        “Natani Nez”. Tall Leader. Hell 
                        they even made him an honorary 
                        chief.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        I never knew that... So after that 
                        night, he respected you?

           John Wayne laughs.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        For a while. Before the war--

           --John Wayne’s eyes catch something through the window.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Oh hell.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        And what you saw in Ford’s room?
           John Wayne ignores his question and storms out of the room. 
           Peter follows.

           EXT. SET OF “THE ALAMO” - TEXAS - NIGHT

           We see a procession of MEXICAN SOLDIERS climbing down from 
           their horses, removing their costumes, and heading to trucks.

           Michael is making a last stand to save his father’s Alamo.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        Just give us a few more days!?

           Peter stand next to John Wayne, who just laughs. A wary, 
           broken laugh. The kind you give when a dream evaporates right 
           before your eyes and that devil on your shoulder purrs “told 
           you just so.” 

           The ringleader, LUIS SOCHO, comes over to John Wayne.

                                 LUIS SOCHO
                        I’m sorry boss.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        When you say you’ll pay a man a 
                        real wage for a real day’s work, 
                        you gotta deliver.

           John Wayne extends his hand.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        And I didn’t.

           Luis takes his hand. They shake.

           John Wayne heads to his horse, mounts and kicks off. He can’t 
           bare to stay and watch the picture die.

           The Gruff Man walks up to Peter. 

                                 GRUFF MAN
                        Phone call for ya.

           Peter follows him towards the only phone in a mile.

           INT. PRODUCTION QUARTERS - SET OF “THE ALAMO” - MOMENTS LATER

           Extras are drinking. Playing darts. Unruly, undisciplined, 
           and without order. 

           Peter moves to the phone on the wall.
           INTERCUT BETWEEN MARY FORD AND PETER BOGDANOVICH

                                 MARY FORD
                        Mr. Bogdanovich. This is Mary Ford.

           Awkward beat. 

                                 MARY FORD (CONT’D)
                        My husband has informed me about 
                        your “book”.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Yes he gave me permission--

                                 MARY FORD
                        --I very much doubt that. But hear 
                        me clearly. Whatever John Wayne 
                        tells you is a lie. Specifically in 
                        regards to The Searchers.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        I’ll be sure to take that into 
                        consideration.

                                 MARY FORD
                        Please pass along a message to Mr. 
                        Wayne. Ford’s offer to save the 
                        production, by directing the 
                        picture, is still on the table.

           The line goes dead.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SET OF “THE ALAMO” - TEXAS - MOMENTS LATER

           Michael Wayne stares up at the massive CATHEDRAL. Peter walks 
           towards him.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Your father needs to call Ford.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        No.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        He wants to help.

           Michael Wayne grabs Peter’s shirt. Startling him. 
                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        I would rather burn this set to the 
                        ground, with my body strung across 
                        the boards then let my father 
                        accept a thing from that man.

           Michael Wayne releases him.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        I’m kicking you of this set.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        John Ford said--

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        --I don’t give a shit what John 
                        Ford said.

           Rain starts to pour down. Michael retreats into the 
           Cathedral.

           INT. CATHEDRAL - SET OF “THE ALAMO” - MOMENTS LATER

           Peter follows Michael inside.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Let me finish interviewing your 
                        father--

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE

                        I need to know what happened 
                        between them.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        They made classic fuckin’ American 
                        films. Now get out.

           Lightning strikes above them.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        I don’t like my chances out there.

           Michael Wayne pauses. Peter takes his silence as a opening.

                             (delicately)
                        You’re father said Ford respected 
                        him before the war. What did he 
                        mean by that?
           Michael releases a long exhale.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        Ford believed he could direct my 
                        father even when the cameras 
                        weren’t rolling. The war was meant 
                        to be their true adventure and Ford 
                        never forgave him for not 
                        enlisting.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        But they worked together after the 
                        war.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        Each film after 1944 is an assault 
                        against my father. The Searchers is 
                        just the opus.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        I don’t understand.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        Ford tortured my father for staying 
                        in Hollywood and playing soldier 
                        but the real irony is John Ford’s 
                        the one pretending to be a war 
                        hero.

           INT. FORD’S QUARTERS - MILITARY BASE - ENGLAND - NIGHT - 1944

           John Ford uses both of his functioning eyes to stare into a 
           MIRROR. He adjusts his CRISP NAVY UNIFORM. A HANDSOME SOLDIER 
           (who resembles Marion Morrison) hands him a WHITE NAVY 
           OFFICER’S HAT. 

           He places it on his head. Then tilts it. Finally, he’s 
           satisfied. 

           He grabs his PIPE, which is lying atop a NEWSPAPER... 

           --a picture of John Wayne attending the OSCARS. Tuxedo and 
           drink in hand. Laughing with Director Cecil B. DeMille.  

           Ford walks out of the room. The door shuts.

           INT. BARRACKS 3 - MILITARY BASE - ENGLAND - NIGHT

           Ford walks in. Men stand, all hand selected by him.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        I’ll be brief. Today’s the day, 
                        gentleman. Our orders are to stay 
                        back.

           The MEN grumble. Ford smiles.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        But we are going with the first 
                        wave of the Allied Liberation. 

           Ford theatrically struts through his men.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Colonel Zanuck fucked me in 
                        Hollywood, then he fucked us all in 
                        North Africa but the only people 
                        getting fucked today, in France, 
                        are the Germans. 

           The men cheer.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        I have built up a stockpile of over 
                        a hundred cameras.

                                 JOHN FORD (V.O.)
                        Your orders are simple. Focus on 
                        what you see and film everything.
                        But I’m not going to lie to any of 
                        you - there is no protected place 
                        to film this invasion. We will be 
                        embedded and that means we will 
                        share the cost. 

           We are back to Ford addressing his men. 
                                 JOHN FORD
                        If anyone wants to wait till the 
                        fighting’s done then walk out that 
                        door and meet with George Stevens’s 
                        film crew at Zero-Six-Hundred.

           No one leaves. Ford tips his hat to them with pride.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LANDING CRAFT - ENGLISH CHANNEL - MORNING

           Ford holds a camera and focuses on the SOLDIERS. One throws 
           up. The camera shakes. The choppy water spills above him.

           THE HANDSOME SOLDIER from Ford’s Quarters crouches right in 
           front of him. Ford gives him an encouraging slap on the back.

           The noise intensifies.

           Bullets KNICK the METAL DOOR.

           The doors come down. 

           And the carnage explodes upon us. 

           THE INVASION OF D-DAY. Hell made real by man.

           The GATE comes up and the LANDING CRAFT turns around. Ford 
           puts his camera down and scurries to The Handsome Soldier, 
           who is split to pieces by machine gun fire. 

           Ford holds him. For the first time in his life, Ford is not 
           in control. The Handsome Solider attempts to speak but he’s 
           chocking on his own blood. Ford leans closer. Trying to hear 
           his last words. But he can’t make them out.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DESTROYER - FRANCE - AFTERNOON

           Ford has wiped most of the blood off his uniform. He is 
           filming the ground, as if in a trance.

           GUTS, SURGICAL BANDAGES, and BRAINS sway in unison with the 
           ocean against Ford’s boot. 

           We hear a muffled sound. He looks up and sees COLONEL DARRYL 
           ZANUCK (50s, legendary Studio Head, currently a Colonel in 
           the Army Corps Photographic Unit and Ford’s commanding 
           officer.) He’s yelling at Ford. 
                                 COLONEL ZANUCK
                        --Disobeyed a direct order and 
                        endangered the lives--

           Ford turns back down to the carnage on the ground. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. OMAHA BEACH - AFTERNOON

           The battle is over. We have “won,” but this is not a 
           celebration. Bodies still roll in with the tide. 

           Zanuck pulls up in his OFFICER’S JEEP with his camera team. 
           He is instructed the weary soldiers to smile, as their 
           friends bodies bob in the water. He is filming propaganda, 
           Eisenhower’s “Total Victory”.

           Ford looks at the bodies on the beach, then looks down at his 
           camera. He throws it on the ground in disgust. Tears start to 
           stream down his cheeks. He wipes them away and climbs into a 
           empty JEEP. 

           Ford turns the engine on and goes AWOL.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COTTAGE - FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           A Man sits in a chair in a pitch black room. A puddle of piss 
           begins to form beneath him.

           He doesn’t care and takes another sip from a bottle. 

           He flays his hands around in the darkness, only being met by 
           empty bottle after empty bottle and then...

           --The door rustles, but it has been blocked by a desk.

           CRACK!

           An AXE cuts through. ARMY POLICE break through the door.

           Light blinds us and then we see...

           --John Ford. Three days deep in a bender.

                                 ARMY POLICE
                        Commander Ford. You are under 
                        arrest for abandoning your post.
           Ford gets up, swaying, with a wild look on his face. His eyes 
           are bloodshot from weeping...

           --He charges in a blind rage. 

           INT. MILITARY COURT - DAY - FRANCE

           Ford’s face is heavily bruised, coupled with an Old Testament 
           of a hangover. A sharp contrast to the STIFF OFFICERS across 
           from him. He is in HANDCUFFS but itching for another beating. 

           A GENERAL walks in. He gives everyone in the room a 
           disapproving look. This is a waste of his time during a time 
           when he has none to waste.

                                 GENERAL
                        On with it. And keep it trim. 

           The General sits at the center of the desk, surrounded on 
           both sides.

                                 COLONEL ZANUCK
                        Commander Ford has disobeyed 
                        orders, put his men in needless 
                        danger, gone AWOL--

                                 GENERAL
                        --Ford what do you have to say for 
                        yourself?

           Beat.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Zanuck was a cunt before the war, 
                        and he most likely will be a cunt 
                        after. Sir.

           Colonel Zanuck seethes with rage.

                                 COLONEL ZANUCK
                        You see!?

                                 GENERAL 
                        The punishment for desertion is 
                        death by hanging.

           Ford doesn’t break a sweat.

                                 JOHN FORD
                             (daring him)

                        war is over.

           The General stands up. Everyone salutes... even Zanuck.

                                 GENERAL (CONT’D)
                        We need Zanuck’s work to sell Bonds 
                        and help win this war. And we need 
                        Ford’s work to remind us to never 
                        have another.

           Ford is drinking from a flask while being driven through by a 
           PRIVATE as planes land behind him.

           The JEEP stops in front of a DOUGLAS C-54 SKYMASTER. Which is 
           being loaded up from the rear for an imminent takeoff.

                        Won’t be necessary. 

           Ford gets out and is saluted. This deeply moves Ford and he 
           sharply salutes back.

           Ford goes to enter the plane and hears...

                        You’ll need this.

                        birdy just let slip your going to 
                        be nominated for Sands of Iwo Jima.

           John Wayne doesn’t react. He still scanning the crowd.

                                 CECIL B. DEMILLE (CONT’D)
                        You lookin’ for some tail?

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Have you seen Fonda or Stewart?
                             (anxiously)
                        I invited them.

                                 CECIL B. DEMILLE
                        Didn’t you hear? They shipped over.

           That’s exactly what John Wayne didn’t want to hear.

                                 CECIL B. DEMILLE (CONT’D)
                        Fools. Their letting us run the 
                        table. I’ve never been more in 
                        demand.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                             (bitterly)
                        There’s a name for that, and you 
                        make it by combining two words that 
                        have no business standing next to 
                        one another. War and profit.

           John Wayne looks down at his champagne. It’s gone flat.

           John Wayne moves to the STEERING WHEEL.

           Passing his guests who all exhaustively praise him.
           EXT. DOCK - NEWPORT BEACH - DAY

           Michael Wayne, (15) stands on the DOCK. As the WILD GOOSE 
           docks.

           He is waiting for his father to disembark.  

           Finally, John Wayne emerges and walks to his son.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        Dad, there’s a package for you. I 
                        put it in your office.

           INT. OFFICE - JOHN WAYNE’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           The office is decorated with all of John Wayne’s MOVIE 
           POSTERS.

           John Wayne somberly looks down at the package. “Commander 
           Ford” is written on top.

           He gently shakes it. It sounds like a tambourine

           He slowly opens it and pulls out a handful of DOG TAGS.

           He reaches deeper and finds a handwritten note from Ford

           “Thought you might want to know what real men look like.”

           John Wayne clenches the DOG TAGS in his fist so hard... blood 
           stars to DRIP.

           He looks up at a poster for the film, Sands of Iwo Jima. 

           At himself, in a COSTUME UNIFORM. Leading a fake heroic 
           charge... 

           --He STORMS towards it and RIPS it from the wall. SMASHING it 
           against the ground.

           John Wayne is pure primal rage. All his posters are judging 
           him. He moves through the room, destroying everything in 
           sight.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE (O.S.)
                        Dad?

           Michael is terrified, standing outside the room.

           John Wayne walks towards his son and at the last second slams 
           the door in his face.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CATHEDRAL - SET OF “THE ALAMO” - NIGHT

           Michael Wayne is shaking with rage.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        Everyone wonders why my dad became 
                        a “Super Patriot’. Its fuckin’ 
                        obvious. DeMille, McCarthy, The 
                        Alamo, The Loyalty Pledge. It all 
                        goes back to Ford.

                        But John Wayne is the face of 
                        American Patriotism--

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        --Like a scab comes from a wound.

           EXT. SET OF “THEY WERE EXPENDABLES” - MIAMI - DAY

           TITLE: DAY 1 “THEY WERE EXPENDABLE” 1946

           John Wayne puffs a cigarette as he pulls up to the set in a 
           BENTLEY. Just as John Ford pulls up in MILITARY JEEP, 
           identical to the one he went AWOL in France... He must have 
           had it shipped across the Ocean.

           Ford is first out of a car. He’s wearing a custom navy 
           uniform except for his BLUE DODGERS HAT.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Nice car Duke!

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Thanks Coac--

           Ford signals for ROBERT MONTGOMERY 40s, (co-lead of the 
           picture) who is walking by to come over.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Monty, take a look at this car. 
                        Ain’t she a beaut?

                                 ROBERT MONTGOMERY
                             (politely)
                        Yes, she is.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        While we were over in Europe, 
                        fighting for freedom like suckers.

                        Mr. John Wayne here was sleeping in 
                        his own bed at night, making a 
                        killing.

           Ford claps Montgomery back and they walk off.

           John Wayne slowly lowers his head. Staring down at his hands. 
           Preparing himself for the worst shoot of his life.

           EXT. BEACH - SET OF “THEY WERE EXPENDABLE” - MORNING

           John Ford sits in the DIRECTOR’S CHAIR, BUCKET OF BEER in the 
           hot sand next to him. Sucking on his HANDKERCHIEF... It’s not 
           working. 

           He throws down the cloth in disgust and reaches for his first 
           beer of the day. Breaking his own rule about drinking on set.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Action!

           A PT BOAT speeds across the BAY. Rigged explosions are set 
           off in a timed sequence.

           A SPITFIRE airplane dives low in UNISON with the EXPLOSIONS.

           Ford’s HANDS SHAKE more intensely with each explosion. 

           He is suffering in silence, years before anyone will diagnose 
           PTSD. 

           The SPITFIRE flies directly over Ford. He grips his chair, 
           turning his knuckles white.

           He finishes his beer and grabs another one as the PT BOAT’S 
           comes into the BAY.

           EXT. DOCK - SET OF “THEY WERE EXPENDABLE” - AFTERNOON

           John Wayne and Montgomery are in military uniforms. They walk 
           alongside a row of their men at attention, as a GENERAL stops 
           in front of his car. 

           It’s the real General from Ford’s Court Marshall.

                                 GENERAL
                        You have a splendid lot of men. 
                             (beat)
                        Gentleman, we are late. Those boats 
                        of yours maneuver beautifully. But 
                        in wartime, I’m afraid I want 
                        something more substantial.
           John Wayne and Montgomery both salute. 

                                 JOHN FORD (O.S.)
                        CUT! Reset.

           Everyone walks back to places and starts from the beginning. 
           The General stops in front of his car.

                                 GENERAL
                        You have a splendid lot of men.
                             (beat)
                        Gentleman, we are late. Those boats 
                        of yours maneuver beautifully. But 
                        in wartime, I’m afraid I want 
                        something more substantial.

           John Wayne and Montgomery both salute.

                                 JOHN FORD (O.S.)
                        CUT! AGAIN!

           Everyone starts to walk back to position.

                                 JOHN FORD (O.S.) (CONT’D) 
                        No, just the salute. Just John 
                        Wayne.

           Everyone is slightly confused.

           Ford walks into frame. He is holding his right arm with his 
           left. Just Like The Searchers. He is clearly in pain. He is 
           drunk. 

           John Wayne gives a salute.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        That isn’t right.

           Ford turns to Montgomery.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        That looks like the salute of a  
                        man who was wearing spurs on D-DAY.
                        Commander Montgomery, why don’t you 
                        demonstrate the salute of someone 
                        who actually served his country.

           Montgomery doesn’t want to embarrass John Wayne, but Ford’s 
           word is gospel. He reluctantly salutes.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        That’s it. That’s the salute of a 
                        man who won a Bronze Star for 
                        Valor.
           Ford turns to John Wayne.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Again.

           John Wayne is on the rack and Ford won’t stop turning the 
           roller. 

           John Wayne salutes.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        No. Seems fake, like the medals you 
                        give yourself.

           Montgomery tries to stop this torture.

                                 MONTGOMERY
                        Why don’t we take a break--

                                 JOHN FORD
                        --Don’t try and protect him.

           Ford starts pointing his finger at John Wayne’s chest.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Where were you... WHERE WERE YOU.
                        Dressing up like some kinda faggot 
                        while the real men fought--

           --John Wayne SOCKS Ford against the mouth, knocking him to 
           the ground and instantly regrets what he’s done. 

           Then Ford looks up like a rabid dog, the heat, the booze and 
           the war mixing like poison in his brain and CHARGES John 
           Wayne--

           --Slamming into him.

           Montgomery HAULS Ford off John Wayne as he screams.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        WHERE WERE YOU!?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SET OF “THEY WERE EXPENDABLE” - SUNSET

           John Wayne, sitting on the dock, starring at a PT BOAT.

           He has visible scraps on his face from his brawl with Ford.
           Montgomery walks over. He stands there a moment, hesitating. 
           He knows what he wants to say, just isn’t sure how to get it 
           out.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                             (desperately)
                        I was thirty-six when we entered 
                        the war. Three kids to support. 
                        Republic Pictures said they would 
                        sue me if I broke my contract and 
                        enlisted--

                                 MONTGOMERY
                        --You’re not a coward, Duke.

           John Wayne just stares at the boat.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        You know why he picked you, don’t 
                        ya?

                                 MONTGOMERY
                        Because I’m a superb actor.
                             (sad shake of his head)
                        I know why. To aid in your torment 
                        and for that I am truly sorry. But 
                        it was John Ford. I felt I couldn’t 
                        refuse--

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        --Cause’ it’s the best work you’ve 
                        ever done.

                                 MONTGOMERY
                        It’s the best work I’ve ever done.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        That’s the answer.

                                 MONTGOMERY
                        To what?

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Why I keep signing up for more 
                        pilgrim. It’s the best work I’ll 
                        ever do.

           And with that John Wayne picks himself up and walks down the 
           dock.
           EXT. JOHN FORD’S BUNGALOW - EVENING

           John Wayne notices the door is slightly ajar, he opens it. 
           The curtains have been drawn, its near pitch black inside.

           INT. JOHN FORD’S BUNGALOW - MOMENTS LATER

           John Wayne enters.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Look here Coach, I got something to 
                        say.
                             (moving further into the 
                              darkness)
                        We both did what we were good at 
                        during the war. You directed, and I 
                        acted. And you damn sure bet my 
                        corpse wasn’t going to sell a 
                        million war bonds...

           --John Wayne hears sobbing.

           Ford stands up and walks to John Wayne, he’s shirtless. He 
           falls into his arms.

           Ford beats his hands against John Wayne’s chest.

           Ford looks up, like a lost child and buries his head in John 
           Wayne’s chest. 

           Then John Wayne notices the blood... 

           --Ford has mutilated himself, and his knee is pumping black 
           mess.

                                 JOHN FORD
                             (softly)
                        Where were you?

           John Wayne places his hands on Fords leg. 

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        I’ll... be right back.

           John Wayne places Ford’s own hand on his wound and rushes out 
           to find help.

                        Ford didn’t fight to save Europe or 
                        because he believed in democracy. 

           John Ford moves his hand away. Letting the blood pour out of 
           him.
                                 MICHAEL WAYNE (V.O.)
                        He fought because the war was the 
                        only time he wasn’t battling 
                        himself.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        The Searchers was about power and 
                        control. Ford had lost his industry 
                        clout, he couldn’t get the movie 
                        financed unless my father agreed to 
                        star. My father held Ford’s fate in 
                        his hands.

           Michael Wayne, (18) stares out the window. He sees smoke. He 
           leans in closer to the glass. He snaps back.

                        fag screenwriters.

           Michael opens the door. John Wayne, Cecill B. DeMille, and 
           Ward Bond turn to him. MEN IN SUITS surround them. All 
           smoking cigarettes.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        What is it?
                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        He’s--

           --John Ford, (50s) hobbles into the frame. EYE PATCH over his 
           right eye. Ford hands his coat to Michael. Michael grabs it. 
           He notices oil on it.

                        Look at this group of peacocked 
                        shit cans.

           John Wayne instantly stands. Everyone follows his lead.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Coach. I didn’t know you where

                        I phoned.

           Ford walks into the room. Looks at the posters lining the 
           wall. Purposefully leans against the Sands of Iwo Jima. John 
           Wayne charging with a rifle in World War Two.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        --Who are these... gentlemen.

                        before it takes Tinseltown.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Is that so?

                        politics and show business.

           Ford takes out a flask and takes a large pull.

           John Wayne is back to being four inches small.

           EXT. JOHN WAYNE’S HOME - NEWPORT BEACH - DAY

           Ford hobbles past his FORD ROADSTER, which he drunkily 
           wrecked against a massive PALM TREE on John Wayne’s front 
           lawn.

           Ford attempts to open John Wayne’s CONVERTIBLE LINCOLN 
           CONTINENTAL...

           --It’s locked.

           John Wayne walks out of his home and heads for Ford.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        KEYS!

           Wayne hesitantly submits them to Ford.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Every car here, belongs to me.

           Ford gets in the CONTINENTAL and reverses it, smashing into 
           SEVERAL OTHER EXPENSIVE AUTOMOBILES.

           John Wayne just stands there. Twitching at each collision.

           Finally, after enough damage, Ford speeds away.

                        And that’s how Ford asked my father 
                        if he would star in The Searchers.

           Michael Wayne bolts the window shut.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        My father instantly agreed. But 
                        Ford just couldn’t stand the 
                        indignity of having to ask.

                        The power balance had changed and 
                        Ford wouldn’t begin principal

                        back to him.

           We turn to John Wayne. Sitting in a large leather chair. 

                                                        WARD BOND
                                              He opposed the Loyalty pledge

                 CECIL B. DEMILLE (CONT’D)
           Joseph Mankiewicz is a clear 
           Communist and therefore 
           completely unfit to be the 
           President of the Screen 
           Directors Guild.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Well, this is America. Let’s vote.

           Cecil B. DeMille awkwardly moves to the bar and pours three 
           stiff drinks.

                                 CECIL B. DEMILLE
                        The issue is Ford.

                                 WARD BOND
                        We need Ford’s certainty that he 
                        supports removing Mankiewicz and 
                        electing a Pro-American Directors 
                        Guild president. Someone who’ll 
                        stomp out this red--

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        --I spoke with him. Ford hates the 
                        reds more than anyone. He gave me 
                        his word he’ll vote for removing 
                        Mankiewicz.
                                 CECIL B. DEMILLE
                        He’s unpredictable.

                                 WARD BOND
                        We must make sure the liberals and 
                        the Jews don’t start blubbering 
                        about freedom--

                                 CECIL B. DEMILLE
                             (to John Wayne)
                        --So you guarantee Ford will vote 
                        with us when he arrives?

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Ford won’t come to an event like 
                        this. He promised me.

           Cecil B. DeMille hands the drinks out and picks up a note 
           from his desk and reads it.

                                 CECIL B. DEMILLE
                        “Wouldn’t miss it for the world” 
                        John Ford. Director. Stop.

           We zoom in on John Wayne’s face, slightly unsure of Ford’s 
           motives. He looks down in his lap.

           INT. CRYSTAL ROOM - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - EVENING

           TITLE: BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - THREE HOURS LATER

           The room is packed with every A-list Director in town and 
           some political minded movie stars. 

           It looks almost like an award show, with two tables on the 
           main stage.

           One full of “American Patriots”: Cecil B. Demille, John 
           Wayne, Clark Gable and Ward Bond.

           The other “Liberal Elite”: Henry Fonda, James Stewart, John 
           Huston and George Stevens.

           Ashtrays are packed with smashed cigarettes, and ties have 
           been loosened. They have been at it a while.

                                 CECIL B. DEMILLE
                        The question you all should be 
                        asking yourself is why, when we 
                        have foreign spies within our very 
                        own country, we can’t simply say we 
                        support the United States of 
                        America!
           The crowd claps in unison. Cecil B. DeMille finally has them, 
           and he knows it. He leans back into his chair smugly.

           John Ford walks quietly into the room and sits in the back.

           John Wayne see’s him and they share a nod. Ford’s with them 
           and then...

           --George Stevens clears his throat. We can tell by everyone 
           stopping on a dime that he has not yet spoken.

                                 GEORGE STEVENS
                        I believe in defending my country-- 

                                 WARD BOND
                        --And we don’t!--

                                 JAMES STEWART
                        --Let him speak or we’re gonna box.

           George places his hand on James Stewart’s shoulder, calming 
           him down. Then turns and faces the group.

                                 GEORGE STEVENS
                        You ask me to support the United 
                        States of America. I did that, in 
                        World War Two and let me add with 
                        the gentleman next to me. Mr. James 
                        Stewart who is a survivor of over 
                        sixteen bombing missions. You speak 
                        of terror.
                             (beat)
                        I have seen the camps. You speak of 
                        horror. I have smelled the bodies. 
                        You speak of America, but I would 
                        argue you know nothing about her.
                             (turning to DeMille)
                        I resent paper-hat patriots who 
                        stand up and holler, I am an 
                        American and contend that no one 
                        else is. I deeply resent that, and 
                        I greatly resent the blatant anti-
                        Semitism of your American purity 
                        test Mr. DeMille... I’ve seen where 
                        this goes and the next time we 
                        debate this issue, I’ll be wearing 
                        a United States Army uniform, for 
                        which I am a member, and I wonder 
                        what uniform you will be wearing?

           And with that George Stevens sits down. He has shifted the 
           tide, and now everything hangs in the balance.
                        JOHN HUSTON
           We were in uniform when you 
           were wrapping yourself in the 
           flag.
                                                       FRITZ LANG
                                              Mr. DeMille, do you know this 
                                              is the first time since I'm 
                                              in America that I'm afraid, 
                                              because I have an accent?'

           Cecil B. DeMille turns to John Wayne. His closer.

           John Wayne looks to John Ford. His mentor, his tormentor and 
           his father.

           John Wayne’s eyes plead with Ford, what do you want?, But 
           Ford doesn’t signal a damn thing.

           John Wayne leans into the mic.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Everyone here knows me.
                             (wiping sweat)
                        Look I ain’t for ruining anyone’s 
                        career. But I am for protecting the 
                        country that I love from a real 
                        threat.
                             (raising his hands)
                        Look where we stand? In two hundred 
                        years we took a wilderness, built a 
                        factory that feeds our people. 
                        Created a beacon of light to the 
                        rest of the world. Why is 
                        capitalism suddenly a bad word? Why 
                        is saying you love America 
                        difficult? Why is making pictures 
                        that celebrate who we are and what 
                        we stand for controversial? I say 
                        we need a president whose going to 
                        put America first and help stop 
                        this Red Menace!

           This has calmed the crowd down, at this point its too close 
           to call but Cecil B. DeMille will take his shot.

                                 CECIL B. DEMILLE
                        I say we vote. Right now!
                        We’ve heard enough fantasies from 
                        red sympathizers and liberal 
                        cowards for one night. All in favor 
                        of removing Mankiewicz from office 
                        and enacting an American Loyalty 
                        Pledge raise your hands!

           The room is filled with raised hands, the vote will pass... 
           --EEEK. Everyone turns to the back of the room. Towards a 
           GOLD LIGHTER, pressed against a GLASS TABLE and the director 
           of that sound Mr. John Ford. He has gained ever single 
           persons attention. 

           Slowly Ford lights his cigar. Delaying his words. Conducting 
           the moment. 

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Mr. Stevens is many things.
                        His comedies are overlong and he 
                        uses a dozen words when one will do 
                        just fine. But one thing he is not, 
                        nor is my personal friend who you 
                        just insulted, Mr. James Stewart, a 
                        coward.

           Ford stands up. He stares at the two tables on stage. Three 
           sons. John Wayne on the left. James Stewart and Henry Fonda 
           on the right. 

           Everyone holds their breath.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        My name’s John Ford. I make 
                        Westerns. 
                             (turning to the room)
                        I think we have forgotten why we 
                        created the Directors Guild in the 
                        first place gentleman. To unite and 
                        protect one another, against the 
                        true enemy of any artist. The 
                        studios!

           The room laughs. Ford is a master at seducing an audience.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think there’s anyone in 
                        this room who knows more about what 
                        the American public wants than 
                        Cecil B. DeMille and he certainly 
                        knows how to give it to them.
                             (turning to DeMille)
                        But I don’t like you, C.B. I don’t 
                        like what you stand for, and I 
                        don’t like what you’ve been saying 
                        here tonight.

           The crowd starts to slam their hands against the tables in 
           agreement.

           In a room of legends, John Ford is the demigod.
                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Let’s turn the guild over to that 
                        Polack Mankiewicz, strip Demille of 
                        his membership, and tomorrow lets 
                        wake up and make movies!

           Everyone rises to cheer. DeMille sinks into his chair.

           John Wayne stares at the table next to him. Fonda and Stewart 
           are embracing in triumph. 

           No matter how hard John Wayne tries, Ford will never let him 
           be the hero in his own life, only in Ford’s films.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        That doesn't justify your father 
                        helping to blacklist Americans.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        Behind every flag waver, there is a 
                        man trying to prove something.

           John Wayne looks up, stares at a mirror. He is balding. He 
           delicately brushes his skull with a binding agent. 

           He reaches for a CUSTOM TOUPEE and gently places it on his 
           head.

           INT. SENATE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           THREE SMALL CHILDREN play. We don’t see their faces, this 
           feels almost like a loop of the last time we saw his home 
           life 20 years ago and on cue John Wayne’s 3rd wife PILAR 
           PALLETE walks into frame chasing the children. (30s, South 
           American beauty.) 

           The door opens, and John Wayne steps out. He shuts the door.

           CU: OFFICE OF SENATOR MCCARTHY
                                 PILAR PALLETE
                        You look good.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        I just want this to be over with.

                                 PILAR PALLETE
                             (nervously)
                        You’ll be great.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        What’s wrong?

                                 PILAR PALLETE
                        He’s... John Ford is here to watch 
                        you testify to the committee.

           Those words hit him like a truck. But John Wayne collects 
           himself. He looks around, realizing everyone is staring at 
           him. 

           He remembers Ford’s words about always playing the part of 
           John Wayne and swallows his nerves and kisses his wife on the 
           forehead.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        I’ll see you after.

           We track John Wayne as he walks down the hall. A FATHER and 
           his TEENAGE SON sheepishly block his path.

                                 FATHER
                        Sorry to bother you Mr. Wayne but 
                        my son would really like to meet 
                        you.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                             (stopping)
                        Of course. 

                                 TEENAGE SON
                        My dad says this country’s going 
                        straight to hell, but John Wayne 
                        will sort it out.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        I’ll do the best I can.

           The Father places his hand on his son’s shoulder. Wayne 
           notices his SCARRED TWISTED hand. 
                                 FATHER
                        Land Mine. Iwa Jima.
                             (saluting with scared 
                              hand)
                        It’s a honor sir.

           John Wayne salutes back with his untouched hand. And then 
           strides down the hall.

           Finally stopping at the MASSIVE two sided doors, which open 
           too... 

           --House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) lead by 
           Senator Joseph McCarthy.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE - SENATE 

           John Wayne stares down at his hands, flexing his fingers, 
           pondering his next move. He makes the decision and looks up 
           at SENATOR MCCARTHY (50s).

           Behind John Wayne GOVERNOR RONALD REAGAN waits his turn to 
           speak next.

                                 SENATOR MCCARTHY
                        So you believe these screenwriters 
                        are communists instigators?

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Yes. We have exposed their agenda, 
                        and hopefully protected the soul of 
                        our imagination. 

           Massive cheers.

           Ronald Reagan watches John Wayne like a con man watching a 
           mark.  Just like how John Wayne watched Yakima Canutt.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Our enemies want us to disrespect 
                        our God and our Flag. But not on my 
                        watch. I will aid this committee in 
                        any way I can. We will stamp out 
                        the communist threat. We must lock 
                        up any communist members or 
                        sympathizers.
                             (beat)
                        We are going to preserve American 
                        greatness!

           John Wayne leans back in his chair as the bulbs flash and the 
           lenses expand. 
           Governor Reagan walks over and claps John Wayne on the back, 
           holding the pose. Absorbing the cameras and beginning his 
           political marriage with American Exceptionalism.

                                 SENATOR MCCARTHY
                        Thank you, Mr. Wayne. America needs 
                        heroes like you now more than ever. 
                        Men who represent our values and 
                        our strength.

           John Wayne eagerly embraces the approval but then he feels a 
           unease overtake him. He looks behind and sees...

           --John Ford. Sitting in the back row. Like a phantom.

           PRE LAP: Water rushing from a FAUCET.

           INT. BATHROOM - SENATE - MOMENTS LATER

           John Wayne walks in. John Ford is washing his hands.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Why’d you come down here?

                                 JOHN FORD
                        To see who you’re pretending to 
                        be... this time.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Why did you show up at the 
                        Directors Guild? How could you do 
                        that to me?

           Ford reaches out with wet hands. John Wayne instinctively 
           grabs him a towel.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        The same reason I banished you to 
                        poverty row twenty years ago. You 
                        stepped out with a different 
                        director.

           Ford pats down his hands, hands the dirty towel to John 
           Wayne.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        I’ve worked with other directors--

                                 JOHN FORD
                        --You hitched your persona, what we 
                        created together, to DeMille’s 
                        cause. I didn’t breed a stallion 
                        for another man to ride it.
           And with that Ford walks out of the bathroom. Leaving John 
           Wayne holding his dirty towel.

                                                                CUT TO:

           We are back in the Cathedral. Michael picks up a ruined prop 
           rifle from the ground as the storm rages outside.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        Ford created John Wayne because he 
                        couldn’t stand what he was, and my 
                        father couldn’t stand John Wayne 
                        because no man can measure up to a 
                        legend.

                        But Ford would direct Wayne in The 
                        Searchers only two years later--

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        --Did he?

                        I don’t follow.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        I would love to expose Ford, but if 
                        the truth came out. It would 
                        destroy my father -- He showed up 
                        to the set of The Searchers 'cause 
                        whatever Ford does to him, he’ll 
                        always show up for my Godfather.

                        John Ford is your Godfather?

           Peter stares at the storm as it wrecks havoc on the set. 

           John Wayne is in the thick of it. Helping to tie things down, 
           get people indoors.

           Peter goes to his DAMAGED AUTOMOBILE.

                        Leaving so soon pilgrim?

           Peter turns and John Wayne is in front of him, the storm on 
           top of them.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                             (yelling)
                        Yes... Thank you for your time.
                        What I’ve heard, can I print?

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Ford wanted you to know. Now you 
                        know. But if you print it. I’ll 
                        attack you with everything I got.

           Peter is surprised by this.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Even after everything he did--

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        --What he did was give me a career.

           John Wayne extends his hand

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Best of luck with The Alamo, sir.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        My career started with a flop, hell 
                        sorta fits I go out on one.

           And like that he’s off. The horses are spooked.

           INT. CADILLAC ELDORADO SEVILLE - STORM

           Peter, absolutely soaked, drives through the town. Unable to 
           shake a feeling. What the hell happened on the set of The 
           Searchers that's a bigger secret than Ford’s homosexuality or 
           Wayne’s battered patriotism?
           INT. CHECK IN - AIRPORT

           Peter is deep in thought. Grabs his ticket.

           INT. SEAT - TWA PLANE - NIGHT

           Peter is cramped in the middle seat. Between TWO OBESE 
           TEXANS. He doesn’t notice. He can’t stop thinking.

           EXT. CURB - NEW YORK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - MORNING

           Polly Platt waits for Peter by the car, with TAXIS pulling in 
           and out around her.

           She kisses him. Her eyes are closed, his are open, and then 
           it hits him.

           INT. YELLOW TAXI - MOMENTS LATER

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        I need to speak with Robert 
                        Montgomery.

                                 POLLY PLATT 
                        You just landed -- Who is Robert 
                        Montgomery?

           Peter doesn’t have time to argue. He jumps out and runs back 
           into the airport.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROBERT MONTGOMERY’S HOME - LOS ANGELES - DAY

           A BROWN TAXI pulls up. 

                                 ESQUIRE REPORTER (V.O.)
                        How’s the book coming?

           Peter gets out.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH (V.O.)
                        It’s expanding. I need two favors. 
                        I’ll pay for both. An address and 
                        the real reason studios wouldn't 
                        finance The Alamo.

                                 ESQUIRE REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Who says there’s a “real reason”.
                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH (V.O.)
                        I just did.

           EXT. ROBERT MONTGOMERY’S POOL - LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Peter and Montgomery sit drinking in the California sun.

                                 ROBERT MONTGOMERY
                        --Of course, ask away. I remember 
                        that film with great fondness.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        I want to talk about when John Ford 
                        injured himself.

                                 ROBERT MONTGOMERY
                        Yeah, terrible fall--

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        --And you took over directing?

                                 ROBERT MONTGOMERY
                        Yes. My first time actually--

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        --And Ford was very complimentary, 
                        which allowed you to direct five 
                        feature films after?

                                 ROBERT MONTGOMERY
                        Yes. An actor’s looks fade. Never 
                        hurts to have a backup plan.
                             (suspiciously)
                        What’s this all about?

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Have you heard of the Auteur 
                        theory?

                                 ROBERT MONTGOMERY
                        No.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        It just came out of the French New 
                        Wave. Specifically two cinema 
                        critics, Francis Truffaut and Jean 
                        Luc Godard. 

           Montgomery joyful demeanor snaps into suspicion.
                                 ROBERT MONTGOMERY
                        I don’t know what some pretentious 
                        journalists have to do with John 
                        Ford or The Searchers, but I’ll 
                        kindly ask you to leave.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        That’s fine.

           Peter slowly finishes his drink and stands up. Peter knows 
           how to reel people in. He waits for Montgomery to ask him.

                                 ROBERT MONTGOMERY
                        You’re not going to tell me what 
                        this silly Auteur theory means?

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        It argues that the director is the 
                        singular author of a film. The 
                        fundamental visual elements as in 
                        relation to camera placement, 
                        blocking, lighting and scene length 
                        rather than plot line. It asserts 
                        that every film is a fingerprint of 
                        its director.

           Peter walks away.

                                 ROBERT MONTGOMERY
                        You wouldn’t!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JOHN FORD’S ESTATE - DAY

           Peter knocks on the door.

           PATRICK FORD (30s) answers. Stiff drink in his hand. Clearly 
           not the first of the day.

                                 PATRICK FORD
                        Who the fuck are you?

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Peter Bogdanovich.

                                 PATRICK FORD
                        Never heard of you.

           The door is slammed in Peters’ face.

           Peter knocks again.
                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        I know what happened on The 
                        Searchers.

           The door slowly opens.

                                 PATRICK FORD
                        By all means. Come in.

           INT. PARLOR - JOHN FORD’S ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER

           Patrick pours himself and Peter a drink. 

           We see no sign of John Ford’s iconic career, only photos of 
           his military service.

                                 PATRICK FORD
                             (nonchalantly)
                        My father is presently recovering 
                        from a drinking binge.

           Peter admires a photo.

           CU: Patrick and John Ford in navy uniforms.

           Patrick settles into a large chair.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Did you serve?

           Patrick winces at the word, revealing a sliver of a pain.

                                 PATRICK FORD
                        No. My father had a uniform made 
                        for me. But I did work on The 
                        Searchers. So tell me Mr. 
                        Bogdanovich, what happened?

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Its common knowledge that Ford 
                        injured his leg on the set of They 
                        Were Expendable--

                                 PATRICK FORD
                        --And Robert Montgomery kept the 
                        picture afloat.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Robert Montgomery didn’t direct a 
                        single shot of that film.

           Patrick laughs, soaking into the chair.
                                 PATRICK FORD
                        Clever...

           EXT. CABIN - SET OF “THE SEARCHERS” - MONUMENT VALLEY - 1956

           A WOMAN’S silhouette hangs in a doorway. She is compelled 
           onto her porch and scans the yellow and red frontier.

           ETHAN EDWARDS approaches on horseback. He carries a SABRE 
           from a LOST WAR and slowly trots towards her. She takes him 
           in, his battle hardened solitude. His deep inner pain.

                                 WOMAN
                        Welcome home Ethan.

           Ethan dismounts, his BROTHER walks onto the porch and steps 
           towards him. They awkwardly shake hands. 

           Ethan moves towards the Woman, his brother’s wife. He kisses 
           her on the forehead. A fleeting moment of intimacy in a 
           forbidden love.

           John Ford watches this doomed romance from his directors 
           chair with rapture, and then when it looks like he might cry--

                                 JOHN FORD 
                        CUT! Set for interior.

           The moment is broken and the CREW buzz through.

           TITLE: SET OF THE SEARCHERS - 1956

           John Wayne moves towards the Cabin. Ford stops him.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        It’s almost like you can act.

           John Wayne smiles and accepts the rare compliment.

           John Wayne sits on his horse. Ward Bond is next to him. They 
           are drenched in sweat. They have been waiting in the heat for 
           hours.

           John Wayne stares at the FORTY INDIAN EXTRAS across the lake. 
           One of them falls off his HORSE and hits the ground... heat 
           exhaustion. 
                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        When did you last see him?

                        We’ll just have to wait and hope he 
                        sobers up.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        How long have you worked for Coach?

                        So have most of the crew. Everyone 
                        knows what a John Ford picture 
                        looks like.
                             (adjusts his saddle)
                        What it feels like.

           Ward Bond turns to John Wayne. Is he saying what he thinks 
           he’s saying?

                                                                CUT TO:

           Peter stands up.

           Peter walks down the creaking wooden floor. John Ford’s 
           bedroom door is slightly ajar.

                                 MARY FORD (O.S.)
                        Mr. Bogdanovich. A word.

           Peter turns and see’s Mary standing in a room flanked by her 
           husbands trophies and accomplishments.
           INT. JOHN FORD’S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER

           Peter walks in. Mary’s back is turned towards him. But he can 
           see what she’s holding. A photo of Ford campaigning for 
           Richard Nixon. Shaking hands at a rally. 

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        If he knew what he was. Would he 
                        really shake his hand?

           Beat.

                                 MARY FORD
                        Which one?

           She places down the picture and moves to Peter.

                        Why did he allow me to go?

                                 MARY FORD
                        My husband sent you to John Wayne 
                        because he thinks of himself as a 
                        fraud. 
                             (past Ford’s oscar’s)
                        And all frauds fear and desire

                        everyday you’re told your best work 
                        is another man’s forgery.

                        Marion wasn’t a forger. He was an 
                        apprentice.

           Mary takes Peter’s hands.

                                 MARY FORD
                        I hope your wise enough to realize 
                        the wounds you discovered won’t be 
                        cleaned by exposure.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Maybe for them. 

           Peter pushes his hands away.

                                 MARY FORD
                        They do love each other. 
                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH 
                             (walking out)
                        Hell of a way of showing it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - JOHN FORD’S ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER

           John Ford alone, lying in bed, wheezing, while lighting a 
           cigar with his GOLD LIGHTER. Peter enters.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        I can tell by the look on your face 
                        Duke told you.
                             (long inhale)
                        After everything, I did for him. 

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        You sent me to test him. He passed.

           This surprises Ford.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH (CONT’D)
                        I figured it out myself. John Wayne 
                        directed They Were Expendable when 
                        you mutilated yourself.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Who gives a damn well fuck? It’s a 
                        segment of one of my lesser works. 
                        If it’s Robert or it’s Duke--

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        --But why would you lie?
                             (beat)
                        Because John Wayne directed the 
                        majority of The Searchers. You can 
                        deal with people thinking you’re a 
                        drunk, a bully or even gossip that 
                        you’re queer, but the one thing you 
                        can’t handle is the reality that 
                        you were blackout drunk for the 
                        shoot of your signature work. 
                        Asleep in your chair most days. 
                        Duke stepped up. And that’s why he 
                        thought he could handle The Alamo 
                        and you thought so too, that's why 
                        you cut his studio financing.

                                 JOHN FORD
                             (terrified)
                        Will you tell anyone?
                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        No. Your secret is safe. Without 
                        Duke’s support. Who would believe 
                        me?

           Peter walks to the door but pauses. One last question for the 
           great man.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH (CONT’D)
                        Duke’s always been loyal to you. 
                        And your just gonna leave him to 
                        bleed out like this?

           Ford just lies their. Unable or unwilling to answer.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH (CONT’D)
                        You really are a rotten son of a 
                        bitch.

           Peter leaves.

           Ford starts wheezing in panic, he latches onto his cigar, but 
           it’s out. He reaches for his GOLD LIGHTER, it’s atop a 
           VARIETY NEWSPAPER.

           CU: John Wayne’s Tragic Last Stand at The Alamo.

           Ford gently picks it up.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SET OF “THE ALAMO” - SUNSET

           John Wayne stares at the CATHEDRAL. 

           The sun is setting. Perfect light. Just taunting him.

           Michael Wayne walks over to him. 

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        They’ll pick us up tomorrow. 
                        Contractors will come and tear down 
                        the sets the day after.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Glad to be done with it.

           John Wayne tries to shrug it off. But Michael can see this 
           kills him.

           Then Michael spots a WAGON in the distance.
                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        Who the hell is that?

           John Wayne walks towards his quarters.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                             (without looking back)
                        Maybe it’s the contractors.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE
                        Don’t think so. They are coming 
                        from the East.

           John Wayne stops cold when he hears the word East.

                                 MICHAEL WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        No one comes from the East. There 
                        ain’t nothing out there.

           John Wayne turns and looks to the distance.

           And then he see’s it... 

           John Ford atop a Wagon, light hitting him perfectly.

           John Wayne smiles for the first time on the set of The Alamo.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        The hero always comes with the 
                        light.
                             (beat)
                        Always

           In this moment Ford is finally John Wayne. The hero charging 
           into battle to save his friend.

           Behind him hundreds of HORSES and EXTRAS follow.

           THE CAVALRY HAS ARRIVED.

           Ford’s Wagon roars onto set.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Duke, is that you?

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Yes, Coach.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        You directing a picture?

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        That was the plan.
                                 JOHN FORD
                        Is it a small picture?

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        It was meant to be an American Epic 
                        actually.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Well then, you’ll need an army!

           And right on cue The Horses and Extras swarm around them.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Hope you don’t mind I brought mine!

           Ford’s Tribe. An honest pay for an honest day’s work.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JOHN WAYNE’S QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

           John Wayne is helping Ford into the room.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        I can’t tell you how relieved I am 
                        to have ya here Coach.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Good. I...

           So many unspoken words, and both such poor communicators.

           John Ford sits on the bed.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        Give me a moment to rest before I 
                        give my performance.

           John Wayne doesn’t catch on.

                                 JOHN FORD (CONT’D)
                        On this picture, I’m the actor 
                        Duke, and you’re the director.
                             (beat)
                        A director is a leader, and crew 
                        can smell fear. You gotta put the 
                        fear of God into them, and there’s 
                        only one way to do it.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. JOHN WAYNE’S QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

           John Ford storms out. Drawing the crews attention to him.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        Who the fuck do you think you are?!

           John Wayne walks out calmly.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        I’m the director.

                                 JOHN FORD
                        You son of a bitch!

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Look here, this picture is gonna be 
                        made, and it’s gonna be made my 
                        way. So you can stay or ya can 
                        leave.

           Ford bitterly kicks the dirt. John Wayne walks over to his 
           CAMERA MAN.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Look, I don’t want to embarrass the 
                        old man too much. So why don’t we 
                        send him out with the second unit. 
                        We won’t use it, but it’ll make him 
                        feel involved.

           The men are in awe. John Wayne doesn’t need the Great John 
           Ford.

           The Camera Man walks over to Ford.

           John Wayne smoothly mounts his horse. Then twists to face the  
           hundreds of EXTRAS.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Alight, I think everyone has had 
                        enough rest for a lifetime. Get on 
                        your horses. Cue the canons and set 
                        the explosives. 

           John Wayne stretches his hands out wide.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Half of you start charging from the 
                        Eastern ridge, the other the 
                        West...
           John Ford has preserved his John Wayne. The legend is 
           secure...

                                                              SMASH CUT

           INT. JOHN WAYNE’S ESTATE - MORNING

           John Wayne, (63) stares at his vanity as he struggles to put 
           on a dress shirt, revealing a grizzly scar across his breast. 
           A battle wound from lung cancer. 

           Above the vanity, a framed variety cover reads...

           “John Wayne saves The Alamo.”

           Wayne picks up CUFF LINKS from his dresser. Which are 
           sandwiched between his 1969 OSCAR and a photo of him 
           celebrating that Oscar with John Ford.

           TITLE: 1971 - NEWPORT BEACH

           He starts aggressively coughing.

           EXT. JOHN WAYNE’S ESTATE - MORNING

           A CONVERTIBLE pulls up and Peter Bogdanovich, (30s) steps 
           out. Still a cinephile but no longer an aspiring artist. He 
           walks with the confidence of a man who has proven who he is.

           He rings the doorbell. A member of STAFF appears and politely 
           directs him to the dock.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JOHN WAYNE’S DOCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Peter walks towards WILD GOOSE II. A vessel even grander than 
           Ford’s. He arrives and takes a long looks at himself in the 
           glass window. Peter fiddles with his hair. 

                                 JOHN WAYNE (O.S.)
                             (calling out)
                        Are you gonna beautify yourself all 
                        day or come aboard?

           Peter laughs at himself as a CREW MEMBER offers his hand onto 
           Wild Goose II. 
           EXT. UPPER DECK - WILD GOOSE II - MOMENTS LATER

           John Wayne is holding court on the phone while cracking open 
           the first Dungeness Crab of the season. He is performing. The 
           role is healthy.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                             (as Peter approaches)
                        I’ll have to call you back.

           Wayne slams the phone down with vigor.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        That was the Congolese Ambassador.
                             (standing up)
                        Making sure my minerals rights are 
                        being handled correctly.

           They shake hands.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        Good to see you.

           INT. CAPTAIN’S CABIN - WILD GOOSE II - AFTERNOON

           John Wayne and Peter are enjoying their third glass of 
           Tequila. In a cabin that looks eerily similar to Ford’s. 

           The walls are lined with photos of John Wayne’s legendary 
           career. Which means John Ford is all around them.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                             (imitating Ford)
                        --A running horse remains one of 
                        the finest subjects for a movie 
                        camera.

           Both men laugh. But John Wayne looks distant...

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Can I ask you a question about The

                             (refocusing)
                        One last time.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Why’d you keep Ford’s secret?
                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Because he made me John Wayne.
                             (beat)
                        Why’d you?

           Peter pauses. Questioning himself. Finally.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        In Hollywood. When the legend 
                        becomes fact. Print the legend.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        You don’t sound like much of a  
                        critic.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                             (proudly)
                        This is my final assignment. I’m in 
                        post of my first feature. The Last 
                        Picture Show.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                             (smiling)
                        The sun even shines on a dogs ass.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        I was surprised you asked for me.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        If I’m going to be interviewed by a 
                        smut peddler. Might as well be one 
                        I can trust.

           Peter takes out his RECORDING DEVICE.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        You ready to start?

           John Wayne nods. Rubs his chest and then catches himself.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH (CONT’D)
                             (speaking into the device)
                        John Wayne Playboy Interview 1971.
                             (beat)
                        So Duke, how do you feel about the 
                        state of the motion-picture 
                        business--

           --John Wayne coughs but collects himself. He waves Peter to 
           continue with his question.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?
                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        I’m terrific. You were saying about 
                        the state of--

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        --Yes, the state of the motion-
                        picture business today.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Well, these business types remind 
                        me of high-class whores. 
                        Specifically that son of a bitch 
                        Darryl Zanuck.

           Peter laughs but catches himself. 

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Do you think you’ve made the list 
                        of Top Ten box-office attractions 
                        for 19 consecutive years in spite 
                        of your political views?

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        No question. Just because I don't 
                        want somebody like Angela Davis 
                        inculcating an enemy doctrine in my 
                        kids' minds I’m some sorta pariah.

           Peter is taken aback.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Angela Davis would argue those who 
                        would revoke her teaching 
                        credentials on ideological grounds 
                        are actually discriminating against 
                        her because she's black.

           John Wayne doubles down.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        Look, with a lot of blacks, there's 
                        quite a bit of resentment along 
                        with their dissent, and possibly 
                        rightfully so. But we can't all of 
                        a sudden get down on our knees and 
                        turn everything over to the 
                        leadership of the blacks.

           Peter reaches to turn off the recorder but John Wayne waves 
           him off. 
                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        That being said I think any black 
                        who can compete with a white today 
                        can get a better break than a white 
                        man. I wish they'd tell me where in 
                        the world they have it better than 
                        right here in America!

           John Wayne finishes his glass of Tequila and pours himself 
           another. He chops ice of a large block.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                             (per the ice)
                        Got some from our last voyage up to 
                        Alaska.

           John Wayne tries to suppress it but let’s out a painful 
           wheezing cough.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Maybe I should come back when your 
                        feeling better?

           This only fuels John Wayne to continue.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                             (regaining his breathing)
                        Hell no.

           Peter reluctantly stays seated.

                                 JOHN WAYNE (CONT’D)
                        No more question’s about politics. 
                        I thought this was a gentleman’s 
                        publication.

           Peter flicks through his notepad. Scanning questions.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Let’s get back to entertainment. 
                        Are you a fan of the current crop 
                        of films--

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        --No I am not. Perverted and un-
                        American.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Such as?

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        How about those two men in Midnight 
                        Cowboy?! a story about two fags 
                        doesn’t qualify as perverted?
           Peter wonders if John Wayne is acting or, at this point, 
           there is a difference between the persona and the man. 

           Peter points to a black & white photograph of John Ford and 
           John Wayne embracing on the set of The Alamo.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        What do you say to people who call 
                        your Oscar winning performance of 
                        the one eyed Rooster Colburn in 
                        True Grit a “love letter” to John 
                        Ford?

           John Wayne doesn’t like the question and scrunches his face.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                        I should have won for Iwa Jima. 
                        General MacArthur told me, “You 
                        represent the American servicemen 
                        better than the American Servicemen 
                        himself.” But I don’t need an 
                        Oscar. I’m a box office champion 
                        with a record they’re going to have 
                        to run to catch. And they won’t.

           Peter slowly nods.

                                 PETER BOGDANOVICH
                        Is that the legacy you hope to 
                        leave behind? The greatest movie 
                        star of all time?

           John Wayne takes a large pull from his fresh drink.

                                 JOHN WAYNE
                             (confidently)
                        Well, you're going to think I'm 
                        being corny, but this is how I 
                        really feel: I hope my family and 
                        my friends will be able to say that 
                        I was an honest, kind and fairly 
                        decent man.
                             (self-consciously)
                        What do you think?

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:
           SCROLL TEXT:

           IN 2016, Donald Trump would seek out and obtain John Wayne’s 
           family endorsement for President. He would base his campaign 
           on Ronald Reagan slogan, “LET’S MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN” 
           which Reagan took from John Wayne’s McCarthy Testimony. 

           When polled, the number one reason Americans voted for 
           Trump...

           “He’s a Strong Man.”

                                  THE END
