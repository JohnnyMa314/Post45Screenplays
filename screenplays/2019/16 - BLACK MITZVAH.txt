                  BLACK MITZVAH 

          BLACK UNICORN  
          noun  \ˈblak\ uni·corn 
          1 : A black suburban person. A suburbanite so rare, it’s like spotting a live unicorn.  
          2: See one North West. A Calabasas dwelling black unicorn and Phoebe Johnson’s style icon.  

           Phoebe Johnson is a black unicorn and so am I. I grew up on the North Shore of Chicago— 
          the same cluster of suburbs that inspired Tina Fey’s “Mean Girls.” To say Fey’s depiction of my 
          hometown was an exaggeration would be a lie. In fact, a teacher really did confuse me for a 
          transfer student from Kenya—who incidentally ended up being a white girl named Chanel…  

           The suburb I grew up in was mostly white, wealthy, and Jewish. That makes me a black 
          person who truly can recite “Baruch Atah Adonai” as fast as I can recite “Fuck Tha Police.” 

           All of these characters are inspired by real people. The kids I grew up with were very 
          raunchy, ratchet, entitled, and bored. Think blow jobs and rehab in seventh grade. Kylie Cohen? 
          Well, she grew up to become friends with Lindsay Lohan… at a time when nobody should admit to 
          being friends with Lindsay Lohan. That should tell you everything you need to know. 

           BLACK MITZVAH is a coming-of-age story about a black pre-teen trying to figure out who 
          she is in a sea of chaos. This is the kind of intersectional comedy I wish I had growing up… to show 
          that there were other black girls figuring out how to maintain their identities in places where no-
          body wants them to be who they are. Instead of movies (which had mostly white leads), I had 
          Kanye West to teach me those things…  

           Rap signified confidence at times in my life when I didn’t have it. Friends and crushes 
          weren’t always in my vocabulary. Kanye’s presence in rap (with his pink polo and backpack) 
          helped show that black people aren’t monolithic. Especially to the white kids asking me how my 
          life was growing up fatherless… My parents have been married for over thirty years. Oy… 

           Kanye’s ego was the steam I used to power my own dreams. Being a fan of (old) Kanye 
          helped make me a fan of myself. He had me at “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.” 
          Little did I know, he’d grow up to become a Kardashian and inspire the documentary “Get Out.” 
          Say what you want about him now, he helped me at a time when all the kids around me were 
          telling me not to believe in myself: “You can’t be smart, you can’t get into a top 10 college, your 
          dad can’t be a doctor, you can’t live in that house, you can’t be on the same level as us.” Or as 
          they say in “Mean Girls:” “You can’t sit with us.”  

           Kanye’s music made me believe I could sit anywhere I want. And my parents made me be-
          lieve if I worked hard enough, I really could. Being black is exhausting. Becoming a Bat Mitzvah 
          isn’t just about becoming a woman for Phoebe, it’s also about accepting who she is… a black 
          woman who doesn’t need the validation of others to believe in herself. Kinda sorta like Kanye or 
          Drake’s rap personas… Whether or not a rapper like Drake or Kanye agrees to do this movie, think 
          of Kanye as a placeholder. He’s a character that represents the ego Phoebe needs as the steam to 
          power her dreams… and gain the confidence she needs to maintain her sense of self as the only 
          black kid in a white environment. Even (new) Kanye would toast to that. L’chaim. 
           Over black, we hear a pre-pubescent male voice. 

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        This is so low budget. It looks 
                        like a sex tape. Not that I would 
                        know what a sex tape looks like... 

                                 PHOEBE (O.S.)
                        Your finger’s on the lens!

           INT. MIKE SCHWARTZ’S BEDROOM - DAY 

           A finger is removed from the camera lens. Now all we see is a 
           camera pointed at some KID’S blurry shirt. 

                                 PHOEBE (O.S.)
                        And it’s pointed at yourself.

           The camera spins around while the voice keeps talking. 

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Confession. My cousin may have left 
                        some pictures of tits open on his 
                        laptop...and I may have 
                        looked...but it wasn’t porn porn...

           After some shaky cam, PHOEBE JOHNSON (black, dope AF 13 year 
           old, awkward but thinks she’s cool) comes into focus.

           She stares directly at the camera. Looks annoyed. 

                                 MIKE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m lying. It was porn. I can’t 
                        unsee it. It feels great to get 
                        that off my chest. Like the cum--

                                 PHOEBE
                        Mike! I don’t know why you feel so 
                        comfortable being yourself around 
                        me, but you need to hide some of 
                        that like you do with other people. 

           CHYRON: This is Phoebe. 13. The year is 2016. 

           Phoebe looks nervous. We hear ADULT PHOEBE’S (think Jessica 
           Williams) voice. 

                                 ADULT PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        Dear Phoebe, it’s me. Phoebe. Right 
                        now, you’re almost 13 and this is 
                        an important year for you. It’s the 
                        year of your Bat Mitzvah... 
           Phoebe fixes her hair. Puts some lip gloss on. Checks her 
           reflection in her phone’s camera.

           INSERT: FAMILY ALBUM

           It’s Phoebe’s family album. Speed flip through photos of 
           Phoebe’s family. Hanukkahs. Shabbat dinners. Passover Seders. 

                                 ADULT PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        Quick pause to explain. Long story 
                        short. Your mom is Jewish. Like 
                        Drake’s mom. And your dad 
                        converted...like Sammy Davis Jr... 
                        Your being black and Jewish 
                        confuses a lot of people... A lot 
                        of things confuse you too... like 
                        why white people whisper things 
                        they think are offensive to make 
                        them sound less offensive. 

           SHOT SERIES 

                                 ADULT PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        Take history class, for example. 

           -A TEACHER stands before the class. Phoebe sits in the front. 

                                 TEACHER 
                        Today we’re going to learn about...
                             (whispers while looking at 
                              Phoebe)
                        ...Slavery. 

           Everyone looks directly at Phoebe who shrinks into her seat. 

                                 ADULT PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        Or chorus...

           - A bunch of WHITE KIDS singing an a cappella version of “New 
           Slaves.” They whisper the word “ninja.” 

           Phoebe’s in the center of the chorus. She’s not singing. 

                                 WHITE KID CHORUS
                        Doin’ clothes you woulda thought I 
                        had help/ But they wasn’t satisfied 
                        unless I picked the cotton myself/ 
                        You see it’s broke ninja racism...

           The CHORUS TEACHER looks moved. He’s standing in front of an 
           African-American history month banner and wearing Kente 
           cloth. It looks as ridiculous as it sounds. 
                                 ADULT PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        And last but not least, the first 
                        day back from spring break... 

           -KYLIE COHEN (12, white) enters the classroom in 
           inappropriate clothes, sporting a tropical tan and the braids 
           with beads that white kids love to get when they go to 
           Mexico. She places her arm against Phoebe’s. 

                                 KYLIE
                        Oh my God. I’m like tanner than 
                        you. I win. I look...
                             (whispers)
                        Black.

           Kylie’s now comparing tans with her posse-- white girls with 
           identical braids and tropical tans. Off Phoebe’s look...

                                 ADULT PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        And anytime you express irritation 
                        with any of this, you’re hit 
                        with...

           -A WHITE GIRL (12) looks straight to camera, interview style. 
           She’s standing in front of lockers.  

                                 WHITE GIRL
                        What’s your problem, Phoebe? It’s 
                        not like you’re... 
                             (whispers)
                        ...Black, black. 

                                 ADULT PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        Sigh. But as Larry Johnson always 
                        says, everybody got haters...it’s 
                        how you stunt on em’ that matters.

           EXT. PHOEBE’S HOUSE - PAST 

           Birdman and Lil Wayne’s “Stuntin’ Like My Daddy” plays as 
           Phoebe’s dad, LARRY (40s, black, think Dave Chappelle) pulls 
           out of the garage in a black Range Rover Sport. 

           Toddler Phoebe pulls out after him in a mini Range Rover 
           Power Wheels version. They nod at each other, then put their 
           sunglasses on at the same time. 

           Phoebe peels out onto the sidewalk when... A WHITE TODDLER 
           pulls out in a COP CAR and blares his siren at Phoebe. It 
           looks like a high speed chase. 

           Toddler Phoebe speeds up and flips him off. 
           We pan out to see how slowly they’re actually going.

           As Phoebe rounds the corner, we see her Power Wheels has a 
           license plate that reads “F*CK Tha Police.”

                                 ADULT PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        As you enter womanhood, there’s 
                        only one thing you want more than 
                        anything in the world. And that’s 
                        for one Kanye West to attend your 
                        Bat Mitzvah... Don’t worry. Obama 
                        was still president. And the only 
                        time Kanye has mentioned Trump was 
                        in a song lyric.

           INT. MIKE SCHWARTZ’S BEDROOM - DAY 

           Phoebe takes a deep breath. She’s wearing grills. 

           CAMERA’S PERSPECTIVE

                                 PHOEBE 
                             (beat, then)
                        Dear Kanye, I can’t talk in 
                        these...

           She pops the grills out. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        Dear Kanye, my name is Phoebe. 
                        Please come to my Bat Mitzvah. 
                        Also, sorry about my participation 
                        in 6th grade chorus. That teacher 
                        got fired. Well not for racism, for 
                        butt grabbing teachers. They didn’t 
                        care about the racism.

           ESTHER (20s, think Awkwafina) steps into frame, blocking 
           Phoebe. We’re extremely close on Esther’s face. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Kanye ain’t coming to your party 
                        unless you were a Make-A-Wish kid 
                        or something. 

           We pan out into Mike’s room. Typical pre-teen shit. Photos of 
           Ariana Grande, Lebron, etc, etc. MIKE SCHWARTZ (13, thinks 
           he’s got swag, but doesn’t) turns off the camera. 

                                 MIKE
                        God, Esther, don’t you knock? 
                                 ESTHER
                        No. What would I look like 
                        knocking? You could be making 
                        pornos in here which is all types 
                        of illegal. 
                             (beat, then)
                        Do I look like a middle-aged 
                        housewife that doesn’t care if her 
                        kids drink in the house to you?

                                 MIKE
                        No one’s making porn!

                                 PHOEBE
                        Yeah. What’s wrong with you? 

                                 ESTHER
                        I’m still babysitting in my late 
                        20s. That’s what’s wrong with me. 
                        Phoebe, it’s time to go. 

           Phoebe collects her stuff.

                                 MIKE
                        Esther won’t make you leave. 

           Esther throws a tube of ointment over to Mike. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Your mom told me to remind you to 
                        use this butt cream on your 
                        hemorrhoids. 

                                 MIKE
                        Damn it Esther! Have some chill! 

           Phoebe laughs as she walks out. Mike looks at the tube.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        This is Neosporin!

                                 ESTHER
                        Test my authority one more time, 
                        boy. 

           Mike looks out the window... Watches Phoebe crossing the lawn 
           over to her house. She waves to Mike before she walks inside. 

                                 ESTHER (CONT’D)
                        She got you more whipped than Cool 
                        Whip. 

                                 MIKE
                        Shut up. She’s like my sister...
           Off Mike looking out the window into the night...

           PRE-LAP: An alarm sounds. 

           INT. PHOEBE’S ROOM - DAY

           Phoebe wakes up and immediately checks her Facebook. There’s 
           an alert that 500 hundred people are attending Kylie Cohen’s 
           Bat Mitzvah. She groans. Opens insta. No likes. Stares at 
           pics of Kylie. 

           She flips to Youtube. We see she and Mike have made many 
           “Dear Kanye” videos. They all have zero views. She turns on 
           photo booth and starts recording herself. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Dear, Kanye. It’s me. Phoebe. 
                        Again. Please come to my Bat 
                        Mitzvah. I’ve been a fan since 2009 
                        when you interrupted Taylor Swift. 
                        I was only six, but I 
                        understood....

           Phoebe flips through Kylie’s expertly curated Insta. Phoebe’s

           PHOEBE’S HOUSE 2009

           A 6 year old Phoebe watches as Kanye interrupts Taylor’s 
           VMA’s acceptance speech. She’s transfixed by the moment. 

                                 PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        There’s this girl Kylie. She thinks 
                        she does everything better than me. 

           SCHOOL FAIR 2010 

           Phoebe stands proudly next to an intense volcano model -- it 
           even has lava oozing out of it. 

           Meanwhile, an 8-year-old Kylie pours vinegar into baking 
           soda. It fizzes. Kylie gets the blue ribbon. 

           Phoebe throws her volcano in the trash. It starts to melt the 
           trash can. It smokes. The fire alarm goes off. 

           A TEACHER glares at Phoebe. 
                                 PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        But really, Kylie’s just a girl 
                        with thin vocals who keeps on 
                        winning when she shouldn’t.  

           GYMNASTICS CLASS 2012 

           Phoebe does a flip off of the uneven bars. She plants her 
           feet proudly, only to find no one saw because everyone is 
           watching Kylie do a dinky cartwheel. Phoebe shakes her head. 

           PRESCHOOL 2007

                                 PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        Since pre-school, the girl has had 
                        it out for me... 

           GRASS

           TODDLER GIRLS who look like mini housewives play duck duck 
           goose in the grass. TODDLER KYLIE is the ringleader. 

                                 TODDLER PHOEBE
                             (approaching the group)
                        Can I play? 

                                 TODDLER KYLIE
                        No. 

           The girls cackle. PHOEBE turns to leave, looking on the verge 
           of tears. TODDLER CHASE approaches Phoebe. 

                                 TODDLER CHASE
                        You wanna play on the tire swing 
                        with me? 

                                 TODDLER PHOEBE
                        Sure, Chase.  

                                 PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        I should’ve known it was a trick, 
                        but I’ve been a hopeless romantic 
                        from an early age. 

           Phoebe skips over to the tire swing with Chase.  

           GRASS 

           Kylie sees Chase and Phoebe swinging on the tire swing, rage 
           in her toddler eyes. 

           TIRE SWING
           Phoebe and Chase are laughing and having fun. They lock eyes 
           and have a moment. 

                                 PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        I thought we had something when--

           Chase PUSHES her off the tire swing. 

                                 CHASE
                        Tag!

           Phoebe catches a mouth full of sand. Kylie and co. pelt 
           pebbles in Phoebe’s direction. Phoebe runs. 

                                 MINI HOUSEWIVES
                        Chase the African girl!

           Toddler Phoebe looks at the camera, confused. Freeze frame. 
           She spits out sand.  

                                 TODDLER PHOEBE
                        Why does everyone think I’m 
                        African?

           Older Phoebe enters the frame. Talks to younger Phoebe. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Good question mini-me. The point 
                        is, Kanye. You HAVE to come to my 
                        Bat Mitzvah. It’ll be the 
                        equivalent of interrupting Kylie on 
                        stage for me and--

           PRE-LAP: BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. 

           END SHOT SERIES

           INT. PHOEBE’S ROOM - DAY

           Phoebe is interrupted by tons of FACEBOOK NOTIFICATIONS about 
           Kylie’s party. She sighs. Shuts her laptop and goes back to 
           sleep, no fucks to give.

           Her mother, APRIL JOHNSON (think Tracee Ellis Ross, 40s) 
           enters the room holding a box of cupcakes.

                                 APRIL
                        Phoebe, how many times do I have to 
                        tell you to close the box? I can’t 
                        take these to my open house, 
                        they’re all crusty. 

           Phoebe lifts her head up slightly.
                                 PHOEBE
                        Sorry. I was stress eating. Just 
                        leave me here to die. 

                                 APRIL
                        You can’t die yet. I want 
                        grandchildren. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Five hundred people are going to 
                        Kylie Cohen’s Bat Mitzvah today. I 
                        don’t even know why I got invited. 
                        The girl hates me.
                             (beat, then)
                        How am I gonna measure up to that? 
                        I can’t even get a like on 
                        Instagram. 

           April puts the box down and pulls all the covers off of 
           Phoebe’s bed. 

                                 APRIL
                        I like you. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        You have to like me, you’re my mom.

           A beat. April picks up a cupcake and playfully smashes the 
           cupcake into Phoebe’s face. 

                                 APRIL
                        I don’t have to like you. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Mom!

           April smears more frosting on Phoebe’s face. 

                                 APRIL
                        Your face is as crusty as these 
                        cupcakes... Get dressed for the 
                        party! 

           Begrudgingly, Phoebe crosses towards the bathroom while 
           wiping frosting off her face, then SMEARS some on April. 

           Phoebe enters the bathroom smiling and shuts the door behind 
           her. April laughs. 

                                 APRIL (CONT’D)
                        I deserved that. 
           INT. PHOEBE’S BATHROOM - DAY 

           Phoebe’s brushing her teeth when her phone dings. She 
           excitedly checks it. One new notification on Instagram. 

           It’s a photo of Phoebe drinking a giant Frappuccino with 
           sunglasses on. It’s captioned “Thirst Trap.” 

           CHYRON: Comment from: Pop Goes De Chairy: 

                                 PRE-PUBESCENT BITCHY VOICE (V.O.)
                        Phoebe’s the kind of girl who wears 
                        pads because tampons are too much 
                        penetration for her.

           Phoebe puts her phone down. She looks at herself in the 
           mirror. Closes her eyes. Opens them. 

           KANYE WEST is looking back at her. 

                                 MIRROR KANYE 
                        If you’re a Kanye West fan, you’re 
                        not a fan of me. You’re a fan of 
                        yourself. You will believe in 
                        yourself. I’m just the espresso. 
                        I'm just the shot in the morning to 
                        get you going to make you believe 
                        you can overcome that situation 
                        that you're dealing with all the 
                        time.

           Phoebe opens her eyes. It’s her again. She smiles at herself 
           in the mirror. Grabs her phone. She deletes “Pop Goes De 
           Chairy’s” comment.

                                 PHOEBE 
                        Yeah. You’re my espresso. 

           Gives herself a pound on the chest. Ow. Boobs. Off Phoebe 
           grimacing... 

           INT./EXT. CAR - DAY

           Phoebe’s dad, Larry, is driving her to the Bat Mitzvah. 

                                 LARRY
                        You excited?

                                 PHOEBE
                        Not really. Nobody gets me. Josh 
                        said I’m not really black because I 
                        talk white and don’t wear FUBU. 
                                 LARRY
                        No one’s worn FUBU since 99’. 

           Phoebe doesn’t laugh. Stares sadly out of the window. A beat. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Do you know the ONLY time Sammy 
                        Davis Jr. didn’t wear his mezuzah 
                        around his neck, he got into a car 
                        accident and lost his eye? 

                                 PHOEBE
                        It’s supposed to go outside the 
                        door. 

                                 LARRY
                        Yeah, but he wore his around his 
                        neck because he thought it brought 
                        him luck. After the accident, he 
                        never left the house without it, 
                        then he researched and realized 
                        black people and Jewish people? 
                        Similar plight. So he converted. 
                        Said it was the most understood he 
                        ever felt. 
                             (beat, then)
                        And I thought to myself... that 
                        nigga might be on to something. 
                             (beat, then)
                        Don’t say nigga. Your mother will 
                        get mad. 

           Larry pulls out a mezuzah tucked behind his shirt. He takes 
           it off. Hands it to Phoebe. She takes it. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t let these white people tell 
                        you how to feel. 

           Phoebe smiles, distracting Larry from the road. He SLAMS the 
           brakes to avoid rear-ending the person in front of him. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Are you trying to kill us?!

                                 LARRY
                        Girl, gimme that mezuzah back. I’ll 
                        get you your own. 
           EXT. AM SHALOM TEMPLE - DAY

           KIDS line up for a shuttle bus. Phoebe exits Larry’s car. 
           She’s Bat Mitzvah chic and is carrying a mini clutch and a 
           blue Tiffany’s gift bag. 

           She immediately meets up with Mike who’s scanning the crowd. 

                                 MIKE 
                        Thank God. For a second, I thought 
                        I was gonna have to make small talk 
                        about Carol Goldman’s breast 
                        reduction and shit. 
                             (off Phoebe’s look)
                        I overheard Janice gossiping about 
                        it. Apparently, she’s much more 
                        balanced now. Meanwhile, Rochelle 
                        is sleeping with a trainer. He’s 
                        uncircumcised. She’s debating if he 
                        should have an adult Brit Milah... 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Does this dress make me look 
                        penetratable? 

                                 MIKE
                        Is that even a word? 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Fucking Dave De Chair. Just because 
                        he’s gay, he thinks he can say 
                        whatever he wants. 

           Phoebe and Mike are about to continue walking inside when 
           CHASE SMITH (13 year old heart throb) pulls up. 

           He exits his mom’s car, dressed in a suit. Phoebe is 
           mesmerized into a trance... Time slows... They lock eyes.

                                 MIKE
                        Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe! Ugh. He’s 
                        not even that hot. He’s so obsessed 
                        with his facial hair and chest 
                        hair. He has one chest hair. It 
                        looks like a pube sprout. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Did he smile at me? Or was he 
                        trying not to sneeze? Maybe he 
                        wants to hit this.

                                 MIKE
                        That sounds wrong. And, no. He just 
                        has a weird face. 
                                 PHOEBE
                        Hater. 

           Phoebe walks forward, still mesmerized when...BAM. Phoebe 
           bumps into a pole. 

                                 MIKE
                        Well, the pole wanted to hit that.

           INT. FANCY COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT 

           Kylie Cohen’s Bat Mitzvah reception is as lavish as a million 
           dollar wedding with ratchet sensibilities. 

           Think ice sculptures in the shape of gangsta dollar signs, a 
           million blown up selfies of Kylie, coffee table book 
           centerpieces called “THE BOOK OF KYLIE.” There’s even a video 
           montage of Kylie reinacting Nicki Minaj videos (Only, 
           Monster, etc). 

           There are BURLESQUE DANCERS, CIRQUE DU SOLEIL DANCERS, it’s 
           absurd. Kids pop bottles of Martinelli’s over the crowd. It’s 
           a wild night at the club for pre-teens.  

           Phoebe and Mike are sitting in the back next to the bar 
           sipping Shirley Temples. Phoebe slams her empty glass down. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Ugh. Look at all this. Her parents 
                        didn’t even make her have a service 
                        in front of everyone. 

           The BARTENDER (think Pete Davidson) shakes his head. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        I was a nerd too. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I’m not a nerd. 

           He slides them two huge glasses of Shirley Temples.

                                 BARTENDER
                        I still think about Timmy Rickson’s  
                        birthday party where they dunked my 
                        head in a toilet. But you know 
                        what? Timmy is an adult named Timmy 
                        and me? I’m a bartender. Women love 
                        bartenders. Well not all women. My 
                        girlfriend left me. Actually I 
                        caught her blowing my best friend, 
                        and then I told her to leave. And 
                        she said “ok.” And took my dog. 
           They back away from the bartender.

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        But it could be worse. I could be 
                        an adult named Timmy. 

           A DJ/HYPE WOMAN (think Tiffany Haddish) hypes the crowd. The 
           guests are playing an uncoordinated game of Coke, Pepsi.  

           A KID WITH A POPPED COLLAR approaches the booth. 

                                 POPPED COLLAR
                        You got some Migos?

           The Hype Woman plays Migos “Fight Night.” The WHITE KIDS go 
           wild! They form a mosh pit while YELLING. 

                                 KIDS
                        Broke niggas stand to the left. 

                                 HYPE WOMAN
                        Oh no. I don’t get paid enough for 
                        this. 

           She changes the song to One Direction’s “Night Changes.” 
           Everyone GROANS. 

                                 KIDS
                        MIGOS. MIGOS. MIGOS.

                                 HYPE PERSON
                        Y’all ruined it with your inability 
                        to keep slurs out yo mouths. It’s 
                        time for SNOWBALL! SO GRAB SOMEBODY 
                        AND SLOW DANCE. 

           Phoebe watches longingly as Kylie chooses Chase. 

           Phoebe and Mike look like they have a force field around 
           them. No one picks them. 

           A BOY approaches her. Her heart swells, palms sweat. Is this 
           what love feels like? 

                                 BOY
                        Hey, you’re blocking the kiddie 
                        cocktail line. 

           No. This is not what love feels like. She moves out of the 
           way. Continues to watch the slow dancing. Anxious. 

           As the song ends, Chase walks up to Phoebe. 
                                 CHASE
                        Hi, Phoebe. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I-- I-- 

                                 MIKE
                        Use your words. 

           She cuts Mike a look. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        You know my name. 

                                 CHASE
                        Of course. You’re the only--

                                 PHOEBE
                        Black girl. But I’m not the only 
                        one. It’s not my fault Chelseigh 
                        Grubbs’ white parents lied to her. 

           ANGLE ON: CHELSEIGH GRUBBS (12, black but doesn’t know it). 
           She’s hanging with Kylie and the rest of the COOL GIRLS. 

                                 KYLIE
                        Chels, where’d you get that spray 
                        tan? It’s to die. 

                                 CHELSEIGH 
                        Oh, I don’t spray tan. I’m just 
                        very hashtag blessed.

           Back to Phoebe and Chase. 

                                 CHASE
                        I thought Chelseigh was Italian.

                                 PHOEBE
                        Right. The H at the end of her name 
                        is as silent as her blackness. 

                                 CHASE
                        And I don’t know your name because 
                        you’re the only black girl. I know 
                        it because you were the only one 
                        who turned your science project 
                        into a rap sing along. 

           Chase smiles. Phoebe loses it, whispers to an annoyed Mike. 

                                 PHOEBE
                             (to Mike)
                        That’s a smile, right?!
                                 CHASE
                        You wanna get out of here? A bunch 
                        of us are gonna go outside and ride 
                        golf carts. 

                                 MIKE
                        Because that sounds fun...

                                 PHOEBE
                        Sure!
                             (then collects herself)
                        I mean, cool. Mike, you coming?

                                 MIKE
                        No, because I like to follow the 
                        rules! And that sounds like some 
                        whack ass shit. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Ok. Be right back. 

           Phoebe leaves a scandalized Mike behind. 

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT 

           A bunch of PARTY GUESTS are crowded around golf carts as 
           Phoebe and Chase walk out. Chase looks at Phoebe.

                                 CHASE
                        You wanna try? 
                             (off her look)
                        Golf cart drag race. 

           Phoebe laughs. Tries to be cool. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        May the best woman win. 

           She hops into the golf cart opposite Chase. One of the kids 
           counts down and Phoebe takes off. Chase’s cart won’t move. 
           The battery died. 

           Meanwhile...Phoebe’s cart CAREENS off the putting green into 
           a pond. She emerges from the water looking like a moss-
           covered swamp monster. Her blowout is now curly and drippy.

           Chelseigh and TALIA MEYERS (12, white) are CACKLING...next to 
           a stunned Chase...who is still in his golf cart. 

                                 TALIA
                        WTF happened to her hair?

           Phoebe watches as everyone laughs at her. 
                                 PHOEBE
                             (to self)
                        Why would he like you, Phoebe? 
                        Stupid. And now you’re talking to 
                        yourself which doesn’t help.

           She steels herself and blows past Chase who exits his golf 
           cart and runs after her. 

                                 TALIA
                        Why are you chasing after that 
                        troll? 

           INT. BAT MITZVAH - NIGHT

           Mike is back with the Bartender. 

                                 MIKE
                        So this Timmy dude, what does he do 
                        now? Something bad. Like an anal 
                        expresser at the dog groomer? 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Nah. He invented vape pens. His 
                        life is pretty lit. 

           Before Mike can respond, he sees Phoebe walking in looking 
           like the swamp monster. Everyone stares. Chase is following 
           her towards the dance floor but can’t catch up to her. 

                                 MIKE
                        Holy shit.

           STAGE

           Kylie is on stage giving a speech. 

                                 KYLIE
                        Thank all of you so much for 
                        coming...unless you gave me a check 
                        for exactly 18 dollars instead of 
                        some higher multiple of 18 dollars. 
                        All of the 18 dollar guests are 
                        currently being escorted out.

           EXIT 

           A BUNCH of ADULTS are indeed being escorted out by security. 

           STAGE
                                 KYLIE (CONT’D)
                        But the person I’d like to thank 
                        the most is...me...and...

           Phoebe is trying to stealthily cut through the party to the 
           bathroom. 

           Kylie SCREAMS at the sight of Phoebe. Focusing everyone’s 
           attention on her. Phoebe stands awkwardly at the center of 
           the dance floor as an enormous cake with Kylie’s picture on 
           it is wheeled out.

           Everyone gasps at the sight of her. Phoebe starts backing up 
           out of embarrassment and TRIPS into the cake, destroying it. 

           Kylie SCREAMS a maniacal cry. 

                                 KYLIE (CONT’D)
                        WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! 

           Talia and Chelseigh run in assessing the scene. 

                                 TALIA 
                        God, she is such a loser. I bet she 
                        has the world’s biggest bush. 

           They laugh harder. Phoebe’s eyes well up with tears. As Mike 
           runs over to help her up. 

                                 MIKE
                        I’d shade you for breaching social 
                        etiquette and leaving me earlier, 
                        but you’ve learned your lesson. 

           Phoebe is on the verge of sobbing. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Just act unbothered.

           Phoebe does her best unbothered look. Sticks her finger in 
           the cake. Puts it in her mouth. The crowd GAGS. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        This cake is delicious... 

                                 KYLIE
                        GET OUT. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Cool. Cool. Cool. Can I get a 
                        giveaway shirt since I need to 
                        change...
                                 KYLIE
                        GET OUT! YOU WEREN’T EVEN INVITED. 
                        YOUR MOM LITERALLY BEGGED MY MOM TO 
                        INVITE YOU BECAUSE YOU’RE SAD AND 
                        LONELY AND ONLY HAVE ONE FRIEND AND 
                        YOU’RE A LIP VIRGIN. 

           Everyone starts laughing. Even the SHALLOW PARENTS. 

           Chase starts heading in her direction. It’s too much for 
           Phoebe. She starts scrambling up but keeps slipping and 
           sliding in the cake. 

                                 KYLIE (CONT’D)
                        SECURITY! 

           Security comes and grabs Phoebe. Everyone is recording as 
           Phoebe is being carried out. 

                                 RANDOM PARTY KID
                        Snapchat, bitch. 

                                 ANOTHER RANDOM KID
                        Snapchat’s over. It’s going on 
                        Insta story. 

           Mike grabs some giveaway shirts and some food. Runs out. 

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY 

           Phoebe walks outside, she’s hyperventilating.

                                 PHOEBE
                        My life is over. I knew Kylie 
                        wouldn’t invite me on her own. My 
                        mom is such a yenta. 

                                 MIKE
                        Our life is over. We in this 
                        together. 

           Mike takes a bite of Bat Mitzvah leftovers when Esther pops 
           out of a bush. They scream. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I texted her to come get us. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Yo, I saw your epic fail on Insta 
                        story. I’m chaperoning y’all home, 
                        but you gotta keep a respectable 
                        distance. Kylie’s mom promised me 
                        one of those iPads. 
           They scowl at Esther. 

                                 ESTHER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t look at me! You guys don’t 
                        know me... 

           She goes back into the bushes while keeping an eye on them. 

           Phoebe and Mike trudge forward. Mike looks towards the bushes 
           at Esther.

                                 ESTHER (CONT’D)
                        No eye contact, Mike. God!

           Off a miserable looking Phoebe... 

           INT. HEBREW SCHOOL - DAY 

           Phoebe is sitting in Hebrew School with a bunch of KIDS. The 
           GIRLS all look at her and snicker/whisper. 

                                 GIRL 1
                        She’s never been kissed. Tragic. 

                                 GIRL 2
                        I heard she only got mono once 
                        because she shared someone’s drink.

           Phoebe sighs. A HEBREW TEACHER leads the class. 

                                 HEBREW TEACHER 
                        Today we learn the meaning of 
                        receiving an aliyah. 

           A nerdy kid, RYAN, is staring at her. 

                                 RYAN
                        I’ve always wondered how are you...
                             (whispers)
                        Black? 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Why are you whispering the word 
                        black?

                                 RYAN
                        My grandma does it when she doesn’t 
                        wanna be offensive. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        The word black isn’t offensive.  
                                 RYAN
                        So no offense, but how are you?
                             (whispers)
                        Black.

           Phoebe rolls her eyes. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        How do you have a tiny...
                             (whispers)
                        Dick?

           Everyone cackles. Ryan scowls. The Hebrew Teacher is 
           appalled.  

                                 HEBREW TEACHER
                        Phoebe! That was extremely 
                        inappropriate. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        You’re right. I’m sorry, Ryan. What 
                        I meant to say is how do you have a 
                        tiny penis.  

           Everyone howls. The teacher GLARES at Phoebe. 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY 

           April, Larry, Phoebe and Phoebe’s little brother SEAN (10) 
           are sitting at the dinner table. 

                                 APRIL
                        You got kicked out of Hebrew 
                        School! Who gets kicked out of 
                        Hebrew School?! Oy, now I’m gonna 
                        have to get you a private tutor. 

                                 LARRY
                        Kid’s lucky she didn’t kick him in 
                        the nuts. 

                                 APRIL
                        Larry!

                                 PHOEBE
                        I don’t wanna have a Bat Mitzvah. 
                        Besides, dad, can you tell mom, I’m 
                        not talking to her right now 
                        because she helped embarrass me by 
                        begging Kylie’s mom to invite me to 
                        her party?
                                 APRIL
                        You don’t have a Bat Mitzvah. You 
                        become a Bat Mitzvah. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Dad. Can you tell the woman who is 
                        speaking to me that I already 
                        became a woman when I menstruated?

           Sean pushes his dinner away and gags. 

                                 APRIL
                        Look, you only have one mother so 
                        you’re gonna have to get over this.   
                        Preferably before I die and you 
                        regret how horribly you treated me 
                        for the rest of your adult life. 

                                 LARRY
                        True. We checked with all the 
                        foster families when you were 
                        little. No one else wanted you. So 
                        we had to keep you. 

                                 SEAN
                        You did?!

                                 APRIL
                             (to Larry)
                        Stop. No one knows when you’re 
                        joking.
                             (beat, then)
                        And you’re becoming a Bat Mitzvah. 
                        Everyone gets embarrassed 
                        sometimes. It makes you stronger.

                                 PHOEBE
                        It didn’t make your bladder 
                        stronger. Remember when you tried 
                        FitTea and then peed your pants at 
                        Target because you couldn’t find 
                        the bathroom?

           Larry and Sean look aghast. 

                                 APRIL
                        That was supposed to be between us. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I wanted you to know what 
                        embarrassment feels like. 

           Phoebe walks out dramatically. Sean looks at April. 
                                 SEAN
                        You didn’t sit on anything after 
                        you peed did you? Like that I 
                        touched?

           INT. PHOEBE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Larry walks in while Phoebe hides under the covers.

           Larry sits on the edge of the bed. 

                                 LARRY 
                        Lemme tell you a little story. It 
                        was about this little black baby 
                        that died, right. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        This is supposed to cheer me up? 

                                 LARRY
                        So the black baby dies and goes to 
                        heaven. And he’s thinkin’, well all 
                        right! So he gets up there, gets 
                        his angel wings, finds God, looks 
                        at God and he says “God, am I an 
                        angel now?” And God took one look 
                        at him and said “nah, nigga you a 
                        bat.” 

           Phoebe laughs. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        The point is, Phoebe. You’re gonna 
                        deal with shit, it’s how you choose 
                        to deal with it that matters. You 
                        think Rosa sat on a bus for you to 
                        sit in your bed feeling sorry for 
                        yourself? 

           A beat. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Become a Bat Mitzvah. Or don’t. But 
                        Imma tell you this. You got one day 
                        to wallow and be sad. Over Kylie 
                        Cohen?! God, she’s the kind of girl 
                        whose picture makes you wanna take 
                        a nap.

           Phoebe sinks back into her covers as Larry exits. She scrolls 
           through Insta. People hanging. Brunching. Happiness. She 
           chucks her phone. 
           EXT. PHOEBE’S HOUSE - DAY 

           Phoebe exits her house. Mike is waiting for her. They chest 
           bump. Esther calls over to them from Mike’s lawn. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Mike! You don’t chest bump a woman, 
                        what’s wrong with you? 

                                 MIKE 
                        She’s not a woman! She cancelled 
                        her Bat Mitzvah. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Probably wise after all those L’s 
                        she took last weekend. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        She’s standing right here!

           Esther walks back towards the house and trips over Mike’s 
           skateboard and falls. Phoebe laughs, then grimaces. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        She’s right. That was so much 
                        easier before puberty. Boobs ruin 
                        everything. They’re just sacks of 
                        fat that get in the way. 

           Mike tries very hard not to look at Phoebe’s boobs. 

                                 MIKE
                        They don’t ruin everything. 

           Phoebe is completely oblivious to Mike’s reaction, because 
           she sees Chase biking down the street. Longing in her eyes. 
           Time slows to something romantic like Frank Ocean’s “Self 
           Control” or “Thinkin Bout You.” Mike snaps her out of it. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I thought you hated him. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        The heart wants what it wants. 

           Off Phoebe pining... 

           EXT. SCHOOL - DAY 

           Mike and Phoebe walk up to school. Kylie, Talia, and 
           Chelseigh march up to Phoebe. 
                                 KYLIE
                        So. We’ve conferred. And you’re 
                        officially banned from any and all 
                        Mitzvah celebrations for the rest 
                        of the year.

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        Mazel tov, bitch. 

                                 MIKE 
                        You can’t do that. 

                                 KYLIE
                        You too. You’re guilty by 
                        association. You should choose your 
                        friends more carefully, Peter. 

                                 MIKE
                        It’s Mike. 

                                 TALIA
                        We’d know that if we cared.

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        And don’t try to crash. Everyone’s 
                        on notice. 

           All the STUDENTS give the girls a head nod like they’re in a 
           secret society. 

                                 KYLIE
                        Got it maxi-pad? 

                                 PHOEBE
                        That’s literally the best you could 
                        come up with? That’s not even 
                        shade. Shade would be talking about 
                        how my clothes look like Stevie 
                        Wonder picked them out from Helen 
                        Keller’s closet.

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        Who’s Stevie Wonder? Does he go 
                        here?

                                 PHOEBE
                        Really? Your parents kept Stevie 
                        from you too?

           Chase walks up and Kylie beelines to him. She hangs all over 
           him. This gut punches Phoebe. Talia interjects. 
                                 TALIA
                        Chase, do you know what kegels are? 
                        Because we’ve all been practicing 
                        them.

                                 CHASE
                        What? 

                                 KYLIE
                        Shut up, Chase. You’re so funny. 

           Kylie hugs him, and glares at Phoebe. 

           Phoebe stares Kylie down. Chase is oblivious. Kylie releases 
           him, then walks away with her posse. Chase walks away.

           ANGLE ON: Kylie, Chelseigh, and Talia. 

                                 KYLIE (CONT’D)
                        Kegels. Really, Talia? That’s for 
                        loose vaginas. You told him our 
                        vaginas are loose. 

                                 TALIA
                        So? He’ll be thinking about sex 
                        then.

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        And isn’t that better? Why would 
                        you wanna have sex with a tight 
                        vagina? That sounds like it’d hurt. 

                                 KYLIE
                        God, you guys are like twelve! 

           She stalks off.

           Back to Phoebe. She’s still staring down Kylie.

                                 MIKE
                        Do you think Chelseigh’s gonna have 
                        to come out of the closet as a 
                        black person one day?

           Phoebe is still eyeing Kylie. Off her silence. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Was that one of those things that’s 
                        only okay when you say it?

                                 PHOEBE
                        She can’t keep me out of Bat 
                        Mitzvahs. It’s like keeping Kanye 
                        out of fashion.

                                 PHOEBE (CONT'D)
                        Bat Mitzvah is uncanceled. I’m 
                        about to have the best Bat Mitzvah 
                        of all time. Steve Jobs. Walt 
                        Disney. 

                                 MIKE
                        Are you okay? You sound crazy.

           Phoebe puts her arm around Mike. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        When I try to be great, people are 
                        always gonna try and tell me “nah 
                        nigga you a bat...” Why? Because 
                        they wanna put me in my place. Not 
                        today. Kylie’s the bat. 
                             (beat, then)
                        And that’s one of those things only 
                        I can say. 

           Phoebe is determined. Off Mike’s weary expression...

           CHYRON: 90 DAYS TO BAT MITZVAH

           INT. PHOEBE’S PARENTS’ ROOM - NIGHT 

           April and Larry are in bed watching TV. Phoebe barges in. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Hi, parents. I mean shalom. 

                                 APRIL
                        Larry. Tell her I’m not speaking to 
                        her right now.  

                                 LARRY
                        I’m gettin’ off this merry go 
                        round. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Bat Mitzvah is back on. 

                                 APRIL
                        Forget what I just said, it was all 
                        a bunch of mishegas. I forgive you. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        And I forgive you, mother. 
                        Haftarah, Torah portion. Whatever 
                        you want. I love you. You’re the 
                        only mother I have. Thank you for 
                        giving birth to me. 
           She kisses April on the cheek, then exits. April is elated, 
           Larry is befuddled. 

                                 APRIL
                        We’re such good parents. 

                                 LARRY
                        I dunno, you think we let her hit 
                        her head a few too many times?

                                 APRIL
                        What were we supposed to do? Her 
                        head was too big for a helmet.

           INT. PHOEBE’S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER 

           Phoebe makes a Bat Mitzvah vision board. Her phone beeps and 
           she starts scrolling through Finsta (fake Insta) stories on 
           Instagram. It’s seventh grade hell. 

           PHOEBE’S PHONE

           SHOT SERIES OF STORIES 

           EMO GIRL cries while listening to Lana Del Rey’s “Summertime 
           Sadness.” Captioned: “I have so many feelings.”

           BLONDE GIRL twerks to “Started from the Bottom.” 

           A REDHEADED GUY RANTS: 

                                 REDHEADED GUY 
                        I don’t like how everyone thinks I 
                        have a chode now. I said I like to  
                        play with TOAD on Mario Kart, not 
                        CHODE. 

           Phoebe quickly swipes away. A DM comes in from CoolGuy13. 

           CHYRON: COOLGUY13 DM: I like you. A lot. 

           Phoebe looks around her room, panicked.

           CHYRON: COOLGUY13 DM: I just don’t know how to talk to you...

           A beat while Phoebe thinks.

           CHYRON: PHOEBE DM: Either I’m being Catfished or you should 
           go to jail. 

           Phoebe clicks off Instagram and goes to bed. 
           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 

           Phoebe and Mike are walking down the hall. They pause, 
           noticing that STUDENTS are whispering and back up from them 
           as if they have a disease. 

                                 MIKE
                        Did you see that? Diabetic 
                        Stephanie just gave me the stink 
                        eye? Me! 

           They get closer to STEPHANIE (12), a nerdy girl with an 
           insulin satchel. She stink eyes Mike and Phoebe. 

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Get away from me, Mike. I have a 
                        rep to protect. 

           She puts a hoodie on and walks away like she’s nervous to be 
           seen with them.

                                 MIKE
                        Are you kidding me with this Kylie 
                        ban?! I gave Stephanie the last 
                        slices of apples and honey at Rosh 
                        Hoshana potluck two years ago 
                        because her blood sugar was low! I 
                        should’ve let her ass faint. 
                             (beat, then yelling at 
                              Stephanie)
                        I SHOULD HAVE LET YOU FAINT, 
                        STEPHANIE AND I HOPE YOU HAVE A 
                        BITTER ASS NEW YEAR. 

           Everyone stares at Mike like he’s crazy. Stephanie hurries up 
           down the hall, pulls the hoodie COMPLETELY over her face. 

           Some JOCKS toss a football. A TEACHER tries to stop them. 

                                 TEACHER
                        Stop. Stop. Oh what do I care? Lost 
                        control of them like I lost control 
                        of my life 10 years ago. 

           The teacher slyly sips from a tiny flask while the jocks 
           BULLDOZE into Phoebe. 

                                 JOCK 1
                        Tackled the black girl! 

           They cackle and run away. Mike helps Phoebe up. 
                                 PHOEBE
                        Look, I didn’t say overcoming this 
                        was gonna be an overnight success, 
                        but it’s not like anything worse 
                        can happen.

           Off Mike’s skeptical expression... 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 

           Phoebe is standing in front of a classroom. Kylie waves her 
           hand wildly while a beleaguered teacher, MR. YOUNG (30s, 
           completely over it) sighs. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Think about chocolate chip cookies 
                        as a representation of like 
                        America. Like the chocolate chip 
                        makes the cookie better. More 
                        complete... 

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        I don’t like chocolate chip cookies 
                        unless they don’t have chocolate 
                        chips in them.

                                 PHOEBE
                        Of course. I bet the only chocolate 
                        you like is “white.” 

                                 TALIA
                        Stop saying “white” like that. You 
                        make “white” sound like a slur. 

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        Yeah... It’s offensive. 

           Phoebe looks at Chelseigh disturbed she has no allies. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        First of all, Chelseigh...

           Mr. Young shoots a “don’t go there” look at Phoebe. 

                                 MR. YOUNG
                        How about we’re done for the day, 
                        since none of you are capable of 
                        going five minutes without being 
                        triggered? 

           Talia points at Phoebe in horror. 
                                 TALIA
                        Oh my God, are you on your period? 

                                 MR. YOUNG
                        We didn’t even make it five 
                        seconds. 

           Phoebe looks down, she is. Shit. Everyone starts cackling. 

                                 CLASS
                        Maxi-pad! Maxi-pad!

           Phoebe is frozen. Mr. Young hands her a hall pass. 

                                 MR. YOUNG
                        Maybe you want to go to the nurse? 
                        That looks like a lot of blood. 
                             (awkward beat)
                        I’m not looking! Your pants are 
                        just white. 
                             (beat, then)
                        Wow. Saying white like that does 
                        sound slurry. 

           Phoebe starts scooting out trying to cover up, mortified and 
           unable to speak.

           INT. NURSE’S OFFICE - DAY 

           The school NURSE hands Phoebe some gym shorts. Phoebe takes 
           them. 

                                 NURSE
                        There comes a time in every girl’s 
                        life. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Save it. I know what a period is. I 
                        just couldn’t give Kylie the 
                        satisfaction of wearing a pad, and 
                        I read online that tampons give you 
                        toxic shock and then you die. 

                                 NURSE
                        Phoebe--

                                 PHOEBE
                        And then there’s the diva cup. But 
                        that’s literally the grossest 
                        concept I’ve ever heard of. A 
                        vampire wouldn’t even wanna drink 
                        out of that cup. 
                                 NURSE
                        So you thought it would be better 
                        to just come to school in white 
                        pants and pray? 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Oh. Saying white like that does 
                        sound a little slur-ish. You’ve 
                        made some good points, I’d take 
                        death by tampon at this point. It’s 
                        a death worth dying for. 

           Phoebe walks out. 

           CHYRON: 75 DAYS TO BAT MITZVAH

           INT. ONCE UPON A BAGEL - DAY 

           Phoebe waits at a table. She’s morose. Eyes a SOUP LADLER at 
           the buffet sipping soup directly from the ladle. Ew. 

           A beat. She sees SAM (30s, think Seth Rogen) ladle some soup 
           into a bowl. She’s horrified. He takes a seat at Phoebe’s 
           table. She stares at the bowl. 

                                 SAM
                        Phoebe, I’m Sam. Your new Hebrew 
                        tutor. 

           Phoebe is staring at his soup. The SOUP LADLER returns and 
           sips soup from the ladle again. He smiles like he’s taunting 
           Phoebe. 

           Off Phoebe’s awkward silence, Sam keeps talking. 

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        I still get paid whether you talk 
                        or not. 

           Sam waves his hand in her face. She snaps out of it. 

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Your mom says you’ve made every 
                        Hebrew Teacher you’ve had cry and 
                        I’m the last resort. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I mean. Define cry.  

                                 SAM
                        Lemme ask you something. What do 
                        you want to get out of your Bat 
                        Mitzvah?
                                 PHOEBE
                        I want it to be more than a party. 

                                 SAM
                        Good. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I want it to be like a feeling. 
                        Like life is better because this 
                        happened. Everyone remembers it. 
                        Like a Kendrick performance when 
                        everybody’s about to fall asleep at 
                        the Grammys. 

                                 SAM
                        Bad. It’s about becoming a daughter 
                        of the commandments. 

           Phoebe watches as Sam is about to take a slurp of soup.

                                 PHOEBE
                        Lemme ask you something. If there 
                        was like hair or something in your 
                        food. Would you want to know or 
                        would you want to eat it in peace? 

                                 SAM
                        What kind of hair is it? 

                                 PHOEBE
                        What kind of question is that? A 
                        hair is hair. 

                                 SAM
                        A hair is not hair, there are 
                        different kinds of hairs. Not all 
                        hairs are created equal. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        That’s disgusting. I bet you’re the 
                        kind of person who doesn’t wash 
                        your hands.

                             (off Phoebe’s non-
                              reaction)
                        Like tomato, tomahto. Light humor.

           He’s about to take a sip of soup, Phoebe knocks the spoon out 
           of his hand. 
                                 PHOEBE
                        A dude was drinking directly out of 
                        that vat of soup. I can’t have my 
                        Hebrew tutor getting SARS even if 
                        you don’t care about germs.  

                                 SAM
                        I’m seriously debating whether or 
                        not I wanted to know that. That 
                        soup looked like it was en fuego.
                             (beat, then)
                        How do you even know what SARS is? 
                        That disease scare is older than 
                        you.

                                 PHOEBE
                        Ooo girl, your breath is harsh. 
                        Cover your mouth up like you got 
                        SARS.

                        You like Kanye?

                                 SAM
                        He’s only one of the most

                                 PHOEBE
                        Like me. No one understands me 
                        except my friend Mike.

                        Getting ready for your Bat Mitzvah 
                        is kind of like “Workout Plan.”

                                 PHOEBE
                        How? 

                                 SAM
                        It’s a glow up into adulthood. I 
                        mean look at me. I’m glowed up. 

           He is not glowed up. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I can’t glow up. Kylie won’t let 
                        me. I need Kanye to come to my 
                        party. 
                                 SAM
                        Another person can’t stop your glow 
                        up. You gotta figure out what it 
                        means for you. 
                             (beat, then)
                        Also. No chance Kanye is coming to 
                        your Bat Mitzvah.

                                 PHOEBE
                        We’ll see. 

                                 SAM
                        I’d shave my eyebrows off if Kanye 
                        came to your Bat Mitzvah. You need 
                        to just focus on the glow up. 

           Off Phoebe thinking... 

           INT. MIKE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Esther stands in front of a white board she has affixed to 
           the wall. It’s emblazoned with the words “GLOW UP.” 

           Phoebe and Mike watch on the couch. 

                                 ESTHER 
                        A glow up is a very specific 
                        process. Usually takes between two 
                        and seven years to complete.  

                                 PHOEBE
                        We have three-ish months. 

                                 ESTHER
                        That’s like asking me to create 
                        diamonds out of farts. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Fine. If you can’t glow me up, I’ll 
                        glow myself up. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Nah. I’ll glow you up. It’ll be 
                        better than watching Mike’s parents 
                        pretend they didn’t stumble upon 
                        his Internet search history.

                        God, can’t you keep ANYTHING to 
                        yourself?
                                 ESTHER
                        I cannot, Mike. Besides...when Ms. 
                        Whitney Houston died I made a vow 
                        to myself to help sad cases. 
                        Because I, too, believe children 
                        are our future.  

                                 PHOEBE
                        So what does that mean?

                                 ESTHER
                        You gotta change the game up. New 
                        clothes. New friends. Some dude 
                        everybody wants to bang. Talent. 
                        You got talent? 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I can roll my tongue like a body 
                        roll. 

           She does it. It’s creepy. 

                                 ESTHER 
                        No. Absolutely do not do that under 
                        any circumstance. We’ll start with 
                        your clothes. 

                                 PHOEBE 
                        What’s wrong with my clothes?

                                 ESTHER

           INT. PHOEBE’S ROOM - DAY 

           Phoebe’s rifling through her closet. 

                                 ESTHER (V.O.)
                        You need something that says swag 
                        without trying.  

                                 PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        This is terrible glow up music. May 
                        Whitney rest in peace though. 
           Music changes to “Only” by Nicki Minaj. Phoebe continues 
           changing outfits. Esther puts the finishing touches on her. 
           We can’t see what Phoebe looks like. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 

           Phoebe and Mike walk down the hall in slo-mo. Phoebe looks 
           absurd in Esther-approved clothes.

           She smiles at a CUTE GUY. He grimaces. Disappointed, she 
           turns to Mike. 

                                 PHOEBE
                             (to self)
                        How am I supposed to glow up if 
                        everybody is racist?! 

                                 MIKE
                        You have spinach in your teeth. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        What?!

           She opens her locker and looks in the mirror. She does. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        Why wouldn’t you tell me I had 
                        spinach in my teeth?!

                                 MIKE
                        I thought it was part of some girl 
                        power “I don’t really care what I 
                        look like statement.” 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Why would I do that while we’re 
                        trying to glow up?! What kind of 
                        friend doesn’t tell their friend 
                        they have food in their teeth?! 

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t know! There are a bunch of 
                        models with gaps in their teeth. I 
                        thought it was the same concept! 

           Phoebe looks at Mike. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I’m hearing what I’m saying.

           Phoebe shuts her locker and walks away wordlessly. 
                                 MIKE (CONT’D)

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY 

           Phoebe is picking the spinach out of her teeth. She looks at 
           herself in the mirror. Sighs. She blinks and Kanye stares 
           back at her. 

                                 KANYE
                        People in this world shun people 
                        for being great, for being a bright 
                        color, for standing out. But the 
                        time is now, to be OK with being 
                        the greatest you. You feel me? 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Yeah. 

                                 KANYE
                        Nah. Say it with your chest. Fuck

                                 PHOEBE
                        Fuck them niggas, I feel you. 

           Kanye paces back and forth in the mirror, full Kanye.  

                                 KANYE
                        You’re Steve Jobs. Walt Disney! 
                        People doubt you, tell em’ “how 
                        Sway”?!

           A toilet flushes. Stephanie The Diabetic exits. Stares at 
           Phoebe who is mortified.

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Phoebe sits in front of the PRINCIPAL (40s, white). 

                                 PRINCIPAL 
                        You were overheard saying the n 
                        word to yourself in the bathroom. 
                        That’s extremely inappropriate, 
                        Phoebe. 

           Phoebe stares at the Principal wordlessly. 
                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
                        You should really think about how 
                        words have power. I don’t think 
                        I’ve ever used that word. 

           Phoebe stares at him dumbfounded. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I mean. That’s a good thing... 

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Stephanie was very upset by what 
                        you said. 

           Phoebe sighs. Off her look... 

           INT. PHOEBE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 

           Phoebe’s sitting at the dinner table with April, Larry, and 
           Sean. She’s feverishly swiping through inane shit on 
           Instagram. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I don’t understand why I have to 
                        watch what I say to make diabetic 
                        Stephanie comfortable. Shouldn’t 
                        she be busy watching her sugar 
                        levels? Besides, nobody cares about 
                        making me comfortable when they’re 
                        using my arm to test their tans. 

           Larry laughs. April shoves him.  

                                 LARRY
                        She has a point. 

                                 APRIL
                        Larry, stop encouraging this. It’s 
                        your fault for buying her the 
                        unedited version of N.W.A.

                                 SEAN
                        Ohhhhh. She said nigga again. What 
                        y’all gonna do? 

                                 APRIL
                        Phoebe!
                                 LARRY 
                        Should we be mad about this? She’s 
                        speaking with 6’4” confidence, 
                        albeit in a Kevin Hart height tone 
                        of voice, but still...

           Phoebe continues swiping without looking up. She gets another 
           DM from CoolGuy13.

           CHYRON: COOLGUY13 DM: Your look today was fire. Still think 
           I’m catfishing????

           She looks around the table. Messages back. 

           CHYRON: PHOEBE DM: Alright if you know me, who’s my worst 
           enemy?

           CHYRON: COOLGUY13 DM: Kylie. She’s basic AF.  

           Phoebe smiles.

                        If I had my phone at the table, my 
                        mom woulda smacked the black off 
                        me. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        They didn’t have phones back then.

                                 APRIL
                        Oh no she did not. 

           Phoebe puts her hand up to silence everyone. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Shhhh. 

                                 APRIL
                        Phoebe Alexis Johnson. 

           CHRYON: PHOEBE DM: Good answer. Who’s my favorite human? 

           CHYRON: COOLGUY13 DM: Kanye West. Easy. I’ve liked you 
           forever.

           Phoebe slips into a dumb, stupid reverie until...

                                 PHOEBE
                        My hair!

           Sean flings mashed potatoes into her hair while April 
           snatches the phone out of her hands. 
                                 LARRY
                        You deserved it. 

           They all laugh at her.

                                 APRIL
                        And don’t say “nigger” at school. 

           Everyone drops their forks. 

                                 APRIL (CONT’D)
                        It sounded really bad when I said 
                        it, didn’t it? 

                                 LARRY
                        You should never say that again.  

                                 PHOEBE
                        The hard “E.R.” didn’t help.  

           They all laugh again. 

                                 PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        Vay'dabeir Adonai...

           INT. DELI - DAY 

           Phoebe and Sam sit across from each other. 

                                 SAM
                        Nah. Needs more chutzpah. 

           Phoebe sighs, looking out the window. 

                                 PHOEBE
                             (morose)
                        Vay'dabeir Adon-- 

           She sighs. Sees Chase outside chatting with friends. 

                                 SAM
                        Who’s the guy? You have a definite 
                        “I have a crush” look. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        It doesn’t matter. No one will ever 
                        like me. Not like they like Kylie 
                        and Talia. 

                                 SAM 
                        What does chutzpah mean?
                                 PHOEBE
                        Confidence. Being a fan of 
                        yourself. 

                                 SAM
                        Of yourself, not Kylie. One of the 
                        commandments is not to worship 
                        false idols. What do you think that 
                        means here?

           Off Phoebe, thinking... 

           EXT. STARBUCKS - TOWN - DAY

           Phoebe stands in front of Mike. 

                                 MIKE
                        This is the worst idea you’ve ever 
                        had. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        This’ll bring Kylie down and we 
                        shouldn’t worship false idols... 
                        besides, Esther said I need to find 
                        a dude everybody wants to bang. 

                                 MIKE
                        His bang-worthiness is 
                        questionable. And I have 
                        experience. I made it to second 
                        base with this girl at camp last 
                        summer. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        When? You didn’t tell me that. 

                                 MIKE
                        Well technical second base. We were 
                        playing softball. She slid into me 
                        while I was manning second. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Ok, just pretend you’re Chase. 

                                 MIKE
                        Yo. Check out my one chest hair. Be 
                        careful with it. It’s fragile. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Mike. Seriously. 

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, Phoebe. 
                                 PHOEBE
                        Hey, Chase. Would you. Would you. 
                        Would you. 

                                 MIKE
                        Spit it out, I don’t have all day. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        MIKE!

           Mike sighs. Stares into Phoebe’s eyes. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        I really like you, Chase. I have 
                        for awhile. Would you wanna come to 
                        my Bat Mitzvah? 

           Mike gazes at Phoebe. 

                                 MIKE
                        Phoebe. I like you too. And not the 
                        way I like deep dish over thin 
                        crust pizza. I like you as much as 
                        I like watching clips of Jordan in 
                        game six. I like how funny you are. 
                        How you like weird shit like 
                        figuring out which dude Dumbledore 
                        would date in the real world. How 
                        you’re so nice to people that don’t 
                        deserve you being nice to them. 
                        Like trying to invite everyone to 
                        your Bat Mitzvah because you want 
                        everyone to have an awesome time. 

           They look into each other’s eyes. A little too long. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Mike? 

                                 MIKE
                        Chase. I’m pretending to be Chase. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Right. Chase. I can do this. 
                        Thanks, Mike. 

           Phoebe walks out. Mike stares after her, a little shaken. 

           EXT. CHASE’S HOUSE - DAY 

           Phoebe marches up to Chase’s door. Resolve in her eyes. She 
           takes a deep breath while talking to herself. 
                                 PHOEBE 
                             (to self)
                        Chase. I like you. I like you. 

           She knocks on the door. Kylie answers, slurping an iced tea.

                                 KYLIE
                        We don’t want any. 

           She shuts the door in Phoebe’s face. 

                                 PHOEBE
                             (eyes narrowing)
                        I will crush her into dust. 

           INT. CHASE’S HOUSE - DAY 

           Chase hands Kylie a backpack. 

                                 CHASE
                        Here’s your sister’s backpack. Did 
                        you answer my door?

                                 KYLIE
                        It was one of those people trying 
                        to raise cash for hunger. I told 
                        them we do credit now. 

           Chase looks out the window. Sees Phoebe dancing down the 
           sidewalk. He laughs. 

           EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY 

           Phoebe is listening to K-Ci and Jojo’s “Tell Me It’s Real.” 
           She’s overcome by the music. Daydreams herself looking 
           longingly into Chase’s eyes, then dances right into a tree 
           and falls.

           A DOG WALKER steps over her. 

           CHYRON: 60 DAYS TO BAT MITZVAH

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 

           Phoebe is sitting in Sex Ed class. Looks at scribbles on her 
           desk. “Blow job kweens: Talia, Amy, Becca.” 

           A FAUX WOKE TEACHER hands eggs to each of the students. 
                                 FAUX WOKE TEACHER
                        These represent your children, 
                        class. Drop the egg, and it means 
                        you’re not responsible enough for 
                        the responsibilities of adult 
                        relations.

           Chelseigh raises her hand. 

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        Why did you give me a brown egg? 

                                 FAUX WOKE TEACHER
                        Oh. I didn’t want to assume you’d 
                        want a white one... 

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        I’m white. 

           The Faux Woke Teacher looks at Chelseigh. Is she serious?

                                 FAUX WOKE TEACHER
                        I understand.
                             (to class re: Chelseigh)
                        They feel white on the inside. 

           Phoebe looks at her desk. She also has a brown egg. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Who’s “they”?! Why do I have a 
                        brown egg?

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        No, I don’t feel white. I am white. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Who is “they”?! I don’t feel white. 

           Phoebe gets up and snatches a white egg off the desk. Cracks 
           her brown egg and the white egg on her desk. The STUDENT 
           whose egg she snatched starts crying. 

                                 STUDENT
                        I’m gonna fail now! 

                                 PHOEBE
                        The eggs look the same when you 
                        crack them, what are you even 
                        talking about? 

           The Faux Woke Teacher GASPS. 
                                 FAUX WOKE TEACHER
                        Did you just kill your baby?! 
                             (points at Phoebe)
                        Class, they get detention for 
                        disrespecting life. 

                                 CHELSEIGH AND PHOEBE
                        Who is “they”?! 

                                 FAUX WOKE TEACHER
                        Phoebe. In this class, we don’t use 
                        gendered pronouns. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        And I respect everyone’s pronouns, 
                        but we use colored people eggs?!  

           She cracks another egg and walks out. Everyone is shocked. 

           INT. DETENTION - DAY 

           Phoebe sits in detention. The TEACHER is snoring. Talia walks 
           in with Kylie. 

                                 TALIA
                        Ugh. I’m so hungry. 

                                 KYLIE
                        I know. Keto is like the worst. All 
                        I’ve had today is kosher bacon.  

                                 TALIA
                        Bacon isn’t kosher. 

                                 KYLIE
                        It is when I’m on Keto. 

           A NERD runs up to Talia. 

                                 NERD
                        You want my turkey sandwich?

                                 TALIA 
                        I don’t eat meat. 

           A GOTH GIRL snorts. 

                                 GOTH GIRL
                        Not what I heard. 

           Phoebe laughs. Kylie stares at her. Smiles menacingly. 
                                 KYLIE
                        So. Chase told me he’s like in love 
                        with me but I was all slow down. 
                        His kisses are wetter than Chez’s 
                        slip ‘n’ slide at his Bar Mitzvah 
                        last week. 

                                 TALIA 
                        Omg, that Bar Mitzvah was dope as 
                        fuck.
                             (off Kylie’s look)
                        I mean not better than yours. 

           They look at Phoebe, pointedly. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        This doesn’t bother me. I’m having 
                        my own Bat Mitzvah. 

           They stare at her. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        And you can come. 

           They keep staring. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        Because I like to bring people 
                        together, not divide them. 

           The girls look at each other. 

                                 KYLIE
                        Do you hear something? 

                                 TALIA
                        Nope. 

           The girls continue to pretend Phoebe isn’t there. 

           INT. MALL - DAY 

           Phoebe and April wander through Neiman Marcus. April clocks a 
           SNOOTY SALES ASSOCIATE following them. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I hate Kylie. 

                                 APRIL
                        What am I paying for these Bat 
                        Mitzvah lessons for? You don’t hate 
                        anybody. We forgive. 
           April picks up a dress. 

                                 APRIL (CONT’D)
                        Do you wanna wear white during the 
                        service?

                                 PHOEBE
                        To really highlight the virginal 
                        aspects of my life? No one likes 
                        me. I mean Mike likes me like a 
                        friend. But no one likes me likes 
                        me. 

           April looks at her, slightly awkward. The Sales Associate 
           continues to trail them. April clocks it. 

                                 APRIL
                        Ugh, I knew this day would come. 

           April puts down the pants she’s holding. The Sales Associate 
           sighs with relief. April picks them back up to mess with her. 

           The Sales Associate follows them more closely. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I wouldn’t even know what to do if 
                        someone did like me. 

                                 APRIL
                        Okay. Ask me anything. I’m open. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Why do they call it a blow job if 
                        it’s supposed to be fun? It sounds 
                        like work. 

                                 APRIL
                        I will kill your father for letting 
                        you watch American Pie. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Oh relax, I’m not gonna go out and 
                        try to have sex with a pie. 

           April sips a long sip of an iced coffee. 

                                 APRIL
                        When you get older, and I mean old 
                        enough to pay for a child, and when 
                        I say old enough to pay, I mean not 
                        paying with money you take from me, 
                        you’ll realize guys like virgins. 
           The Sales Associate is behind April. April quickly turns 
           around. 

                                 APRIL (CONT’D)
                        Boo! 

           The Sales Associate startles backwards. Scurries away. Phoebe 
           laughs. 

           INT. PHOEBE’S ROOM - DAY 

           Phoebe’s in bed. She gets another DM.

           CHYRON COOLGUY13 DM: Biggest pet peeve is people who don’t 
           wash their hands. 

           CHYRON PHOEBE DM: THE WORST. I HATE PEOPLE. 

           CHYRON COOLGUY13 DM: Even me? 

           CHYRON PHOEBE DM: Dunno. For all I know you’re SIRI w/ an 
           Insta account...

           CHRYON PHOEBE DM: Have you ever like kissed someone?

           CHRYON COOLGUY13 DM: Yeah. Have you? 

           Phoebe sighs heavily. 

           CHYRON COOLGUY13 DM: I don’t care... Kinda curious if you 
           like anyone tho...:) 

           CHRYON PHOEBE DM: Not telling unless you say who you are.

           CHYRON COOLGUY13 DM: I’ll tell you you’re pretty when you 
           smile. 

           Phoebe smiles, likes the message, then logs out of Insta. 

           Phoebe googles “how to kiss someone.” 

           She looks at herself in the mirror. Wraps her arms around 
           herself. She leans in to the mirror when...  Her phone rings.

           INT. MIKE’S ROOM - NIGHT 

           Mike is on the phone looking out his window. 

                                 MIKE 
                             (into phone)
                        What the hell are you doing?
           INT. PHOEBE’S ROOM - INTERCUT

           Mortified Phoebe runs to the window. She pulls the curtains 
           down. 

                                 PHOEBE
                             (into phone)
                        Can I live?! I was cleaning my 
                        mirror!

                                 MIKE
                             (into phone)
                        Sure...

                                 PHOEBE
                             (into phone)
                        Also stop playing around on Insta. 

                                 MIKE
                             (into phone)
                        I’m not on Insta. My parents 
                        parental controlled all my shit. 

           Off Phoebe’s confused expression. She quickly hangs up. 

           Phoebe makes sure the curtains are closed. Resumes her stance 
           in front of the mirror when Larry walks in. Phoebe falls 
           backwards. She scrambles back up. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Doesn’t anybody knock?! 

                                 LARRY
                        In my own house? No. Your mother 
                        says we need to have a sex talk. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        We do not. 

           Larry sits down at the edge of the bed. 

                                 LARRY
                        I don’t want you learning stuff 
                        from those little urchins you go to 
                        school with, so I brought aids. 
                             (beat, then)
                        I mean I brought props. Aids is 
                        what you get if you don’t use a 
                        condom. 

           Larry pulls out a box of condoms. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Dad! STOP.  
           He pulls out a cucumber. 

                                 LARRY
                        So you put the condom on the 
                        cucumber. And you better not be 
                        doing this for at least fifteen 
                        years. But you know what? Teaching 
                        you this now is important. Because 
                        a broke ass you learning how not to 
                        have a baby equals some peace of 
                        mind for me. 

           Phoebe is appalled. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I get it. I know how everything 
                        works. And if you continue, I will 
                        die. I will actually die. 

                                 LARRY
                        Thank God, because I didn’t want to 
                        pull out anything else. Speaking of 
                        which, pulling out is not a form of 
                        birth control... 

                                 PHOEBE
                        DADDY! STOP! You don’t even have to 
                        worry anyway. I’m a germaphobe, 
                        plus no one at school wants to date 
                        a black girl. I’m like guy 
                        repellent. 

           A beat. 

                                 LARRY
                        They don’t deserve to date a black 
                        girl. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        According to “Don’t Hurt Yourself,” 
                        the most neglected person in 
                        America is the black woman.

                                 LARRY
                        Malcolm X said that, not some song. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I know who said it, just wanted to 
                        make you sweat since you came in 
                        here with condoms and cucumbers. 

           Larry laughs. 
                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        But you know what. Beyonce got 
                        cheated on. You can like literally 
                        be like perfect and like it’s still 
                        not enough. Like how else can you 
                        explain me not having a boyfriend?

                                 LARRY
                        Your gratuitous use of the word 
                        “like” helps explain it.  

           Phoebe throws a pillow at him. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        You can leave now. 

           Larry pulls a mezuzah out of his pocket. 

                                 LARRY
                        Not before I give you this.

           Hands the mezuzah to Phoebe. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t let anybody make you feel 
                        like you’re not enough. There’s 
                        power in this, use it wisely.  

           Larry begins walking out. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Why does your mirror have lipstick 
                        marks all over it?

                                 PHOEBE
                        Daddy, get out! 

           Larry walks out while Phoebe looks at the mezuzah.

           CHYRON: 40 DAYS TO BAT MITZVAH

           INT. DELI - DAY

           Phoebe sits with Sam. 

                                 SAM
                        The crux of the halakhah is the 613 
                        mitzvot that God gave to the Jewish 
                        people. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        So how do I apply that to my life?
                                 SAM
                        It includes all of the commandments 
                        in the Torah, but in the everyday 
                        sense? Good deeds. 

                                 PHOEBE 
                        So like if I were to do some good 
                        deeds. That’d make me better? 
                        Faster? Stronger?

                                 SAM
                        A better person. Yeah. 

           Phoebe pulls out her mezuzah. Rubs it between her fingers. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        So if I do a bunch of good deeds, 
                        it’ll be like eating a Mario magic 
                        mushroom for my lucky mezuzah? Like 
                        it’ll increase it’s luck?

                                 SAM
                        That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever 
                        heard you say. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Not according to Sammy Davis Jr. 
                        And I don’t remember asking for 
                        your opinion, Sam. Goodbye. I have 
                        deeds to do. 

           Phoebe walks out. And we... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           MONTAGE OF GOOD DEEDS

           EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY 

           Phoebe holds the door for an ELDERLY WOMAN. The woman doesn’t 
           say “thank you,” then Phoebe gets stuck holding the door for 
           a bunch of CUSTOMERS. None of them say “thank you.” 

                                 PHOEBE
                        You’re welcome, everyone. 

           She lets go of the door, thinking the person behind her will 
           hold it as she walks through. He lets it hit her instead. 
           EXT. GYM FIELD - DAY 

           Mike and Phoebe finish the mile. Stephanie the Diabetic looks 
           like she’s about to pass out. Phoebe starts sipping from her 
           water bottle. Stephanie approaches them. 

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Can I have a sip of your water?

                                 MIKE
                        Pretend you don’t see it like you 
                        don’t see us. 

           Phoebe looks at Stephanie then her water. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I don’t really “share” water. I 
                        mean the germs just swirling around 
                        and--

           Phoebe stops herself. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        Nevermind. You can have it. 

                                 MIKE
                        No, Phoebe! Let her ass faint! 

                                 PHOEBE
                        It’s a mitzvot, Mike! I need good 
                        karma.  

           Stephanie takes the water, slobbers all over it. Hands it 
           back to a repulsed Phoebe. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        You just keep that. 

           EXT. STREET - DAY 

           Phoebe sees a HIPPIE DUDE collecting money for the Salvation 
           Army. She hands them a bill. The Hippie Dude lights up. 

                                 HIPPIE DUDE
                        One hundred dollars! You shouldn’t 
                        have!

                                 PHOEBE
                        Wait no. I didn’t. That was my 
                        Hanukkah money, I meant to give you 
                        a ten. 
                                 HIPPIE DUDE
                        No take backs.

           The Hippie runs away. Phoebe chases him. Off Phoebe, out of 
           breath.

           INT. MIKE’S HOUSE - DAY 

           Phoebe and Mike sit in front of Esther. Phoebe clutches her 
           mezuzah, then ties it around her neck. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I’ve done like a million good 
                        deeds. I’m ready to glow up.  

                                 ESTHER
                        Isn’t that supposed to go outside 
                        the door? 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Sammy Davis Jr. wore his because he 
                        thought it was lucky. Only time he 
                        didn’t, he almost died. Don’t 
                        question blewish girl magic.

                                 ESTHER
                        If you wanna take down Kylie, 
                        you’re gonna need a Beyoncé lights 
                        off at the Super Bowl moment.

                                 PHOEBE
                        How?

                                 ESTHER 
                        I’m just a vessel of information. I 
                        can’t do everything. God. 

           Esther walks out exasperated. Off Phoebe, annoyed. 

           INT. SEX ED - DAY 

           A BLAND TEACHER drones on. Chelseigh is sitting in the corner 
           with bleach blonde hair. It looks insane. Phoebe can’t stop 
           staring. 

                                 BLAND TEACHER
                        So now we have to have sensitivity 
                        training due to a skin colored egg 
                        scandal. I’m your new teacher. I’m 
                        just gonna play a video. 
           The teacher turns on a movie about the reproductive system. 

           Phoebe feels something taped underneath her desk. It’s a card 
           with her name on it. She opens it. 

           The front is a picture of Kanye and says “My Presence is a 
           Present.” 

           Phoebe smiles. Looks around. Opens the card. “CoolGuy13 hopes 
           you used hand sanitizer before and after reaching underneath 
           this desk. DM later?” 

           Phoebe laughs. Looks around the class. Can’t detect who it 
           could be. 

           All of a sudden there’s a THUD. The teacher shrieks. 

                                 TEACHER 
                        Oh my my my my my my. 

           The teacher covers his eyes. A DOUCHEY KID is on the floor 
           with an obvious BONER. All the kids laugh.

           The Bland Teacher throws a cloth over the student’s boner 
           area and snatches his phone. 

                                 BLAND TEACHER
                        OH HOLY HELL. 

           It’s a suggestive photo of Talia. 

           The Douchey Kid and the teacher make eye contact. Everyone in 
           the class looks at the Douchey Kid. They all lose it. 

                                 BLAND TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        Class is over everyone. 

           The Douchey Kid tries to get up. Has trouble. 

                                 BLAND TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        Not for you. You stay here. 

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY 

           The hallway is bustling with STUDENTS whispering to each 
           other. 

                                 KID 1
                        Talia totes gave Chris a handy 
                        during study hall. 

                                 KID 2 
                        I heard it was a blow job. 
                                 KID 1
                             (spits out a Frappucino 
                              he’s sipping)
                        She took a sip of my Frappucino! 

           Kid 1 RUNS away disturbed. 

           Mike and Phoebe are standing at Phoebe’s locker when there’s 
           a PSA ANNOUNCEMENT. 

                                 PSA ANNOUNCEMENT
                        Students, there will be a mandatory  
                        emergency assembly tomorrow 
                        regarding both the incident 
                        regarding skin colored eggs as well 
                        as sexual safety. 

           Phoebe looks at Mike. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Do you know what that means?

                                 MIKE
                        My science test is canceled. Thank 
                        God, because I didn’t study shit. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        No...everyone locked in an 
                        auditorium. This is our chance. 
                        Come on...

           Phoebe drags Mike down the hallway. 

           INT. MIKE’S HOUSE - DAY 

           Phoebe and Mike stand before Esther. 

                                 ESTHER
                        What y’all mad about today?

                                 PHOEBE
                        We need your help. 

                                 MIKE
                        Are you good at tech?

                                 ESTHER
                        Are you asking me that because I’m 
                        Asian, Mike?

                                 MIKE
                        No! No! No! What. No! 
                                 PHOEBE
                        We’re asking because we know you 
                        hacked the nanny cam when you were 
                        trying on Mike’s mom’s clothes. So 
                        help us or we tell. 

           Esther chuckles. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Ohhh. Look who’s tryna glow up into 
                        grown folks’ business... 

           Off Phoebe smiling...

           INT. SCHOOL ASSEMBLY - DAY 

           A NERDY TEACHER is leading a seminar about sexual safety, the 
           dangers of nudes, etc. 

           The students are intensely bored. 

                                 NERDY TEACHER
                        Kids. The thing about the Internet 
                        is it lasts forever and ever and 
                        ever and ever...and then you die. 
                        And it’ll be the thing people 
                        google at your funerals. Post a 
                        nude and it’s how you’ll be 
                        remembered for all time. By your 
                        grandchildren, by your employers, 
                        by your love interests when they 
                        google search you to make sure you 
                        have no priors... 

           Talia, Kylie, and Chelseigh sit in the audience, unbothered. 

                                 TALIA
                        Duh. Everyone should wanna be 
                        remembered when their body’s the 
                        hottest. 
                                 CHELSEIGH
                        Does my hair look more Taylor Swift 
                        or Lady Gaga?

           All of a sudden, the lights turn off.

                                 NERDY TEACHER
                        What’s going on? Ugh. Did Janet 
                        forget to pay the bill again? 

           He walks off. 

           A projector screen rolls down like a pop concert. It flashes 
           the name PHOEBE. Then goes dark. Then flashes again. 

           Lily Allen’s “Sheezus” begins. Phoebe starts strutting across 
           the stage.  

                                 LILY
                        Been here before, so I’m prepared. 
                        Not gonna lie low, I’m kinda 
                        scared. 

           AUDIENCE

           Kylie looks on, irritated. 

                                 KYLIE
                        What is she doing? 

           OFF STAGE

           We see Esther has managed to lock the TEACHERS out of the 
           auditorium. Gives Phoebe a thumbs up in the window. 

           STAGE

           Phoebe continues to dance like no one’s watching. 

                                 LILY
                        I’ll take the hits. Roll with the 
                        punches. I’ll get back up it’s not 
                        as if I’ve never done this. 

           OFF STAGE

           Mike controls the screen. We see various videos of Phoebe 
           imitating her favorite divas. Beyonce in FORMATION. Mariah. 
           Rihanna. Lady Gaga. Ariana Grande.

           STAGE

           Phoebe stands in the center. Starts singing. 
                                 PHOEBE
                        Riri isn’t scared of/Katy Perry’s

                        CROWN BITCH, I WANNA BE SHEEZUS. 

           AUDIENCE 

           They look dumbfounded. Is she serious? Kylie eyes Chase who’s 
           transfixed by the screen. More shots of DIVA PHOEBE. 

           STAGE

           Phoebe grows more confident in her dancing. 

           SCREEN 

           More footage of Phoebe. Now she’s going through a variety of 
           Beyonce 7/11-esque poses, but doing goofy things in each one. 

           The screen reads EMBRACE THE WEIRD. 

           BACKSTAGE 

           Esther struggles to hold the teachers back. Phoebe notices, 
           but doesn’t break.  

           AUDIENCE

           Kylie stares daggers at Phoebe. Phoebe smiles, marches right 
           up to her and sings in her face. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        I’m switching off. No longer 
                        listening. I’ve had enough of 
                        persecution and conditioning. 

           Kylie is momentarily stunned. Phoebe runs up to the stage. 

           SCREEN

           “Being a fan of Phoebe is being a fan of yourselves.”

           STAGE

           Phoebe stands in the middle of the stage. 
                                 LILY
                        It makes me angry, I’m serious/ But 
                        then again, I’m just about to get 
                        my period/ Periods, we all get

                        what the theory is. 

           A bunch of TAMPONS fall from the rafters. Phoebe starts 
           throwing them out into the audience. 

           AUDIENCE

           KIDS start cracking up, much to Kylie’s chagrin. 

           SCREEN

           The projector changes: “GOT MAXI-PADS?” 

           “You can’t shame someone who has no shame.”

           The lights cut off again. Phoebe freestyles. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        My name is Phoebe. It ain’t easy to 
                        be me. But what y’all don’t know is 
                        none of y’all can see me. Kylie 
                        says I’m banned, but I got another 
                        plan...Black and Jewish, but you 
                        can call me blewish. What’s wrong 
                        Ky? You’re lookin slightly fluish.

                        I don’t believe in Jesus, but I 
                        believe in Sheezus. Before y’all 
                        get excited, don’t worry you’re all 
                        invited...

                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
                        Oh great. There’s another one. 
                        Phone, please.

           Phoebe smiles. Hands over her phone. 

                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
                        You’re usually such a good kid, 
                        Phoebe. Because of that. You’ll 
                        just get detention. Was it worth 
                        it?

                                 PHOEBE
                        If I said no, that’d be a lie. I 
                        can’t lie while doing mitzvot. 

           Phoebe hears her phone blowing up across the desk. 

                                 PRINCIPAL 
                        Why would you do this?

                                 PHOEBE
                        To be Sheezus. 

           She smiles.

           CHYRON: 30 DAYS TO BAT MITZVAH
           INT./EXT. CAR - DAY 

           Phoebe and April are driving. 

                                 APRIL
                        You can’t break rules like the 
                        other kids, Phoebe. You have to 
                        be... 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Twice as good to get half as much. 
                        I know. I know. I know. But it’s 
                        not fair. It’s exhausting. 

           April looks at her for a beat. 

                                 APRIL
                        What’d that trife heifer Kylie’s 
                        face look like after you did it? 

           Phoebe smiles. April laughs. 

           INT. DELI - DAY 

           Sam sits across from Phoebe. Phoebe is enthralled by her 
           phone. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I have like 100 new followers. 

                                 SAM
                        Recite the Shema. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        And like 50 new likes on this 
                        picture. 

                                 SAM
                        That’s 5th grade level likes. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Stop hating. 

                                 SAM
                        Recite the Shema. God doesn’t care 
                        about your likes. 

           Phoebe continues scrolling. Sam snatches her phone. 

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Mitzvot #53 is to destroy idols and 
                        their accessories. I think we can 
                        agree a phone is an accessory. 
           Sam drops the phone in a cup of water. Phoebe screams. 
           Everyone stares, horrified. 

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        She’s fine. Her phone broke. 

           Everyone nods, understanding. 

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        You can’t scream like that, 
                        people’ll think I kidnapped you. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        My phone! 

           Sam looks at the phone in the cup of water. 

                                 SAM
                        That was an extremely absurd 
                        overreaction on my part. I’m gonna 
                        have to pay for that now. 

           CHYRON: 25 DAYS TO BAT MITZVAH

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY 

           Phoebe and Mike walk through the hallway. People are paying 
           attention to them this time. High-fives, head nods. Jay-Z’s 
           “SomewhereinAmerica” plays as they slo-mo walk with swag. 

           As they walk, people gossip and whisper around them. 

                                 GIRL 1
                        I heard she’s Drake’s cousin 
                        through black and Jewish geography.

                                 GIRL 2 
                        Her dad was like almost in the NBA. 

                                 BOY 1 
                        I like lip virgins. 

                                 GIRL 3 
                        I wonder if she can twerk. 

           Phoebe and Mike feel eyes on them. They look at each other. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Are we... 

                                 MIKE
                        Popular? 
           GIRL 3 scurries up to them, eagerly. 

                                 GIRL 3
                        Phoebe, can you teach me how to 
                        twerk?

                                 PHOEBE
                        No one twerks anymore. 

                                 GIRL 3
                        Oh. Ok. Oh. 

           Girl 3 walks away, bummed. She curses at herself.

                                 GIRL 3 (CONT’D)
                        That was about as cool as telling 
                        her I pluck my pubic hair. 

           Everyone stares at her. Chase walks by, he smiles at Phoebe. 

           Phoebe goes weak. Dizzy. Leans against a locker. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        He definitely smiled that time, 
                        right?

                                 MIKE
                        I dunno. He could also be 
                        constipated. 

           Phoebe glares at him when Stephanie the Diabetic approaches 
           Phoebe and Mike. She bows her head in shame. Doesn’t look 
           Phoebe in the eye when she speaks.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I’m sorry, Sheezus. Please forgive 
                        me. 

                                 MIKE
                        You should be sorry, Stephanie. 

           Stephanie bows to Phoebe. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Mike, shut up. You don’t have to 
                        bow, Stephanie, it’s weird. 

                                 STEPHANIE
                        I’m sorry. I’m just so sorry. Can I 
                        be invited to your Black Mitzvah?

                                 PHOEBE
                        Everyone’s invited. 
                                 STEPHANIE
                        Is it okay that I said 
                             (whispers)
                        black? 

                                 PHOEBE
                             (shakes her head)
                        Yes, Stephanie.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        What’s your give away? I heard 
                        Drake’s your Jewish cousin due to 
                        black and Jewish geography and he’s 
                        gonna perform. 

           Mike and Phoebe look at each other. 

                                 STEPHANIE (CONT’D)
                        What DJ did you get? Are you 
                        raffling stuff? What is a Black 
                        Mitzvah? 

           Stephanie’s ramblings fade into white noise as Phoebe grabs 
           Mike and runs to the bathroom. 

           INT. MEN’S BATHROOM - DAY 

           Phoebe and Mike stand in the men’s bathroom. Phoebe paces 
           while hyperventilating. 

                                 PHOEBE
                             (panicked)
                        Mike. I’m freaking out. 

                                 MIKE
                        You should be. You’re in the men’s 
                        bathroom.  

                                 PHOEBE
                        We didn’t plan anything! We were so 
                        focused on getting people to come! 
                        This Bat Mitzvah is gonna be weak 
                        as fuck. 

                                 MIKE
                        You’re right. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        You’re supposed to reassure me!
                                 MIKE
                        Nah, a real friend tells you the 
                        truth. This Bat Mitzvah is about to 
                        be weak as fuck. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        What are we gonna do?! I need 
                        someone to give me a sign. 

           She pulls her mezuzah off her neck. Rubs it like it’s a lucky 
           Buddha. Mike snatches it. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        Mike, don’t touch it! You’re gonna 
                        fuck up the vibe. 

                                 MIKE
                        Relax.

           A NERDY GUY walks into the bathroom. He and Phoebe look at 
           each other. 

           He SHRUGS and proceeds to start peeing in a urinal next to 
           Phoebe. He has horrible aim. Pee splashes onto her shoe. She 
           shrieks. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Mike. Is there pee on my shoes? 

           The Nerdy Guy shrugs while zipping. 

                                 NERDY GUY
                        It happens. 

           Phoebe snatches the mezuzah back. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Don’t question it again. 

           Phoebe walks out. 

           INT. PHOEBE’S PARENTS’ ROOM - NIGHT 

           Phoebe barges into her parents’ room. 

                                 LARRY
                        You gotta learn how to knock. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        You never knock. 

                                 APRIL
                        You don’t pay bills. 
                                 PHOEBE
                        Sooo, like, speaking of money. 
                        Everyone wants to come to my Bat 
                        Mitzvah. 

                                 APRIL
                        See! I told you.

                                 PHOEBE
                        I need like two hundred thousand 
                        dollars to cover Kanye’s or some 
                        lesser known rapper’s performance 
                        fee. 

           Her parents look at each other, they start CRACKING UP. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        I’m willing to forfeit my college 
                        fund for this. 

           They’re still laughing. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        Why can’t you throw money at me 
                        like all the other kids’ parents?!

           Larry reaches for some coins on the nightstand. He throws 
           them towards Phoebe. 

                                 LARRY 
                        There ya go, make it drizzle. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        You’re ruining my life!

           She walks out. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Phoebe is in bed scrolling through Instagram. Her followers 
           are growing. She sighs. Stressed. She clicks her DMs. 

           CHYRON COOLGUY13 DM: Maybe we’ll finally meet at your Bat 
           Mitzvah? 

           Phoebe hyperventilates. 

           INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY 

           Phoebe and Mike sit together at a table. 
                                 MIKE
                        We gotta step it way up, like you 
                        gotta give away laptops and shit. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        My dad won’t even do iPads, he 
                        called it reverse reparations. 

           Kylie walks in with Talia and Chelseigh. They start handing 
           out elaborate invitations to everyone emblazoned with 
           “Kylie’s Super Sweet Half Birthday.” 

           She walks over to Phoebe. 

                                 KYLIE
                        Sorry, Phoebe. I’d invite you, but 
                        it’s on the same day as your little 
                        Bat Mitzvah. 

           Kylie turns to all the kids in the cafeteria. 

                                 KYLIE (CONT’D)
                        This will be even better than my 
                        last party. Expect special guests. 
                        I understand if you want to go to 
                        Phoebe’s, but choose wisely, my 
                        personal family friend Britney is 
                        flying in. 

           Stephanie the Diabetic is intrigued.

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Britney who?

           Mike scoffs at Stephanie.  

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t come to me next time you need 
                        a sugar boost, Stephanie.  

                                 KYLIE
                        The Britney.

                                 TALIA AND CHELSEIGH
                        It’s Britney, bitch. 

                                 KYLIE
                             (to Phoebe)
                        Oops. I did it again. 

           Everyone GASPS. Phoebe glares at Kylie. 
                                 STEPHANIE
                             (to Phoebe)
                        Sorry, Sheezus. 

           Kylie stands on a chair. 

                                 KYLIE
                        Thank you all. For being fans. For 
                        being supporters. 

           Phoebe places a chair in front of Kylie. Phoebe stands up, 
           blocking her. Mike looks at her, dumbfounded. 

                                 MIKE
                        What are you doing? We haven’t 
                        agreed on any impromptu speeches.

                                 PHOEBE
                        That’s really beautiful, Kylie. And 
                        Imma let you finish in a minute, 
                        but I’m about to have the best Bat 
                        Mitzvah of all time. 

                                 STEPHANIE
                        Who’s gonna beat Britney, bitch?

                                 PHOEBE
                        Kanye Omari West. As you know, 
                        Drake is my cousin through black 
                        and Jewish geography. Drake will be 
                        on tour, but he put in a call to 
                        Ye. I actually personally squashed 
                        the petty feuding they’ve been 
                        doing the past few years. If you’d 
                        prefer Kylie’s bland, flavorless, 
                        mayonnaise-drenched party to mine. 
                        That’s a “you” problem. 

           Everyone GASPS, including Mike. 

                                 MIKE
                        Have you lost your mind?

           Phoebe steps down, leaving a shell-shocked Kylie standing up 
           on her chair. Talia and Chelseigh look at Kylie, then at 
           Phoebe. 

                                 TALIA
                        I’d rather see Kanye. 

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        Do you think he’ll bring Kim? 
           Kylie is enraged, Phoebe smiles. Her work here has been done. 
           She walks out. Trailed by Mike.

           INT. MIKE’S ROOM - DAY 

           They sit in front of Esther who is cracking up. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Y’all... 

           She can’t stop laughing. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Esther, it’s not funny! 

                                 ESTHER
                        I mean I got a friend who does 
                        improv... 

           Mike and Phoebe look at each other.

           INT. IMPROV CLASS - DAY 

           Esther, Phoebe, and Mike walk into the improv class. They 
           stand in the back and watch while RAY (30s, black, think Jay 
           Pharoah) is performing with a MOROSE GIRL (20s). 

                                 RAY
                             (licks lips, a la Denzel 
                              Washington)
                        So I’m Denzel Washington, and it’s 
                        panty-dropping season. Like cuffing 
                        season but for panties, because... 
                        did you know I am Denzel 
                        Washington?

                                 MOROSE GIRL
                        I mean, I know you’re not Denzel. 

                                 RAY
                        Damn it, girl. You’re not supposed 
                        to say no in improv! 

                                 MOROSE GIRL
                        I’m a woman. I should be able to 
                        say no whenever I want to. 

           Ray walks off the stage, frustrated. He spots Esther in the 
           corner. 
                                 RAY 
                        Yo...was wondering what happened to 
                        you after-- 

           Esther abruptly cuts him off. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Not in front of the kids, Ray. 
                        Damn. 

           Ray spots the kids. 

                                 RAY
                        You didn’t kidnap them did you?

                                 ESTHER
                        I’m a nanny. Side hustle. 

                                 MIKE
                        Are you guys done eye-banging yet?

           Ray and Esther look at each other awkwardly. Phoebe steps in. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Can you do a Kanye impression? Are 
                        you funny? Tell a joke. 

                                 RAY
                        Girl, you can’t just be askin’ 
                        people to tell jokes on command. I 
                        ain’t a dog. 

                                 MIKE
                             (to Esther)
                        Why’d you bring us to this whack 
                        place? 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Yeah we don’t have time for him to 
                        pretend he’s funny. Who is he even?  

           Ray is scandalized. 

                                 RAY
                             (a la Kanye)
                        I’m a God. I already told you who I 
                        think I am. A God, huh?! Don’t tell 
                        me I ain’t funny, huh?! Who you 
                        think gave Zuckerberg the idea for 
                        Facebook, huh?! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RAY (CONT'D)
                        Was supposed to be called face-ye, 
                        where I decide if people are good 
                        enough to be friends with 
                        Beyoncé...who I’m not speaking to 
                        because she ain’t come to my 
                        wedding, fam. HUH!!

           Phoebe smiles at Mike. 

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                             (a la Jay-Z)
                        Sorry fam, we ain’t come to the 
                        wedding cuz we got stuck in an 
                        elevator. 

           Ray does the Jay-Z laugh. 

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                             (a la Chris Rock)
                        That’s a lie, Ye. He got a billion 
                        dollars. He knows how to get his 
                        ass out an elevator if he wants to!

                                 PHOEBE
                        Omg. We can give him tons of outfit 
                        changes and up the special guests. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Told y’all. Don’t sleep on the kid. 

                                 RAY 
                        What y’all plannin? Sounds like 
                        some Eyes Wide Shut shit. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I need you to pretend to be Kanye 
                        at my Bat Mitzvah and whoever else 
                        you can impersonate. We’ll turn the 
                        lights down low and pretend you 
                        have an allergy to UV rays. 

                                 RAY
                        I have a performance fee for that. 

                                 MIKE
                        For what? You’re barely doing 
                        improv. 

                                 RAY 
                        You think I’m gonna come out to the 
                        suburbs for free?! Last black dude 
                        I knew who drove to Lake Forest 
                        never came back.
                                 PHOEBE
                        Prolly because he got lost in white 
                        girls. I’ll give you a cut of some 
                        of my Bat Mitzvah money.

           Ray gives Phoebe the once-over. 

                                 RAY 
                        I’ll take your Yeezys. 

           Phoebe chokes. 

                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        I need to pay rent. I’ll take the 
                        Yeezys up front. 

           Phoebe looks at Mike, then Esther. Off her look... 

           EXT. IMPROV CLASS - NIGHT

           Ray limps out wearing Phoebe’s Yeezys which are clearly way 
           too small for him. He turns to Phoebe.  

                                 RAY 
                             (a la Bernie Mac)
                        Pleasure doin business with y’all 
                        summamabitches. 

           Phoebe walks barefoot to Esther’s car. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        This better be worth it. 

           CHYRON: 20 DAYS TO BAT MIZVAH

           MONTAGE

           Phoebe walks through school. POP FLASHES OF FACEBOOK ALERTS 
           ANNOUNCING PHOEBE’S GUESTS: Kanye, Jay-Z, Chris Rock, etc. 

           Each day she becomes cooler and cooler and cooler. High-
           fives. Head nods. Birthday invites. Phoebe is loving life.

           Kylie notes Talia and Chelseigh looking at Phoebe longingly. 

           Meanwhile, Phoebe looks longingly at Chase while Kylie chats 
           him up. Kylie glares at Phoebe. 

           END MONTAGE
           INT. DELI - DAY

           Sam sits across from Phoebe. 

                                 SAM
                        So as you’re getting ready to 
                        receive an aliyah... 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Being called up is just a big 
                        performance. I need to crush it in 
                        front of everyone to seal my 
                        popularity. 

                                 SAM 
                        Phoebe. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        When you listen to Robyn which song 
                        do you think came first? “Dancing 
                        on My Own,” “Hang with Me,” or 
                        “Call Your Girlfriend”? 

                                 SAM
                        Becoming a Bat Mitzvah isn’t about 
                        likes, or Facebook invites, or give 
                        aways... although I do plan to 
                        collect one of those Life Of Phoebe 
                        joints. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I think it was “Hang with Me” 
                        first, when she became friends with 
                        a guy. Then “Dancing on My Own”... 
                        she had to watch him kiss his 
                        girlfriend. Then “Call Your 
                        Girlfriend,” she finally told him 
                        like it’s time for you to glow up 
                        and be with me. 

                                 SAM
                        Are you glorifying adultery? That’s 
                        not in your mitzvot. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Chase shouldn’t be with Kylie. 

           Phoebe takes out her phone and starts scrolling through 
           Instagram. Her face is detached, unemotional as she blindly 
           likes things, commenting things like “get it girl, yaaaasssss 
           queen, AMAZE HEART.” 
                                 SAM
                        One of the lessons here is not to 
                        seek revenge on people. Pete 
                        Dennison stuck my head in a toilet 
                        in seventh grade and what did I do? 
                        Nothing, because we forgive, work 
                        to understand others. So I turned 
                        the other cheek.

           Phoebe barely looks up from her phone. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        And how’d that work out for you?

                        He punched the other cheek. 

           Off Phoebe’s look... 

           INT. MALL - DAY 

           Phoebe and Mike are walking through the mall when Talia and 
           Chelseigh approach. 

                           TALIA
                                                        CHELSEIGH
           Hey. 
                                              Hi. 

           Phoebe and Mike look at each other. 

                                 MIKE
                        Are you talking to us? 

           Talia positions her body between Mike and Phoebe. 

                                 TALIA
                        So like. I’m sorry for all those 
                        times I was rude to you. 

                                 MIKE
                        What about me?

           Chelseigh also positions herself between Mike and Phoebe. 

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        I’m also sorry. Like I’ve always 
                        thought you were so funny. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Really?

                                 TALIA
                        Yeah SO funny. 
                                 CHELSEIGH
                        I heard Adam has a crush on you. 

           Phoebe’s heart flutters. She tries to play it cool, but lets 
           out a giggle. Not cool. Mike glares at her. 

                                 MIKE
                        Phoebe doesn’t care.

                                 TALIA
                        No one cares about you either. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Stop Mike, they’re being nice. Sam 
                        says becoming a Bat Mitzvah is also 
                        learning when to forgive. 

           Off Mike scandalized... 

           INT. PHOEBE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Phoebe scrolls through a bunch of dumb shit on Instagram. 
           Refreshes her page which goes down a follower. She touches 
           her hand to her chest, outraged. 

           She opens her laptop. 

           She writes an e-mail. Voiceover as she types. 

                                 PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        Dear Kanye (or his assistant or 
                        manager although he cannot be 
                        managed). My name is Phoebe 
                        Johnson. I don’t think you’ve seen 
                        my videos, but it would mean so 
                        much to me if you came to my Bat 
                        Mitzvah. I hired a fake because 
                        white people can’t tell black 
                        people apart anyway, but it’s not 
                        the same. No one in this world 
                        understands me, but when I turn on 
                        College Dropout or Twisted Fantasy 
                        or 808s or Yeezus...I feel like you 
                        do. Your ego is the steam I use to 
                        power my dreams. When no one else 
                        believes in me, you’re always right 
                        there, giving me the confidence I 
                        need to believe in myself. To 
                        remember that no one man should 
                        have all that power. To not let 
                        people tell me how to feel. To be 
                        me... Phoebe. And remember to love 
                        myself no matter what. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PHOEBE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        If I had a dying wish, it’d be for 
                        you to be there when I become a Bat 
                        Mitzvah. It’s down to the wire, but 
                        you’ve made it through the wire 
                        before... Thanks for listening, 
                        Phoebe “Sheezus” Johnson. 

           Phoebe sits in bed with her laptop. Her phone beeps. 

           CHYRON COOLGUY13 DM: Heyyyy 

           CHYRON PHOEBE DM: I think my aliyah is gonna be a disaster. 

           CHYRON COOLGUY 13 DM: No you’re gonna crush it. Plus KANYE!

           Off Phoebe’s forlorn expression... 

           POP FLASH GROUP TEXT: “Party at my place this 
           weekend...parents out of town bitches. BOUT TO GO APESHIT!” 

           Phoebe smiles, her first party invite.  

           EXT. TOWN - DAY 

           Mike and Phoebe walk while eating french fries. Mike takes a 
           bite of his hamburger and gags. 

                                 MIKE
                        The cashier is trolling, she keeps 
                        putting pickles on my burgers when 
                        I specifically said no pickles. And 
                        you can’t pick them off. There’s 
                        residue! 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Are you going to Chris’s party? 
                             (off Mike’s blank 
                              expression)
                        Group text about my parents are 
                        gonna be outta town bitchesssss! 

                                 MIKE
                        I didn’t get a text. 

           Very awkward silence. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Did you get a text? 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Huh? 
                                 MIKE
                        You can’t lie while you’re doing 
                        mitzvot! You got a text that I 
                        didn’t get! 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Relax. He prob didn’t have your 
                        number. You can still come.

           They continue walking, but Mike is clearly perturbed. POP 
           FLASH TEXT FROM TALIA: “Get ready for Chris’s at my place?” 

                                 MIKE
                        Who was that?!

                                 PHOEBE
                        Nobody. 

           She puts her phone in her pocket. Mike takes his phone out. 
           No messages. 

           INT. FOYER - DAY 

           Phoebe runs into her house. Hears April SCREAM. Phoebe runs 
           towards the kitchen.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           April is in the kitchen scooping up melted skin wax from the 
           floor. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        What are you doing?

                                 APRIL
                        I spilled all this hundred dollar 
                        wax on the floor! Help me before it 
                        gets hard! 

           Phoebe scoops wax from the floor onto her mom’s chin while 
           shaking her head. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Can I go to Talia’s?

                                 APRIL
                        Where’s Mike?

                                 PHOEBE
                        He’s at home. We don’t do 
                        everything together. 
                                 APRIL
                        Do you even like Talia? You told me 
                        she was a dusty ass witch when you 
                        were eight. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        People change. I mean four years 
                        ago I thought Macklemore was cool. 

           April looks at Phoebe, concerned. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        I’m forgiving her. That’s what 
                        becoming a Bat Mitzvah is about. 
                        Learning to forgive.

                                 APRIL
                             (skeptical)
                        Okay... 

           Phoebe rips the wax off April’s chin. April YELPS. 

                                 APRIL (CONT’D)
                        I’m not forgiving that. 

           INT. TALIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Phoebe sits on Talia’s bed while Chelseigh and Talia try on 
           different shirts. Talia watches as Chelseigh cycles through 
           shirt after shirt. 

                                 TALIA
                        Not enough cleav. 

           Talia turns to Phoebe. 

                                 TALIA (CONT’D)
                        You don’t wanna borrow something? 
                        Adam likes boobs... 

           She takes out a shirt and screams. 

                                 TALIA (CONT’D)
                        My sister is such a fucking bitch, 
                        she stretches out all my clothes. 

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        So rude. Phoebe, maybe it’d fit 
                        you?

           Rude. Phoebe is offended. Talia pulls out a box of condoms. 
           Off Phoebe’s look...
                                 TALIA
                             (re: condoms)
                        I stole them from CVS. 

           She pulls out a few, then takes a pair of jeans out of the 
           closet. Stuffs the condoms in the pockets. 

                                 TALIA (CONT’D)
                        Wait til mom finds these in your 
                        pants, bitch. 

           She tosses the jeans into a dirty clothes hamper. Then 
           refocuses on Phoebe. 

                                 TALIA (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, you have huge boobs, you 
                        should show them more. 

           Phoebe looks down at her chest self-consciously. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        No, thanks.

                                 TALIA
                        How far have you gone?

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        You can tell us. 

                                 TALIA
                        Yeah. You can like totally trust 
                        us. Kylie was lying about that lip 
                        virgin thing, right? She’s a 
                        chronic liar. 

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        I’ve been to 2nd base-ish. 

                                 TALIA
                        What about the handy you gave Matt?

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        That was over clothes. 

           They look at Phoebe who looks terrified. 

                                 CHELSEIGH (CONT’D)
                        Is it true that black guys have 
                        bigger dicks? 

                                 TALIA
                        Omg, yeah. Is it?
           Phoebe looks at her phone. It RINGS! Thank God. She runs out. 
           The girls shrug.

                        That was a test! You’re at Talia’s. 
                        Your mom just told me.  

                                 PHOEBE
                        She’s a traitor. 

                                 MIKE
                        Why didn’t you tell me you were 
                        going to Talia’s?

                                 PHOEBE
                        Get off my jock, Mike! We don’t 
                        have to do everything together!

           Mike collapses onto his bed, scandalized. 

                                 MIKE
                        Touch my hand to my motherfucking 
                        chest. What did you say?! 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I mean, we’re talking about women’s 
                        issues. Stuff I can’t talk to you 
                        about.

                        supportive of your cramps. So I’ll 
                        forgive this friendship 
                        transgression. But don’t let it 
                        happen again. How’s Talia? She 
                        talking about me? I feel like she 
                        secretly wants me. 

           Phoebe rolls her eyes. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        You are distracting me from my 
                        creative process. 

                                 MIKE
                        What? 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I’m reinventing. 

           Phoebe hangs up on Mike. She looks in the mirror. Studies 
           herself and all of her imperfections. Pinches her waist. 
           Looks at her pores. Pokes her chest. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        Why do guys like these, they’re 
                        literally sacks of fat. 

           She keeps poking, then walks back into...

           INT. TALIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Chelseigh and Talia scroll through Insta. 

                                 TALIA 
                        What an uggo. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Can I borrow the shirt? 

           Talia hands it to Phoebe. Phoebe puts it on. Looks in the 
           mirror. Doesn’t look right. Keeps pulling the sides down. 
                                 TALIA
                        I die for this look. Let’s go 
                        bitches. 

           EXT. CHRIS’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Phoebe arrives with Chelseigh and Talia. Mike’s waiting 
           outside. Phoebe tugs down her shirt uncomfortably. 

                                 MIKE
                        You’re an hour late. And what are 
                        you wearing? Aren’t you cold? 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Mike. Be cool. No one comes to 
                        things on time.

           Chelseigh and Talia look at Mike. 

                                 MIKE
                        Hey. 

           They look at him but don’t answer. Talia rings the doorbell. 
           CHRIS (pre-teen douche) answers. 

                                 CHRIS
                        What up, homies. What’s the happs 
                        on the craps? 

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        You’re so funny. 

           Talia and Chelseigh giggle. They walk in. Chris takes in 
           Phoebe’s outfit, he smiles. Phoebe keeps tugging the sides of 
           her shirt down. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Hey girl. You lookin straight fire. 

                                 MIKE
                             (to Phoebe)
                        He’s talking straight douche. 

           Phoebe walks in, followed by Mike, but Chris blocks Mike. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Nah. We’re at capacity. 

                                 MIKE
                        Capacity for what? Brain cells?

           Chris turns to Phoebe. 
                                 CHRIS
                        You can stay, but he’s not coming. 

           Phoebe hears laughter downstairs. Looks at Mike. 

                                 MIKE
                        Aight, let’s roll out. I don’t 
                        wanna be apart of that fake shit 
                        anyway. 

           Mike walks away. Turns right, then left. Realizes he’s 
           talking to himself. Phoebe stands in the doorway. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        You’re just gonna leave me standing 
                        out here like Chris’s limp dick? 

           Phoebe’s torn. Mike marches back to the door. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I mean I guess if you really want 
                        me to leave the first party with 
                        guys in it that I’ve ever been 
                        invited to in solidarity... 

                                 MIKE
                        That’s exactly what I want.

                                 PHOEBE
                        Sorry. I wanna stay... 

           Chris shuts the door, leaving Mike outside alone. 

                                 MIKE
                        Phoebe! Phoebe! Fuck that, I’ll 
                        have a party by myself. 

           Another CHRIS LACKEY walks up to the door and gives Mike the 
           onceover. 

                                 CHRIS LACKEY 
                        Have fun with your hand tonight, 
                        needle dick. 

           INT. PARTY - NIGHT

           Phoebe and the other kids sit around a basement. Talia drinks 
           out of a solo cup while dancing to some angsty, too-grown-for-
           her shit like Lana Del Rey. 

           Phoebe shivers. Spots a blanket in the corner and wraps 
           herself with it. She sits in the corner next to Chelseigh. 
           Some GIRLS twerk for a couple GUYS in the corner. Phoebe is 
           hating all of this. 

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        Do you think I should go blonder?

                                 PHOEBE
                        No...

           Chelseigh looks at her cracked iPhone. 

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        Ugh. This ghetto ass phone. 

           Phoebe stares at her. 

                                 CHELSEIGH (CONT’D)
                        What? 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I hate the word ghetto. 

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        Why? You’re not ghetto. 

           Phoebe looks around, desperate for escape. Chase walks in. 
           Phoebe watches him, Chelseigh follows her gaze. He walks up 
           to Phoebe.

                                 CHASE
                        Where’s Mike? 

                                 PHOEBE
                             (defensive)
                        At his house. We don’t have to do 
                        everything together! Where’s Kylie? 

                                 CHASE
                             (defensive)
                        I don’t know. I barely talk to 
                        Kylie. 

                                 PHOEBE
                             (harsher than intended)
                        Lies. 

           Phoebe stares at him. Talia interrupts them. 

                                 TALIA 
                             (to Phoebe)
                        I dare you to take a hit off this.

           She hands Phoebe a rolled joint. Phoebe hesitates.
                                 PHOEBE
                        What will it do to me?

                                 TALIA
                        Make you forget about everything 
                        that stresses you out. Like my 
                        bitch sister. 

           Chris puts his arm around Phoebe.

                                 CHRIS
                        Can guys really eat your ass like a 
                        cupcake? Like the Nicki Minaj song 
                        says? Like is it different?? I’ve 
                        always wanted to know. 

                                 PHOEBE
                             (off Chris, to Talia)
                        Give it to me. 

           Still hesitant. Phoebe looks at Chase. Imagines him and Kylie 
           kissing. Then looks at the joint. Chelseigh snickers. 

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        Relax, it’s organic. 

                                 TALIA
                        I mean you can go home with Mike... 

           Phoebe inspects the joint. Talia lights it. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Has anyone else’s mouth been on 
                        this? 

                                 TALIA
                        No. 

                                 CHRIS
                        Can’t say the same bout my dick, 
                        right Talia?

                                 TALIA
                        Shut the fuck up, Chris. 

           Phoebe takes the joint. Eyes it, takes a modest inhale. 
           Starts coughing. It’s awful. She takes another, coughs. Talia 
           laughs. 

                                 TALIA (CONT’D)
                        Do you feel it?
                                 PHOEBE
                        I just smoked weed. I just smoked 
                        weed. I just smoked weed.

           She looks at Chase. Is he frowning? Her heart beats faster. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        Why isn’t this making me relaxed? 

                                 TALIA
                        Tell us something you hate about 
                        Mike. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I don’t hate anything about Mike. 

           She looks around. Do people’s heads look bigger? She looks at 
           her phone. 

           PHOEBE’S PHONE

           Its background, a Marugame TEDDY BEAR from the LATE 
           REGISTRATION cover art, blasts from its spaceship and winks 
           at her. 

           BACK TO SCENE

           Talia smiles. 

                                 TALIA
                        I heard Mike say your Black Mitzvah 
                        was gonna be weak as fuck. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        He said what? 

                                 TALIA
                        He also said he’s only friends with 
                        you because he has no one else to 
                        talk to...

           This is landing on Phoebe. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Well. You know what, I don’t need 
                        Mike. He needs me. I’m trying to 
                        take my game to the next level. I’m 
                        next level. Mike is down level. 

           Talia reveals Mike via Facetime. Turns the phone around. 

                                 MIKE
                        Oh no you fucking did not. 
                                 TALIA
                        Bye, Mike! 

           She clicks off. Phoebe looks shell-shocked. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Shit. Shit. Shit. 

                                 TALIA
                        Relax. I just did you a favor. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        That wasn’t me. It was the weed!

           She looks around, feels like everyone is staring at her in a 
           highly aggressive way...paranoia. Hears music. 

           Phoebe shakes it off. Was the music in her head? 

                                 CHRIS
                             (to Phoebe)
                        You all right boo? You look like my 
                        nig Malcolm-- 

                                 PHOEBE
                        What did you just say? 

           Chelseigh drapes herself over Chris. 

                                 CHRIS
                        You all right? 

                                 PHOEBE
                        No the other part. 

                                 CHRIS
                        My nig Malcolm?

           Phoebe looks at Chelseigh. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        You let him say that around you?

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        “You all right boo?” 

                                 PHOEBE
                        No! “My nig.”

           Chris raises his hand for a high-five.

                                 CHRIS
                        Yeeeessss! My nig! 
           Chelseigh laughs.

                                 PHOEBE
                        Chelseigh! You’re black! 

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        Ok, Phoebe. You’re high. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        One day you’re gonna have to come 
                        out as a black person. I’m not 
                        gonna be the person to out you... 
                        Mike said that. I miss Mike. 

           Phoebe walks away while Chris looks at her. 

                                 CHRIS
                        I thought you were Italian. 
                             (beat, then)
                        Can I eat your ass like a cupcake?

           Chelseigh removes his arm from her shoulder. Walks away. 

           EXT. CHRIS’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Phoebe exits the house. She takes several breaths of air when 
           she spots a pair of feet standing beneath her. She comes face 
           to face with Kylie. 

                                 KYLIE
                        So everyone’s just hanging out 
                        without me? Like you’re the new me. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Kylie...I can’t with you right now.

                                 KYLIE
                        No one even invited me. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        If it makes you feel better, it 
                        sucks in there and I think I lost 
                        my best friend in the whole world. 

           Kylie grabs Phoebe and leads her over to a secluded treehouse 
           in the backyard. 

           INT. TREEHOUSE - NIGHT 

           Phoebe looks woozy. 
                                 PHOEBE
                        I don’t feel well and I feel like 
                        you’re about to murder me.

                                 KYLIE
                        Cancel your Bat Mitzvah.

                                 PHOEBE
                        I can’t cancel becoming a woman. 

                                 KYLIE
                        You don’t need it. You’re like 
                        totally fine being a weirdo who no 
                        one invites anywhere. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Everyone’s weird. And that’s not 
                        true. Mike invites me places.  

           Phoebe is a little unsteady, she takes a seat. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        I think Mike may never speak to me 
                        again. 

                                 KYLIE
                        See! Someone who cares about what 
                        people think wouldn’t be friends 
                        with Mike! 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I think I lost my person. 

                                 KYLIE
                        Cancel your Bat Mitzvah. 

           Phoebe stands. Still unsteady. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I have to find Mike. 

                                 KYLIE
                        You’re literally the only person I 
                        know who won’t just do what I say.

           Phoebe tries to move past her but Kylie blocks her. A beat 
           while they stare at each other. Kylie looks nervous. Phoebe 
           looks nauseous.

                                 KYLIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re really pretty. 
                                 PHOEBE
                        Is this reverse psychology? I’m not 
                        cancelling my party. Why do I feel 
                        so sick? And panicky? And paranoid.  
                        I mean I’m usually paranoid but now 
                        I’m REALLY paranoid and can’t stop 
                        talking for some reason. Like do 
                        you know how hard it is to be black 
                        and Jewish? Jay-Z says I should 
                        aspire to wealth because I’m black 
                        and society thinks we’re not 
                        supposed to have generational 
                        wealth. But THEN my Jewish side 
                        says that’s a stereotype and I 
                        should be mad at rap lyrics that 
                        think Jewish prosperity is a 
                        compliment. I’m fucked. 

           Kylie kisses Phoebe. Shocking Phoebe. They part. Awkward 
           silence. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        Did we just-- 

                                 KYLIE
                        I just assumed because you’ve never 
                        had a boyfriend that maybe... 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I thought you liked Chase?

                                 KYLIE
                        Don’t fucking tell anybody about 
                        this. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Are you--

                                 KYLIE
                        SHUT UP. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        It’s okay, you can trust me. I 
                        think this is great...even though 
                        you’re a raging bitch to me most of 
                        the time, but...OH MY GOD. Is this 
                        why you’re a raging bitch to me 
                        most of the time?! 

           Phoebe has FLASHES of all the times Kylie has paid too much 
           attention to her, now realizing all of Kylie’s glares were 
           really the lingering glances of an unrequited crush. 
                                 KYLIE
                        SHUT UP. SHUT UP. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Kylie. It’s ok. I won’t tell 
                        anyone. 

                                 KYLIE
                        Tell anybody and I’ll chop your 
                        body into tiny pieces and dump you 
                        into Lake Michigan. 

           Kylie runs out. Phoebe walks away, shocked. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Phoebe is walking home. Everything she sees and hears looks 
           menacing. Car lights. Dogs barking. Scared, she dials Mike. 
           Goes to voicemail. She tries again. Goes to voicemail. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Mike, I’m having an out-of-body, 
                        near death experience and I really 
                        need you. How would you feel if I 
                        died? And you ignored the call? And 
                        this was the last voicemail you 
                        ever had from me? And you just had 
                        to play it over and over for the 
                        rest of your life and think “why 
                        didn’t I answer the call?” Stop 
                        declining. 

           She hangs up. Mike calls right back. Phoebe answers.

                                 MIKE
                        If you’re dying, you should call 
                        911. Bye. 

           Phoebe looks around, alone. She dials another number. 

           INT. MIKE’S MOM’S CLOSET - NIGHT

           Esther tries on Mike’s mom’s clothes. Her phone rings. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Yo. 

           EXT. STREET - INTERCUT

           Phoebe whispers into the phone. 
                                 PHOEBE
                        Esther...I’m high. Please help. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Phoebe, you’re HIGH?! 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Shhhhhhhhh. Shhhhhhh. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Mike says he’s not speaking to you, 
                        this is crossing enemy lines. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        How would you feel if I died on 
                        this street and you were my last 
                        call? 

           Esther sighs. Looks at herself in Mike’s mom’s full length 
           mirror. Off Esther... 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Esther rolls up on Phoebe sitting on the curb, clutching her 
           knees to her chest. 

                                 ESTHER
                        You look a mess. 

           Phoebe runs into the car. 

           INT./EXT. CAR - NIGHT 

           Phoebe gets in and buckles her seat belt. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Drive really slow. My parents are 
                        gonna kill me. 

                                 ESTHER
                        What did you take? 

           Phoebe fishes around in her pocket. Pulls out the joint. 
           Esther pulls over. Sniffs it. She unrolls it. Takes a deeeeep 
           inhale. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Be careful! It’s powerful. 

           Phoebe looks out the window. 
                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        I’m so scared, Esther. 

           Esther starts CRACKING up. 

                                 ESTHER
                        This is oregano. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        No it’s not, it’s weed. 

                                 ESTHER
                        It’s oregano. You smoked spaghetti 
                        spice. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Then why did I get paranoid and 
                        panicky and puke? 

           Phoebe’s phone beeps. Talia has posted a live story of Phoebe 
           with the caption: Your Sheezus got oregano’d. Comments stream 
           in: LOL, cry face emoji, so lame. 

           Talia posts another photo, a selfie with the caption: “WATCH 
           THE QUEEN CONQUER.” 

           Phoebe shuts off her phone. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        They didn’t want to be my friend. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Of course not, fool. Ya prolly got 
                        panicky because you screwed over 
                        Mike for those shit stains. 

           Phoebe looks out the window, crushed. Mike pulls up besides 
           them on his bike. Esther rolls down the window. 

                                 MIKE
                        OH! Et tu, Brutus?! 

                                 ESTHER
                        Reads Shakespeare one got damn 
                        time. 

                                 MIKE
                        Tell her to get out of the car. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Mike, I’m not leaving a woman out 
                        on the street corner. 
                                 PHOEBE
                        I’m not a woman for another 2 
                        weeks. 

                                 MIKE
                        She’s a fake-ass friend who has to 
                        hire fake-ass impersonators to get 
                        fake-ass people to come to her fake-
                        ass party filled with fake-ass 
                        people.

           They’re at a stoplight. Before Phoebe can respond, Mike 
           speeds away on his bike. 

           Esther starts driving again, as she rounds the corner, REVEAL 
           Kylie around the corner, listening to everything and smiling. 

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 

           Phoebe walks in. Everyone points and laughs. There are fliers 
           posted everywhere depicting a mugshot of a fake Kanye with 
           the caption...”Phoebe hired a Fake Ye.” 

           Everyone laughs, Phoebe is mortified. She runs to Mike’s 
           locker. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        How could you?! 

                                 MIKE
                        How could I what? Leave you outside 
                        a party by yourself?

                                 PHOEBE
                        So you’re mad at me and want to 
                        ruin my party? You told! 

                                 MIKE
                        I’d never tell. I’m a good friend. 
                        I might speak too loudly on street 
                        corners, but I’d never 
                        intentionally tell. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        You have to fix it! 

                                 MIKE
                        Nah. You got new friends now, let 
                        them fix it. 

           Mike walks away. Talia and Chelseigh walk by Phoebe. 
                          TALIA  
                                                        CHELSEIGH
           You’re expired.
                                              You’re expired. 

           They snicker and walk off. 

           INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - DAY 

           Phoebe sits in the stall by herself. She logs onto Insta. Her 
           followers plummet. She has one DM. 

           CHYRON COOLGUY13 DM: That was messed up. What you did to 
           Mike. 

           CHYRON PHOEBE DM: Ok. So this WAS Mike all along? 

           CHYRON COOLGUY13 DM: You were just like Kylie all along... 

           Phoebe logs out. Looks overwhelmed. 

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 

           Phoebe sits alone. People act like there’s a force field 
           around her table. She waves at people. They either ignore 
           her, laugh, or point with disdain. She’s jittery. 

           Mike enters. Spots Phoebe. Sits FAR away. Phoebe snaps. She 
           stands up on the table and paces.  

                                 PHOEBE
                        No one appreciates me! I’m like a 
                        vessel to awesomeness and you’re 
                        all just sheep to Kylie’s mind 
                        control. You think I’m fake?! She’s 
                        the fake. She--

           Kylie stops in her tracks. Nervous. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        She’s not awesome. And I don’t care 
                        if you don’t wanna come to my 
                        party. My whole life! I’ve been in 
                        pursuit of happiness like Kid Cudi. 
                        I’m dope. I do dope shit. 

           Everyone stares at her like she’s crazy. A beat, while it 
           sinks in that she’s yelling on a table. She faints. 
           Everything goes black. 
           INT. PHOEBE’S BASEMENT - DAY 

           Phoebe sits in her basement in darkness. Larry comes down and 
           sits with her. 

                                 LARRY
                        Your mother is worried about you. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        And you’re not?

                                 LARRY
                        Depends. You gonna tell me what got 
                        you sent home for exhaustion?

                                 PHOEBE
                        Nothing. 

                                 LARRY
                        Alright. I know being black can be 
                        exhausting. 

           They sit there together in silence. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I was mean to Mike. 

                                 LARRY
                        Apologize. 

           Phoebe reaches in her pocket. Hands Larry her mezuzah. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I don’t deserve this. I also smoked 
                        oregano because I thought it was 
                        weed. So technically I didn’t smoke 
                        weed, but the impulse was there. 

                                 LARRY
                        That’s the dumbest shit I’ve ever 
                        heard you say. And you’ve said some 
                        dumb shit.  

                                 PHOEBE
                        I wanted to fit in. 

                                 LARRY
                        So you smoked the spice cabinet. 
                        What’s next? Free-basing basil?  
                        What did I tell you when I gave you 
                        this? 

           Larry looks at the mezuzah. 
                                 PHOEBE
                        Don’t let white people tell me how 
                        to feel. 

                                 LARRY
                        And what did you do? 

           Phoebe is silent for a beat. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Let them trick me into smoking 
                        oregano. Are you gonna tell Mommy? 

                                 LARRY
                        No. She’ll think it was her fault 
                        for dropping you on your head that 
                        one time. 

           She hits him. He laughs. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        No one’s good all the time. People 
                        mess up, even the greats. Lebron 
                        has off games, Barack Obama didn’t 
                        become Barack til’ he met Michelle, 
                        and don’t get me started on that 
                        knucklehead Kanye. But they get 
                        back up because nobody great makes 
                        it to greatness by being mediocre 
                        and following people around. 

           They continue to sit and stare in silence. 

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        Your friendship with Mike? That’s 
                        not a mediocre friendship.

                                 PHOEBE
                        He hates me. 

                                 LARRY
                        You’ll figure it out. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        How do you know? 

           Larry hands Phoebe the mezuzah. 

                                 LARRY 
                        Because I know. 

           He walks out. Leaving Phoebe alone. She hears laughter. Sean 
           pops out of a closet, startling Phoebe. 
                                 SEAN
                        God, you smell. Have you even 
                        showered today?

           Phoebe throws a pillow at him.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 

           Phoebe walks through the hallway. Everyone smirks at her. She 
           walks up to Mike. They stand outside of a classroom. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Hi. 

           Mike stares at her. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t mean any of 
                        those things I said. I miss you. 
                        You’re the only one I want at my 
                        Bat Mitzvah. 

           She hands him an invitation. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        You and only you are invited to my 
                        Black Mitzvah. 

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. Now that no one else wants to 
                        come. Keep your dusty invite. 

           He drops it on the floor. 

           CHYRON: 10 DAYS TO BAT MITZVAH

           INT. DELI - DAY 

           Phoebe sits across from Sam. 

                                 SAM
                        Your Shema was a million times 
                        better today. No Insta to distract 
                        you?

                                 PHOEBE
                        Everyone hates me. 

                                 SAM
                        I don’t hate you. 

           Phoebe puts her head against the table dramatically. 
                                 PHOEBE
                        You have to like me. You get paid.

                                 SAM
                        You know how many of these little 
                        asshats I tutor that I don’t like? 
                        I don’t have to do anything.
                             (beat, then)
                        Don’t repeat that. I have bills to 
                        pay. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I messed everything up. I was so 
                        focused on having a perfect party. 
                        Mike hates me. And he’s the only 
                        person I’ve ever cared about 
                        coming. And the worst part 
                        is...it’s my fault. I can’t blame 
                        him for hating me. I hate me. I 
                        suck. That’s what should go on my 
                        tombstone so everyone remembers how 
                        much I suck. 

                                 SAM
                        You don’t suck. Someone who sucks 
                        wouldn’t care about how much they 
                        hurt another person. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Becoming a Bat Mitzvah means I have 
                        to take this L. Maybe Mike will 
                        hate me forever, but I have no one 
                        to blame but myself. I don’t 
                        deserve true friendship. 

                                 SAM
                        Taking accountability. Someone’s 
                        finally ready to receive an aliyah.
                             (beat, then)
                        You’ll fix it with Mike. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        How?

                                 SAM
                        Do something that shows him how 
                        much you care. Haven’t you ever 
                        seen a rom com? 

           Off Phoebe thinking... 
           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 

           Mike sits in class doodling while his MATH TEACHER drones on. 

                                 MATH TEACHER
                        If x plus y equals 1. What is Y. 

           All of a sudden, the PA system speakers go off. The opening 
           beats to Kanye’s “Runaway” play. 

                                 PHOEBE’S VOICE
                        Dear, Mike. I love you. Sometimes I 
                        don’t have the words to express how 
                        much or how sorry I am. So I’ll 
                        just use my favorite song. 

           The beat continues. Mike looks around. 

                                 PHOEBE’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah I always find, yeah I always 
                        find somethin’ wrong. You been 
                        puttin up with my shit just way too 
                        long! Mike, I’m sorry. 

           Everyone starts laughing. As Phoebe continues singing, a 
           GRUBHUB MAN enters the classroom. He pours flutes of 
           Martinelli’s sparkling cider. 

                                 GRUBHUB MAN
                        Who is Mike?

           Mike raises his hand. The Grubhub Man hands Mike a glass. The 
           song continues and Phoebe walks in acting out the song before 
           Mike while holding a glass of Martinelli’s in her hand. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Let’s have a toast for the 
                        douchebags. Let’s have a toast for 
                        the assholes! Every one of them 
                        that I know! 

           She raises her glass to toast. Everyone stares at her. Mike 
           shakes his head. Phoebe approaches his desk and gets down on 
           her knees. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        I ain’t too proud to beg, Mike. 
                             (beat, then with the song)
                        See, I could have me a good 
                        friend...And still be addicted to 
                        them hoodrats...And I just blame 
                        everything on you...Cuz that’s what 
                        I’m good at...Mike I’m sorry. 
                        You’re my best friend. 
                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        Please come to my Bat Mitzvah. This 
                        is a preview to your front row seat 
                        to me embarrassing myself during 
                        the Haftarah.
                             (beat, then raising her 
                              glass)
                        Can we toast to the biggest 
                        douchebag? Me? 

           Mike puts his flute down. Phoebe nods, awkwardly rejected. 
           Drinks her Martinelli’s solo. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                             (sadly)
                        L’chaim. 

           Phoebe walks out. Off Mike sinking into his seat... 

           INT. AM SHALOM TEMPLE - TEMPLE 

           GUESTS file into the temple. Phoebe stands off to the side 
           with Larry, April, Sean, and Sam. She looks around. No sign 
           of Mike. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Can we push back 30 minutes? 

                                 SAM
                        You’re ready. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        No, I just don’t see him. 

           Phoebe’s GRANDMA DOROTHEA (think Whoopi Goldberg) approaches. 

                                 DOROTHEA
                        Mazel Tov, Phoebe. 

           She scans the room. 

                                 DOROTHEA (CONT’D)
                        Good. I see Ethel wasn’t invited. 

                                 LARRY
                        Not after she ruined game night. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        What’d she do at game night?

                                 DOROTHEA
                        Stay outta grown folks’ business. 
                                 PHOEBE
                        I’m becoming an adult. 

                                 DOROTHEA
                        Mmhm. I’ll tell you what, Imma 
                        dance at that woman’s funeral. 

                                 LARRY
                        Why would you go to a woman’s 
                        funeral who hates you? 

                                 DOROTHEA
                        Who’s gonna tell her? 

           Dorothea saunters off. 

                                 SAM
                        I like her. 

           Phoebe keeps scanning the crowd. It’s a small gathering of 
           FAMILY and CLOSE FAMILY FRIENDS. They all approach and give 
           Phoebe words of encouragement. But Phoebe’s eyes remain 
           fixated on the door. 

           Phoebe keeps looking, disappointed. She takes a seat in front 
           with her family. 

           The RABBI takes his spot at the Bima. 

                                 RABBI
                        Today, we would like to call up 
                        Phoebe Johnson to the Bima. 

           Phoebe walks up to the Bima flanked by her parents. 

           As she stands behind the microphone...she spots Mike sitting 
           in the back. They lock eyes. She smiles. He rolls his eyes. 

           Larry and April wrap the tallit around Phoebe. She smiles. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        As I wear this tallit, it reminds 
                        me that regardless of the direction 
                        I find myself, I’m always in God’s 
                        presence. The tallit has four 
                        corners which symbolize the four 
                        corners of the Earth. There are 613 
                        knots on the fringes to serve as a 
                        reminder that there are 613 
                        commandments in the Torah. By 
                        wrapping myself in this tallit, I 
                        seek God’s warmth and security. 
                        Baruch atah, Adonai Eloheinu, 
                        Melech haolam... 
           Off Phoebe confidently speaking while surrounded by love...

           INT. RESTAURANT RECEPTION - NIGHT 

           Phoebe and Mike sit together. They look at each other, 
           slightly awkward. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Does this mean you forgive me?

                                 MIKE
                        Your “Runaway” rendition had pitch 
                        problems. 

           She stares at him. He lifts his kiddie cocktail. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Toast to the douchebags? 

           Phoebe smiles, raises her kiddie cocktail. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        You’re the douchebag, by the way. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I know. 

           They sip. 

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sorry no one came. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I’m not. The most important person 
                        did. 

           They stare at each other a beat. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        Will you finally admit you were 
                        CoolGuy13? 

                                 MIKE
                        Huh?

                                 PHOEBE
                        You have a crush on me. 

                                 MIKE
                        God, you’re still a narcissist! 

                                 PHOEBE
                        You don’t?
                                 MIKE
                        I-- I-- 

           They stare at each other. Mike kisses her. They part. A beat. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        God, that was awful.

                                 PHOEBE
                        Oh, thank God you thought so too or 
                        else this friendship was about to 
                        die again. 

                                 MIKE
                        I think that was just the hormones. 
                        I don’t want to do that ever again. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Me neither...We’re so adult. 

                                 MIKE
                        Ok, well I have a surprise for you. 

           Phoebe looks over his shoulder. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Chase?

                                 MIKE 
                        Why would Chase be my surprise? 

                                 PHOEBE
                        He’s headed this way. 

           Chase walks up dressed in a suit. Hands Phoebe a Tiffany’s 
           bag. 

                                 CHASE
                        Sorry, I’m late. I couldn’t get out 
                        of practice on time. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Why are you here?

                                 CHASE
                        Open it.

           Phoebe opens the bag. It’s a Tiffany’s heart bracelet 
           engraved with “Mazel Tov on your Black Mitzvah - CoolGuy13.” 

                                 PHOEBE
                        What. What. It’s YOU?! 
                                 CHASE
                        It’s me. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        You don’t hate me? 

                                 CHASE
                        Nah. I just like the old Phoebe, 
                        straight from the go Phoebe. I hate 
                        the new Phoebe, the bad mood 
                        Phoebe... 

           Phoebe laughs. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I hate her too. The always rude, 
                        Phoebe. 

           As she’s talking, the REAL KANYE’S VOICE talks over them. 

                                 KANYE
                        Spaz in the news Kanye, I miss the 
                        sweet Kanye, chop up the beats 
                        Kanye. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Why does it sound like Kanye’s 
                        right behind me? 

                                 MIKE
                        Because he is. 

           Phoebe turns around and faces KANYE WEST. She can’t speak. 
           She runs to her parents and Sam who is star-stuck. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Omg. Omg. Omg. You’re the best 
                        parents in the whole world. 

                                 LARRY
                        How the hell did Kanye get to this 
                        Bat Mitzvah?

                                 SAM 
                        Sorry for doubting you, Phoebe. Be 
                        right back, gotta go shave my 
                        eyebrows. 

           Sam exits. Mike and Esther approach Phoebe and her parents. 

                                 MIKE
                        Esther and I did it. 
                                 ESTHER
                        Told him you’re a Make-A-Wish kid, 
                        so cough a little or something and 
                        go with it. 

           Off Phoebe’s expression... 

                                 ESTHER (CONT’D)
                        Kidding. Or am I? Don’t question my 
                        come through again.

           A PARENT runs up to Kanye. 

                                 PARENT
                        Can I get a picture? My kid is a 
                        HUGE fan. 

                                 KANYE
                        And you’re not? Why is it so empty 
                        in here? No one cares this kid is 
                        dying? 

           Kanye walks up to Phoebe holding a few boxes. 

                                 KANYE (CONT’D)
                        Esther told me you lost your Yeezys 
                        to a scammer. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I. You. Know. Esther. Thank yay. I 
                        mean thank you. I mean mazel tov. 
                        No you mazel, me. 

                                 KANYE
                        Where are all the people? 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I had a meltdown and everybody 
                        abandoned me. 

                                 KANYE
                        I can relate. 

           Ray walks in and sees Phoebe and Kanye. 

                                 RAY
                        Where’d you get this other 
                        imposter? He got a mask on?

           He touches Kanye’s face. Realizes it’s not a mask. 

                                 KANYE
                        Please get away from me. 
           Kanye smiles, but is immediately serious again.

                                 RAY
                        Yo, I’m sorry bout that. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Can we do a song? 

           As Phoebe’s talking: POP FLASHES of Kanye being at Phoebe’s 
           Bat Mitzvah goes wide on Insta and snap. 

           STAGE 

           Phoebe and Kanye take the stage. “Power” starts. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        I’m livin in that 21st century. 
                        Doin somethin mean to it. Do it 
                        better than anybody you ever seen 
                        do it... 

           She and Kanye start rapping together. Phoebe’s biggest dream 
           come true. 

           ENTRANCE

           Hordes of kids come filing in. 

                                 KIDS
                        Oh shit. She wasn’t lying.

           They form a mosh pit near the stage. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Tell em’ Phoebe said they can kiss 
                        my whole ass, I’m an asshole y’all
                             (looks at April)
                        Ninjas got jokessss! 

           Kanye continues rapping while Phoebe crowd surfs. The kids 
           put her down. Talia and Chelseigh approach. 

                                 TALIA
                        We’re sorry. 

                                 CHELSEIGH
                        Also, you were right. My parents 
                        just came clean. I was adopted. And 
                        am black. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Good for you, Chelseigh. Honesty is 
                        the first step towards acceptance. 
           Phoebe starts walking away. 

                                 TALIA
                        Wait. You wanna come over later?

                                 PHOEBE 
                        No. 

           Kylie walks in. Approaches. 

                                 KYLIE
                        Why didn’t you tell everyone about 
                        me? It’d make everyone like you.

                                 PHOEBE
                        I don’t care about being liked. 

           Chase approaches. 

                                 CHASE
                        This is...wow... 

                                 PHOEBE
                        I wanna talk to you about...a lot. 
                        But I gotta do something first. 

           Phoebe pushes through the ever-growing crowd. Finds Mike 
           sitting in the corner. Sits beside him. 

                                 MIKE
                        I thought you’d be making out with 
                        Chase by now. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        Mike, I’m 13. Guys are gonna come 
                        and go, but us? We forever. 

           She puts her arm around him. Mike smiles. They watch Kanye 
           perform. He’s rapping “Celebration.” 

                                 KANYE
                        I hear it’s time for snowball. 

                                 MIKE
                        Go get your guy. 

           Phoebe smiles. She approaches Chase.

                                 PHOEBE
                        You wanna dance? Just promise not 
                        to push me off any tire swings 
                        again. 
                                 CHASE
                        I won’t let you fall into any more 
                        golf course ponds... 

            They start dancing while Kanye raps. 

                                 KANYE
                        You know what this is...It’s a 
                        celebration bitches! 

           Everyone dances. Including a now eyebrow-less Sam who is 
           acting like a thirteen-year-old. This carries us out into...

                                 OLDER PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        And so that’s how I became a woman. 

           INT. CAFE - NEW YORK - NIGHT 

           OLDER PHOEBE (20s) is standing on stage. Behind her is a 
           poster that reads “THE MOTH.” 

                                 OLDER PHOEBE
                        So Kanye really did come to my 
                        party. And my Bat Mitzvah taught me 
                        how to be okay with being 
                        different. A Cocoa Puff in a sea 
                        Kix. 
                             (beat, then)
                        Ok, I think my time is up. 

           A BITCHY COFFEE SHOP EMPLOYEE (male, 20s) sweeps the floor 
           and glares at her. 

                                 BITCHY COFFEESHOP EMPLOYEE
                        Honey, your time has been up. We’re 
                        about to close.  

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        I’m still here. 

           There’s one GUY in the audience.

                                 OLDER PHOEBE
                        Thank you, Mike. 
                             (to Coffee Shop Employee)
                        Besides, I have more things to say.   

                                 BITCHY COFFEESHOP EMPLOYEE
                        Give it up, honey. You got to go... 
                        now. 

           Phoebe sighs. Walks off stage. 
           EXT. COFFEE SHOP - NEW YORK - NIGHT

           Phoebe and Mike walk together. 

                                 OLDER MIKE
                        So this girl I met is throwing a 
                        birthday party. We could roll to 
                        that, but I don’t want to bring her 
                        a present. That’s too committal. 
                        It’s also too close to the 
                        holidays, and I don’t wanna have to 
                        buy holiday presents either.  

           Phoebe’s not paying attention. A HOT GUY (think Drake) walks 
           past her. Time slows. Kids See Ghost’s “Ghost Town” plays. 

                                 KIDS SEE GHOSTS 
                        I been trying to make you love me.

                                 OLDER PHOEBE
                        It’s the guy from the gym. Also, 
                        think he might be blewish too. 

           She pulls off the LUCKY MEZUZAH around her neck and rubs. 

                                 OLDER MIKE
                        Oh my God, you still have that?

           Phoebe can’t stop staring at her boo. Mike shakes his head. 

                                 OLDER MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Dude’s not that hot. He’s probably 
                        the type to spray-tan his abs. Ugh, 
                        gimme that. 

           He snatches the mezuzah from Phoebe. 

                                 OLDER PHOEBE
                        You’re gonna fuck up the vibe! 

           An A/C UNIT falls inches away from them. Mike is shook. 

                                 OLDER MIKE
                        Fuck it. You can have it back. 

           Phoebe snatches her mezuzah back. They continue walking and 
           bantering like old times. “Ghost Town” carries us out. 

                                 KIDS SEE GHOSTS
                        And nothing hurts anymore. I feel 
                        kinda freeeeee. We’re still the 
                        kids we used to beeeeee.   

                                                              FADE OUT.
           AS CREDITS ROLL, CUT TO:

           It’s complete darkness. We hear a SCREAM. 

           CHYRON: 2018. 

           Phoebe lights a candle. Illuminating the room. We see a 
           picture of Kanye wearing a MAGA hat. 

           Mike shakes his head. He starts recording while Phoebe 
           presses play on her speakers. The instrumentals of Barbra 
           Streisand’s “Papa, Can You Hear Me?” play. 

                                 PHOEBE
                        May the light of this flickering 
                        candle illuminate the night the way 
                        your spirit illuminates my soul. 
                        Kanye, can you hear me? Kanye, can 
                        you find me in the night? Kanye, 
                        can you help me not be frightened? 

           Phoebe does her best Barbra run. She is not great. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        Can you hear me praying? Anything 
                        I’m saying? I know your night’s 
                        filled with Kardashian voicessss. I 
                        remember everything you’ve taught 
                        me. Every song you’ve ever rapped. 
                        All the words in all the songs help 
                        me face what lies ahead....

           Phoebe stands. 

                                 PHOEBE (CONT’D)
                        Old Kanye how I miss you. Old Kanye  
                        how I need you. Old Kanye how I 
                        miss you singing me-- 
                             (beat, then)
                        I don’t have an ending. Is this a 
                        lost cause?

           Mike stops recording. 

                                 MIKE 
                        Probably.

                                 OLDER PHOEBE (V.O.)
                        Dear Phoebe, You haven’t quite 
                        learned what to do when your 
                        problematic favorites disappoint 
                        you yet...not even in adulthood.

           Phoebe’s voice carries us into THE REMAINING CREDITS.
