           EXT. DOG PARK - DAY 

           A gorgeous WOMAN walks the world’s most perfect Golden 
           Retriever through the park. 

                                 TRICIA (V.O.)
                        It’s our favorite part of the love 
                        story...

           A Black Lab comes barreling down the path, leash flapping 
           behind him. He leaps onto the Retriever, humping away. 

           The startled woman tries to pull her dog free when an out of 
           breath MAN, also gorgeous, comes running after his Lab. 

                                 TRICIA (V.O.)
                        The first spark of romance... 

           The man untangles the leashes and makes eye contact with the 
           woman. A sly smile. An embarrassed laugh. They shake hands. 

                                 TRICIA (V.O.)
                        The anecdote you get to tell from 
                        this day forth... 

           INT. GYM - DAY 

           MAN #2 looks like he’s just trying this whole gym thing for 
           the first time. He’s got too much weight on the bench press. 
           Arms shaking. He can’t get the bar up. This is bad. 

                                 TRICIA (V.O.)
                        Some of them are painful... 

           WOMAN #2, a fitness guru, comes running over to help. She 
           lifts the weights off his chest with ease and racks them. 

                                 TRICIA (V.O.)
                        Some of them are funny... 

           Man #2 sits up panting, red in the face. She gives him some 
           water. A thankful nod. A slight giggle. They shake hands. 

                                 TRICIA (V.O.)
                        All of them are special... 

           EXT. ICE CREAM PARLOR - EVENING

           On the patio of the ice cream shop, WOMAN #3, cute and 
           unassuming, walks out the door with her treat. It’s two 
           scoops of mint chocolate chip with rainbow sprinkles. 
                                 TRICIA (V.O.)
                        We see them happen in the movies...

           MAN #3, handsome in a nerdy way, sits alone at the nearest 
           table. He’s eating an ice cream that’s the exact same order. 
           She trips and spills her ice cream onto the floor. 

                                 TRICIA (V.O.)
                        But we all want them to happen to 
                        us in real life... 

           Man #3 grins and shuffles over to woman #3. He offers her 
           some of his. A wink. A chuckle. They shake hands. 

                                 TRICIA (V.O.)
                        It’s called the Meet Cute. And now 
                        they can...

           INT. TV STUDIO - AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS

           TRICIA LAWSON (30, always ‘on’) sits on a couch across from 
           KEATON BROWN (28, effortless cool). Bad THANKSGIVING 
           decorations adorn the stage. 

                                 TRICIA
                        I’m Tricia Lawson, and I’m joined 
                        today by Keaton Brown, the creator 
                        of the hottest app in recent 
                        memory. Thanks so much for stopping 
                        by, Keaton. 

           The studio audience smatters him with applause. He looks 
           perfectly humble. 

                                 KEATON
                        Thanks for having me, Tricia. 

                                 TRICIA
                             (to audience)
                        For those of you living without a 
                        pulse, Keaton’s app is called Meet 
                        Cute, and it’s flipped the dating 
                        game on it’s head. 
                             (to Keaton, stage whisper)
                        Among many new positions. 

                                 KEATON
                        Ohh! Flipped on your head. I 
                        haven’t tried that one yet.  

           The crowd eats this up. Tricia puts her hand on his knee. 
                                 TRICIA
                        I’m kidding, I’m kidding! 

           Hand lingers. 

                                 TRICIA (CONT’D)
                        Now, you have the most downloaded 
                        app this year. Did you ever think 
                        your little idea would turn out so 
                        big? 

                                 KEATON
                        Kind of? Can I say that? 

                                 TRICIA
                        You’re the inventor of Meet Cute! 
                        You can say whatever you want. 

                                 KEATON
                        Oh, OK. Umm, avocado toast is 
                        wildly overrated and at most should 
                        be a one dollar add on to your 
                        already free toast.  

           He shrugs with the agreeable crowd, he can do no wrong. 

                                 KEATON (CONT’D)
                        But no, I certainly didn’t think it 
                        would get THIS big. It just seemed 
                        like there was a gap in the market 
                        and I had a way to fill it. 

                                 TRICIA
                        How did you come up with Meet Cute? 

                                 KEATON
                        By whining about something. Which, 
                        of course, is where all good ideas 
                        come from, right??

                                 TRICIA
                        Of course. What was bothering you?

                                 KEATON
                        I blinked, and everyone I knew was 
                        using dating sites and dating apps. 

                                 TRICIA
                        That’s a bad thing? It’s pretty 
                        convenient. You can match with 
                        someone while eating takeout on 
                        your couch. 
                                 KEATON
                        Exactly. And it makes sense! The 
                        world is huge. There are 7 billion 
                        of us trying to figure it out. Why 
                        limit our pool of potential 
                        partners to people we see in our 
                        day to day lives? Of course we 
                        should widen that net. But for me, 
                        it came with a stigma. 

                                 TRICIA
                        What do you mean by that? 

                                 KEATON
                        I felt weird saying I met a girl 
                        online. I couldn’t get past it. So 
                        I asked myself why. Then it hit me. 
                        I wanted my RomCom moment. And I 
                        had a hunch we all do. There’s 
                        something magical about meeting 
                        another person organically and it 
                        just...clicks. 

           He SNAPS his fingers. Tricia jumps, pulled from a trance. 

                                 KEATON (CONT’D)
                        When you arrange your date online 
                        you’ve already seen the pictures, 
                        you’ve already read the bios, it’s 
                        so robotic. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Explain to us how your app is the 
                        first of its kind. 

                                 KEATON
                        You create a private profile. Me 
                        and my inspiring team of engineers 
                        at Meet Cute HQ pour over all the 
                        data provided to us by the user via 
                        questionnaire and personality test. 
                        When we find a compatible couple in 
                        a specified proximity, we suggest 
                        places they should go. 
                        Individually. They never know when 
                        they’re going to run into their 
                        match, or even who their match is. 

                                 TRICIA
                        But what if they miss each other? 

                                 KEATON
                        Then we keep trying. Sometimes they 
                        do meet, and the spark isn’t there. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KEATON (CONT'D)
                        We keep trying then too. We won’t 
                        stop until they find that special 
                        someone. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Everyone gets their “meet cute” 
                        while still widening the net. 

                                 KEATON
                        You nailed it. The reason I love it 
                        so much, other than the fact that I 
                        made it....
                             (winks at crowd)
                        Is all these other apps let you 
                        create a profile but it’s still an 
                        instant reaction on people’s looks. 
                        Swipe left or swipe right. 
                        Personality doesn’t matter because 
                        you never get the chance to know 
                        someone first. Meet Cute inverts 
                        that. You get put in a social 
                        setting first. You’re forced to 
                        interact. Then you can see if you 
                        connect with a person before 
                        finding yourself on an awkward 
                        first date that’s only happening 
                        because you both found the other 
                        one attractive in a staged profile 
                        picture. 

                                 TRICIA
                             (nodding profoundly)
                        Mmmmmmmmmm. 

                                 KEATON
                        It brings the most unlikely couples 
                        together. Ones that don’t work on 
                        paper. But really, they’re perfect 
                        for each other. Like, I don’t know, 
                        an app designer and a vivacious TV 
                        personality...for example. 

           He can play this game. Tricia fans herself off with her hand.  

                                 TRICIA
                        Genius. 

           The crowd gives a thunderous applause. 

           INT. TV STUDIO - LATER

           HALEY MOSS (31, self centered but sweet) waits by the 
           greenroom. Tricia runs up and hugs her. 
                                 TRICIA
                        Hails!

                                 HALEY
                        T, you crushed that. 

                                 TRICIA
                        I was so nervous. 

                                 HALEY
                        Oh really? I couldn’t tell when you 
                        were trying to molest him on stage. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Stop. 

                                 HALEY
                        What? He’s hot in a ‘he probably 
                        names his dick’ kinda way. 

                                 TRICIA
                        I’m engaged. 

                                 HALEY
                        Flirting doesn’t count if it’s on 
                        camera. Where is Marcus? 

                                 TRICIA
                        In New York for work. Still have 
                        time for a quick lunch? 

           EXT. PATIO BEVERLY HILLS RESTAURANT - 1PM 

           Tricia and Haley have trendy salads in front of them. 
           Probably kale caesar with salmon. 

                                 HALEY
                        Mom’s hosting Thanksgiving this 
                        year, so I’ll be joining them and 
                        their crazy neighbors. They asked 
                        me to cook. 

           Tricia can’t contain her laughter. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Do they plan on eating or no? 

                                 HALEY
                        Not the whole meal! I’m responsible 
                        for the cranberry sauce.

                        I say this with love Hails, but if 
                        you want to be invited back, buy it 
                        from the store.

                        I don’t even know when I can do 
                        that. I’m gonna be reading scripts 
                        the entire week. 

                                 TRICIA
                        You’re the busiest person I know.  

                                 HALEY
                        By choice. 

                                 TRICIA
                        We need to get you a boyfriend. 

                                 HALEY
                        No thank you. I don’t have time.

                                 TRICIA
                        You’re not bringing Zeke to my 
                        wedding, just so we’re clear. Can 
                        that end please? He’s a jerk. 

                                 HALEY
                        No he isn’t. We’re both getting 
                        exactly what we want from each 
                        other. But sure, I can find another 
                        wedding date in 10 months. 

                                 TRICIA
                        You can’t use your plus one on a 
                        random. 

                                 HALEY
                        I’m not going to your wedding 
                        alone. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Do you know how much each seat 
                        costs? I’m not spending 200 dollars 
                        on some WeHo boy toy who lies all 
                        night to get instagram followers. 

                                 HALEY
                        OK you have final cut on any 
                        potential plus ones. Deal? 

                                 TRICIA
                        Deal. But today gave me an idea. 
                        You should get on Meet Cute!
                                 HALEY
                        Ew. Are you kidding me? 

                                 TRICIA
                        I’m serious. Did you know that 91% 
                        of people who start dating on Meet 
                        Cute make it at least 1 year? 

                                 HALEY
                        Did you know that dating apps are 
                        designed for failure? You fill out 
                        a questionnaire and then this guy 
                        is supposed to be your soulmate? 
                        Wrong. People lie on those forms.

                                 TRICIA
                        Not the people who really want to 
                        find love. 

                                 HALEY
                        Everyone. They answer like the 
                        person they want to be, not who 
                        they are. Then the guy does the 
                        same. Then you get two people 
                        paired up who are a match in what 
                        they want, but not what they are, 
                        and they both end up resenting the 
                        other for not being what they said 
                        they were. 

                                 TRICIA
                        But Meet Cute is different! 

                                 HALEY
                        Is it though? 

                                 TRICIA
                        Just fill out a profile. 
                             (off Haley’s look)
                        For me. Please? 

                                 HALEY
                             (ugh)
                        I’ll do it this afternoon. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Hails. 

                                 HALEY
                        I promise. 

                                 TRICIA
                             (so pleased with herself)
                        Thank you. 
           INT. NETWORK OFFICE - THAT AFTERNOON

           Haley sits at her desk in her corner office. Outlook spits 
           emails at her constantly. She opens her calendar. 

                                 HALEY
                        Is this pitch on time? 

           Her ASSISTANT scrambles from her cubicle into Haley’s office. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Running 15 minutes late. Traffic. 

           Haley exhales. Get a new excuse, ya know? 

           She pulls out her phone. Opens the texts. Types Zeke. Thinks 
           about it. Something flirty maybe? No, gross.  

           Instead, she goes to the app store and searches MEET CUTE. 
           Her thumb hovers. Thinks about it. INSTALL. 

                                 ASSISTANT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s now looking like an hour. 

           INT. THATCHER’S HOUSE - THANKSGIVING 

           RUSS PHILLIPS (32, caring, a romantic) is racing around the 
           kitchen like a Chopped contestant. THATCHER (30s, as goofy as 
           he is loyal) grabs another beer from the fridge. 

                                 THATCHER
                        So you wont be calling her again? 

                                 RUSS
                        What do you think, Thatch? Did that 
                        sound like we made a good couple? 

           SIMONE (30s, playful and British) joins them with some wine. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Hell if I know. In case you haven’t 
                        noticed bud, I’m married. 

           Thatcher not subtly head nods to Simone, who rolls her eyes. 

                                 SIMONE
                        Are you allowed to use Meet Cute?  

                                 THATCHER
                        It’s encouraged! Just because we 
                        work there doesn’t mean he’s not 
                        allowed.  
                                 RUSS
                        That’s how I met this last one. Our 
                        tickets got mixed up at the dry 
                        cleaners. Almost went home with a 
                        cocktail dress, which I think I 
                        could’ve pulled off.

                                 SIMONE
                        Where did you take her? 

                                 RUSS
                        We went to one of those dinner in 
                        the dark places. I could barely see 
                        my food, let alone her. 

                                 THATCHER
                        OH MY GOD. I’m updating the list. 
                        This is your new, worst idea. 
                             (loudly, to the room)
                        Alexa....add “Dark Dinner” to 
                        “Stupid Russ.” 

                                 RUSS
                             (loudly)
                        Alexa...delete “Stupid Russ.” 

                                 THATCHER
                             (screaming)
                        Alexa NO!!!!!

           Russ pulls a foil tented turkey out of the oven. 

                                 SIMONE
                        Are you absolutely sure you don’t 
                        need any help in here? 

                                 RUSS
                        I’ve got it under control, Simone. 
                        The bird is out. Just waiting for 
                        the brussels to finish up now. 

                                 THATCHER
                             (to Simone)
                        I don’t know what we’re going to do 
                        when he gets married.

                                 SIMONE
                             (to Thatcher)
                        We go to his house, darling. Why do 
                        you think we‘ve been hosting all 
                        these years? 

           Simone’s three steps ahead of Thatcher, just how he likes it. 
           She kisses her two fingers and touches them to his nose. 
           Russ takes the foil off the bird and it’s a “Grand Canyon 
           sunset” golden brown. Well played, sir.  

                                 SIMONE (CONT’D)
                        Ahhh, it’s brilliant. And it can’t 
                        be a proper Thanksgiving without 
                        the cranberry sauce. 

           Simone pulls out a bowl of cranberry sauce from the fridge 
           just as Thatcher opens the oven to steal a brussels sprout. 

                                 RUSS
                        It’s really not that hard. You just 
                        have to baste it every 30 minutes 
                        for 6 hours--

           As Simone carries the bowl to the counter by the turkey, 
           Thatcher burns his hand on the over rack. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Balls! 

           He flings his hand back wildly and smacks the bowl out of 
           Simone’s hand. SMASH!   

                                 SIMONE
                        Bollocks! 

           Red everywhere. It’s a crime scene. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Was that the cranberry sauce?

                                 SIMONE
                        Yes, it WAS. And now Russ’s got it 
                        all over him. 

                                 RUSS
                        No, I’m fine. It’s fine. 

           Russ grabs some paper towels and let’s Bounty do its thing 
           while the other two gently pick up glass.  

                                 THATCHER
                        No harm...yes fowl. You 
                        know...fowl? Like a turkey? 
                        Nothing?  

           Sorry, bud. Simone WHACKS Thatcher in the arm. 

                                 SIMONE
                        Apologize you fool! 
                                 THATCHER
                        To Russ? He’s fine! 

                                 SIMONE
                        To me! That was a good batch.

                                 RUSS
                        Why don’t I go get some? 

                                 SIMONE
                             (sad)
                        No, we don’t need it. 

                                 RUSS
                        But you said it’s not Thanksgiving 
                        without the cranberry sauce, and 
                        who would know better than the 
                        Brit? I’ll grab some cans at the 
                        store. It’ll take 5 minutes. 

                                 THATCHER
                        You cooked all day, let me get it. 

                                 RUSS
                        You start carving. 

           Russ waves over his shoulder as he dashes out.

                                 THATCHER
                        Alright bud, take her easy. 
                             (beat, louder now)
                        And if she’s easy, send her my way! 

                                 SIMONE
                        That joke just cost you sex 
                        tonight. I hope it was worth it. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Oh I’m eating far too much for sex 
                        tonight so no worries. 

           INT./EXT. - RUSS’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Russ races down the completely empty roads. His phone is 
           resting in the center console. Without him realizing, a 
           NOTIFICATION pops up on his screen. It’s from Meet Cute. 

           INT. GROCERY STORE - 5 MIN LATER

           Russ moves purposefully through the store and he hears 
           something ROLLING across the tile floor. He looks down just 
           as a can of cranberry sauce bumps into his foot. 
                                 HALEY (O.S.)
                        Shit. 

           Russ looks up and sees Haley. She’s at a display with all the 
           Thanksgiving essentials. Can of cranberry sauce in her hand. 
           A few knocked over. Russ scoops up his can and walks to her.

                                 RUSS
                        Did you just bowl cranberry sauce 
                        at me? 

                                 HALEY
                        It’s a Moss family tradition. Every 
                        year we go to the store and knock 
                        over some procrastinating 
                        thanks-givers. If you wouldn’t mind 
                        moving a bit, I’m going for my 
                        third strike.  

           She mimes bowling her can. 

                                 RUSS
                        I’m not procrastinating. 

                                 HALEY
                        Says the guy shopping on 
                        Thanksgiving.   

                                 RUSS
                        There’s a cranberry emergency at my 
                        friend’s house. We made some, but 
                        we dropped the bowl. So by the can 
                        it is. 

                                 HALEY
                        There’s a cranberry emergency at my 
                        mom’s house. I was gonna make some, 
                        but I dropped the ball. So by the 
                        can it is. 

                                 RUSS
                        Don’t tell anyone, but I think it’s 
                        better like this anyway. 

           Russ grabs a few more cans and heads to the self checkout. 

                                 HALEY
                        I really hope others share your 
                        preference and you’re not eating 
                        all of that. 
                                 RUSS
                        These are for you. If you’re 
                        supplying the cranberry sauce for 
                        the entire Thanksgiving dinner I 
                        can’t with good conscience let you 
                        walk in with one measly can. This 
                        stuff has to get you through 
                        gobbler sandwiches for the next 
                        three days at least. 

                                 HALEY
                        I am partial to leftover 
                        sandwiches. I’ll buy it, though.   

           She tires to reach for the cans he’s put on the belt, but 
           instead he grabs the remaining can out of her hands. 

                                 RUSS
                        I insist. 

           Russ pays and hands her the bag. 

                                 RUSS (CONT’D)
                        Happy Thanksgiving. Good luck 
                        getting that third strike. 

           Russ pockets his one can and heads out of the store, stopping 
           at the automatic doors.  

                                 RUSS (CONT’D)
                        Ohhhhh, three strikes. A turkey. 
                             (beat)
                        You’re clever.  

                                 HALEY
                        I’m Haley, actually. 

           He laughs. So does she. It’s all happening. 

                                 RUSS
                        See you around, Haley. 

           He holds out his hand. She shakes. 

                                 RUSS (CONT’D)
                        I’m Russ. 

           INT. MEET CUTE OFFICE - MORNING

           A sweet converted warehouse looks cool as hell. Huge windows 
           provide great light with an awesome view. Trendy art on the 
           walls and, oh damn, there’s a ping pong table over there! 
                                 THATCHER
                        You didn't even get her last name?? 

                                 RUSS
                        I didn’t want to force it! 

                                 THATCHER
                        What did she look like? 

                                 RUSS
                        I don’t know. She was cute. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Move over. 

           Thatcher opens up Google on Russ’s computer. He types in 
           “Haley + LA + cranberry sauce + cute.” A bunch of Haleys 
           making cranberry sauce on Pinterest fill the screen. 

                                 RUSS
                        Did you seriously think that was 
                        gonna work? 

                                 THATCHER
                        Don’t give me that tone. You’re the 
                        one who screwed this up. 

                                 RUSS
                        I didn’t screw it up. I think I’ll 
                        see her again. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Right, cause this city is tiny and 
                        chance meetings like that happen 
                        all the time. 

                                 RUSS
                        There’s one thing I haven’t told 
                        you yet. When I got back in the 
                        car, I noticed I had a message from 
                        Meet Cute. It could’ve been her. 

                                 THATCHER
                        What!? Have you checked yet?? 

                                 RUSS
                        It doesn’t really work like that.

                                 THATCHER
                        Whatever, you’re the coder not me.

           The BOSS walks over to break up this party, and holy shit. 
           It’s the CEO in the flesh. Keaton. Fucking. Brown. 
                                 KEATON 
                        My two superstars! How was the 
                        holiday boys? 

                                 THATCHER
                        Excellent Mr. Brown, sir. Any time 
                        with the ones I love is time well 
                        spent. How was yours, sir? You must 
                        put on quite the feast. 

                                 KEATON
                        I’ve actually spent the last year 
                        nursing an injured turkey in my 
                        yard back to health. I slaughtered 
                        him myself on Wednesday, and I felt 
                        every bit of the 16th Native 
                        American that I am.   

           Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight. Keaton turns to Russ. 

                                 KEATON (CONT’D)
                        RP. The new restaurant code. Tell 
                        me something good. 

                                 RUSS
                        I heard back from Research. The 
                        numbers are inside a standard 
                        deviation. If we get to work it 
                        could be ready in the new year. 

                                 KEATON
                        Lets do it. This is gonna be big. 
                        Draw something up for how you want 
                        to implement it. 

                                 RUSS
                        Thanks, Keaton. I’m on it. 

           Russ puts out his hand. Keaton launches into a flawless five 
           move handshake. He finishes with a mini salute and leaves. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Always a pleasure, sir. You’re an 
                        inspiration to us all. 

           No response. 

                                 THATCHER (CONT’D)
                        You guys have a secret handshake? 

                                 RUSS
                        We’ve literally never done that 
                        before. I have no idea what just 
                        happened. 
                                 THATCHER
                        A new girl, a new project. You’re 
                        really knocking em down bud! 

           Something dawns on Russ. 

                                 RUSS
                        Wait. Bowling! I do know her last 
                        name. A Moss family tradition. 

           Thatcher beats him to the computer. Facebook. Instagram. 
           Everything. Haley Moss. Haley Moss. Haley Moss. 

                                 RUSS (CONT’D)
                        That one! 

           They’ve got her. Her Facebook says she’s interested in an 
           event tomorrow night. Rooftop Cinema. The Big Lebowski. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Dude. You have to go to this. She’s 
                        gonna be there. 

                                 RUSS
                        Just go alone? 

                                 THATCHER
                        You go to movies alone all the 
                        time! 

                                 RUSS
                        This feels a little stalker-y. I 
                        could just message her on this. 
                        Maybe invite her to my sister’s 
                        thing this weekend. 

                                 THATCHER
                        That’s a terrible idea. She doesn’t 
                        want to meet your family on the 
                        first date. Rooftop Cinema is a 
                        first date. A first date she won’t 
                        know she’s on till it’s too late. 

                                 RUSS
                        Again, this feels stalker-y. 

                                 THATCHER
                        It’s not stalker-y if she’s the 
                        one, bud. It’s frickin adorable. 

           Russ thinks. Stares at the link for tickets. 
                                 THATCHER (CONT’D)
                        This is it. She’s probably thinking 
                        about you right now. 

           PRE-LAP: Girl MOANING. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Haley’s back bangs into the wall. A man enters the shot. 
           What’s up ZEKE (31, confident, very fuckable). 

           He puts one hand on the wall and one hand through her hair as 
           he resumes his make out. Haley pulls his shirt off to reveal 
           exquisite skin that’s definitely moisturized, stretched 
           tightly over traps that could crack a walnut. Duh. 

           He helps her with her shirt as they tip over onto the bed. 

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Haley fires emails off on her phone in bed. She tries to 
           slide out without waking Zeke but she fails. He squints at 
           her while she gets dressed. 

                                 HALEY
                        Hanging on a week night. That's a 
                        slippery slope. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Yea, my bad. The boys and I were 
                        out celebrating Dre’s 30th. 

                                 HALEY
                        Tell him many happy returns from 
                        me, please. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Let me get you an Uber. 

                                 HALEY
                        No, I got it. 

           She does. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Hey, I was gonna text you, but 
                        since you’re right here. I’ve got a 
                        friend coming to town this weekend. 

           She looks at him. So what?  
                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        It’s a girl. So, I won’t be around. 
                        I just didn’t want you to think I 
                        was being weird.  

                                 HALEY
                        Oh Zeke, don’t worry. I don’t care 
                        about that stuff. We’re good. Car’s 
                        here. See ya. 

           EXT. ROOFTOP CINEMA - NIGHT

           Haley and Tricia stand by concessions waiting for the movie 
           to start. A guy approaches them with snacks. Russ! Just 
           kidding. It’s MARCUS (30s, neurotic but funny). 

           Marcus passes out some candy and holds a bucket of popcorn. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Marcus, this is a small. 

                                 MARCUS
                        You said you weren’t that hungry. 

                                 TRICIA
                        There’s three of us, babe. 

                                 HALEY
                        I thought you were on a diet?

                                 TRICIA
                        I am on a diet. That’s why we got 
                        no butter. But this is not enough. 

                                 MARCUS
                        OK, I’ll get more but can you just 
                        hold this because I have to pee so 
                        badly right now I think my 
                        bladder’s going to explode. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Yes, go before it starts please. 

           Marcus speed walks away pinching his crotch. 

                                 TRICIA (CONT’D)
                             (watching him go)
                        I’m marrying an 80 year old. 

                                 HALEY
                        I’ll get my own popcorn. I 
                        definitely want butter.  
                                 TRICIA
                        That’s empty calories. 

                                 HALEY
                             (emphasizing)
                        Layered. Butter.  

           They move into a line. At the front of that line...there he 
           is! Russ, placing his order. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        Oh god. 

                                 TRICIA
                        What? 

                                 HALEY
                        Cranberry sauce. He’s here. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Your Meet Cute?!  

                                 HALEY
                        Potential Meet Cute. There were 
                        tons of other guys in the store and 
                        the app didn’t know I was going to 
                        throw cans of produce at him by 
                        accident. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Definite Meet Cute! Where?!

                                 HALEY
                        Paying for popcorn. 

                                 TRICIA
                        This is a sign. Go talk to him. 

                                 HALEY
                        No. And say what? 
                             (doing a voice)
                        So, you like movies? 

                                 TRICIA
                        Let’s beat that, but you’re on the 
                        right track. 

           Haley hesitates. Russ starts to walk away. Tricia shoves 
           Haley in the back. She stumbles into Russ’s path as he’s 
           grabbing some napkins. 

                                 RUSS
                        I’m sorr- Oh... 
                                 HALEY
                        Hi. 

                                 RUSS
                        Haley, right? 

           Good sell, Russ. 

                                 HALEY
                        Yup. Russ? 

                                 RUSS
                        Yup. 
                             (awkward)
                        So, umm, you like The Big Lebowski? 

                                 HALEY
                             (shrugs)
                        I come for the popcorn. This has 
                        butter right? 

                                 RUSS
                             (nods)
                        Layered.

           She takes a handful. Tricia walks up. 

                                 HALEY
                        Russ, this is Tricia. Tricia, this-

                                 TRICIA
                        Is Russ. Would you like to join us? 

           A look from Haley, but not a mad one. 

                                 HALEY
                        I’m sure he’s with his friends. 

                                 RUSS
                        Nope, just me. 

                                 HALEY
                        You’re alone?? 

                                 RUSS
                        That’s usually what that means. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Hails. 

                                 HALEY
                        What? That’s weird. 
                                 RUSS
                        Only the first time. Like--

                                 HALEY
                        Sex? 

                                 RUSS
                        I was gonna say like eating a fig. 
                        Have you seen the inside of those 
                        things? It’s like...nevermind. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Well, this time you’re with us. 
                        Lets go find seats before Marcus 
                        sits somewhere near the exit. 

           Russ gives Haley a shy smile as he falls in step behind her. 

           EXT. ROOFTOP CINEMA - 1HR AND 59 MIN LATER

           The credits roll and the group is shuffling out. 

                                 TRICIA
                        That was so fun! 

                                 HALEY
                        You fell asleep halfway through. 

                                 MARCUS
                        I told her she would. She said we 
                        had to come, because we do things 
                        like this, because we’re going to 
                        be a fun married couple. And I told 
                        her she was going to fall asleep. 

                                 TRICIA
                        He did. You know me so well, babe. 
                        That’s why I love you. 

           She gives him a kiss. 

                                 HALEY
                        Ugh, you two are boring. This is 
                        supposed to be the pregame. Lets go 
                        somewhere. I’m hungry.  

                                 TRICIA
                        You ate all Russ's popcorn. 

                                 RUSS
                        I’m down for a nightcap. 

           Haley looks at Russ. Implores her friends to join. 
                                 MARCUS
                        Not me. I’m putting it to bed. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Then I better go too or he’ll watch 
                        all our shows without me.

                                 RUSS
                             (to Haley)
                        Come on, I have a spot. 

           Tricia gives Haley an encouraging nod. Why not? 

                                 HALEY
                        They better have fries. 

           INT. DINER - LATER

           Russ and Haley sit across a booth in an old-timey diner. The 
           place is nearly empty. They sip on something.  

                                 RUSS
                        How do you know Tricia and Marcus? 

                                 HALEY
                        T and I met forever ago, when she 
                        first moved. We were in an acting 
                        class together. She met Marcus not 
                        long after. Now they’re engaged, 
                        took them a while, but they do seem 
                        like a good fit. I worry she’s only 
                        taking the next step because the 
                        world says it’s time to get 
                        married.
                             (contemplating)
                        Sorry, that’s not for me to air 
                        out.  

                                 RUSS
                        Are you an actress? 

                                 HALEY
                        Ha. I love that’s what you took 
                        from that. And no. 

                                 RUSS
                        What do you do? 

                                 HALEY
                        I hate that question. 

                                 RUSS
                        I’m sorry.
                                 HALEY
                        It’s an American question. It’s all 
                        we care about. Where do you work? 
                        How much do you make? Do those 
                        things really define me, the 
                        person? Ask me what I like to do 
                        for fun instead. That’ll actually 
                        tell you something about me. 

                                 RUSS
                        Where were you? 

                                 HALEY
                        What? 

                                 RUSS
                        When you went abroad and got yelled 
                        at for being a typical American by 
                        asking that question. 

           So busted. 

                                 HALEY
                             (defeated)
                        Switzerland. 

           They share a laugh. The WAITRESS arrives. In front of Haley, 
           the biggest side of fries the world has ever seen. In front 
           of Russ, two, count em, two, pieces of pie.  

                                 WAITRESS
                        Extra fries, one slice of pumpkin, 
                        one slice of apple. 

                                 RUSS
                        Thank you so much. 

                                 HALEY
                        Could I trouble you for some 
                        mustard? 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Course. 

           She scurries off. Haley turns back to an APPALLED Russ. 

                                 RUSS
                        Are you putting mustard on fries? 

                                 HALEY
                        Do you not like mustard? 
                                 RUSS
                        I love mustard. But I also love 
                        ketchup. And since I’m a 
                        functioning member of society I put 
                        ketchup on my fries. 

                                 HALEY
                        Says the guy eating two different 
                        flavor pies right now. You should 
                        be in jail. 

                                 RUSS
                        This is way different. I love them 
                        both equally. Before Thanksgiving I 
                        go to the farmer’s market and get 
                        one of each from the Pie Lady.  

                                 HALEY
                        She probably has a name. 

                                 RUSS
                        In another life perhaps, but it’s 
                        since been forgotten by the fates. 
                        My dream is to make a pie that’s 
                        half pumpkin and half apple. Like a 
                        pizza with split toppings. 

                                 HALEY
                        That’s disgusting. 

           Russ stabs some pumpkin pie with his fork. Locks eyes with 
           Haley. Then he stabs some apple...

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t eat those two pies at the 
                        same time. 

           He slowly, seductively, moves the concoction into his mouth. 
           He moans his delight. 

           The waitress returns with the mustard. She saw Russ’s move. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        That looks good! 

                                 HALEY
                        Don’t encourage him. 

           The waitress leaves. Haley clears a space on her plate. Locks 
           eyes with Russ. He shakes his head, don’t you dare. She 
           empties half the mustard bottle. Digs in. 
                                 RUSS
                        OK, Mustard, what do you like to do 
                        for fun then? 

                                 HALEY
                             (while chomping fries)
                        I like staying busy. I do improv 
                        with a group of girls. I’m in a 
                        book club. I do trivia nights. 

                                 RUSS
                        You were definitely a theater girl. 

                                 HALEY
                        I used to play soccer! I play in a 
                        coed league out here. Not so much 
                        anymore. But when I can. 

                                 RUSS
                        Dual threat. I’m impressed. 

                                 HALEY
                             (mouthful)
                        I go to the movies. I watch sports. 
                        I go out to dinner. I love to eat. 

                                 RUSS
                             (sarcastically)
                        You don’t say. 

           Haley opens her mouth and flashes half chewed mustard fries 
           at Russ as some schoolyard payback for that jab.  

                                 HALEY
                        And to be fair, my job is fun too. 
                        I make TV shows for a living. But 
                        I’m not satisfied, you know? I want 
                        to write. I want to create. 

                                 RUSS
                        Do you sleep, or is that not active 
                        enough for you?  

                                 HALEY
                        As little as possible. I have this 
                        sickness in me that I have so much 
                        I want to do and I’m running out of 
                        time. Like travel. I’ve never even 
                        been to Italy. What is that? I know 
                        I’m young, relatively, but that 
                        attitude keeps me going. 
                                 RUSS
                        Despite the fact that I’m exhausted 
                        just listening to your calendar, I 
                        think it’s awesome. Beats the 
                        alternative, feeling like you let 
                        life pass you by. 

                                 HALEY
                        That’s the idea. What about you? 

                                 RUSS
                        I love movies too. I still play 
                        video games, but mostly the sports 
                        ones. And even then I just 
                        simulate, which is weird, I know. 

                                 HALEY
                        You play the important games 
                        though, right? 

                                 RUSS
                        Of course. I don’t read as much as 
                        I’d like to. I really enjoy 
                        holidays. All of them.

                                 HALEY
                        Even Easter? 

                                 RUSS
                        Even Easter. I like to swim, I grew 
                        up near the beach. I like to play 
                        board games, and...I like to eat 
                        baked goods with strangers. 

           Haley grins despite herself. She takes Russ in for a beat. 

                                 HALEY
                        You’re an interesting guy, Russ.

           He returns the look. 

                                 RUSS
                        Hey, do you want to come with me to 
                        this thing my sister hosts at her 
                        house on Saturday? It’s at 1 so 
                        you’d still have your night. 

                                 HALEY
                        Family on the first date? 

                                 RUSS
                        What’s this? 
                                 HALEY
                        Not a date. This was an accident.  

           Nervous sip from Russ. 

                                 RUSS
                        What’s your go-to first date? 

                                 HALEY
                        I don’t really go on dates. But IF 
                        it happens, I like this little 
                        Mexican place by my house. 

                                 RUSS
                        Solely for proximity? 

                                 HALEY
                        I can walk, yes. But they have 
                        these nachos on the secret menu 
                        that I always order because you 
                        can’t eat them with a fork. There’s 
                        something about having your face 
                        covered in guac that really eases 
                        the tension. And if it’s going 
                        well, there’s a lovely little bar 
                        for dancing next door. 

                                 RUSS
                        For never doing them, that’s a well 
                        thought out ideal first date. 

                                 HALEY
                        And yours...is a luncheon with your 
                        sister. 

                                 RUSS
                        I wouldn’t say it’s my ideal. But 
                        neither is watching someone eat 
                        french fries with mustard. 
                             (shrugs)
                        No pressure. 

           Haley bites her lip. 

           INT. IMPROV THEATER - SATURDAY MORNING

           Haley’s on a small stage in a tiny theater with three GIRLS 
           (late 20s). There’s, like, seven people in the audience. The 
           girls play parts in this make believe. 

                                 HALEY
                             (playing Miranda)
                        I’m Miranda Priestly!

                                 HALEY (CONT'D)
                        The editor of Runway magazine. I 
                        decide what is fashion. 

           Haley takes a sip of her imaginary beverage. 

                                 NOEL
                             (playing Margaret 
                              Thatcher)
                        As Prime Minister, I decree that 
                        Sophie will decide what is, or is 
                        not, fashion. 

                                 JOSIE
                             (playing Sophie)
                        Don’t make me choose. I can’t. 

                                 OLIVIA
                             (playing the Witch)
                        Into the woods, we all must go, to 
                        discover fashion, yes or no!

           The other three women glare at the Witch. Then Haley tosses 
           fake coffee all over her. The Witch stares aghast at her 
           ruined clothes. 

                                 HALEY
                             (playing Miranda)
                        Now THAT is fashion. 

           The four girls start laughing and gather at the front of the 
           stage for a bow. The audience is as confused as you are, but 
           the smattering of applause pales in comparison to the fun 
           they had. 

                                 JOSIE
                        We’re the Streep Sweepers, the 
                        entirely Meryl Streep improv group. 
                        Thank you so much for coming! 

           BYRON (50s) walks up on stage.   

                                 BYRON 
                        Alright everyone, open mic’s over, 
                        you gotta clear out. I have a class 
                        at noon. Same time next week, and 
                        if anyone wants to sign up there’s 
                        a sheet outside my office. 

           No one wants to sign up. The crowd shuffles towards the exit.

                                 JOSIE
                        What’d you think, Byron? 
                                 BYRON
                        I only saw the end. 

                                 JOSIE
                        Liar. I saw you watching. 

                                 BYRON
                        You’re getting better, I’ll give 
                        you that. But your schtick is still 
                        completely ridiculous. 

                                 JOSIE
                        It’s unique! Let us open for one of 
                        your shows. 10 minutes. Tops. You 
                        know you want to. 

                                 BYRON
                        You keep practicing and I’ll 
                        consider it. For now, scram. 

           He exits. They get their things. 

                                 NOEL
                        Thanks for joining, Haley. It’s so 
                        fun playing with you. 

                                 OLIVIA
                        If Byron lets us open you have to 
                        be there. 

                                 HALEY
                        I’d love to, just say the word. 
                             (checks her phone)
                        Shit. 

                                 JOSIE
                        You have to get to set, right? 

                                 HALEY
                        My show is shooting today but I’m 
                        skipping it. I’m having lunch with 
                        this guy I met randomly. 

                                 JOSIE
                        Whoa. Did you join Meet Cute? 

                                 HALEY
                        Uhh, yes, but it’s not like that. 

                                 JOSIE
                        Whatever you say. 

           Haley makes a face at her. Gives them all hugs. Races out. 
           EXT. PALISADES HOUSE - 1PM 

           Haley approaches the front door of a beautiful family home. 
           She’s in a sleek, ankle length dress. Stylish but not fancy. 
           She RINGS the door bell. 

           INT. PALISADES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Russ is dressed very casually, almost sporty. He jogs to the 
           door. Swings it open. Sees Haley. 

                                 RUSS
                        Hey! Right on time. 

                                 HALEY
                        A first. 

           He gives her a massive hug and drags her inside. When they 
           separate he looks at her again. 

                                 RUSS
                        Wow, you look...wonderful. 

                                 HALEY
                        Am I over dressed? You didn’t 
                        say... 

                                 RUSS
                        No no no you’re fine. It’s fine. 

           Russ’s sister GEORGIA walks in. She’s older and clearly in 
           charge. She’s followed by a group of around 10 GUESTS, all 
           dressed like they’re going for a run. 

                                 GEORGIA
                        OK enough chit chat, lets rock this 
                        thing. Everyone to the backyard! 
                        Russy, I hope your friend’s ready 
                        to bring it. 

           They march past a confused Haley and an uncomfortable Russ. 

                                 RUSS
                        Yea...so...this is a kickball game 
                        she does every month. I’m so sorry 
                        I didn’t tell you. I thought it 
                        would be like a fun surprise. But 
                        it never occurred to me that you 
                        would show up in the wrong attire. 
                        Because I’m an idiot. But we don’t 
                        have to play! We can grab a drink 
                        and watch. It’s pretty funny...Or 
                        we don’t need to watch...I’m sorry.

                        want. I’ll make an excuse. 

           Haley lets him wear this for one extra long second.

                                 HALEY
                        What do you take me for? 

           She collects the bottom of her dress in a fist and ties it 
           off just above her knee. All Range Kicking Motion activated!

           Haley leads the way to the backyard. 

           EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           A kickball diamond is set up with huge bases taped off. 

                                 GEORGIA
                        Listen up people. You know the 
                        rules. You can’t play unless you 
                        have a solo cup in hand. You can 
                        have more than one player on a base 
                        at a time. You don’t have to run on 
                        a hit, but if you leave first base 
                        you have to get to third. No 
                        stopping at second. If you get to 
                        first, you drink. If you get to 
                        third, you drink. If you’re 
                        thirsty, you drink. If you’re 
                        tired, suck it up. Remember, we’re 
                        not here to have fun, we’re here to 
                        see how power corrupts. Me and the 
                        man honored to call himself my 
                        husband, Isaac, will pick teams. 
                        Because of a deal struck in the 
                        bedroom last night which will not 
                        be discussed publicly at this time, 
                        he gets first pick. 

           She yields the floor to a couple WOLF WHISTLES. 

                                 HALEY
                             (whispers to Russ)
                        How did she start that speech with 
                        you know the rules??

           ISAAC (late 30s) dances his way up and scans the crowd. His 
           eyes land on Haley. 
                                 ISAAC
                        I think I want the new girl who 
                        wore a dress to a kickball game. 

                                 RUSS
                        That was my fault. Poor 
                        instructions. This is Haley by the 
                        way. She normally- 

                                 HALEY
                        Doesn't take it easy on anyone, but 
                        decided to be nice today and wear a 
                        dress to level the playing field. 

           Ohhhhhhh snap. She kicks off her heels. 

                                 GEORGIA
                        That’s what I’m talking about! I 
                        love this girl. 

           Russ looks at Haley. He shrugs. She winks. Lets play. 

           EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Five people on Georgia’s team in the field. Russ pitching. 
           Haley up first. 

                                 GEORGIA
                        No meatballs, Russy. Loyalty 
                        doesn’t cross the baseline. 

           Russ shakes his head. Glares in at Haley. She crinkles her 
           nose back at him. He rolls. With solo cup in hand and 
           barefoot, she takes one step and unleashes a BOMB. 

           It flies over the outfielder’s head so fast it might reach 
           Malibu. Russ gets whiplash trying to follow the ball. Haley’s 
           team is going nuts. Russ turns around. 

                                 HALEY
                        Theater girl my ass. 

           She takes off around the bases while Russ’s team chases her 
           home run ball in vain. 

           JUMP CUT AS NECESSARY

           Russ rips a hit into right field which scores a few runs. 

           Someone on Georgia’s team drops a pop up in the outfield and 
           she’s rage screaming at them at the top of her lungs. 
           Haley runs into first base. A few teammates wait for her 
           there. They cheers their solo cups and chug. 

           Isaac smokes a kick but Georgia makes a ridiculous diving 
           stop, beer in hand, and throws him out. She wags her finger 
           in his face. Really rubbing it in. 

           Russ on first base. Someone gets a hit and he takes off. He 
           touches second and keeps going. Haley takes the relay throw 
           and PEGS him. His beer explodes in his face. 

           All the fun. All of it. 

           INT. PALISADES HOUSE - LATER

           Haley paces alone in the living room, talking on her cell. 

                                 HALEY
                        Don’t worry. Just let me handle. 

           Russ appears with a bandage wrap. 

                                 RUSS
                        There you are. 

           She hangs up. Why doesn’t anyone ever say goodbye?? 

                                 HALEY
                        I swear I’m good. I don’t need it. 

           He kneels down and we see she has a scrape on her shin. 

                                 RUSS
                        I can’t believe you slid during 
                        kickball.

                                 HALEY
                        I wasn’t about to get thrown out at 
                        third. 

           Russ delicately wraps her leg and gives it a quick squeeze. 

                                 RUSS
                        Sorry we’re out of Neosporin. You 
                        were a champ today. Everyone loves 
                        you. 

           Haley eyes the floor. Looks at her bandage. Then her phone. 

                                 HALEY
                        Russ, I’m not really looking to be 
                        in a relationship. 
           Russ, taken aback. Where did that come from? 

                                 RUSS
                        Oh, that’s fine. I didn’t mean to 
                        give off the impression...I don’t 
                        want to rush into anything either. 

                                 HALEY
                        I only bring it up because I think 
                        you’re my Meet Cute. And I didn’t 
                        want to lead you on. Are you on 
                        that app?   

                                 RUSS
                        Of course. Aren’t you? 

                                 HALEY
                        Tricia made me download it. It’s a 
                        bit ridiculous, right? 

                                 RUSS
                        I actually work there, so....

                                 HALEY
                        What?

                                 RUSS
                        You said no job talk. 

                                 HALEY
                        Wow. That’s...Do you like it? 

                                 RUSS
                        It’s a great gig. My boss has been 
                        really loyal to the engineers. It’s 
                        still the original crew he hired. 

                                 HALEY
                        I meant the app. 

                                 RUSS
                        Oh, right. Yea, I do. It works. And 
                        it’s fun. I like fun. 

           Off her look. 

                                 RUSS (CONT’D)
                        But you hate fun? 

                                 HALEY
                        I don’t hate fun. I just don’t 
                        think it works. 

           Off his look. 
                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        Not because of you! You’ve been a 
                        delight actually. But...I don’t 
                        want...

                                 RUSS
                        A boyfriend. 

                                 HALEY
                        A boyfriend. I was supposed to be 
                        on set today. It was an easy shoot 
                        so I came here instead. Now I have 
                        an actor refusing to say his lines, 
                        which I have to clean up. I don’t 
                        have time for stuff like... 
                             (gestures to house)
                        ...this. 

                                 RUSS
                        Career first, I understand. 

                                 HALEY
                        Look, I want a family. I know I’m 
                        getting older and I know it’s 
                        tougher on women. But there are 
                        still things I want to accomplish 
                        while I’m single. There's a version 
                        of a great girlfriend that I want 
                        to be. I can’t be that right now. 
                        So I don’t want to be anyone’s bad 
                        girlfriend. Does that make sense? 

                                 RUSS
                        Sure. It’s weirdly considerate 
                        while also selfish in a way. But 
                        not a bad way. You know yourself 
                        and you’re honest. I think those 
                        two qualities alone put you ahead 
                        of most of the dating world. 

                                 HALEY
                        The way I see it, we have our whole 
                        lives ahead of us. But it’s only MY 
                        life until I settle down. Then it’s 
                        a shared life. And that’s a 
                        beautiful thing that I’m looking 
                        forward to. But I only have MY life 
                        for a little bit longer. So I want 
                        to make sure I make the most of it 
                        before it’s gone. 
                             (beat, Russ absorbs)
                        I should probably go. 
                                 RUSS
                        Don’t go cause this is weird now. 

                                 HALEY
                        No, it’s not weird. 

           It is. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        I just have to, uh... 

           Do nothing. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        Go. 

           Russ takes her spritzer and puts it down. He gives her a hug 
           and she pulls out of it quickly. And from whence she came...  

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Haley and Tricia walk on the treadmill. Tricia’s is 
           aggressively inclined. Haley - winded but composed. 
           Tricia - soaked with sweat, near tears from exhaustion. 

                                 TRICIA
                        I was talking to my show’s makeup 
                        artist today. You remember Nicole? 

                                 HALEY
                        Sure, the red head. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Get this. Apparently she slept with 
                        Keaton Brown when he was on set. 

                                 HALEY
                        The Meet Cute guy?? 

                                 TRICIA
                        That’s not the half of it. She said 
                        he made her hold a mirror in front 
                        of her face while they did it! And 
                        he kept calling her ‘Keaton.’ 

                                 HALEY
                        WHAT?! Please tell me you have 
                        footage of this. 

                                 TRICIA
                        I don’t know why you would ever 
                        want to see that, but no. We don’t 
                        have cameras in the green room. 
                                 HALEY
                        I wonder if he puts “I’m a freak 
                        who likes to have sex with himself” 
                        on his Meet Cute profile. I told 
                        you I didn’t want to join this app. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Probably not something he wants to 
                        advertise. And his fetishes have 
                        nothing to do with Russ.

           Steps. Side look from Tricia. 

                                 TRICIA (CONT’D)
                        Are you really not going to text 
                        him again? You had fun together. 

                                 HALEY
                        How many times are you going to ask 
                        me that? You know my stance. 

                                 TRICIA
                        I know Hails. I’ve heard it so many 
                        times I could probably deliver the 
                        whole speech myself. 
                             (parrots back in a voice)
                        There’s a version of a girlfriend I 
                        wanna be...

           Haley tries to stifle her smirk. Fails. 

                                 HALEY
                        I missed work for him. That can’t 
                        happen. 

                                 TRICIA
                        You told me yourself it didn’t 
                        matter. You’re just doing that 
                        thing where you latch on to a tiny 
                        problem when you want an out. 

                                 HALEY
                        I am not. I’m stopping it before 
                        Russ has a chance to complain that 
                        I don’t give up my whole life for 
                        him. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Don’t put every guy in the same 
                        category. It’s possible for someone 
                        new to show up and make you rethink 
                        everything. 
           Marcus approaches in the lamest workout clothes ever worn, 
           towel over his shoulder. 

                                 HALEY
                        Is that what happened with you? 

           Tricia smiles at him. 

                                 TRICIA
                        I didn’t need to rethink anything. 
                        I was ready. 

           Tricia stops the treadmill. Haley follows suit. 

                                 TRICIA (CONT’D)
                        Good workout, babe? 

                                 MARCUS
                        This place is so unsanitary. I 
                        brought you a towel. Wipe it down. 
                        Wipe everything down. I think I 
                        tweaked my back. 

           Tricia takes the towel while Haley looks at the two of them. 
           She reaches for her phone. 

           INT. MEET CUTE OFFICE - DAY 

           Thatcher sits at his desk scrolling through pictures of Emily 
           Blunt. Russ walks up behind him but Thatcher’s in a trance.  

           Russ eyes the screen, watches for a beat. 

                                 RUSS
                        Thatch. 

           Thatcher has a seizure. He tries to minimize the screen in a 
           panic but misses a few times, then knocks over some pens, 
           then goes with turning off the monitor altogether. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Sup? 

                                 RUSS
                        Was that Emily Blunt?

                                 THATCHER
                        Yes. She’s wonderful and the photos 
                        were safe for work. Can I help you, 
                        or do you intend to rob me of my 
                        entire lunch break? 
                                 RUSS
                        She texted me. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Emily Blunt?! 

           Thatcher’s instantly no longer bothered. Russ squints at him. 
           Hoping he’ll get there. Wait for it....And he got there. 

                                 THATCHER (CONT’D)
                        Oh! What’d she say? 

                                 RUSS
                        Her friend, that Tricia girl, is 
                        having a Christmas party. 

                                 THATCHER
                        And you’re invited? 

                                 RUSS
                        No, she felt the need to tell me I 
                        can’t come to a Christmas party I 
                        didn’t know about. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Right. Sorry, this is just really 
                        big for me. When is it? 

                                 RUSS
                        Friday. 

                                 THATCHER
                        NO!

                                 RUSS
                        Is that bad? 

                                 THATCHER
                        That's the company party. 

                                 RUSS
                        Oh damnit. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Keaton will expect you there. 

                                 RUSS
                        Maybe I can hit both? 

                                 THATCHER
                        Venice to Los Feliz!? 
                             (pulls phone up to mouth)
                        Siri...add “Both Parties” to--
           INT. TRICIA’S APARTMENT - FRIDAY NIGHT

           The mistletoe has been hung. The holly has been decked. The 
           jingle bells are rocking. The egg is nogging. 

           The crowded party’s in full swing and everyone’s dressed on 
           theme. Russ, in all his ugly sweater glory, searches. 

           He spots Haley’s head bobbing in a Santa Hat. He catches up 
           to her and playfully pokes her in the stomach. He’s a little 
           drunk. Color Haley not amused. 

                                 HALEY
                        Didn’t think you were showing up. 

                                 RUSS
                        Sorry, I had a work thing. I wanted 
                        to be here, but my boss bought a 
                        shaved ice machine and made us have 
                        a snowball fight in the office. 

                                 HALEY
                        I hope no one hit him in the face. 
                        Wouldn’t want to tarnish his 
                        reflection. 

           Boom ROASTED. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        And you didn’t have to bail on your 
                        plans. It’s just a party. 

           Russ engages damage control protocol. 

                                 RUSS
                        Hey. I’m right where I want to be. 
                        And I like your hat. 

           He flicks the dangling pom-pom. She rolls her eyes but grins. 

                                 HALEY
                        Is that for me? 

           Haley points to a fancy bottle of vodka in his hand. 

                                 RUSS
                        Holy ego! No, this isn’t for you. 
                        What kinda guy gets a girl a 
                        Christmas present right after she 
                        told him she doesn’t want anything 
                        serious?  

                                 HALEY
                        Yea, that’s a crazy move. 
                                 RUSS
                        I assume Tricia drinks Vodka. Is 
                        there somewhere I can put this? 

                                 HALEY
                        Everyone drinks vodka. Except for 
                        Marcus. 

           Haley’s gaze finds Tricia and Marcus. Tricia’s tipping a 
           bottle of vodka into a huge punch bowl of eggnog. Marcus’s 
           picking up used solo cups and putting them in a trash bag. 

           Haley grabs the bottle of vodka and leads Russ into...

           INT. TRICIA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Russ looks around the room, clocking photos of Tricia and 
           Marcus together. Haley puts the vodka on Tricia’s bed. 

                                 HALEY
                        This way it doesn’t get mixed in 
                        with the party booze. Otherwise 
                        it’ll be gone by morning. 

                                 RUSS
                        I didn’t leave a note. 

                                 HALEY
                        I’ll make sure she knows where to 
                        send her thank you card. 

           Russ jokingly wipes his brow. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        Alright, do you wanna get a drink 
                        and meet people? 

                                 RUSS
                        I’d talk to you all night. Is that 
                        an option? 

                                 HALEY
                        I didn’t invite you here to talk to 
                        me all night. 

                                 RUSS
                        But you did invite me... 

           Eyebrow raise. He’s trouble. She knows it already. 

                                 HALEY
                        It’s a party! Make friends! 
           INT. TRICIA’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Haley scoops herself a generous portion of vodka eggnog and 
           figures she’s left Russ on his own long enough. Let’s see if 
           he’s surviving, shall we? 

           She finds him in the kitchen, and oh my god. He’s the life of 
           the party! Kris Kringle? More like Kris Mingle! .......Sorry. 

           A GIRL WITH ELF EARS is sitting in a chair, head leaning 
           back. Russ has PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS in one hand, WHIPPED CREAM 
           SPRAY in the other. Tricia holds a bottle of CHOCOLATE SYRUP. 
           Marcus watches on in horror. 

           First, Russ pours some schnapps into the Elf’s mouth. Tricia 
           follows up with the chocolate syrup, spilling half of it on 
           the floor. Russ tops her off with the whipped cream. 

                                 RUSS
                        Now shake!

           The Elf leans forward and shakes her head left and right, 
           blending the shot together. She swallows and jumps in the air 
           as everyone cheers. 

           Russ HIGH FIVES Tricia, then grabs a paper towel from the 
           counter. He wipes the chocolate syrup off the floor and WINKS 
           at Marcus. 

           Tricia catches Haley’s gaze. She side nods at Russ and gives 
           Haley the A-OK hand signal. Maybe this could work?

           EXT. BALCONY - LATER 

           The party’s dying down and Russ and Haley sit on the floor of 
           the balcony. There are chairs, but this is more comfortable 
           at the moment. 

           The view of the city looks pretty cool from up here. 
           Christmas lights line the railing. 

                                 RUSS
                        I really appreciate Tricia putting 
                        effort into the decorations. It 
                        makes or breaks a Christmas party. 

                                 HALEY
                        Don’t you? Mr. I-love-all-holidays. 

                                 RUSS
                        I go wild with it. Nutcrackers, 
                        lights, stockings, the tree, a REAL 
                        tree by the way. 
                                 HALEY
                        Obviously. 

                                 RUSS
                        I start decorating the day after 
                        Halloween. 

                                 HALEY
                        Ewww you’re one of those? You have 
                        to respect Thanksgiving. 

                                 RUSS
                        Thanksgiving is fantastic. They can 
                        coexist. One month isn’t nearly 
                        enough time for Christmas music. 

                                 HALEY
                        I don’t know...

           Russ takes her Santa Hat off and puts it on his head. He 
           reaches out and puts an arm around her, pulling her up 
           against him in the brisk night. 

           She hesitates, then lowers her head onto his shoulder. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        Be careful. 

                                 RUSS
                        What if I don't wanna be careful? 

                                 HALEY
                        I’m difficult. 

                                 RUSS
                        I don’t care. 

                                 HALEY
                        Alright, but you’re gonna get hurt. 
                        Everyone says they wont get hurt, 
                        but they do. 

                                 RUSS
                        Thankfully you’ve got just the 
                        thing for minor cuts and scrapes. 

           Russ reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small present. 
           It’s expertly wrapped and has Haley’s name on it. 

           Haley gasps, theatrically incredulous. 

                                 HALEY
                        What kinda guy does this?? 
           She opens it up and reveals a travel sized tube of Neosporin. 

                                 RUSS
                        A crazy one. 

           Haley leans in. Russ leans in. And....BANG! A kiss! And we 
           didn’t even have to wait til the end! 

           EXT. FARMERS MARKET - DAY 

           The closed off street is full of pop-up shops. Russ and Haley 
           are out on the town. 

                                 HALEY
                        I don’t get why it doesn’t just say 
                        “go to Whole Foods at 2pm.” 

                                 RUSS
                        That would defeat the purpose! 
                        Think about it this way. When we 
                        met, what did yours say? 

                                 HALEY
                        I don’t remember. 

                                 RUSS
                        Mine said “Looks like you could use 
                        some groceries”...smiley face. 

                                 HALEY
                        Nice touch. And that little yellow 
                        circle made you race to Whole 
                        Foods?? 

                                 RUSS
                        No. I actually didn’t even see the 
                        notification until after, but 
                        that’s my point. Groceries could 
                        have taken me anywhere. The hope is 
                        we run into each other. 

                                 HALEY
                        At the same place at the same time. 
                        Cause that makes sense. 

                                 RUSS
                        Well we only get notifications when 
                        we’re in close proximity. That’s 
                        why we can use messages like “how 
                        does a coffee sound?” We know 
                        there’s a chance the two people 
                        will end up in the same spot. 
                                 HALEY
                        How do you know if they meet? 

                                 RUSS
                        The same way we know when you’re in 
                        close proximity. The app is 
                        tracking your phone, so if the two 
                        phones go into the same location at 
                        the same time, that’s called an 
                        HPI, or High Percentage 
                        Interaction. We give couples 3 HPIs 
                        before moving on to another match. 

                                 HALEY
                        HPIs. Only tech virgins can making 
                        dating sound like an infection. 

                                 RUSS
                        We’re not virgins. I’ve had sex 
                        probably 2 to 4 times.  

                                 HALEY
                        So if I didn’t go into Whole Foods 
                        when you did, that wouldn’t have 
                        counted as one of our HPIs? 

                                 RUSS
                        Exactly right. Normally we send 
                        users a bunch of notifications 
                        before they actually have an HPI.

                                 HALEY
                        Yea, I mean I didn’t have my first 
                        HPI til sophomore year of college.  

                                 RUSS
                        Hm. I woulda guessed high school. 

           That earns Russ a playful dead arm.

                        But do you see how that’s more fun 
                        than being texted an arranged 
                        meeting spot? You never know who 
                        it’s going to be because you don’t 
                        even know if you’re in the right 
                        place.

                        I’m not forcing anyone to do 
                        anything, I just write the code.

                        You forced me to come here. 

                                 RUSS
                        This is a valid point. But you 
                        don’t count. You won’t even come to 
                        Valentines dinner with me so I have 
                        to take what I can get.

                        drag you to a King’s game on 
                        Friday? My office has a box and 
                        it’s my turn for the tickets.

                        you’ll want to grab dinner. And-

                                 RUSS
                        We can meet there.

                        We’re shooting that night and it 
                        might go late. I should be on set. 

                                 RUSS
                        It’s all good. I’ll take Thatch. 

           A beat. Small smile creeps onto Haley’s face. Then Russ stops 
           their walk. Haley’s confused. Then Russ proudly points ahead.

                        Russ!

           Russ gives her a hug. Yup. They’re on hugging terms. 
                                 RUSS
                        This is a big day. Haley, it is my

                                 PIE LADY
                        I do have a name. 

           Haley makes “told you!” eyes at Russ.

                        But it’s a secret. My favorite 
                        customers refer to me by my 
                        preferred title. Pie Lady. 

           Russ makes “told you!” eyes at Haley.

                        That doesn’t count. I’m right.

                        Ummmm, blueberry please. 
           Pie Lady grabs a picturesque blueberry from her stock. She 
           trades Russ pie for cash. Russ dips into a sweeping bow.

           She curtseys in return. Haley and Russ keep moving. 

           INT. NETWORK OFFICES - EVENING

           Haley reading a script. FLOWERS rest in a vase on her desk 
           with a card from Russ. Thanks for not being an idiot, Russ. 
           Haley’s the only one still here. Minus her assistant of 
           course. 

           An email PINGS on her laptop. Her eyes wander. It’s from 
           JOSIE. The subject reads “WE NEED YOU!” 

           She opens it. “Byron’s letting us perform next weekend!!!!!!” 
           Under it is a MERYL STREEP GIF. These girls are nuts. 

           Her assistant knocks on her door frame. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        You should go if you’re gonna make 
                        your drinks. 

           Haley nods her thanks but her eyes drift over to the TV on 
           mute, mounted against the wall. It’s the Kings game. Her eyes 
           linger, then she shuts it off and leaves. But we go into...

           INT. STAPLES CENTER - MEANWHILE

           Thatcher returns to his seat next to Russ with two beers. 
           They’re in the company box, prime seats.

                        Here you go, bud. On me.

                        know any of these mooches.

                                 RUSS
                        We give away these tickets to 
                        clients all the time. It’s how we 
                        keep up relationships. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Can someone tell the relationships 
                        to save some bean dip for the rest

           Russ covers his now exploded ear drum.

                        I still don’t know what it is.

                        I’m in ad sales. I don’t read. 

                                 RUSS
                        It’s simple code. It’s more of an 
                        idea I had. We’re always trying to 
                        tweak the compatibility scores on 
                        the app by ranking each core value.

                                 RUSS
                        Butt stuff is on there but it’s 
                        shockingly low. My idea is that the 
                        most important qualifiers are what 
                        shows they’re watching and where 
                        they get take out. We already let 
                        users link their Netflix but I’m 
                        implementing a way to link their 
                        Postmates. You’d be shocked how 
                        happy couples say they are together 
                        when they don’t fight over what to 
                        order and what to watch.

                             (sits down)
                        You gotta invite her, bud. It’s 
                        your birthday. 

                                 RUSS
                        I don’t want to pressure her. 

                                 THATCHER
                        You can invite someone to your 
                        birthday. It’s weird if you don’t 
                        invite her then she finds out. 

                                 RUSS
                        You’re oddly wise sometimes Thatch. 
                        Don’t ever change. 
                                 THATCHER
                        CHANGE!!!! 

           He’s on his feet again, upset about ice time. He turns back 
           to the uncomfortable clients in the box. 

                                 THATCHER (CONT’D)
                        Go Kings, right!? 

           INT. MEET CUTE OFFICES - THAT NIGHT

           It’s dark in here as Russ arrives at his desk post Kings 
           game. He shakes his computer awake and logs in. A faint 
           PANTING in the distance catches his ear. 

           Russ creeps toward the sound, nervous. He grabs a paddle off 
           the ping pong table for a weapon. He peers around the corner. 

                                 KEATON
                        RP! 

           Russ jumps and drops the paddle. Keaton - work clothes on the 
           bottom, shirtless on the top. He’s covered in sweat with a 
           headband on. He take a huge pull from a Gatorade. 

                                 KEATON (CONT’D)
                        How was the game?!

                                 RUSS
                        Jesus, Keaton, you scared me. 

                                 KEATON
                             (super serious)
                        Fear is the mind killer. 

                                 RUSS
                             (confused)
                        Is that...from Dune? 

           Keaton slaps Russ on the shoulder. 

                                 KEATON
                        Yes! Thank you for being well read. 

           Keaton picks up the paddle and walks back to the ping pong 
           table. It’s folded in half so you can play by yourself. 

                                 RUSS
                        What are you doing here so late? 

                                 KEATON
                        I could ask you the same question. 
           He grabs the ball and starts hammering it back to himself, 
           Forrest Gump style. 

                                 KEATON (CONT’D)
                        Yasmine beat me last week. We can’t 
                        have that, can we RP? 

                                 RUSS
                        Uh, I suppose not. 

                                 KEATON
                        Did you forget something? 

                                 RUSS
                        I told you I’d send you the 
                        restaurant code to review before I 
                        left for the game. I forgot. 

                                 KEATON
                        You didn’t have to come all the way 
                        back just for that. 

                                 RUSS
                             (shrugs)
                        I’m here now. Wanna check it out? 

           Keaton snatches the ball out of mid air with his free hand. 

                                 KEATON
                        Hell yes. 

           INT. MEET CUTE OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER

           Russ at his computer. Keaton’s over his shoulder, scrolling 
           through lines of code way too fast to possibly read. 

                                 KEATON
                        This is a game changer. And RP. 
                             (grabs Russ’s shoulder)
                        So are you. 

                                 RUSS
                        We good to launch in the morning? 

                                 KEATON
                        Do it right now! The lovers out 
                        there need us. We can’t let them 
                        down. Here: 

           Keaton logs out Russ and logs in with his ADMIN ACCOUNT. 
                                 KEATON (CONT’D)
                        You do it. 
                             (holds up paddle)
                        My forehand topspin return isn’t 
                        going to murder Yasmine by itself. 

           Keaton power walks away. Russ opens the master code and 
           uploads his new feature. Closes out. Pauses. Admin access...

           ON THE COMPUTER - in the search bar he types 
           @RussellPhillips10. His profile pops up. He clicks 
           NOTIFICATIONS. Scrolls back to NOVEMBER 28TH. It reads “Looks 
           like you could use some groceries” with a smiley face. Awww 
           the memories. 

           ON RUSS - a quick peek to make sure Keaton’s long gone. 

           ON THE COMPUTER - searches @HaleyMoss87. Clicks on 
           NOTIFICATIONS. Wonder what hers said? Scrolls to NOVEMBER 
           28TH. “Perfect day for a walk in the park.” 

           Wait. Hold on. That’s not sending her to a grocery store?? 
           Noooo no no no no. That could only mean one thing...  

           ON RUSS - Ohhhhhhhh shit.  

           EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER PACIFIC PARK - DAY 

           The Pier in all her glory. Because if you can put an 
           amusement park, an arcade, and over priced food ON the ocean, 
           you do it. 

           PAN DOWN over the Ferris Wheel onto the boardwalk to find 
           Thatcher and Russ. Thatcher’s inhaling a cup of Dippin Dots, 
           licking it clean. Yes, they still sell Dippin Dots here, 
           despite the fact it’s been the “ice cream of the future” for 
           the last 30 years. Russ’s brain is in a pretzel. 

                                 RUSS
                        Thatch, I gotta tell you something.

           Thatcher stops, lowers the cup for the first time. 

                                 THATCHER
                        What’s up, bud? 

                                 RUSS
                        When I went back to the office last 
                        night, Keaton was there. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Was he practicing ping pong? He 
                        lost the other day. What a leader. 
                                 RUSS
                        Yea, but that’s not what I wanted 
                        to tell you. After I uploaded my 
                        code I decided to poke around. I 
                        wanted to see what notification 
                        Haley got the day we met. 

                                 THATCHER
                        You guys should get your two 
                        messages framed so you can hang it 
                        in the guest room of your future 
                        house which I will often frequent. 

                                 RUSS
                        That’s the thing. Mine sent me to 
                        the grocery store. Hers tells her 
                        to go to the park. We met by 
                        accident. We’re not a match.

                                 THATCHER
                        What do you mean??

           Before he can elaborate they’re interrupted by an approaching 
           Simone and...Haley. Duh. 

                                 THATCHER (CONT’D)
                             (attempted whisper)
                        Are you gonna tell her?? 

           Russ with the universal subtle head shake. Shut upppppp. 

                                 HALEY
                        Tell me what? 

                                 THATCHER
                        That we want to do the sea dragon 
                        ride again. 

                                 SIMONE
                        Will you please stop licking that. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Never heard her say that before, ya 
                        know what I mean? 

           He elbows Russ in the ribs. Haley laughs. 

                                 THATCHER (CONT’D)
                        Haley gets me. 

           He offers her a high five. It’s not returned. He drops the 
           empty plastic cup on a table. Simone WHACKS him in the arm. 
                                 SIMONE
                        Pick that up this instant. 

           Thatcher accepts his punishment. Simone practically drags him 
           by the ear to find a trash can like the spoiled child he is. 

           Haley checks her phone. 

                                 RUSS
                        You having fun?  

                                 HALEY
                        Yea, of course.

           Russ looks behind him into the arcade section of Pacific 
           Park. He head nods for her to come with him. 

           They approach the Ring Toss. A CARNEY (18) sits behind the 
           booth. He’s literally the highest person you’ve ever seen.  

                                 RUSS
                        Hey man, you think I can snag one 
                        of these rings? I don’t want to 
                        play. I mean can I just keep one?

           The Carney isn’t even sure if Russ spoke. He mouth breathes 
           in Russ’s general direction. 

                                 RUSS (CONT’D)
                        Cool, gonna take that as a yes. 

           Russ pockets a tiny RED RING from the bucket and leads Haley 
           back to the boardwalk. 

                                 HALEY
                        You a collector? 

                                 RUSS
                        I like to keep trinkets from life’s 
                        big moments. 

                                 HALEY
                        This is a big moment? Didn’t 
                        realize 32 was a special birthday. 

                                 RUSS
                        Not that. It’s your first time to 
                        the Pier. 

                                 HALEY
                        And you’ve been 32 times. 
                                 RUSS
                        Ten! We started coming on my 
                        birthday after college. Thatch 
                        pretends it’s a big tradition we 
                        can’t break, but I know it’s more 
                        for him than me. 

                                 HALEY
                        So accommodating on your birthday. 
                        I’m a diva on mine.  

           Again with the phone. 

                                 RUSS
                        You sure you’re good? 

                                 HALEY
                        Absolutely. The girls are opening 
                        that improv show tonight, I was 
                        wishing them luck. 

                                 RUSS
                        Wait, what? That’s tonight? Why 
                        aren’t you there?? 

                                 HALEY
                        I told them I couldn’t make it. 

                                 RUSS
                        Who’s gonna be the devil in Prada? 

                                 HALEY
                        That’s not my only character! 

                                 RUSS
                        But none of those hacks pull it off 
                        like you do. Let’s go! You can 
                        still get there in plenty of time.

                                 HALEY
                        I’m not bailing on you. 

                                 RUSS
                        Who cares? It’s just a birthday. 

           He starts to walk out but she grabs his arm. 

                                 HALEY
                        Hey. I’m right where I want to be. 

           She’s goes up on her tip toes and gives him a kiss. 
                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        Plus, they’re only up for like 10 
                        minutes and the crowd sucks. 

                                 RUSS
                        There she is. 

           He playfully pokes her in the stomach. She flinches and grabs 
           his finger. 

                                 HALEY
                        Stop it! I hate when you do that. 

           Lie. That smile gives her away.  

                                 RUSS
                        No you don’t. 

           Russ agrees with the smile.  

                                 HALEY
                        I’ll eat it. 

           She opens her mouth wide and slowly raises his extended 
           finger as he fake struggles. 

                                 RUSS
                        No! Please no! 

           Simone walks up. 

                                 SIMONE
                        Are you cannibals ready? 

           Russ and Haley relent and follow Simone after Thatcher who’s 
           halfway to the sea dragon already. Before they get too far...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Haley! 

           Haley stops. Looks around. Enter...Zeke. Dun Dun Dunnnnnn.  

                                 HALEY
                        Zeke. Hey. Hi. 

           She shoulder checks awkwardly, then gives him a 5 out of 10 
           hug at best. Not pretty. 

                                 ZEKE
                        How are you? It’s been a while. 

           Damn, has he been working out more? Is that a new haircut?? 
           And that jawline could cut glass! 
                                 HALEY
                        Yea, it has. I’m good. 

                                 ZEKE
                        You look great. 

                                 HALEY
                        Thank you. 

                                 ZEKE
                        I see you’re doing your best 
                        tourist impression.  

                                 HALEY
                             (shrugs)
                        Kind of. 

           She gestures over her shoulder at Russ. He’s waiting with 
           Thatcher and Simone by the ride entrance. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        It’s a birthday tradition. I 
                        couldn’t pass it up. 

           Zeke looks over her shoulder at his competition. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Are you here with somebody? 

           She looks at Zeke again. OK, that’s definitely a new haircut. 
           But no, stop, she looks back at Russ. Sets herself. 

                                 HALEY
                        Yes. That’s Russ. I’m here with 
                        him. 

                                 ZEKE
                        That’s awesome, Haley. I’m happy 
                        for you. He’s a lucky guy. 

                                 HALEY
                        Are you just going on rides by 
                        yourself? 

                                 GIRL VOICE (O.S.)
                        Zeke? Zeke? 

           He motions to Haley to wait one second and turns around. 
           Haley’s embarrassed. 

                                 ZEKE
                        I’m right here! 
                                 HALEY
                        Oh, I didn’t realize you were with 
                        a girl. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Nah, it’s just my mum. 

           ZEKE’S MOM (late 50s) and a BOY (10) run up beside him.

                                 ZEKE’S MOM
                        Bathroom line was longer than 
                        anticipated. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Mum, this is my friend Haley. 

                                 HALEY
                        Hi. 

           She offers her hand but Zeke’s mom brings her in for a hug. 
           It’s a 4 out of 10 from Haley. We’re regressing here. 

                                 ZEKE’S MOM
                        It’s nice to meet you, Haley. 

                                 ZEKE
                        And this is my nephew, Max. 

           Zeke ruffles Max’s hair. Max smiles through his powdered 
           sugar mustache. 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        He’s got a slight drug problem, but 
                        we love him. You ready to ride, 
                        pal? 

           Max nods and runs off. Zeke’s mom chases after him. 

                                 ZEKE (CONT’D)
                        Great to see you Haley. 
                             (yells past her to Russ)
                        Happy birthday!

           And then he takes off after his family. Haley turns on her 
           heels and ambles back to Russ. 

                                 RUSS
                        Who was that? 

                                 HALEY
                        That was Zeke. I, uh...well, we 
                        used to...ummmm, I...

           Bail her out here, Russ. Please. 
                                 RUSS
                        Had lots and lots of sex with him.  

           A beat. The truth? Why not? 

                                 HALEY
                        Yea. Sorry. 

                                 RUSS
                        Don’t apologize. I wanna sleep with 
                        that guy! Did you see his haircut? 

           Haley laughs. Genuinely happy. She falls face first into 
           Russ’s chest. 

                                 RUSS (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go ride a lizard. 

           INT. TRICIA’S APARTMENT - DAY 

           Tricia’s all dolled up. She grabs her purse and runs for the 
           door. Haley’s at the kitchen counter. Marcus does dishes. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Thanks-for-the-help-love-you-bye! 

           She blows Haley a kiss on her way out. 

                                 HALEY
                        Good luck! 

                                 MARCUS
                        Bye hon- 
                             (door BANGS closed)
                        She’s gone. 

           Marcus is in need of a dryer. Haley volunteers for tribute. 

                                 HALEY
                        Let me give you a hand. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Please, it’s no trouble. Sit. 

           Haley insists. She grabs a dish towel and puts it to work. 

                                 HALEY
                        We made the mess, not you. 

           Marcus knows he won’t win this fight, so he might as well get 
           on board. He hands her each item as he finishes cleaning. 
                                 MARCUS
                        The wedding prep’s coming along. 

                                 HALEY
                        It helps when you’ve had everything 
                        planned out since you were eight.  

                                 MARCUS
                        I really appreciate you helping her 
                        out with the process. She doesn’t 
                        show it, but she’s stressing. 

                                 HALEY
                        We differ on cocktail hour hor 
                        d’oeuvre preferences, but otherwise 
                        she’s crushing it. 

                                 MARCUS
                        It should be fun. 

                                 HALEY
                        I think I’m gonna bring Russ. 

                                 MARCUS
                        That’s wonderful! Tricia approving 
                        of your plus one is not a scenario 
                        I saw coming to fruition. 

           Haley whips her dish towel at him playfully. 

                                 HALEY
                        What’s that supposed to mean? Come 
                        on, what does she say about me when 
                        I’m not here? Spill it. 

                                 MARCUS
                        No, nothing. She just wants you to 
                        have the best life. Her version of 
                        the best life. Which means you need 
                        to find a nice guy, settle down, 
                        and have a minivan’s worth of kids.

                                 HALEY
                        Ugh. I’d rather be hit by a minivan 
                        full of kids. 

                                 MARCUS
                        The gentlemen you usually bring 
                        around, they don’t...and I’m being 
                        delicate here...fit the fantasy she 
                        has for you. But Russ...

                                 HALEY
                        You’re a fan? 
                                 MARCUS
                        It doesn’t matter what I think. 
                        What do you think? 

           Haley winces. Can’t fathom she’s saying this. 

                                 HALEY
                        I really like him. Listen, I’m 
                        nowhere near marriage. That hasn’t 
                        changed. But he’s been such a 
                        pleasant...surprise. 

                                 MARCUS
                        How so? 

                                 HALEY
                        You know me. I’ve been saying 
                        forever that these apps and dating 
                        sites don’t work. But then I tried 
                        it, and we’re so compatible. 

                                 MARCUS
                        You like the same things. 

                                 HALEY
                        It’s not even that. We have a lot 
                        in common, sure, but it’s our 
                        attitude about the things we don’t. 
                        I run into problems with guys 
                        because I’m never around. That’s 
                        always where it ends. They want to 
                        see more of me, or they don’t want 
                        to do something casual at our age, 
                        or they need me to give up things I 
                        love. Russ is different. He likes 
                        it when I’m independent. He wants 
                        me to chase my passions. 

                                 MARCUS
                        That must be a nice change. 

                                 HALEY
                        It’s refreshing. I’m not operating 
                        under this ticking clock. Neither 
                        is he. At every turn I think “this 
                        is going to be when he breaks” but 
                        each time I underestimate him. 
                        Tricia kept telling me I’d find 
                        someone I want to miss things for. 
                        She was right.  

                                 MARCUS
                        You should do an ad for Meet Cute. 
                                 HALEY
                        I’m a believer! I didn’t want to 
                        need a dating app to find something 
                        like what you and Tricia have, but 
                        it’s a good thing I gave it a shot.

                                 MARCUS
                        Yea, we got really lucky. 

           Haley’s cell phone RINGS. She checks the screen. 

                                 HALEY
                        Do you mind? 

           Of course he doesn’t. Haley ducks into...

           INT. TRICIA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           The approximately one million outfits that Tricia tried on 
           before she left lie discarded and forgotten on the bed. 

           She answers her phone on SPEAKER while folding clothes. See? 
           She’s a good friend too. 

                                 HALEY
                        Josie cat! How are you? 

           Josie’s voice ECHOES out of the phone speakers. 

                                 JOSIE (O.S.)
                        Guess. What. No, don’t. I’ll tell 
                        you. 

           Haley waits...

                                 HALEY
                        Are you still there? 

                                 JOSIE (O.S.)
                        Yes, I was letting it build. 

                                 HALEY
                        I’m ready. It’s fully built. 

                                 JOSIE (O.S.)
                        I was trying to wait to tell you in 
                        person but you’re never free and 
                        it’s exploding out of me. You know 
                        the show we did the other night? 

                                 HALEY
                        Yes of course, I should have called 
                        you. How’d it go? 
                                 JOSIE (O.S.)
                        We were pretty good. Noel’s Julia 
                        Child impression is horrible, which 
                        is nearly impossible, but that’s 
                        neither here nor there.  

                                 HALEY
                        What are we doing here? 

                                 JOSIE (O.S.)
                        I’m texting you a picture. Look 
                        what happened!!

           Haley’s phone BUZZES. She puts down a blouse and opens the 
           text. It’s a picture message of her three friends. On stage. 
           Smiling. With MERYL STREEP. 

           Like Meryl Streep, Meryl Streep. THE Meryl Streep. 

           I’m sorry, I’m not sure you’re following. I mean literally 
           Meryl Streep showed up and took a picture with them. 

           Haley’s voice catches. She zooms in. This can’t be real. 

                                 HALEY
                        Oh...my god...that’s.. 

                                 JOSIE (O.S.)
                        Isn’t that everything!? 

                                 HALEY
                        How? 

                                 JOSIE (O.S.)
                        Byron put us up on the website and 
                        apparently someone in her circle 
                        saw it and sent her the info. I 
                        don’t know what inspired her to 
                        actually show up, but Haley, she 
                        was there! I touched Meryl! With my 
                        hands! 

                                 HALEY
                        I can’t believe this. 

                                 JOSIE (O.S.)
                        I had to tell you. I knew you’d 
                        freak. I’m sweating just talking 
                        about it. It’s gross. I’m so sorry 
                        you weren’t there, Haley. When I 
                        saw her my first thought was I’m 
                        dead and in heaven but my second 
                        thought was I wish you were here 
                        too. I hope you’re not upset. 
                                 HALEY
                        Not at all! 

           She is. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        I think this is awesome! 

           She doesn’t. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        I knew that would be a great night. 

           She didn’t. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m so happy for you, Josie. 

           Eh, sure, we’ll give her this one. 

           INT. HALEY’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Haley has a glass of white wine and a book in her lap. A 
           POUNDING on the door distracts her. 

           She saunters to her front door and opens it. Tricia barges 
           past Haley into the house, BAWLING CRYING. Haley grabs a box 
           of tissues as Tricia flops on the couch. 

                                 HALEY
                        T, what is it??

           Haley waits patiently as Tricia whimpers herself quiet. 
           Tricia gropes blindly for a tissue. She’s looked better. 

                                 TRICIA
                        It’s Marcus. 

                                 HALEY
                        Is he OK? 

                                 TRICIA
                        He could be in a ditch somewhere 
                        for all I care. 

                                 HALEY
                        OK, OK, talk to me. What happened? 

           Tricia reaches for Haley’s full glass of wine on the table. 
           She downs the entire thing. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        Easy...easy...well...sure. 
           Tricia catches her breath. 

                                 TRICIA
                        He called off the wedding.

           Bomb. Dropped. 

                                 HALEY
                        Oh my god. 

                                 TRICIA
                        And now my life is over. 

                                 HALEY
                        No it’s not. Everything is going to 
                        be alright. This, this, isn’t 
                        happening. What did he say? 

                                 TRICIA
                        What do you mean? He said I don’t 
                        want to marry you and now your life 
                        is over. 

                                 HALEY
                        Did he say why? 

                                 TRICIA
                        He said....he said...

           And we’re sobbing again. Haley rubs Tricia’s back until she’s 
           ready to talk. 

                                 TRICIA (CONT’D)
                        He said it’s because of you. 

           Wait. I thought the bomb already dropped. There’s a second 
           bomb?! 

                                 HALEY
                        What?! That doesn’t make any sense. 

                                 TRICIA
                        You said something to him the other 
                        night, when I left for my shoot. 

                                 HALEY
                        I didn’t say anything! I mean, we 
                        spoke. But I didn’t saying anything 
                        about you guys. We didn’t even 
                        discuss...we talked about Russ! 

                                 TRICIA
                        I know. It was the way you talked 
                        about him. 
                                 HALEY
                        What? 

                                 TRICIA
                             (quoting)
                        He lets you be you, and you’re 
                        constantly surprising each other. 
                        You love what you have in common 
                        but you love what you don’t have in 
                        common even more.

                                 HALEY
                        I’m not sure I put it that way, 
                        exactly. 

                                 TRICIA
                        It doesn’t matter! Marcus thinks we 
                        don’t have what you and Russ have. 

                                 HALEY
                        Russ and I don’t have anything! T, 
                        I’ll talk to him. This is crazy. 
                        You and Marcus have been together 
                        how long? It’s just jitters. This 
                        happens. I’ll fix this. 

           Haley gets up. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Hails, no. 

           She's pacing. 

                                 TRICIA (CONT’D)
                        Hails, sit down. 

           We've entered pacing for pacing’s sake mode. 

                                 TRICIA (CONT’D)
                        HALEY. 

           She stops. Sits back down. 

                                 TRICIA (CONT’D)
                        He’s right. 

                                 HALEY
                        I’m sorry? 

                                 TRICIA
                        He’s right. I’ve felt it for a long 
                        time but I didn’t want to admit it. 
                                 HALEY
                        That's ridiculous! 

                                 TRICIA
                        It’s not. You don’t understand it 
                        like I do. Marcus and I, we...grew 
                        apart. We’re different people now 
                        than when we met. We’ve been trying 
                        to keep it together but we lost 
                        that magic. 

                                 HALEY
                        People change. That’s normal. You 
                        love each other! 

                                 TRICIA
                        Of course we do. We always will. 
                        We’re just not perfect for each 
                        other. We don’t want the same 
                        things out of life any more. We 
                        don’t want a life together. 

                                 HALEY
                        T, I don’t know what to say. I’m so 
                        sorry. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Don’t be sorry. It’s good we were 
                        honest about it. I’m completely 
                        miserable, but right now, I need my 
                        best friend.  

           Haley throws her arm around Tricia. Tricia takes the blanket 
           off the back of the couch and covers them with it. 

           INT. RUSS’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Russ’s playing FIFA on Play Station in gym shorts and his 
           all-time favorite t-shirt. AKA living the dream. 

           His phone RINGS. The game’s paused. 

                                 RUSS
                        Hey, you here? 
                             (beat)
                        I’ll buzz you in. 

           He does, from his phone. Unpause. The button mashing 
           continues until Haley enters. 

           She drops her purse down on the couch and stands in front of 
           the TV. Looming. Hardcore looming. 
           Russ tries to look past her at the screen, this is an 
           important game after all. Then he gets the message. Pause. 

                                 RUSS (CONT’D)
                        What’s up? 

                                 HALEY
                        Tricia and Marcus split up. 

                                 RUSS
                        Holy-

                                 HALEY
                        I know. Apparently, Marcus came to 
                        this decision after seeing us 
                        together. 

           Slash hearing her drool over Russ, but that can be our little 
           secret for now. 

                                 RUSS
                        That’s...interesting. 

                                 HALEY
                        He wants to find someone who can 
                        give him what we have. 

                                 RUSS
                        Tricia must be a wreck. 

                                 HALEY
                        She is. But she thinks he’s right. 

                                 RUSS
                        She’s gonna need your help. 

                                 HALEY
                        We had a girls night last night. 
                        I’m now out of tissues and wine. 
                        But she survived. 

           Haley takes a seat on the couch. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        Do you think we’re good together? 

                                 RUSS
                        This feels like a trap. You don’t 
                        like talking about anything 
                        serious. 
                                 HALEY
                        I promise the ban on discussing 
                        serious subjects has been 
                        temporarily lifted. You may fire 
                        when ready. 

           Russ, hesitant. That sounds like something a trap would say. 

                                 RUSS
                        Ummmm, yea, Haley, I do. Don’t you? 

                                 HALEY
                        Of course. But like, so good that 
                        we broke up Tricia and Marcus good? 

                                 RUSS
                        That puts unnecessary pressure on 
                        it, but I do feel like I’m on the 
                        same wavelength with you more than 
                        with other people in the past.  

                                 HALEY
                        I’m probably in my own head here, 
                        but after we met, despite my 
                        attempts to complicate things, it’s 
                        been so effortless. It almost seems 
                        too easy. Does that make sense? 

                                 RUSS
                        Sure. Love...
                             (off her look)
                        not that I’m labeling anything...is 
                        never easy. It’s compromise. It’s 
                        acceptance. It’s a job. Expect you 
                        don’t get the weekends off. You 
                        work at it every day. Attraction 
                        can be easy, especially when you’re 
                        lucky enough to find someone who’s 
                        humming the same tune. 

                                 HALEY
                        And you think we got lucky? 

                                 RUSS
                        Absolutely. We’re lucky to even be 
                        alive at the same time, let alone 
                        find each other.

                                 HALEY
                        Can you find out what the app saw 
                        in us to put us together?  

           Should probably tell her here, dude. 
                                 RUSS
                        It doesn’t really work like that, 
                        you don’t find out-

                                 HALEY
                        Then we could ask Keaton. He can 
                        tell us. 

                                 RUSS
                        I’m not comfortable doing that. 

                                 HALEY
                        Wouldn't it be good to know? 

                                 RUSS
                        To know what? Which part of our 
                        profiles made us a match? 

                                 HALEY
                        Yes!

                                 RUSS
                        We work, Haley. Can’t that be 
                        enough? 

           She takes his hand. Trying to be compassionate. 

                                 HALEY
                        Russ, I didn’t believe in programs 
                        telling me who my match was. Now, 
                        because of you, I do. And I know 
                        I’m spiraling about Tricia. I get 
                        it. But I need the confirmation. 
                        Will you ask him? Please.  

           Russ would give this girl his entire heart. 

                                 RUSS
                        I can’t. I’m sorry. 

           INT. TV STUDIO - DAY 

           ON Tricia, waiting in her makeup room. 

                                 TRICIA
                        You sound insane. 

           REVERSE ON Haley, standing opposite her, affronted. 

                                 HALEY
                        I’d do it for you. 
                                 TRICIA
                        First of all, would you? Second of 
                        all, I could get in trouble. 

                                 HALEY
                        How?? 

                                 TRICIA
                        I can’t harass the guests. Plus, he 
                        weirds me out now.  

                                 HALEY
                        You’re not harassing anyone. You’re 
                        reaching out to a contact. It’s 
                        called networking. Maybe don’t 
                        FaceTime him, though.  

                                 TRICIA
                        What do you want me to say? Hey 
                        Keaton, it’s Tricia Lawson. 
                        Remember me? I wanted to introduce 
                        you to my friend who has some 
                        invasive questions for you about 
                        the inner workings of your program 
                        that are coming from a totally 
                        healthy mental state. 

                                 HALEY
                        Maybe a little less wordy, but it’s 
                        a good first draft. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Hails, I’ve got enough problems 
                        right now. 

                                 HALEY
                        You’re right. I’m so insensitive. I 
                        almost didn’t ask. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Did you and Russ have a fight or 
                        something? Does he know you’re 
                        doing this? 

                                 HALEY
                        No, we’re good, and no, he doesn’t, 
                        but I...it would mean a lot to me 
                        if you would try. 

           Tricia sighs at her best friend. She been there.  

                                 TRICIA
                        I’ll do it this afternoon. 
                                 HALEY
                        T, I love you. 

                                 TRICIA
                        You mean you owe me. That’s better 
                        than love. 

                                 HALEY
                        I gotta run. Text me. 

           Haley moves in to kiss Tricia on the cheek. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Not the face! Not the face! They 
                        just touched me up. 

           Haley laughs, and blows her a kiss instead. 

           INT. MEET CUTE OFFICE - DAY 

           Thatcher’s walking around, holding a stack of papers, 
           whistling to himself. Having a nice little Wednesday. 

           He looks up just in time to see HALEY entering Keaton’s  
           office. He freezes. Drops the papers. They go EVERYWHERE. 
           Sprints off. 

           INT. KEATON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Keaton has the coolest desk chair of all time. It’s like 
           perfect posture meets euphoric comfort. On his desk he’s got 
           a productivity toy for every day of the week. 

           When Haley walks in, Keaton pops out of his chair. No one has 
           ever been happier to see anyone. 

                                 KEATON
                        Welcome, welcome!

           He shakes her hand with both of his. Then leads her to a 
           sitting area where they sit on opposite couches. Haley sees a 
           full length mirror next to his desk. Frowns to herself. 

                                 HALEY
                        Thank you very much for taking the 
                        time to meet me, Mr. Brown. I know 
                        you’re extremely busy. 

                                 KEATON
                        Please, a friend of Tricia’s is a 
                        friend of mine. And it’s Keaton.

                        How is Tricia by the way? What a 
                        little firecracker she is. 

                                 HALEY
                        She’s great. Still in a very solid 
                        relationship. 

           What do I keep telling you? Good friend. 

                                 KEATON
                        Ah, well, not a surprise. It’s a 
                        pleasure to meet you, Haley. 

                                 HALEY
                        I love your offices.

                                 KEATON
                        It’s not too shabby, is it? I 
                        designed it myself. I was going for 
                        chic hotel lobby vibe while also 
                        promoting good work flow. Can I get 
                        you anything? Water? Food? Our 
                        smoothies are delicious. 

                                 HALEY
                        I’m fine, thanks. 

                                 KEATON
                        Let’s get to it, then. Tricia tells 
                        me you have some questions about 
                        the app? 

                                 HALEY
                        I do. Mostly, how it works. 

           INT. MEET CUTE OFFICES - MEANWHILE

           Russ’s wired in at his work station. Thatcher skids to a stop 
           next to him and rips the headphones out of the jack. 

                                 RUSS
                        Thatch. Come on. Can I swing by 
                        later? I’m super busy. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Dude. Listen to me. Code Purple. 
                        Code. Purple. 

                                 RUSS
                        What’s that one again? I don’t have 
                        my chart. 
                                 THATCHER
                        Haley’s in Keaton’s office. 

           Russ’s face drops. Sprints off. These guys should run track.

                        To put it simply, it matches people 
                        up and attempts to put them in 
                        situations where they could run 
                        into each other. The hope being 
                        they hit it off organically, and 
                        wind up together.

                                 HALEY
                        Could you be more specific about 
                        the functions? I know the general 
                        premise, I was trying to find out 
                        the nitty gritty. 

                                 KEATON
                        Certainly. You make profiles, 
                        answer the questions, take the 
                        tests, and then our algorithm ranks 
                        your responses. It’s a 100 point 
                        scale. Some are scored as strong 
                        responses, some are less so. We try 
                        to match up core values, while also 
                        flagging issues that might be a 
                        deal breaker. It’s not without 
                        flaws, nothing is, but we’re very 
                        satisfied with the results.

                        Our user base doesn’t get to see 
                        other user responses. It’s an 
                        invasion of privacy. I assume you 
                        met someone on the app?

                                 HALEY
                        Yea, he actually- 

           The office door BURSTS open. Russ enters as calmly as one can 
           while they’re experiencing complete and utter panic.

                        Nicely done big guy. 

           OK, keep your pants on.

                        Is this a surprise? 

           All time smirk from Keaton. Rubs his hands together. He loves 
           a little drama.

                        And It’s my match. We’re both here. 
                        I agree it’s OK to show us.

                        I’ll sign whatever you want.

           Keaton’s getting a little uncomfortable. 

                                 KEATON
                        Our user base is growing 
                        exponentially every day, and the 
                        matchup analysis is running 
                        hundreds of combinations a second 
                        around the world. It would be a 
                        process trying to find your 
                        specific result. 

                                 HALEY
                        I can wait. 

                                 RUSS
                        He said no, Haley. 
           It’s hard to say who looks more on edge, Keaton or Russ. 
           Keaton glances at his office door. 

                                 KEATON
                        What are you doing here, Haley? 
                        Really? 

                                 HALEY
                        I need to know what the app saw in 
                        us. It’s important. 

                                 KEATON
                        I’m afraid I can’t--

                                 HALEY
                        Listen. You had sex with Tricia’s 
                        makeup artist and made her hold up 
                        a mirror so you could look yourself 
                        in the face while you got off. 

           Cat’s got Keaton’s tongue. You’re in big trouble, buddy. Russ 
           eases away from him. Notices the full length mirror. Frowns. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        There are cameras in the greenroom. 
                        Either you help me out or I blast 
                        that video on Twitter for the whole 
                        world to see. 

                                 KEATON
                        I don’t...There aren’t cameras in 
                        there.

                                 HALEY
                        One way to find out. 

           Keaton stares at them both. Can’t risk it. Then, for the 
           first time, he drops the act. 

                                 KEATON
                        OK, OK. If you’re actually willing 
                        to sign something...I can show you 
                        the truth. 

           INT. BACK ROOM - LATER

           CLOSE ON a signature line. A pen drags Haley’s signature 
           across it. 

           WIDEN to reveal a dark, cramped office. A messy desk. A 
           laptop with several displays. Uncomfortable and bad habit 
           forming chairs. 
                                 KEATON
                        What I’m about to tell you can’t 
                        get out. No one would believe you 
                        anyway, but now that you’ve signed 
                        this I’ll also sue you for 
                        everything you own. 

           Haley waits for more, but Keaton grills her. 

                                 HALEY
                        I wont say anything. 

                                 RUSS
                        What about me? 

                                 KEATON
                        You’re already under a noncompete 
                        contract. That ship has sailed, RP.   

           Keaton shakes his head. Can’t believe he’s doing this. 

                                 KEATON (CONT’D)
                        You two aren’t a match. Because no 
                        one is. Meet Cute is.......made up. 

                                 HALEY
                        What are you talking about? You 
                        match people at random?? 

                                 KEATON
                        No. It doesn’t exist. There is no 
                        Meet Cute.

                                 RUSS
                        Keaton, enough jokes. 

                                 KEATON
                        Does it look like I’m joking? 

           It does not. But, what???

                                 HALEY
                        Start making sense please. 

                                 KEATON
                        Everything I’ve ever said about the 
                        invention of Meet Cute is true. I 
                        wanted a RomCom moment. I tried to 
                        make a dating app that could create 
                        that. But it didn’t work. I was 
                        crushed. I thought I could make the 
                        world a happier place. Then I 
                        realized...I could. All I had to do 
                        was say it worked. 
                                 RUSS
                        I don’t follow. 

                                 KEATON
                        It’s simple. I create Meet Cute. I 
                        tell people to do the profiles and 
                        the blah blah blah. Then...I do 
                        nothing. All the app actually does 
                        is ping your phone at random 
                        intervals, suggesting you get out 
                        of the house. The entire premise of 
                        Meet Cute is that your soulmate 
                        could be anyone, anywhere. Guess 
                        what? That was already true!! But I 
                        had to remind us. I’m opening the 
                        eyes of the world. All people 
                        needed to find their soulmate was 
                        to think an app had set it up for 
                        them. Be outgoing, be friendly, 
                        SPEAK to people instead of burying 
                        your head in your phone, and look 
                        at the connections you can make. 

           Russ and Haley are stunned. 

                                 HALEY
                        I’m gonna throw up. 

                                 KEATON
                        Don’t look at me like that. 
                        Consider the results. More people 
                        are in lasting relationship from 
                        Meet Cute than any other app or 
                        dating site ever made. They’re 
                        finding love on their own! Who 
                        cares if I gave them a placebo?

                                 HALEY
                        You’re a fraud! You’re 
                        intentionally deceiving people and 
                        they’re making real life decisions 
                        based on your lies! 

                                 KEATON
                        I’m not! I did lie, yes, but I was 
                        only trying to help. And you keep 
                        ignoring the fact that it works. 

                                 HALEY
                        It doesn’t work. There isn’t 
                        anything to work.
                                 KEATON
                        Yes there is. WE work. People work. 
                        But only when we’re willing to open 
                        ourselves up. 

                                 RUSS
                        You don’t even have a real 
                        compatibility algorithm? 

                                 KEATON
                        Of course I do. I had to show the 
                        investors something to get funding. 

           Haley was just tossed a life vest, and she’ll cling to it. 

                                 HALEY
                        Can we use it? 

                                 KEATON
                        What? 

                                 HALEY
                        Me and Russ. You have all our info 
                        in your system. All the blah blah 
                        blah. Can you plug us into your 
                        algorithm? 

                                 KEATON
                        I can. But I won’t. 

                                 HALEY
                        Why? 

                                 KEATON
                        Because I’ve never actually used it 
                        other than on simulated users. It’s 
                        not real. 

                                 HALEY
                             (fuming)
                        Meet Cute isn’t real and you don’t 
                        have a problem using that! 

           Haley steps at him like she might hit him. Keaton flinches. 

                                 KEATON
                        Jesus, alright! 

           He sits down at the computer and logs in. His fingers fly 
           across the keys. Easily 120 words per minute. He pulls up the 
           program. While he works, Russ addresses Haley.   
                                 RUSS
                        Haley, we shouldn’t do this. I 
                        don’t need Keaton’s broken code to 
                        tell me something I already know. 

                                 HALEY
                        Why not? You believe in us. I 
                        believe in us too. This will prove 
                        it without a doubt. 

           Keaton’s ready. He faces them one more time. 

                                 KEATON
                        RP’s right, Haley. It’s a bad idea. 
                        Are you sure you want this? 

                                 HALEY
                        Hit the button. 

           Keaton and Russ exhale their mutual disappointment. Keaton’s 
           finger hovers, then he punches the return key. 

           The programs is calculating...calculating...calculating...

           BING! 

           A number appears. That number is red. That number is 24. 

           Shit. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        24? What’s 24? 

                                 KEATON
                        Well. It’s not good.

           Keaton tries to mend bridges. 

                                 KEATON (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t run it in a long time, it 
                        could probably use some updates. 

           Haley, stone faced, stalks out. 

           INT. RUSS’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Haley blows through the place into Russ’s bedroom. Door 
           SLAMS. Russ trails close behind her. KNOCKS. 

                                 RUSS
                        Haley?

           Nothing. 
                                 RUSS (CONT’D)
                        Haley. Can I come in? 

                                 HALEY (O.S.)
                        No. 

                                 RUSS
                        OK, I’m coming in. It’s my room. 

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Haley paces. She fiddles with the RED RING from the pier. 
           Wont look at Russ, who stands in the doorway. 

                                 RUSS
                        That was- 

                                 HALEY
                        I refuse to believe this. The whole 
                        thing is fake?? We’re not even a 
                        match... 

                                 RUSS
                        According to Keaton. Who cares? It 
                        never bothered me before.  

                                 HALEY
                        You’re probably right. I- 

           Cease pacing. Replaces the RED RING on his dresser. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        What do you mean, before? Like 
                        before 10 minutes ago? 

           Fuck. Scramble.

                                 RUSS
                        ....Yea. I mean our score, or 
                        whatever, never mattered to me 
                        before. 

                                 HALEY
                        Did you know? This whole time? 

                                 RUSS
                        Did I know what? 

                                 HALEY
                        That we weren’t a match. Did. You. 
                        KNOW? 
           For the love of god, Russ, deny til you die. You’re in too 
           deep. Please. Pleeease.

                                 RUSS
                             (gigantic pause)
                        Not the whole time. 

           Such an idiot. 

                                 HALEY
                        You’re unbelievable. 

           She tries to storm out but he stops her. 

                                 RUSS
                        Hold on a minute. It’s complicated. 
                        I didn’t know the entire thing was 
                        fake, but I did know we weren’t a 
                        match. I found out when I was 
                        adding my new code. We were already 
                        seeing each other. I didn’t want to 
                        screw that up. 

                                 HALEY
                        We’re not even supposed to be 
                        together! We broke up Tricia and 
                        Marcus because they wanted what we 
                        have. We’re a 24. You put your 
                        Christmas lights up too early! 

                                 RUSS
                        We didn’t break up Tricia and 
                        Marcus. Tricia and Marcus broke up 
                        Tricia and Marcus. If it took us 
                        for them to get there, then they 
                        should thank us.  

                                 HALEY
                        That’s nice. I’ll be sure to tell T 
                        where she can send her thank you 
                        card. 

                                 RUSS
                        I’m sorry. I’m not trying to be 
                        mean. But their relationship has 
                        nothing to do with us.

                                 HALEY
                        Maybe we need to take a break. I 
                        don’t know if I can do this.  

                                 RUSS
                        Do you mean that? 
                                 HALEY
                        The girls met Meryl Streep. 

                                 RUSS
                        What? 

                                 HALEY
                        Josie and the girls. That night 
                        they opened. Meryl Streep showed up 
                        at the theater. She took a picture 
                        with them. Without me. Because I 
                        wasn’t there. I was at your 
                        birthday. 

                                 RUSS
                        I told you we should go! You didn’t 
                        want to. 

                                 HALEY
                        That’s not the point. I don’t care 
                        about meeting Meryl Streep. The 
                        point is I’m missing stuff for you. 

                                 RUSS
                        Great, here we go. Lecture me about 
                        your commitment issues. First it’s 
                        work, now it’s this. Can’t wait to 
                        hear what it’ll be next month. 

                                 HALEY
                        I’m spending all this time with you 
                        and I’m neglecting all the things I 
                        want. 

                                 RUSS
                        Are you listening to yourself? You 
                        just said that wasn’t important. 

                                 HALEY
                        I said I didn’t have time for this. 

                                 RUSS
                        You act like your time is more 
                        valuable than everyone else’s. 
                        You’ve got so much to do you 
                        couldn’t possibly fit in a 
                        boyfriend. But you can’t imagine a 
                        world where I have anything to do 
                        except date you. 

                                 HALEY
                        I never said that. I said I want to 
                        be the version of a girlfriend that 
                        I envision. And you lied to me! 
                                 RUSS
                        I didn’t lie. 

                                 HALEY
                        You withheld the truth. Because you 
                        were being selfish. Even when you 
                        knew it was messing up my life. 
                        Messing up my friend’s lives. 

                                 RUSS
                        Do you want me to admit I was 
                        afraid this would happen if I told 
                        you? Of course I was! You finally 
                        gave this a chance and we were 
                        happy. I knew you’d overreact. I 
                        was just trying to protect you. 

                                 HALEY
                        I didn’t ask you to do that! 
                        I didn’t ask for any of this! 

                                 RUSS
                        Too bad. You got it. It’s here now. 
                        You don’t want to talk about the 
                        serious stuff? 
                             (shrug, sorry...)
                        I like you. I like you a lot. I 
                        might love you if you’d ever let 
                        me. We all get to choose who we 
                        spend our time with. And I know you 
                        have all these things you want to 
                        accomplish, but eventually you 
                        figure out that success isn’t that 
                        fun unless there’s someone to share 
                        it with. I want to share it with 
                        you. 

           Time to pull out of this tailspin, right? Pull up! Pull up! 

                                 HALEY
                        I can’t. 

           Damn. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        I see where I want to take my life 
                        and I don’t see you there. It was a 
                        nice fling, but that's it. 

           Genuinely hurt, the wind is knocked out of his fight sails. 

                                 RUSS
                        Wow. Whatever makes you feel 
                        better.
                                 HALEY
                        Don’t get mad at me. I warned you. 
                        I told you not to get hurt. 

                                 RUSS
                        That’s what you don’t get, Haley. 
                        You hurt me more while we’re 
                        together than you do when we’re 
                        apart. 

                                 HALEY
                        Then let me do you a favor. 

           And just like that, poof, she’s gone. 

           CUE SONG: After You written by Meg Myers

           BEGIN THE DEPRESSING BREAKUP MONTAGE

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Simone and Thatcher sit across from each other in a booth. 
           Russ next to Thatcher, third wheeling. Thatcher, laughing 
           overly hard at one of his jokes, puts essentially half the 
           spinach dip on one chip. Simone WHACKS his arm. Russ sulks. 

           INT. HALEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Haley and Tricia. Baggy sweatpants. Baggy sweatshirts. Black 
           and white movie on the tv. Tricia holds a box of tissues. 
           Haley holds a book, reading on the side. 

           EXT. LA - DAY 

           Time passing. Summer fun all around the city. At least 
           someone’s enjoying the weather. The entire season zooms by. 

           INT. MEET CUTE OFFICE - NIGHT

           The whole office is dark. Russ tries hitting to himself at 
           the folded up ping pong table but his heart’s not in it. 

           EXT./INT. HALEY’S CAR - MORNING

           Haley’s stopped at a red light. She reaches for her coffee. 
           Her eyes wander out the passenger window to a bench on the 
           corner. A huge AD for PACIFIC PARK at the SANTA MONICA PIER 
           stares back at her. She holds on it, then snaps her eyes 
           forward. The light changes. She gases it. 
           EXT. PALISADES HOUSE - DAY 

           Mid kickball game. Russ’s at the plate. Trying to have fun. 
           He crushes a home run. Georgia is FIRED UP. He smiles at his 
           sister. Looks to the sideline. There’s no one there. 

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           A high top table. Haley with a group of GUYS and GIRLS. 
           HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS fill the bar. An EMCEE on a stool with 
           a microphone asks a trivia question. The whole table puts 
           their heads together, whispering. Haley, apathetic.  

           INT. RUSS’S BEDROOM - DAY 

           Russ notices the RED RING on his dresser. He slams it into 
           the top drawer. He digs through a closet. Pulls down a box 
           and drops it on the floor. In marker, the side reads 
           CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS. He looks at it. He SIGHS. 

           END MONTAGE - FADE OUT SONG 

           INT. TRICIA’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Haley and Tricia are surrounded by Chinese take out. They 
           could build a fort with these boxes. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Do you think we’re ordering in too 
                        much? I mean, look at my hair. 

           She pulls it in front of her so Haley can really see it. 

                                 TRICIA (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t my hair used to be shinier? 

                                 HALEY
                        I don’t think so? 

                                 TRICIA
                        It did. It’s all this junk food. I 
                        know it. Now my hair is so...bleh. 

                                 HALEY
                        Your hair isn’t bleh, T, you look 
                        great. If it’s bothering you that 
                        much, eat some blueberries. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Does that add shine?? 
                                 HALEY
                        I read they’re high in 
                        antioxidants. They “combat free 
                        radicals” or something. 

           They munch a few more bites, but Tricia’s over it. 

                                 TRICIA
                        We probably should get out more 
                        though, don’t you think? Like out, 
                        out. Dance. Talk to boys. Make them 
                        buy us drinks. 

                                 HALEY
                        That feels like so much work. Maybe 
                        I’m getting old. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Or maybe you’re not as over Russ as 
                        you thin-

                                 HALEY
                        I’m over Russ. 

           Don’t get stabbed by Tricia’s PIERCING look. 

                                 TRICIA
                        That was a little rash, babe. And 
                        you never actually told me what 
                        went down with Keaton. 

                                 HALEY
                        It doesn’t matter. I had to think 
                        about my priorities. I was missing 
                        out on too much.

                                 TRICIA
                        Oh my god, the girls met Meryl 
                        Streep. So what? 

                                 HALEY
                        Excuse me? 

                                 TRICIA
                        Don’t get me wrong, I would do 
                        despicable things to have her 
                        career. But it’s a stupid picture. 
                        It’s not a big deal. 

                                 HALEY
                        It’s what the picture represents. 
                                 TRICIA
                        What does that even mean? You have 
                        to stop doing this. 

                                 HALEY
                        Doing what? 

                                 TRICIA
                        The constant self sabotage. Finding 
                        anything you can to destroy 
                        relationships. Making mountains out 
                        of mole hills. 

                                 HALEY
                        So I’m supposed to let this guy 
                        dictate my life? 

                                 TRICIA
                        You’re supposed to stop being so 
                        scared. This defense mechanism 
                        kicks in as soon as you start to 
                        feel vulnerable. Let yourself be 
                        happy. For once. 

                                 HALEY
                        I wasn’t happy. And we weren’t 
                        gonna work out anyway. 

           Careful where you wave that look around, Tricia! 

                                 TRICIA
                        I know you pretty well, Hails. 

                                 HALEY
                        Then you know you should drop this.  

                                 TRICIA
                        Fine, you’re over him, but I’m 
                        still having a tough time. I’m not 
                        asking you to do a juice cleanse 
                        with me, I’m asking you to put on 
                        some heels and wear something that 
                        makes your boobs pop. I think it 
                        would be good for both of us to get 
                        back on our feet. And then 
                        theoretically off them. 

           INT. MEET CUTE OFFICE - DAY 

           KITCHEN. Thatcher mulling over his options in their super 
           fancy cafe. It’s snack city up in here.  
                                 RUSS
                        How do you not know what you want 
                        before you walk in here? 

                                 THATCHER
                        Sometimes I’m in the mood for 
                        chips. Sometimes I want a candy 
                        bar. Who cares? 

                                 RUSS
                        I understand that. I’m saying the 
                        offerings haven’t changed for the 
                        duration of our employment. Don’t 
                        you think “today I want a candy 
                        bar,” then go get it?

                                 THATCHER
                        I’m a shoot from the hip kinda guy, 
                        bud. I live in the moment. 

                                 RUSS
                        Tell the moment to hurry up, would 
                        ya? I have work to do. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Salt and Vinegar. Last bag. Nice. 

           Thatcher reaches into the rack and grabs the sole survivor.  

           Keaton ENTERS. 

                                 THATCHER (CONT’D)
                        Ah, Mr. Brown! 

                                 KEATON
                        My two superstars! 

                                 THATCHER
                             (mock tone)
                        Come here often? 

           It doesn’t land. 

                                 THATCHER (CONT’D)
                        Would you like a chip, sir

           He proffers the Lays bag. Keaton takes the ENTIRE thing. 

                                 KEATON
                        Tremendous choice. 

           Thatcher is heart broken but can’t help himself. 
                                 THATCHER
                        I’m glad I could assist you with a 
                        mid-day snack. My job here is done. 
                        That is to say not my real job, of 
                        course, sir. 
                             (beat)
                        I’ll show myself out. 

           He wastes no time doing just that. Keaton snacks on chips.  

                                 KEATON
                        RP. 

                                 RUSS
                        Keaton.  

                                 KEATON
                        You ever getting back together with 
                        that little minx you were dating? 

                                 RUSS
                        People don’t like being lied to. 

                                 KEATON
                        You mustn’t blame me for this. It 
                        sounds like you’re the one who 
                        wasn’t as up front as you should’ve 
                        been. Honesty is everything, RP. In 
                        life and in love. 

                                 RUSS
                        I feel terrible and this was just a 
                        small lie. Can’t imagine how you 
                        feel.  

                                 KEATON
                        I feel like the world’s falling in 
                        love, and they have us to thank.
                             (grabs Russ’s shoulder)
                        Make sure you let me know if I have 
                        the green light with what’s her 
                        name.  

           This fucking guy. 

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           ON HALEY. Trendy spot for cocktails? Check. Heels? Check. 
           Boobs popping? Check. 

           Someone approaching gets her attention. 

           Tricia?? Nope. Zeke. UGH. 
           She gets up as he greets her with a kiss on the cheek. Does 
           this guy get a fresh haircut every day?!?! 

                                 HALEY
                        Thanks for meeting me. 

                                 ZEKE
                        For sure. I was surprised to hear 
                        from you. 

                                 HALEY
                        I’m full of ‘em. Surprises I mean.

           Not her best. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        How’s your mom? 

           OK, that was worse. 

                                 ZEKE
                        You wanna talk about my mum? 

                                 HALEY
                        No. I don’t. Why is this weird? 
                        This shouldn’t be weird. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Are you still seeing that guy?

                                 HALEY
                        No. 

                                 ZEKE
                        We’re not really relationship 
                        types, are we?

                                 HALEY
                             (hesitates)
                        I guess not. 

                                 ZEKE
                        Do you wanna get a drink? 

                                 HALEY
                        Desperately. 

           JUMP CUT 

           Haley and Zeke, crying laughing, much looser now. A fruity 
           cocktail in front of her. Whiskey neat for Zeke. Swoon. 
                                 ZEKE
                        They were just trying to sing 
                        karaoke as a family!

                                 HALEY
                        We thought the seats were open! The 
                        waiter delivered food to the table. 
                        What was I gonna do? Not eat it?  

                                 ZEKE
                        Yes! It was their dinner!  

                                 HALEY
                        Once I realized what happened I had 
                        to pretend we did nothing wrong. 

                                 ZEKE
                        You’re the worst. 

                                 HALEY
                        I am. I’m also drunk. 

           Haley takes a big gulp. Zeke polishes off his whiskey. 
           Doesn't even make a face. His hand lands on Haley’s knee. 

                                 ZEKE
                        One more at my place? 

           Haley thinks for one full heartbeat. This guy’s not the 
           answer, right??  

                                 HALEY
                        Yea. 

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - AFTERNOON

           Russ carries a LARGE POPCORN, layered butter, and a soda 
           through the lobby. He stops at the popcorn SEASONING. 

           He grabs the WHITE CHEDDAR just before another hand. Russ 
           looks to the source. The fellow MOVIE GOER is cute as a 
           button. She gives him a bashful smile. 

                                 MOVIE GOER
                        Didn’t see you there. 

                                 RUSS
                        I’m easy to miss. 

           He hands her the seasoning. She tries to push it back. 

                                 MOVIE GOER
                        Go ahead, you were here first. 
           He return volleys.  

                                 RUSS
                        No, I stole it from you. 

           Guys, this is adorable and all, but there’s plenty. 

                                 RUSS (CONT’D)
                        Besides I’m pretty early, I like to 
                        see the previews. 

                                 MOVIE GOER
                        Me too. I feel like I’m seeing 
                        extra movies. I pay for the 
                        previews, there just happens to be 
                        a really long one at the end. 

           Russ gets a kick of out of this. 

                                 RUSS
                        Well said. What are you seeing? 

                                 MOVIE GOER
                        The super hero one. I know, I know. 
                        There are no stakes, but I love a 
                        good butt kicking.

                                 RUSS
                        Preaching to the choir. I’m here by 
                        myself because no one would come 
                        with me.   

                                 MOVIE GOER
                        I’m alone too! I thought nobody did 
                        this but me. How fun! It’s only 
                        weird the first time. 

                                 RUSS
                        Yes! 

           She grabs the SEASONING and pours it on her popcorn. The cap 
           comes off and the entire jar empties into her bucket. Ruined. 

                       RUSS (CONT’D)
                                                       MOVIE GOER
           Oh no! 
                                              Shoot!

           Russ tries to pull the cap out and offer some napkins but 
           it’s a lost cause. 

                                 RUSS
                        She might be a goner. Let me get 
                        you a new one. 
                                 MOVIE GOER
                        You’re sweet, but it’s OK. I’m just 
                        embarrassed.
                             (beat, a spark, a grin)
                        Hey, I have to ask. Are you my Meet 
                        Cute? 

           The smile fades from Russ’s face. 

                                 RUSS
                        No...I don’t think so. 

           He hands her his brand new POPCORN. She takes it, a bit sad 
           and very confused, as he leaves the theater. 

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 

           Tricia looks like she just got out of a killer yoga class. 
           Haley’s dressed for work. 

           Haley sits with a coffee in hand. Tricia gets in the back of 
           the line. Haley gets up to join her.  

                                 TRICIA
                        Sorry I’m late, class ran long. 

                                 HALEY
                        It’s OK, I’ll wait in line with you 
                        but then I gotta get back. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Did you have sex with Zeke? 

                                 HALEY
                        Can you use your library voice 
                        please? My coworkers come here. 

           She scans the customers. A HANDSOME GUY in a LEATHER JACKET 
           gets in line behind them.

                                 TRICIA
                        They think you’re a virgin? 

                                 HALEY
                        No. But you don’t have to broadcast 
                        it. 

                                 TRICIA
                        I don’t like him. 

                                 HALEY
                        I’m aware. You’re the one who told 
                        me to get back in the saddle. 
                                 TRICIA
                        I didn’t mean that horse. But it’s 
                        done. I’m not mad. I, myself, am 
                        back in the game as well.

                                 HALEY
                        You slept with someone!? 

           Way too loud. Genuinely shocked.  

                                 TRICIA
                        Library voice. No. God. I’m not 
                        ready. But I decided I’m going to 
                        join Meet Cute! 

           Haley starts to say something. Catches herself. Looking at 
           Tricia, she’s so hopeful for the future. Who’s Haley to take 
           that away? But she doesn’t need it. Tell her, Haley. 

                                 HALEY
                        That’s...great, T. But you don’t 
                        need it.  

                                 TRICIA
                        That’s sweet, Hails, but I do. I 
                        don’t remember how this works. 

                                 HALEY
                        Tricia, you’re a confident and 
                        beautiful woman. Be willing to put 
                        yourself out there and you’ll see  
                        how easy it is. People will want to 
                        get to know you. Just pick your 
                        head up and start talking. For me. 

           Tricia’s no match for a good compliment. 

                                 TRICIA
                        OK, I’ll try. 

                                 HALEY
                        T. 

                                 TRICIA
                        I promise. 

           She points through her chest to someone behind her.  

                                 TRICIA (CONT’D)
                        Maybe I’ll start with handsome 
                        leather jacket guy.  

           They arrive at the register. The BARISTA greets them. 
                                 BARISTA
                        Hi, what can I get for you today? 

                                 TRICIA
                        Can I do large chai latte. It’s for 
                        Tricia. And can I do it with whole 
                        milk, but can you write skim milk 
                        on the cup, please? 

           The barista pauses, sharpie in the air. 

                                 TRICIA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t ask questions. Thank you! 

           She swipes her card and goes to wait. Haley follows as 
           HANDSOME LEATHER JACKET GUY orders. 

                                 HALEY
                        I gotta go, honey. Love you. 

           Kisses, kisses. Tricia checks her phone and sits. Haley 
           doubles back to the register. She pulls out a TEN DOLLAR BILL 
           and catches the barista’s eye. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        Ten bucks if you can mix up 
                        Tricia’s order with that guy’s 
                        order when you call them out. 

           Points to HANDSOME LEATHER JACKET GUY. The barista gets it, 
           and pockets the 10 spot. Haley sneaks away, proud of herself. 

           INT. MEET CUTE OFFICE - DAY 

           Russ stands by the printer while warm sheets slide out of the 
           machine. Thatcher walks by, bouncing a ping pong ball on a 
           paddle. He finds Russ and enters. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Hey bud, want a game? 
                             (notices the print job)
                        Wait, what is that? 

                                 RUSS
                        Nothing.  

           They stare at each other for too long. Then Thatcher lunges 
           for the print job. Russ boxes him out. 

                                 RUSS (CONT’D)
                        Alright! Alright! It’s the 
                        Thanksgiving recipes. 
                                 THATCHER
                        I knew it! Why do you refuse to 
                        consult me first? 

                                 RUSS
                        If I’m the one doing the cooking 
                        then I choose the sides dishes. 

                                 THATCHER
                        I have valuable opinions. I eat the 
                        most. 

                                 RUSS
                        Please direct all submissions to my 
                        inbox for future consideration. 
                        What are you guys gonna do when I 
                        get married? 

                                 THATCHER
                        Go to your place, obviously. 

                                 RUSS
                        I knew there was a catch to you 
                        hosting all these years. 

           Russ starts to walk out and points at Thatcher’s paddle.

                                 RUSS (CONT’D)
                          Best of 151? 

                                 THATCHER
                        Let me pull up the scorecard. 

           As he pulls out his phone...

                                 THATCHER (CONT’D)
                        Oh yea, I wanted to show you 
                        something. I don’t know if you’ll 
                        even care...but I was on one of our 
                        competing dating apps last night 
                        and this came up. 

           He turns his phone to Russ. We see HALEY. She’s looking hot 
           in her staged profile picture. Russ rips it out of his hands. 

           He SCROLLS the profile. We don’t see it. 

                                 RUSS
                        “Loves the beach.” Yea, sure, like 
                        you went once all summer. “Never 
                        see the movie before reading the 
                        book.” Please, you didn’t even know 
                        How to Train Your Dragon was a 
                        book. 
                                 THATCHER
                        Alright, bud, calm down.

           He takes his phone back. 

                                 THATCHER (CONT’D)
                        This was a bad idea, maybe. But I 
                        thought you should know. 

           Here we go, Russ. Breathe out the bad. Breathe in the good. 

                                 RUSS
                        Thanks. I appreciate it. I don’t 
                        know what I expected, it’s not like 
                        she was gonna lock herself inside 
                        from now on. 

                                 THATCHER
                        Lucky I saw her, really. 

           Russ, just dawning on him. 

                                 RUSS
                        Wait, why are you on a dating app?? 

           Thatcher, instantly uncomfortable. 

                                 THATCHER
                        I bet Simone sexual favors that I 
                        could get more matches than her. 
                             (stares off into space)
                        I’m not excited about the ball gag. 

           EXT. APARTMENT - EVENING

           CLOSE ON a hand. KNOCKING. And KNOCKING. Eventually, the 
           door’s swung open to REVEAL...

           INT. TRICIA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Tricia. Bathrobe on for the night. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Wasn’t expecting you. 

           REVERSE ON

                                 RUSS
                        Can I come in? 

           Tricia steps aside to let him pass. They walk to the couch. 
                                 RUSS (CONT’D)
                        I know this is weird, showing up 
                        like this. 

                                 TRICIA
                        It’s fine, I’m a single woman. I 
                        can have men to my apartment at any 
                        hour of the night I choose. 

                                 RUSS
                        Uh, yea, of course. So, Haley 
                        hasn’t been responding to any of my 
                        texts. I gave her space, but it’s 
                        been long enough that we should be 
                        able to talk to each other, right? 
                        I guess I was wondering if you had 
                        any insight. 

                                 TRICIA
                        I gotta be honest, Russ, I don’t 
                        feel comfortable telling you 
                        anything about what Hails is 
                        thinking if she doesn't feel 
                        comfortable telling you. 

                                 RUSS
                        I understand. I shouldn’t have 
                        come. 

           Starts to Charlie Brown walk himself out of there. 

                                 TRICIA
                        But...

           Light at the end of the tunnel?? Or is that a train coming...

                                 TRICIA (CONT’D)
                        I can tell you that she’s a fickle 
                        beast. She gets these ideas in her 
                        head and it’s like she forgets she 
                        ever felt differently at any point 
                        in her life. She’s the worst kind 
                        of stubborn, because she doesn’t 
                        think she’s stubborn, when really 
                        she’s the most stubborn person I 
                        know. You think it’s hard being her 
                        boyfriend?? Try being her friend. 

                                 RUSS
                        I know you take the brunt of it.  

                                 TRICIA
                        It doesn’t matter because I take 
                        the brunt of the rest of her too. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TRICIA (CONT'D)
                        She’s also the most loyal and 
                        thoughtful person in my life. Every 
                        year on Valentine’s Day she sends a 
                        secret admirer card to my house so 
                        Marcus would get jealous. The day 
                        after I auditioned for my job, 
                        Haley barged in on the head of the 
                        network and told him if he didn’t 
                        hire me their show would be off the 
                        air in a year. And when my mom was 
                        sick, Haley would read to her in 
                        the hospital on the nights I 
                        couldn’t be there. After she died, 
                        Haley slept at my house for a 
                        month. She’s got her quirks, I’m 
                        not arguing that, but she’ll do 
                        anything for you if you earn it. 

           Russ soaks that in. Give him a sec, please. 

                                 RUSS
                        I guess that’s where I came up 
                        short. 

                                 TRICIA
                        That’s the thing, Russ. You didn’t.

           It was light at the end of the tunnel after all! 

                                 TRICIA (CONT’D)
                        You started to change her mind. 
                        That hasn’t happened in a long 
                        time. It scared her. 

                                 RUSS
                        Why doesn’t she tell me these 
                        things? It’s not like I had it all 
                        figured out. We were in this 
                        together. I can’t read her mind. 

                                 TRICIA
                        You’re such a guy. You have to ask 
                        yourself what you want. Do you want 
                        her back? 

                                 RUSS
                        Yes. Or...I want her to be happy. 
                        But I think she could be happy with 
                        me. I just want to have to a 
                        conversation.  

                                 TRICIA
                        Then talk to her. 
                                 RUSS
                        She wont answer me! 

                                 TRICIA
                        Well, this whole barge in 
                        unannounced move was pretty 
                        effective. 

                                 RUSS
                        Good point. 

           Russ heads for the door, he’s amped. Tricia can tell. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Not right now though. 

           He stops. 

                                 RUSS
                        Why? 

                                 TRICIA
                        Don’t get mad...she’s with a guy. 
                        It’s nothing, a first date. And 
                        don’t even ask me, because I don’t 
                        know where. 

           Russ just smiles. 

                                 RUSS
                        Thanks Tricia. Your hair looks 
                        great by the way. 

           Tricia waves him off like that didn’t just make her week.

                                 TRICIA
                        It’s the blueberries. 

           INT. MEXICAN RESTAURANT - LATER 

           Haley’s perfecting the ‘looking cute without trying that 
           hard’ outfit. She sits opposite a RANDOM GUY whose blazer is 
           wildly out of place at this restaurant. 

           He attempts to stab a nacho with a fork unsuccessfully.  

                                 HALEY
                        Mom hosted last year, so this year 
                        it’s at mine. 

                                 RANDOM GUY
                        Does that mean you’re doing all the 
                        cooking? 
                                 HALEY
                        No, no, no. Mom will cook. But it’s 
                        important to her to mix up the 
                        venue, so I’m happy to give her 
                        full disposal of my kitchen. 

                                 RANDOM GUY
                        Does anyone else join you? 

                                 HALEY
                        Oh god. 

                                 RANDOM GUY
                        I didn’t take you for a religious 
                        type.  

                                 HALEY
                        Russ. 

                                 RANDOM GUY
                        I don’t know who that is. 

                                 RUSS
                        It’s me. 

           Russ! Welcome to the party! 

                                 HALEY
                        What are you doing here? 

                                 RUSS
                        Looking for you. 

                                 HALEY
                        I’m a little busy at the moment. 

                                 RUSS
                        You’re a little busy all the time. 

                                 RANDOM GUY
                        Should I...

                                 HALEY
                        No, stay. Russ’s leaving. 

                                 RUSS
                        I’m not, actually. You don’t have 
                        to go, but if you’re getting up I’d 
                        love a water. 

                                 HALEY
                        Do not get him a water. Russ, what 
                        do you want?
                                 RUSS
                        I want to talk. 

                                 HALEY
                        Fine. I’ll call you later. 

                                 RUSS
                        Right now. 

           The whole restaurant is officially staring. Haley’s one part 
           livid, one part embarrassed, shaken, and poured over ice. 

                                 HALEY
                        How did you even know where I was?? 

                                 RUSS
                        They have nachos on the secret 
                        menu. Guac on the face eases the 
                        tension. 

           Wow. Nice. Haley softens. Barely...  

                                 HALEY
                        Make it quick. 

                                 RUSS
                        I don’t know what I’m doing.

           A beat. Duh. 

                                 HALEY
                        Great, thanks for comin--

                                 RUSS
                        I don’t know where my life’s going. 
                        I don’t know where yours is. And 
                        that’s scary. And stressful. But I 
                        do know that I like not knowing 
                        when I’m with you. And if you could 
                        be OK with not knowing, I think 
                        you’d like it too. 

                                 HALEY
                        Russ, you’re a great guy. You 
                        really are. And you’re going to 
                        find someone who’s right for you. 
                        But it’s not me. It’s not a 24. 

                                 RUSS
                        This is so backwards! You didn’t 
                        even believe in these stupid 
                        formulas that say you should match 
                        with...this guy. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUSS (CONT'D)
                             (at Random Guy)
                        No offense. 

           Random Guy puts up his hands. 

                                 RANDOM GUY
                        None taken. 

           At least he’s getting a story out of this. 

                                 RUSS
                        You only changed your mind because 
                        you met me and we were great 
                        together. Then we get a bad score, 
                        but you still trust the apps?  

                                 HALEY
                        Yes! Because it could be even 
                        better if I find someone I’m 
                        actually compatible with. 

           That stung a bit. Russ flinches. Then...

                                 RUSS
                        Just because a computer says we’re 
                        not perfect for each other, doesn’t 
                        mean we’re not perfect for each 
                        other. 

                                 HALEY
                        How can you be so sure? 

                                 RUSS
                        Because sometimes you just know 
                        right away. 

           Russ takes out his wallet. He reaches inside and pulls out a 
           small piece of paper. He tosses it at her plate. It flutters 
           down in front of her as he walks out. 

           Haley doesn’t stop him. She grabs the slip. Turns it over. 

           It’s the RECEIPT from their jars of cranberry sauce on the 
           day they met. Life’s big moments indeed. 

           EXT. FARMERS MARKET - DAY 

           Pie Lady’s busy this time of year. Russ waits in line. She 
           finishes payment with the customer in front of him, then Russ 
           steps up. She smiles when she sees him. 
                                 PIE LADY
                        I knew I’d be seeing you soon. How 
                        are you, Russ? 

                                 RUSS
                        I’ve been better, Pie Lady. I’ve 
                        been much better. 

                                 PIE LADY
                        You’re in luck. I’ve got something 
                        extra special to cheer you up. 

                                 RUSS
                        I don’t think I can handle extra 
                        special right now. 

                                 PIE LADY
                        You’re gonna want this. It’s one of 
                        a kind. 

           She reaches into her cooler and pulls out a pie. She hands it 
           over the table to Russ. He takes it, gently. Looks down. 

           Half apple pie..................................half pumpkin. 

           He’s speechless. He might even be crying, we can’t be sure. 
           Then slowly, a smile spreads across his face. 

                                 PIE LADY (CONT’D)
                        What do you think? 

                                 RUSS
                        It’s...the most beautiful thing 
                        I’ve ever seen. 

                                 PIE LADY
                        I had some help. 

           Haley timidly pokes her head out from behind Pie Lady’s 
           booth. Russ considers her for a beat. 

                                 RUSS
                        How long were you hiding there? 

                                 HALEY
                        I brought my book. 

           She waves it around. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        And I texted Thatcher to find out 
                        when you were coming. 
                                 RUSS
                        What a snitch. 

                                 PIE LADY
                        Feels like you two have a lot to 
                        hash out.  

           She leaves. Nothing gets past Pie Lady. Russ holds up the 
           half and half pie. 

                                 RUSS
                        I thought you said this was 
                        disgusting.  

                                 HALEY
                        Turns out I said a lot of things 
                        I’d like to take back. 

                                 RUSS
                        Feel free to be specific. 

                                 HALEY
                        You weren’t a fling. 

                                 RUSS
                        You just wanted to shout that at me 
                        to make yourself feel better.  

                                 HALEY
                        I know I’m not the center of the 
                        universe even though I act like it 
                        sometimes. 

                                 RUSS
                        It doesn’t feel good when it seems 
                        like you only want to be with me 
                        when it’s convenient for you.

                                 HALEY
                        I’m sorry. I never wanted to hurt 
                        your feelings. 

                                 RUSS
                        And I’m sorry I lied. 

                                 HALEY
                        I thought I was being mature, 
                        telling you to be careful, but 
                        really I was too afraid to take a 
                        chance. 

                                 RUSS
                        Is that what you want to do now? 
                                 HALEY
                        I want to...just...be. In the 
                        present. If something comes into my 
                        life that feels real then I want to 
                        stop fighting it so hard. 

                                 RUSS
                        That doesn’t fit your plans. 

                                 HALEY
                        I’ve kept my life locked away for 
                        so long. It’s time to open up. 

           Haley rocks on her heels. You can do it babe. 

                                 HALEY (CONT’D)
                        And...I want to share it with you. 

                                 RUSS
                        But we’re not a match. 

                                 HALEY
                        We’re a match if we say we’re a 
                        match. Perfect scores are 
                        overrated. 

                                 RUSS
                        Did you have a certain number in 
                        mind? 

                                 HALEY
                        I was thinking something like a 24. 

                                 RUSS
                        I might know a guy. 

                                 HALEY
                        How do you feel? I’m ready to be 
                        that girlfriend I envision. 

                                 RUSS
                        I’m not sure. 

           Really? After the whole restaurant speech and everything? 

                                 RUSS (CONT’D)
                        I’ll have to check my schedule. 

           She deserved that. A sly smile. A slight giggle. Russ leans 
           in. Haley leans in. And...BANG! Still got one at the end! 
           INT. TRICIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The mistletoe has been hung. The holly has been decked. The 
           jingle bells are rocking. The egg is nogging.

           We’ve seen this before. The party decorations are even better 
           than last year. Tricia fills two cups with boozy eggnog. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Will you bring these to them, 
                        please? 

                                 GUYS VOICE (O.S.)
                        You got it babe. But make one for 
                        me while I’m gone. 

           She sticks her tongue out at someone. 

           HANDSOME LEATHER JACKET GUY bends down and grabs the two 
           cups. Lets go, T! 

           We follow him through the party until he arrives at Haley and 
           Russ. He reaches over the crowd so Russ can take the 
           beverages off his hands. Russ nods his thanks. 

           Russ hands one cup to Haley and puts his arm around her. He 
           looks at the COUPLE standing in front of them. 

                                 RUSS
                        Didn’t mean to interrupt you, what 
                        were you saying? 

                                 PARTY GOER GUY
                        No, that was it, that’s our story. 

                                 PARTY GOER GIRL
                        So, how did you two meet? 

           Haley opens her mouth to talk. Closes it. Turns to Russ. They 
           lock eyes. Smile. 

           We...

           SMASH TO BLACK
