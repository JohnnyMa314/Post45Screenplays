           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A saggy futon, vivid green, in a dank basement apartment. 
           It’s such a sad wet scene, you can almost smell it. 

           A thermometer on the wall reads 86 degrees.

           INT. DEN - DAY

           A makeshift bedroom with a twin mattress on the ground. 

           Clothes and papers scatter the floor, along with old crusty 
           plates and half-filled glasses.

           Two people clearly share the space. The only orderly corner 
           is a shelf with a series of books on hydroponics and a line 
           of gymnastics trophies and medals. 

           There’s a photo of teenage girl kissing a medal, her arm 
           around a large man.

           INT. POT ROOM - DAY

           What should be the “master” bedroom is a massive room full of 
           marijuana plants. They thrive under hot, buzzing lights.

           This room’s orderliness, its efficiency, is palpable. A timer 
           on the wall ticks-ticks-ticks — then clicks. 

           A set of hoses thrum on and distribute water into the plants. 

           A latex-gloved hand delicately handles a pot leaf, inspecting 
           it. A surgically-masked face with bright, curious eyes leans 
           in. AMBER KIVINEN. The girl from the photo, now late 20s. 

           In the glow of the UV light she looks both beautiful and 
           powerful, a queen reigning over a green kingdom. 

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Amber Kivinen. Drug dealer. Lapsed 
                        Evangelical Christian. Former 
                        gymnast. My girlfriend of twelve 
                        years. The only person I’ve ever 
                        loved. Is going to Mars.

           Amber releases the leaf softly. She looks at us, at our very 
           souls. As the water turns off, the timer begins anew. 
           Tick-tick-tick...

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Tick-tick-tick...the sounds of a classroom wall clock.

           There are two pictures on the wall: Bill Clinton and Al Gore. 
           Outside, torrential rain falls. There’s a crack of thunder. 
           The CHILDREN ooh and ahh. We hear them but don’t see them. We 
           stay on the portraits, and the rain.

                                 TEACHER (O.S.)
                        Shhh. Children. It’s U.S.S.R., 
                        remember? Uninterrupted, Sustained 
                        Silent Reading.

           There’s a bulletin board with kids art on it: those turkeys 
           you make with your handprint. Names underneath: Kelsey. 
           Chelsea F. Chelsea B. Kevin. Amber. Amber’s is the best.

           A papier-mâché solar system is hanging from the ceiling. 

           We linger on paper Mars, its craters clearly painted by a 
           child. One looks like a tiny human face.

           Two KIDS, a boy and a girl, sit cross-legged on the floor 
           with books in their laps. We see only their legs and little 
           shoes, touching soles. 

           Another crack of thunder. 

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Amber is going to Mars, and she’s 
                        never coming back. 

           The little boy and girl move closer together. Their hands 
           clasp as the lights flicker. Between light and dark we see —

           INT. MARSNOW LIVING POD(TM) - THE NEAR FUTURE

           A white room. Lying on a central table with an IV in is a 
           thin, sickly WOMAN. Her back faces us. She twitches. Behind 
           her, green plants flourish in neat rows. Familiar.

           INTERCUT: MARSNOW LIVING POD/CLASSROOM

           Flicker. Paper Mars again. 

           Flicker. The woman’s hand on table, clawing.
           Flicker. The clock goes tick-tick-tick. Then darkness.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           That saggy green futon, now holding the unwashed form of 
           KEVIN WATKINS, late 20s, a guy you went to high school with. 
           Passably cute. Hung out with druggies, but not a bad guy.

           He’s melted into the futon like it’s his job. Remote in one 
           hand, a potato chip in the other. Asleep. The screen flickers 
           on his slack face.  

           On the coffee table is a baggie of weed, an ashtray from 
           Dollywood, and a bunch of joints in a neat line. There’s also 
           a small, yellowish glass pipe.

           Kevin’s mouth hangs open. A pool of drool threatens to fall, 
           then does. Onto a dirty plate, on the ground. 

           Kevin turns over, his back to the TV. He folds his arms. Chip 
           and controller crunch together.  

                                 AMBER (O.S.)
                             (distantly)
                        Hey Kev? Kevin?

           He sinks. And sinks, and sinks. The futon swallows him up.

                                 AMBER  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Tater-totter?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           He snorts awake. He’s still on the futon, but sitting up. 
           Amber sits beside him, gloves on, mask pulled to her neck.

                                 AMBER
                        Can we talk?

                                 KEVIN
                        This is when you told me.

                                 AMBER
                        What?

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Shit. This is when she told me. 

           Kevin stretches slowly, like a chameleon on a rock.
                                 KEVIN
                        Sorry, I’m super stoned. What’s up?

                                 AMBER
                        I’m, um. This is gonna sound weird.  

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        I remember wondering what it was 
                        going to be. 

           Kevin looks at Amber, but speaks to “us.” Amber is talking to 
           him, carefully. But we don’t hear what she says.

                                 KEVIN
                        That she cheated on me. Like when 
                        she gave Jeremy head on this futon, 
                        on Voyager. We call it Voyager 
                        because we’ve taken our best trips 
                        on it. Or, like, that she was 
                        quitting grad school. But I guess 
                        you can’t do that twice.

                                 AMBER
                        Just listen okay? I entered this 
                        contest. It’s a reality show. And 
                        if I win, I’m going to Mars.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Okay. (to us) Amber applied to go 
                        to Mars, without telling me, one 
                        year and three months ago. 

                                 AMBER
                        I made it to round three, so now I 
                        have to go train.  

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        She’d already been training. I knew 
                        because she stopped getting her 
                        period, just like in high school. 

           INSERT: The under-sink bathroom cupboard, stocked to the brim 
           with sealed tampon boxes, and the garbage can, empty.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        ...And because of the braid.   

           Amber’s hair is, indeed, in a tight french braid. 

                                                             FLASHBACK:
           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY

           TEENAGE AMBER’s tight braid from the back, in slow motion. 
           She powders her hands, wraps them tight with tape. 

           Closeup on her feet as they arch on padded mats, on her arms 
           as they go up in the air.   

           In slow motion, she tilts forward to run. We watch the braid. 
           We see her mouth. She breathes out, forcefully.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        She always had the braid to train.

                                 AMBER (V.O.)
                        You need to understand this, Kev: 
                        If I win, I’m not coming back.

                                                         END FLASHBACK.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY (BACK TO SCENE)

           Amber and Kevin, back on Voyager. The news sinks in.

                                 KEVIN
                        Huh.

                                 AMBER
                        Yeah.

                                 KEVIN
                        Is Mars a hot one or a cold one?

                                 AMBER
                        It’s really hot. Hot and red. But 
                        they’ve found some water. And they 
                        think people can live there. At 
                        least, MarsNow thinks people can 
                        live there. 

                                 KEVIN
                        And it’s going to be a show? 

                                 AMBER
                        Yeah, like a reality show, but a 
                        useful one. One that goes on 
                        forever, and is about the future of 
                        our species. Of us. It makes me 
                        tingly.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Like The Truman Show. 
                                 KEVIN
                        Like The Truman Show? 

                                 AMBER
                        I guess so, yeah. (Beat) Look, are 
                        you okay? I mean, this is a lot. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Truman dies.

                                 AMBER
                        What? 

                                 KEVIN
                        In the Truman Show, Truman dies. 

                                 AMBER
                        No, you’re remembering it wrong, 
                        Kev. He leaves. And meets the woman 
                        of his dreams. And anyway, that’s 
                        because he didn’t know he was in a 
                        show. Just — we can talk more 
                        later. After work.

                                 KEVIN
                        Okay. Yeah.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Shit. Work.

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           A DETECTIVE and his team of OFFICERS comb the wet, dense west 
           coast forest floor, looking for something. 

                                 DETECTIVE 
                             (to himself, pained)
                        Goddammit, where are you?

           The Detective leans against a tree dramatically, his head on 
           his arm. He punches the tree in frustration. A bit much.

                                 OFFICER #1 (O.S.)
                        Detective, over here!

           The Detective looks up, right where the voice came from, then 
           starts running towards it. Even his run is a bit much.

           EXT. FOREST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           The Detective’s face comes into view, looking down at 
           something. He covers his face. Whatever it is, it’s awful.
                                 DETECTIVE
                        Oh, god. Timmy. Poor Timmy.

           The Detective squats down to get a closer look.

           We see what he sees: A gross, bloated corpse, splayed out on 
           the ground and half-covered in moss and dirt. On closer 
           inspection, it’s Kevin in extensive makeup. 

           Kevin’s face twitches. He can’t help it. He sneezes.

                                 DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        Cut! Goddammit it. Back to one.

                                 KEVIN
                        Sorry. Sorry, everyone.

           A flurry of movement as the set comes to life. The CREW works 
           to reset the scene.

                                 DETECTIVE
                             (the actor, with British 
                              accent)
                        Twat.

           He shakes his head and walks away.

           EXT. EXTRAS HOLDING - DAY

           Corpse Kevin sits against a trailer. He’s still got moss and 
           leaves on him. He eats a sandwich voraciously.

           There are other EXTRAS in the distance, but Kevin hangs 
           alone. As before, he speaks to us but not at us. 

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m an extra. The pay’s shitty and 
                        everyone hates you. But sometimes 
                        you get to lie down and the food is 
                        good. And you can be stoned. And as 
                        Amber says, it gets me out of the 
                        house. Plus-

           A MAKEUP ARTIST approaches, starts touching Kevin up.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        I met Jennifer Love Hewitt once.

                                 MAKEUP ARTIST
                        That’s nice, honey. 
           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           Amber, in a high bun and office attire, sits at the front 
           desk of a bland, corporate office. She answers the phone.

                                 AMBER
                             (perfect phone voice)
                        Markham and Sanders, this is

                        Amber works as a temp for a bunch 
                        of different places. She never uses 
                        her real name. 

                                 AMBER

           A puffy LAWYER type walks past. Amber flashes a brilliant 
           smile. The lawyer smiles back, winks, then enters his office 
           and closes the door. 

           She opens her desk drawer and grabs a bundle of pens, 
           dropping them in her purse. Then a stapler.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        The thing is, she’s really fucking 
                        smart. But there aren’t many jobs 
                        for, like, tree scientists.

           INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT BATHROOM - DAY

           Kevin, still corpse-y but in his own clothes, looks in the 
           mirror. He uses a Q-tip, which comes out of his ear blue. He 
           tries to scrub off the makeup. to us/the mirror:

                                 KEVIN
                        We make most of our money selling 
                        weed, which was her idea. But Amber 
                        said we need to seem like adults, 
                        with adult jobs. So that if the 
                        cops ever got wise, we’d have an 
                        excuse. She said “got wise”—

                        —like a gangster from the 40s. I 
                        remember it. 
           Kevin opens the medicine cabinet. On his side, a couple of 
           dude-ish items: shaving cream, nail clippers. Her side: An 
           array of bottles, plus a bunch of vitamins. Neatly arranged. 

           Kevin picks up a bottle of something and sniffs it.

           INT. THE KIVINENS BATHROOM - NIGHT

           TEENAGE KEVIN sniffs a similar bottle. TEENAGE AMBER, arm in 
           a sling, opens the door. She holds a red solo cup. The sounds 
           of a party can be heard behind. Teenage Kevin freezes. 

                                 TEENAGE AMBER
                        What are you doing?

                                 TEENAGE KEVIN
                        Nothing! 

                                 TEENAGE AMBER
                        Kevin...Watkins.

                                 TEENAGE KEVIN
                        Yeah.

                                 TEENAGE AMBER
                        You were my pen pal one summer. You 
                        never wrote me back.

                                 TEENAGE KEVIN
                        Sorry.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        I was trying to find her smell. She 
                        had this smell. Like if someone 
                        dumped pepper on the grass. But 
                        sweet, too. Like syrup tastes. She 
                        didn’t even really know who I was. 
                        But she knew I was her pen pal. 
                        That was something. It was a start. 

           A beat. Kevin grips the bottle, white-knuckled. He could put 
           it back but he’s frozen. They look at each other.

                                 TEENAGE AMBER
                             (amused)
                        You’re weird.

                                 TEENAGE KEVIN
                        Sorry.
           Teenage Amber laughs and walks away. Teenage Kevin looks in 
           the mirror.

                                 TEENAGE AMBER (O.S.)
                        That’s my mom’s, by the way!

           Teenage Kevin reaches, shuts and locks the bathroom door. He 
           puts his hand on his face. 

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        For what it’s worth, Amber’s mom is 
                        hot, too. In a mom way. She’s the 
                        only reason I liked hockey.

           Loving, slo-mo closeups of AMBER’S MOM, large-boned and large-
           breasted, cheering from the sparse stands of a small-town 
           hockey arena. 

           Her severely 90s-mom-cut hair bounces, as do her breasts. A 
           young boy’s dream of womanhood. 

           YOUNG KEVIN stops skating to look up at her longingly. He’s 
           hit from behind by another KID and smashes onto the ice.

           INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT - DAY

           Kevin snorts awake on the futon to the sound of Amber 
           breathing out, forcefully. She’s doing push-ups in the space 
           between the coffee table and the TV.  

           He watches her a moment. By the door is a duffel bag and a 
           backpack, neatly packed. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Can I come? to Mars?

                                 AMBER
                        It’s too late, Kev. You missed the 
                        deadline.

                                 KEVIN
                        Right. (Beat) We could have applied 
                        together. They probably want 
                        couples.
                                 AMBER
                        I didn’t think you’d be into it.

                                 KEVIN
                        They probably want people to 
                        propagate. Name the animals and 
                        stuff.

                                 AMBER
                        I won’t even make it to Mars. I 
                        have to compete against, like, 
                        thirty other people first.

           She continues to do push-ups, then stands. She’s powerful, 
           flushed. Ready. 

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        We can talk about this more, if you 
                        want.

                                 KEVIN
                        Um. No, it’s okay. (to us) When she 
                        says that it means she doesn’t.

           He picks up the small glass pipe. It’s beautiful, an amber 
           color, swirled like the surface of a planet but blackened 
           around the edges from use. 

           He holds it to his eye and sees Amber through it. He packs it 
           with weed from the ever-present baggie, puts it to his lips.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        You want some?

                                 AMBER
                        No thanks. And remember, some of 
                        that is Jeremy’s. 

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Yeah, that Jeremy. Blowjob Jeremy.

                                 KEVIN
                        Okay.

                                 AMBER
                        You can handle it? I gotta jog five 
                        miles before I leave. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah. Hey Slammer? 

           Amber sits back down in one swift motion. She does crunches.
                                 AMBER
                        Yeah.

                                 KEVIN
                        Do they know you grow pot?

                                 AMBER
                             (amused)
                        What do you think?

           Kevin shrugs. Amber keeps doing crunches.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        I’m a “hydroponics expert,” dummy. 
                        You gotta grow food on Mars.

           Kevin smiles. He lights the pipe and takes a long drag on it. 

                                 KEVIN
                        I love you.

                                 TEENAGE AMBER (V.O.)
                        No you don’t.

           INT. AMBER’S TEENAGE BEDROOM - DAY

           Teenage Kevin and Teenage Amber are in bed, post-coital. They 
           look directly in each other’s eyes. There’s love there, or 
           the teenage version of it.

                                 TEENAGE AMBER
                        You’re just excited you had sex.

           Teenage Kevin laughs. He touches her face. He kisses her.

           MONTAGE: 

           The moments before, in bits and pieces: 

           --They kiss on the edge of the bed; 

           --He pulls her sports bra over her head, tenderly, its marks 
           still on her back. He touches the marks;   

           --She takes out her hair elastic and pulls on it, loosening 
           her braid;

                                 TEENAGE KEVIN (V.O.)
                        What do you like about me?
           --His hand on her back, he pulls her down and around to lying 
           down. They entwine with one another, in an awkward teenage 
           way. 

                                 TEENAGE AMBER (V.O.)
                        Um. I guess, you make me feel calm. 
                        Like weed. Like, you don’t expect 
                        anything from me. You just want me 
                        around.

           --She moves her right shoulder, which is in a sling, 
           tenderly.

           --He kisses the sling. Then her arm, her neck. The beginning.

                                 TEENAGE KEVIN
                        That’s true. I love you for no 
                        reason at all.

                                                           END MONTAGE.

           Back in bed, post-coital.

                                 TEENAGE AMBER
                        What does that mean?

                                 TEENAGE KEVIN
                        I’m not sure.

           Suddenly, there’s the sound of the front door opening. A 
           pause. Teenage Kevin’s eyes go wide.

                                 AMBER’S DAD (O.S.)
                             (intense, with accent)

                        Shit! Go! He’ll actually kill you.

           The door closes. Teenage Kevin bolts up. Blankets fly.

                                                         END FLASHBACK.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY (BACK TO SCENE)

           The apartment door closes. Kevin comes to, pipe in hand. 
           Amber has just left. He almost says something to the empty 
           room. He looks at the pipe, then puts it down.

           He picks it back up again, lights it. Inhales and -
           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           - Exhales smoke. It’s nighttime. The TV is on something 
           cartoonish and dumb. He’s surrounded by snacks. 

           He passes the pipe to his left, to reveal MARCUS KULAP, 28, 
           his longtime best friend. One of those little, squirrelly 
           kind of guys. Burnout. Talks too much. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Wow. Mars.

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah.

                        Dude, what are you gonna do? You 
                        gonna —

           He gestures to the weed in his hand. 

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m okay at growing.

                                 MARCUS
                        Yeah, but she’s great at it. She’s 
                        got the magic touch.

           Marcus mimes a hand job. Kevin bats at him. It’s playful.

                                 KEVIN
                        I’ll figure it out.

                                 MARCUS
                        Are you guys gonna break up? 

                                 KEVIN
                        No, man. 

                                 MARCUS
                        You sure? Remember when Callie went 
                        to Vegas?

                        ways. It’s either —
                                 MARCUS
                        I’m glad she went, because I don’t 
                        wanna be married to someone who 
                        figures out she’s gay at a fucking 
                        Cirque du Soleil show.

                        Or —

                                 MARCUS
                        If I could have stopped her from 
                        going, she never would have gone 
                        gay by watching a bunch of French 
                        clowns twirl fucking ribbon around. 

                                 KEVIN
                        But it always ends with —

                                 MARCUS
                        I guess what happens in Vegas fucks 
                        up your life forever, right?

                                 KEVIN
                             (to Marcus)
                        I guess so, man.

                                 MARCUS
                        Are there dogs on Mars?  

                                 KEVIN
                        I dunno. I doubt it.

                                 MARCUS
                        I’d wanna have a dog. Like a big 
                        fluffy guy. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah.

           A beat. Marcus takes another hit. 

                                 MARCUS
                        So, like, if she’s on the show, 
                        does that mean she’s gonna be 
                        famous? Like gymnastics famous?

                                 KEVIN
                        Probably.

                                 MARCUS
                        I feel like that’s a lot, you know? 
                        She wasn’t great with pressure 
                        before. No offense.
                                 KEVIN
                        That was twelve years ago. Gimme 
                        that.

                                 MARCUS
                        Yeah, I guess. It’s just, I’m not 
                        sure people change. Give you what?

           Kevin motions to the pipe still in Marcus’s hands.

                                 KEVIN
                        That.

           Marcus looks down. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Hahaha. Oh shit. Cool.

           Marcus takes a long drag. Still holds the pipe.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Marcus is not smart. But he’s a 
                        good friend. And he’s our best 
                        customer.

           Marcus pulls a wad of cash out of his pants. 

                                 MARCUS
                        I almost forgot! Here man.

                                 KEVIN
                        Thanks.

                                 MARCUS
                        Wanna order Mr. Fatty’s?

                                 KEVIN
                        Definitely.

           Marcus gets up. He still doesn’t pass the pipe.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Kevin is lying down on Voyager. He holds a drink cup. Marcus 
           sits on the floor. There are takeout wrappers strewn about.

           They are very high.

                                 MARCUS
                        Man, you know what I just thought?  
                        If you married Amber and took her 
                        name, your name would be Kevin 
                        Kivinen. Kevinkivinen. Wow. 
                                 KEVIN
                        That’s so dumb, man.

                                 MARCUS
                        What’s dumber though, me, or 
                        Kivinenenkevinkevin?

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m not marrying Amber. Or taking 
                        her name.

                                 MARCUS
                        Yeah I know but it’s funny to think 
                        about. Keeping up with the 
                        Kivinenenenenenens.

           Despite himself, Kevin laughs. He closes his eyes.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        The Kivenens.

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. HOCKEY ARENA - NIGHT

           Little Kevin stares up at Amber’s Mom and her bouncing 
           breasts. Gets hit from behind. His nose hits the ice and 
           immediately explodes in a spray of blood.

           Little Kevin lies on the ice. He watches the blood escape his 
           face, red on white. The red divides and spreads, crater-like.

           Through blood-pounding ears he hears-

                                 AMBER’S DAD
                             (the scariest accent)
                        WATKINS!!!

           He tries to get it together. But the blood. It pools and 
           swirls. It almost seems to be making a face. 

                                 AMBER’S DAD (CONT’D)
                        Get your ass up, Watkins!

           As he struggles to get up, suddenly he’s lifted by something 
           massive. His little tiny boy body is turned. Held. 

           He passes out. In the black —

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Amber’s terrifying dad.

                                                         END FLASHBACK.
           INT. BAR - DAY

           Amber’s Dad and Mom, a decade older, sit on one side of a 
           high top. Kevin and Amber sit on the other.

           Kevin tries, and fails, not to look at Amber’s mom’s breasts, 
           which are resting on the table top. 

           Amber is nervously ripping up a napkin.

                                 AMBER
                        So, uh. If I go to Mars, I can’t 
                        come back.

           Off Amber’s Mom, who starts to cry quietly.

                                 AMBER’S DAD
                        Deanna. Hush.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        He hates that his daughter ended up 
                        with me. But in this moment, I had 
                        hope. He’s sensible. Controlling. 
                        Finnish. He used to weigh Amber’s 
                        food.

           Amber’s Dad takes a big gulp of beer. He looks out the 
           window. His face is stern. Suddenly, he breaks into a huge, 
           unnatural grin. Kevin recoils.

                                 AMBER’S DAD
                        The Kivenens have always been 
                        pioneers. We are Vikings. 

                                 KEVIN
                             (to us, whispering)
                        Actually, they aren’t. Amber did a 
                        school project on it once. They’re 
                        just fishermen. And one was a 
                        murderer.

                                 AMBER’S DAD
                        We will die as Vikings. Yes! You 
                        will go to Mars.

           Amber’s mom wipes her tears. Her dad holds his beer glass 
           aloft, looking directly into Kevin’s eyes. 

                                 AMBER’S DAD (CONT’D)
                        To Mars!

           Everyone holds their glasses up, smiling. Kevin’s is forced.
                                 EVERYONE
                        To Mars!

                                 AMBER’S DAD
                             (to Kevin)
                        And you? Still in the background of 
                        TV shows I don’t watch?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Marcus sits on Voyager and rolls a joint. He watches TV.

                                 MARCUS
                        Kev! Get in here man, it’s about to 
                        start.

                                 KEVIN (O.S.)
                        Yeah, okay.

           INT. POT ROOM - SAME

           Kevin looks over the pot plants. A few of them look a little 
           droopy. He lifts a sad leaf, tenderly.

                                 MARCUS (O.S.)
                        Hurry up! You’re gonna miss it.

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah. Coming.
                        (to the plants) 
                        Sorry, guys. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Kevin plops down on Voyager just as we hear the strains of an 
           inspirational, Star Trek-like theme song.

           INT. MARSNOW CREDIT SEQUENCE - SAME

           A CGI space-scape, with Mars at its center.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        Imagine the future of humankind. 
                        Imagine what might be possible if 
                        we weren’t bound by this planet. If 
                        we could leave behind all this 
                        hate, and destruction, and disease.

           Images of Neo-Nazis with tiki torches, icebergs breaking 
           away, Syrian children crying in a bomb-blasted street...
           Suddenly overtaken by titles reading MARS NOW. It’s abrupt.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        We can! We can go to Mars. Now. 
                        These brave citizens are competing 
                        for the chance to make a new world, 
                        a better world. On Mars. Now.

           INT. MARSNOW TRAINING FACILITY - SAME

           A camera sweeps over PEOPLE in matching white jumpsuits with 
           orange MarsNow insignias, standing like soldiers. 

           Among them, shining brightly, proudly, is Amber.

                                 MARCUS (O.S.)
                        Oh shit! Dude! Look!

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           The two friends are dug in on the couch like they’re growing 
           roots. It’s a stark contrast to the clean white scene on TV.

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m looking.

                                 MARCUS
                        She’s on TV!

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah, I see her.

                                 MARCUS
                        Wild, dude. This is wild.

           Marcus produces and takes a massive hit from a water bong. 

           On TV the HOST, an Elon Musk-like bro, walks dramatically 
           down a long metal gangway. He speaks to the camera.

           INTERCUT: SHOW/LIVING ROOM.

                                 HOST
                        Welcome to MarsNow. I’m so excited 
                        you’re here. I made close to a 
                        billion dollars last year, but it 
                        doesn’t matter, because the world 
                        is still bad.

                                 MARCUS
                        Haha. This guy rules. What a prick.
                                 KEVIN
                             (playful)
                        Shut up, man.

                                 HOST
                        So I decided that I needed to do 
                        something. And since I can’t solve 
                        all the world’s problems, I’m doing 
                        the next best thing. I’m leaving 
                        them behind. To go to Mars. Now.

           The Host walks through a hallway and past the line of 
           contestants, including a stoic Amber.

                                 HOST (CONT’D)
                        Well not me, but two of these 
                        people. Brave but ordinary 
                        citizens, people just like you who 
                        decided they wanted to be the first 
                        human beings ever to go to and live 
                        on Mars. Let’s meet them, okay?

           Suddenly, the channel changes to cartoons. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Marcus!

                                 MARCUS
                        Fuck, sorry. I got bored.

           The channel changes back to reveal a handsome dude, ADAM. The 
           lower third reads “Adam, 34, Israel.” He’s fit and earnest.

                                 ADAM
                        I got out of the military and knew 
                        I needed to keep helping, however I 
                        could. So I became a doctor. 

           INT. CLINIC - DAY

           B-roll of Adam in his clinic, helping various PEOPLE. He 
           looks confident, happy, and at ease with himself.

                                 MARCUS (O.S.)
                        This guy’s a prick.

                                 KEVIN (O.S.)
                        Marcus. Shut up.

           Back to Adam’s direct-to-camera interview.

           INTERCUT: LIVING ROOM/SHOW.
                                 ADAM
                        And the idea of going to Mars. It’s 
                        just...I mean, I can’t imagine it. 
                        Being the first man on Mars. Making 
                        it habitable. It makes me tingle.

           He tears up. He wipes the perfect tears with a perfect thumb. 

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. It’s just so moving.

                                 MARCUS (O.S.)
                        PRIIIIICK.

           Suddenly the music changes to something softer, more 
           feminine. Amber appears on screen. She laughs as she walks 
           through a garden. She picks and eats peas in the sun.

           The lower third says “AMBER, 28, USA.” Marcus smacks Kevin’s 
           arm repeatedly. Kevin swats him away.

                                 AMBER (V.O.)
                        I’m Amber. I’m a hydroponics 
                        expert, which basically means I 
                        know how to grow plants. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Yeah, sticky icky plants.

           Amber does a direct to camera, like Adam. She’s fresh faced, 
           pretty. Her hair is in a high ponytail. She looks happy.

           Kevin sits forward, focusing on Amber. Everything else falls 
           away. It’s just him and her words. He studies her face.

                                 AMBER
                        And, um, I used to be an athlete. A 
                        gymnast. I qualified for the 
                        Olympics, but I hurt my shoulder 
                        and, um, that was kind of it for 
                        me. But growing things, making 
                        things live, made me feel whole 
                        again.

           Amber looks down at her lap, then back up to camera. Her eyes 
           shine. She smiles. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Kevin snoozes on Voyager. There’s a knock on the door. He 
           sleeps on. Another knock, more insistent. He wakes up.
           INT. APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Kevin opens the door to reveal BLOWJOB JEREMY. He’s one of 
           those handsome hippies you suspect has family money. 

                                 KEVIN
                             (to us)
                        Oh good, it’s Blowjob Jeremy.

                                 BLOWJOB JEREMY
                        Hey man, what’s up?

                                 KEVIN
                        Hey.

           A moment. The thought of Jeremy coming in gives Kevin pause.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        Come in.

                                 BLOWJOB JEREMY
                        Cool. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Kevin and Blowjob Jeremy sit on the couch. It’s uneasy. Kevin 
           weighs pot on a scale. Blowjob Jeremy looks poised to speak.

                                 KEVIN  (V.O.)

                                 BLOWJOB JEREMY
                        How’s Amber?

                                 KEVIN
                             (to us)
                        I knew it. (to him) Good, I guess.

                                 BLOWJOB JEREMY
                        It’s cool to see her on the show. 
                        I’m psyched for her. It’s bananas, 
                        right? Mars?

                                 KEVIN
                             (to us)
                        Who says bananas?
                             (to Blowjob Jeremy)
                        Yeah, I mean, she seems to like it. 
                        They’re not allowed to talk to us 
                        on the phone or whatever. 
                                 BLOWJOB JEREMY
                        Bummer. Must be kinda lonely 
                        without her, right?

           Kevin quietly finishes measuring pot, dumps it into a baggie, 
           ties it off, and hands it to Jeremy.

                                 KEVIN
                        That’ll be eighty. 

                                 BLOWJOB JEREMY
                        Eighty! It used to be sixty-five. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah, it’s eighty now. I’m all 
                        alone here, y’know? Lonely.

                                 BLOWJOB JEREMY
                        Alright. Man. 

           Jeremy digs out his wallet.

           EXT. APARTMENT DOORWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Kevin opens the door. Jeremy stops, a little too close.

                                 BLOWJOB JEREMY
                        Thanks man. If you do talk to her, 
                        just tell her I said hi, okay?

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kevin comes in from outside to see Amber giving Jeremy a a 
           blowjob on the sofa. He quickly turns away, backs out of the 
           hallway, and out the door. He shuts it softly.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        No, I never told her. I wanted to. 
                        But when’s a good time to say “I 
                        saw you blowing a dude on Voyager?” 
                        Before or after you put together an 
                        Ikea dresser? (Beat) And anyway, it 
                        never became anything more. Plus, 
                        she’s always happier when she has a 
                        secret.

                                                         END FLASHBACK.
           EXT. APARTMENT DOORWAY - DAY (BACK TO SCENE)

           Jeremy waits for Kevin to respond. After a beat —

                                 KEVIN
                        Like I said, they’re not allowed to 
                        talk to us. 

                                 JEREMY
                        Right. Cool. Peace man.

           Kevin shuts the door.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 KEVIN
                        What Blowjob Jeremy didn’t know, 
                        would never know, was that Amber 
                        was calling me anyway.

           INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY

           Kevin makes mac and cheese on the stove. His phone rings. The 
           screen reads “Slammer.”  

           Panicked, he drops his spoon. He turns the stove off and 
           answers.

                                 KEVIN
                        Amber?

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Kevin slips into the tub.

                                 AMBER (O.S.)
                             (through the phone)
                        Hey Kev. Are you in the tub?

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah. (to us) The tub’s the coolest 
                        place in the house. And the only 
                        place we get service.

                                 AMBER (O.S.)
                        How are you?

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m okay. How are you?
                                 AMBER (O.S.)
                        Good. I’m really good. It’s — I’m 
                        always tired. And they made me get 
                        fake eyelashes. But it feels good, 
                        you know? I feel healthy.

                                 KEVIN
                        Awesome. 

           A quiet moment passes. Kevin smiles.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I thought you weren’t supposed 
                        to call the people at home? 

                                 AMBER (O.S.)
                        We’re not, but I missed you so I 
                        begged a producer to let me have my 
                        phone. I said your mom was sick.

                                 KEVIN
                        Joke’s on them. She’s dead.

                                 AMBER (O.S.)
                        Haha, yeah.

                                 KEVIN
                        I miss you too. I’m proud of you. 
                        Probably not as proud as (imitating 
                        Amber’s dad) Pekke John Kivinen. 
                        (Himself) But proud. Really proud.

                                 AMBER (V.O.)
                        Thanks, Kev. 

                                 KEVIN
                        I think about you all the time. I— 
                        Mostly I wish you were here to... 
                        watch you with me. Which is weird.

                                 AMBER (O.S.)
                        You sound stoned. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Guilty as charged. 

                                 AMBER (O.S.)
                        How are the plants?

                                 KEVIN
                        The babies are good. 
                                 AMBER (O.S.)
                        Don’t forget to test the pH on 
                        Wednesdays, okay?

                                 KEVIN
                        Actually, I’ve been doing it on 
                        Thursdays right before the show. 
                        It’s a new tradition.

                                 AMBER (O.S.)
                        You should go back to Wednesdays. 
                        They like structure. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah, totally. I will. Sorry.

                                 AMBER (O.S.)
                        It’s actually not a big deal. I 
                        don’t... I’m sorry I didn’t say 
                        goodbye properly. I kinda pulled a 
                        runner, huh? 

                                 KEVIN
                        It’s okay.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        It’s not okay. She pulls runners 
                        when she’s sad. I should ask her if 
                        she’s sad. 

           A long pause.

                                 AMBER (O.S.)
                        I gotta go, I promised I’d only be 
                        five minutes. I’m glad you’re good.

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah, you too. Love you Slammer. 
                        (Beat) I hope you win.

           A pause. The line clicks. Kevin holds his breath.

                                 AMBER
                        Love you too.

           Kevin exhales. He hangs up. 

                                 KEVIN
                        She couldn’t help but call me. I’m 
                        the Blowjob Jeremy, now. I’m the 
                        secret she’s keeping from the 
                        entire planet. 

           He peels himself out of the tub. 
           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Kevin, pipe in hand, slumps on Voyager. An array of snacks 
           litter the table. Marcus sits beside him. 

           The MarsNow theme song plays in the background.

                                 MARCUS
                        It’s weird how sometimes I forget 
                        she’s gone because she’s on TV.

           Kevin opens his mouth to speak, but instead takes a big hit 
           on the pipe.

           A MONTAGE, spinning on the axis of the living room: 

           -- Marcus and Kevin on the couch, watching episodes of the 
           show and cheering Amber on;

           -- Kevin checking out the plants, frowning at wilting and 
           spotty leaves;

           -- Kevin picking up call after call from Amber, going to the 
           tub to talk to her;

           -- Amber on the show, prevailing through several rounds of 
           eliminations.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Round after round, Amber stayed. 
                        Why? Because she had a story. A 
                        conversion narrative. She was 
                        “depressed and going nowhere,” but 
                        Mars gave her a purpose. Her story 
                        wasn’t better than anyone else’s, 
                        but she’d been raised in her 
                        father’s church. She could sell it. 
                        I was lost but now am found. 

           -- Kevin looking in at the den/bedroom, and closing the door;

           -- Kevin tossing and turning on Voyager instead.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Kevin kicks blankets aside on Voyager, a cookie in his mouth.

           Suddenly, the apartment door opens. It’s Amber, with a 
           MarsNow bag. Her shoulder is in a sling.

           She drops the bag and blasts in, unsettling everything. Kevin 
           sits bolt upright. He watches her in shock - she’s back!
           She flops down on Voyager next to him, flapping the sling.

                                 AMBER
                        They made me come home because of 
                        this. I’m so pissed, like what is 
                        the point? I could just hang out in 
                        my pod. 

                                 KEVIN
                        You’re here.

           Amber vibrates with intensity. She seems not to hear him.

                                 AMBER
                        And they made me sign like fifteen 
                        NDAs, so again, what’s the point? 
                        I’m missing so many chances to 
                        strategize. It sucks.

                                 KEVIN
                        Your shoulder.

           She finally looks at him.

                                 AMBER
                        I’m sorry, I’m just kind of in it, 
                        you know? (Beat) I forgot how hot 
                        it is in here all the time.

           Amber stands up and awkwardly strips off a layer. She 
           hesitates, then sits back down.

                                 KEVIN
                        Are you okay?

                                 AMBER
                        I’m not allowed to talk about it. 
                        It’s going to be on this episode.

           She leans her head on Kevin’s shoulder. He seems to calm her.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        This is better. Feel my heart.

           She lifts Kevin’s hand to her chest. We hear the beat-beat-
           beat, beat-beat-beat. It gradually slows. Amber sighs.

                                 KEVIN
                        You wanna smoke?

                                 AMBER
                        You know what? I do. Screw them.
           INT. VOYAGER - LATER

           The futon is open to a bed. Kevin and Amber stare up at the 
           ceiling together, passing the pipe back and forth.

                                 AMBER
                        It’s weird to be here. I forgot how 
                        messed up the ceiling is.

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah. Messed up and about to fall 
                        on us.

           The ceiling is a patchwork of brown spots, cracks, and bumps 
           from weird repairs. A planet’s surface.

                                 AMBER
                        I can’t see the face anymore.

                                 KEVIN
                        It’s there.

                                 AMBER
                        Where?

           Kevin passes her the pipe and holds his hands up and apart.

                                 KEVIN
                        Between my hands. 

           Amber starts to laugh.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 AMBER
                        Kev, I can’t see between your hands 
                        the same way you can. I told you 
                        this before. 

           Amber takes a huge drag on the pipe.

                                 KEVIN
                        Okay, but that’s where the face is.

           Amber sputters smoke as she laughs. 

                                 AMBER
                        You’ve got a beautiful mind.

                                 KEVIN
                        See, I always know that means you 
                        think I’m dumb.
                                 AMBER
                        No! It means you think differently 
                        than other people. And that the way 
                        you think is pretty stupid.

           They laugh. A lot. Stoned laughs, signifying nothing and 
           everything at once.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Can you blame me for thinking this 
                        meant something? That since she was 
                        getting high, risking a drug test, 
                        that she was done with Mars? For 
                        thinking she was home?

                                 AMBER
                        There’s a face on Mars, too. It’s 
                        called Cydonia.

                                 KEVIN
                        Cool. Creepy.

           Finally, Amber props herself up on her good elbow. They 
           continue to pass the pipe between them.

                                 AMBER
                        You know, this is what the pressure 
                        cooker feels like. 

                                 KEVIN
                        The what? What’s that?

                                 AMBER
                        That’s what we call the gravity 
                        chamber. We all have to go in there 
                        for a couple hours a day to get 
                        ready for the atmosphere. Mars will 
                        crush you to powder otherwise.

                                 KEVIN
                        And it feels like this?

                                 AMBER
                        Like a body high, only way better. 
                        It’s amazing. The Russian guy 
                        puked, which is how I knew he’d 
                        never done drugs.

           Amber passes the pipe over, then plays with Kevin’s fingers. 

                                 KEVIN
                        So you like it.
                                 AMBER
                        It’s cool, yeah. It feels 
                        important. Even if I don’t win.

           She looks at him. There’s more there, but not yet.

                                 KEVIN
                             (to us)
                        She already knew what was coming. I 
                        wasn’t her secret anymore.

           She lies on his shoulder, adjusting her sling. She touches 
           his face. He turns to her. They kiss.

           The kissing intensifies, and Amber starts to pull on Kevin’s 
           shirt. He helps her pull it over his head. 

           He pulls on her shirt, moving it around her sling. 

                                 AMBER
                             (whispering)
                        Be careful.

                                 KEVIN
                             (whispering)
                        Of course. I’ve done this before.

           They kiss again, with practiced tenderness. It’s something 
           close to sad. 

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        I didn’t know this was the last 
                        time. I would have... (beat) I’m 
                        not sure what I would have done.

           They continue to kiss. Amber’s eyes close. Kevin’s remain 
           open. He studies her face.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 

           Kevin wakes up alone. From where he lies, he can see into the 
           kitchen. At the table, the blue light of a computer lights 
           Amber’s face. She types quietly.

           He smiles, rolls over, and goes back to sleep.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Kevin wakes up in the ass-crack of Voyager in full daylight. 
           He sits up to see the entire apartment has been cleaned 
           around him as he slept. Amber.
           The kitchen is neat, the computer closed on the table.

           INT. POT ROOM - SAME

           The sad, spotty plants look a little better, somehow. 

           A small jar containing some kind of concoction sits on a 
           shelf. A Post-It note on the jar reads, “Use me! I can help! - 
           X, Amber.” Kevin smiles. 

           INT. KITCHEN - SAME

           Kevin makes coffee in a French Press. He takes out two cups. 
           He whistles a jaunty tune. 

           He looks up and sees a sticky note on the windowsill in 
           Amber’s unmistakeable hand. It reads: “At doctor! <3”

           Kevin turns and sees the laptop on the kitchen table. He 
           walks over and sits.

           He opens the laptop and looks at the browser history. The 
           last page was “MarsNow Member Portal.” He clicks on it. 

           INSERT: A main page with other tabs down the sides like 
           “Training Modules” and “Why Mars, Why Now?” 

           A window pops up: “Resume previous conversation?” Kevin 
           clicks “Yes.”

           Another window opens with “HorizonHunter” and “FirstMan34.”

           Off Kevin’s eyes scrolling the page we hear—

                                 AMBER/HORIZONHUNTER  (V.O.)
                        I just can’t believe it. What do 
                        you think it smells like?

                                 ADAM/FIRSTMAN34 (V.O.)
                        Haha, wow. You’re thinking about 
                        how Mars smells? You’re incredible. 
                        Winky face.  

                                 AMBER (V.O.)
                        It me. Smiley face. Thank you again 
                        for the other day. I guess we had a 
                        bit of a caps lock TV Moment, huh?

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        L-O-L. Something took over my body. 
                        It was primal.
                                 AMBER (V.O.)
                        Wow, really? I like the sound of 
                        that. Winky face.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        I thought you might. Winky face 
                        with tongue.

           Kevin slams the laptop shut.

           EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - DAY

           Amber stands, hands on hips on the sun-blasted New Mexico 
           desert. She’s poised, focused. The camera eats her up.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        This is what determination can do. 
                        Amber was the child of immigrants 
                        who became a gymnastics legend. 
                        Then she got hurt. Now look at her.

           Amber tilts forward on her toes and begins to run.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        This is an obstacle course. It 
                        makes our contestants have to think 
                        about their next steps, to make 
                        choices and solve problems. These 
                        are skills they will need on Mars.

           The word “MUTE” suddenly appears in the bottom right corner.

                                 MARCUS (O.S.)
                             (imitating host, robotic)
                        This is a TV show. I’m a massive 
                        prick and I host it. Ironically, my 
                        wiener is very small!

           INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT - SAME

           Marcus, Kevin and Amber are watching the show on Voyager. 
           Kevin is smoking from the small, amber-colored pipe. 

           Kevin sits as far from Amber as possible, his arms folded.

           He yanks the remote from Marcus and presses a button. The 
           word “Mute” disappears and the sound comes back up.

                                 MARCUS
                        Sorry, Amber.
                                 AMBER
                        No, you’re right. He is a prick. 
                        His eyebrows are drawn on.

           Marcus laughs. He looks over at Kevin, who’s impassive.

           On TV, Amber runs towards a massive log on the ground. 

           INTERCUT: LIVING ROOM/SHOW.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        Each contestant has to lift the 
                        tree trunk out of the way. For 
                        Amber, this might be tough.

           Off TV Amber’s shoulder as she bends to pick up the tree. She 
           starts to squat-shuffle it forward.  

           Suddenly, her right shoulder drops dramatically. She screams.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        Oh wow. I did not expect that. It 
                        looks like Amber has re-injured her 
                        bad shoulder. This is not good. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Dude. That must have hurt.

                                 AMBER
                        Worse than the first time.

           Marcus looks at Kevin again. He doesn’t react.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        It looks like — yep, it appears 
                        she’s dislocated it. 

           Amber tries to push the log along with her hips. An intense 
           music sting matches the overly-dramatic closeups of her face.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        What’s this now?

           Suddenly we see Adam. He runs on a diagonal through the other 
           courses towards Amber like a fireman to a fire.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        It looks like — yes, that’s Adam 
                        running over from his own course, 
                        abandoning it, to help her.

           Adam reaches Amber. He lifts and moves the log with ease. 
                                 MARCUS
                        This pr—

           He looks at Amber, then at Kevin, who’s still silent. He 
           starts to read the situation.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        Wow. Ladies and gentlemen: It 
                        appears as though Adam has thrown 
                        this competition to help Amber. 

           A teary, pained Amber turns to look at Adam. 

           The world stops.

           Adam takes the side of Amber’s face with both hands. He says 
           something quietly to her. She nods. He handles her arm gently 
           and pops her shoulder back into place. Amber winces. 

           They do not break eye contact.

           He places his hands back on her face, and they touch 
           foreheads. The camera lingers on their faces. Amber cries.

                                 HOST  (V.O.)
                        Wow. This is...wow. I don’t have 
                        the words.

           A long beat. Marcus, Amber, and Kevin sit, stock-still. Amber 
           gets up and goes into the kitchen. 

                                 MARCUS
                        I’m just gonna —

                                 KEVIN
                        Yep.

           Marcus hastily leaves, gathering up his stuff as he goes. He 
           returns, grabs few joints, and makes an “I’m sorry” face.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Kevin walks into the kitchen. Amber is trying to wash a dish 
           with her arm in the sling. It’s not going well.

           Kevin goes to her and takes the dish. He puts it down in the 
           sink. She doesn’t look at him.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Say something. Say it.
                                 AMBER
                        I didn’t know they’d edit it like 
                        that.

                                 KEVIN
                        Bullshit. You and FirstMan34 knew 
                        exactly what you were doing. 
                             (to us)
                        Did I say that out loud?

                                 AMBER
                        Wow. Spying on my browser history? 
                        Classy, Kev.

                                 KEVIN
                             (to us)
                        I did. I said it out loud. (To 
                        Amber) You know what’s classier? 
                        Running away from your problems by 
                        moving to another fucking planet. 
                        (To us) Holy shit.

           Amber’s face goes stony. She leaves. Kevin follows.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Amber goes into the bathroom and slams the door. Kevin stands 
           there a moment. Then he sits on Voyager.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Kevin watches TV, the volume low. He looks at the still-
           closed bathroom door. He stands up and goes to it. 

           He puts his fist up to knock, but hears sobbing from the 
           other side. He pauses.

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. KIVINEN'S HOUSE - DAY

           Teenage Kevin and Amber’s dad stand facing each other outside 
           Amber’s bedroom door.

           CANNONBALL by The Breeders plays from within.

                                 AMBER’S DAD
                        She won’t let me in. Or her mother.

                                 TEENAGE KEVIN
                        Okay.
           Amber’s Dad knocks on her door, heavily.

                                 TEENAGE AMBER (O.S.)
                        Go away, dad.

           Her dad gestures to Kevin, like “Go ahead.”

                                 TEENAGE KEVIN
                        Hey Amber? It’s Kevin.

                                 TEENAGE AMBER
                        Come in.

           INT. AMBER'S TEENAGE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Teenage Kevin closes the door, edging out Amber’s Dad. 

           Teenage Amber sits on the floor, her face red from crying. 
           Her arm is in a sling, on which she has written “Doomed” in 
           black sharpie. She’s in it.

           Teenage Kevin sits beside her on the floor. We see Amber 
           through his eyes: Sad, but beautiful. She talks, cries, and 
           breathes raggedly. Kevin just sits, and stays.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        I remember everything she said that 
                        day. That she hadn’t been able to 
                        breathe properly since losing her 
                        chance at the Olympics. That she 
                        felt sick all the time because now 
                        she didn’t know what to do with her 
                        life. She was only seventeen but 
                        already fully heartbroken.

           Teenage Amber rests her head on Teenage Kevin’s shoulder.

                                                         END FLASHBACK.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT (BACK TO SCENE)

           Kevin enters the bathroom and finds Amber sitting in the tub. 
           She’s surrounded by used tissues, and her face is red. 

           Kevin slides in the tub across from her. He takes her hand. 
           Amber puts her face in her other hand and cries.

                                 AMBER
                        I don’t know what to say to you 
                        right now. (Beat) Talk to me.
                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        I tried. I really tried. I tried to 
                        say something mean, like earlier. I 
                        tried to argue. But all I wanted to 
                        say was stay, stay, stay, stay — 

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Kevin wakes up in the tub. Amber is gone. Rain lightly falls 
           outside, picking up the stay-stay-stay refrain.

           Stuck to the tub where she sat is a sticky note: “Pulled 
           another runner. Sorry. <3”

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

           Kevin dejectedly rolls his shopping cart down the aisles.

           He rolls through the specialty foods aisle and pops several 
           olives in his mouth. He fills his cart with chips and beer.

           He loads his groceries onto the checkout belt. 

           He looks up to see Amber and Adam’s forehead moment on the 
           front page of the NY Times. “A Hero’s Journey: From Doctors 
           Without Borders to MarsNow’s Doctor on Call.” 

           He turns away, but it’s also on US Weekly. “The First Man and 
           First Lady of Space?” Kevin stares at it.

                                 CASHIER (O.S.)
                        That everything?

           Kevin comes to. The CASHIER looks at him.

                                 KEVIN
                        Uh. No. And this.

           He throws the magazine on the grocery belt.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kevin sits quietly alone on the couch, reading the magazine. 
           His phone lights up.

           INSERT: Series of texts from Marcus: “U up? JK. Mars time?”

           Kevin starts typing a reply.

           INSERT: Kevin’s reply. “Not feeling it tonight. Next week?”
           INSERT: Marcus’s reply: “Cool” plus a gif of a guy falling 
           down stairs. Then: “Haha falling is tits.”

           A moment passes, then Kevin turns on the TV. 

           INT. MARSNOW TRAINING FACILITY - SAME

           The Host walks past the line of remaining contestants. There 
           are eight, including Adam and Amber. Amber looks more put 
           together, her teeth whiter, her skin brighter. 

                                 HOST
                        Starting this week, we’re doing 
                        something different. From now on, 
                        you the audience can vote for who 
                        you want to stay and who goes home. 
                        Along with our expert panel, your 
                        votes will help us decide who goes 
                        to Mars.

           Off “expert panel”, they cut to a panel of stern looking 
           JUDGES sitting behind a white desk.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Kevin is prostrate on Voyager, pipe in hand. On TV, the 
           episode ends and a phone number flashes on screen. 

           Kevin lifts his phone and dials. The line clicks and plays a 
           tinny version of the show’s theme.

           Kevin hurriedly presses 3. 

                                 AMBER (V.O.)
                        Hi! I’m Amber. Thank you for voting 
                        for me. I’d love to go to Mars, and 
                        thanks to you, I can.

                                 KEVIN
                        Uh. Hey Slammer. I hope you win. 
                        (Beat) Actually, I don’t. But I do, 
                        you know? Fuck.

           He goes to hang up, but there’s a beep on the line.

                                 HOTLINE OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Thank you for calling MarsNow. Is 
                        that all you’ve got?

                                 KEVIN
                        What?

                                 HOTLINE OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Say something meaningful, dumbass.

                                 KEVIN
                        Jesus. (Beat) You know what, 
                        MarsNow? You guys are so screwed. 
                        Because I know something you don’t. 
                        Amber’s not going to sit still or 
                        settle. Mars will seem great at 
                        first, and so will FirstMan34. But 
                        eventually Mars will be as stifling 
                        as this place, and he will be just 
                        like me. The guy who’s always 
                        around. And he’ll probably still 
                        love her too, like a fucking chump.

           Kevin waits. The line clicks and plays a canned message.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        Thank you for calling MarsNow. We 
                        can create a better world...on 
                        Mars. Now.

           Kevin hangs up. He tosses his phone in anger. He immediately 
           picks it up. The screen has suffered a circular crack, like a 
           planet. Or a face.
           INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

           Kevin buys a case of beer and six pre-packaged cupcakes. He 
           tosses his purchases on the conveyer belt. 

           The cashier, TANYA, eyes his choices with a smirk.

           INT. MARSNOW TRAINING FACILITY - DAY

           The remaining six contestants are paired off as Amber/Pablo, 
           Adam/Mariko, Roger/Tina.

                                 HOST
                        This is our supplies challenge. 
                        Each pair will decide what supplies 
                        they need for one year on Mars and 
                        race to the pile to hoard them. And 
                        if you’re thinking, “Hey, this is 
                        like the Hunger Games, you’re 
                        right.” Only better. 

           The Host winks. 

                                 KEVIN (O.S.)
                        Prick.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Kevin drains the last of several beers. He picks up and licks 
           the frosting off of a cupcake, then puts it back. 

           There are four other licked-clean cupcakes in the container.

           He picks up the pipe, packs it, then stops. He lights it, 
           inhales, and leans back into Voyager, closing his eyes.

           He ignores his phone, which has several messages from Marcus 
           on it, lighting the screen.

           INTERCUT: Living Room/Show.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        This is an interesting challenge. 
                        It’s about protecting your pairing, 
                        and it’s about math. How much do 
                        two people need to live?

           The pairs huddle and discuss. The camera finds Amber.

           A title flashes onscreen: Contestant Up Close: Amber.
           On TV, photos of The Kivenens, including the gymnastics photo 
           from their bedroom wipe across, Ken Burns-like. 

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        Amber Kivinen was born in Delancey, 
                        Oregon, on March 20, 1990. Her 
                        parents are Finnish immigrants and 
                        pillars of their small community. 
                        Dad coached hockey and mom was a 
                        homemaker.

           INT. MARSNOW STUDIO - SAME

           Suddenly, Amber’s parents are on screen, being interviewed. 
           They’re shined up, TV-friendly versions of themselves.

           INTERCUT: LIVING ROOM/SHOW.

                                 AMBER’S DAD
                        We are very proud of Amber. 

                                 HOST (O.S.)
                        When she hurt her shoulder, ending 
                        her gymnastics career, did you 
                        think that she would get this far?

                                 AMBER’S DAD 
                        She can do anything when she 
                        applies herself.

           Amber’s dad seems to say this directly to Kevin. An affront. 
           Kevin gives him the finger from the futon.

                                 AMBER’S MOM
                        We’re just so grateful to God and 
                        Jesus for making her so beautiful 
                        and talented.

           Even now, Kevin can’t help but look at Amber’s mom’s boobs.

           Amber shows her parents around the MarsNow Facility, pointing 
           out the equipment and showing them the hydroponics lab.

           Amber does a direct to camera interview.

                                 AMBER

                        hurt my shoulder. But my parents 
                        always stood by me.
                                 HOST (O.S.)
                        I’m sure you’re going to miss them. 
                        Is there anyone else you will miss?

                                 AMBER
                        Of course. There are people out 
                        there I really love. 

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Kevin sits forward in his seat.

                                 AMBER
                        This is a huge decision. I don’t 
                        make it lightly. But you know, my 
                        life — I kind of hit a wall.

                                 HOST (O.S.)
                        Time for a change, huh?

                                 AMBER
                        Haha...yeah. A really big one.

           Kevin turns the TV off. He sits in silence for a moment. 

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           The rain streams down. Bill Clinton and Al Gore smile 
           beatifically out from their portraits. 

           Children sit in a circle on the floor. Little Kevin and 
           Little Amber sit next to one another. 

           Little Amber reads a book. Little Kevin looks at Little 
           Amber’s foot. He pushes his foot into hers. 

           They look at each other and giggle. They push their feet 
           together harder, giggle more.

           Little Kevin tips over dramatically. Little Amber giggles.

                                 TEACHER
                        Children, shhh.

           Little Amber dutifully looks down at her book. 

                                 LITTLE KEVIN
                             (whispers)
                        What are you reading about?
                                 LITTLE AMBER
                             (whispers)
                        The Planets. You?

           She looks up at the papier-mâché solar system.

                                 LITTLE KEVIN
                        Dinosaurs. 

                                 LITTLE AMBER
                             (matter of fact)
                        Dinosaurs were killed by an 
                        asteroid from space, did you know?

           Little Kevin processes this. He’s distraught.

                                 LITTLE KEVIN
                        All the dinosaurs?

                                 TEACHER
                        Children! I won’t say it again.

           Suddenly, there’s a loud CRACK of thunder. The kids gasp. The 
           lights overhead flicker. Little Amber keeps reading. Little 
           Kevin edges closer to her.

           The lights go out. Little Amber looks up at the ceiling. 
           Little Kevin looks at Amber. He grabs her hand. She lets him.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        What I’ve always wondered is, why 
                        do we love who we love? And why 
                        does love die?

           Little Amber turns to Little Kevin and smiles. The lights 
           buzz back on.

                                                         END FLASHBACK.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Kevin sleeps on Voyager. Marcus shakes Kevin’s shoulder. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Hey man. Wake up.

           Kevin emerges, as from a dream. On TV, Amber and Adam 
           embrace. A lower third reads: “Previously on MarsNow”.

                                 KEVIN
                        Hey. What’s up?
                                 MARCUS
                        What’s up is, I thought I might 
                        come here and find you all bloated 
                        and dead in your own shit. 

           On TV, Amber stands next to the Host. She’s out of breath.

                                 HOST
                        What made you decide to share 
                        supplies with Adam’s team?

                                 AMBER
                        Well, I thought since he sacrificed 
                        for me, with my shoulder, I should 
                        sacrifice for him.

                                 KEVIN
                             (to Marcus)
                        Oh. Yeah.

           Marcus grabs the remote and hits Mute.

                                 MARCUS
                        “Oh, yeah”? Not good enough man. It 
                        definitely smells like ripped ass 
                        in here but you’re unharmed.

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah. Sorry.

                                 MARCUS
                        Sorry. Get the fuck up, man. This 
                        ain’t no way to live.

           Kevin sits up. Marcus throws a towel at him.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Shower, then we’re gonna watch this 
                        shit.

                                 KEVIN
                        What shit?

                                 MARCUS
                        Mars. Period. Now. We’re watching 
                        it. Period. Now. together.

                                 KEVIN
                        Oh, I dunno. I might not.

                                 MARCUS
                        Look, I get it. It sucks. But I’m 
                        here, and Mr. Fattys is coming, and 
                        we’re doing this. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARCUS (CONT'D)
                        (Beat) She’s either going to Mars 
                        or she’s not, whether we watch, or 
                        not. So.

           Kevin peels himself off Voyager. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kevin and Marcus eat Mr. Fatty’s and watch. Intercut with —

           INT. MARSNOW TRAINING FACILITY - SAME

           The remaining four contestants’ final moments on the show, 
           seen in a montage:

           --Giving unheard direct-to-camera interviews;

           --Bouncing in the Pressure Cooker; 

           --Smiling to camera, laughing, and waving while eating 
           together, Amber and Adam side-by-side;

           --Exploring a facsimile of their MarsNow “home,” a pod with 
           sleeping space, a computer lab, a hydroponics lab, and a 
           medical room with examination table.

           Marcus and Kevin smoke.

                                 MARCUS
                        You okay, man?

                                 KEVIN
                        Ask me in ten minutes.

           INT. MARSNOW TRAINING FACILITY - SAME

           Amber, Adam, Mariko, and Pablo, stand in a tense line under 
           their country’s respective flags.

           The Host walks out and stops beside a small table with two 
           MarsNow pins shining on it in perfect, direct lighting.

                                 HOST
                        These four brave but ordinary

                        months preparing and training and 
                        showing you why they are the best 
                        people to go to Mars now. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HOST (CONT'D)
                        You voted, our experts weighed in, 
                        and now two people from earth are 
                        going to start a new life on Mars. 

           The camera lingers on Amber and Adam.

                                 HOST (CONT’D)
                        Contestants, are you ready?

                                 CONTESTANTS
                        Yes sir.

                                 HOST
                        Great. Here they are, one by one: 
                        Amber, the hydroponics expert. 
                        Adam, the doctor. 

           The camera pans to Mariko, then Pablo.

                                 HOST (CONT’D)
                        Mariko, our chemist. And Pablo, our 
                        computer scientist-slash-poet.

           A tense moment.

                                 HOST (CONT’D)
                        People of Earth. The moment has 
                        arrived. (Beat) Your MarsNow 
                        travelers are...

           A too-long pause. TV time stretched to its limits.

                                 HOST (CONT’D)
                         Adam and —

           Amber looks up a beat early, as if on cue. 

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        She was never a good actress. In 
                        high school she was always the 
                        stage manager.

                                 HOST (O.S.)
                        Amber! Amber and Adam are going to 
                        Mars!

           A pause. Then an explosion of cheering from everywhere.

           The Host pins the pin on her as the woman pins the other on 
           Adam. Amber makes a “Who me?” face. The music crescendoes.

           She and Adam look at each other, triumphant. They press their 
           foreheads together, then turn, hold hands, and wave.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Kevin stares at the screen. Marcus’s mouth hangs open. He 
           brings the pipe up to his lips and inhales.

                                 MARCUS
                        Fuck, man.

           He exhales.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        That was good TV.

                                 KEVIN
                        I need to talk to her.

                                 MARCUS
                        Haha. Okay. That might be kind of 
                        hard, dude. 

           INT. MARSNOW TRAINING FACILITY - DAY

           Amber walks in dramatic slow motion down a long gangway. She 
           wears a streamlined jumpsuit with a MarsNow insignia and 
           carries a helmet under her arm. Triumphant music plays. 

           Adam walks down another long gangway in a similar outfit, 
           though his has an obvious codpiece.

           They meet at a Y and smile as they continue together.

           Amber and Adam climb into the oval door of a ship-like 
           structure. They close the door and latch it.

           The POV shifts to Big Brother-esque series of cameras inside 
           the pod, above and beside Amber and Adam. 

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        Now that they’re inside the pod, 
                        they can’t come back out. Over the 
                        next six months, they’ll be locked 
                        in and gradually acclimated to 
                        Mars’s atmosphere. 

           As the Host speaks, an animated graphic of Amber and Adam 
           illustrates what he’s saying.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        The pod will be air-locked to a 
                        ship, which will in turn deposit 
                        them on Mars. Yes, these are Amber 
                        and Adam’s last moments on earth.

                                 HOST (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Their loved ones here at MarsNow HQ 
                        are the last to see them leave.

           Back on the gangway, a very staged moment: Amber’s parents 
           walk and join up with an older Israeli woman, ADAM’S MOTHER, 
           and a pair of TEENAGE TWINS, younger copies of Adam. 

           The two families look at the pod, waving in slo-mo.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Kevin sits on Voyager, staring at the TV in the dark. 

           The TV silently plays late night news, the story obviously 
           about Amber and Adam’s victory.

           A lower-third scroll reads: “JUST 11 DAYS UNTIL LAUNCH!”

           Kevin lays down. He sinks into Voyager like quicksand.

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           KIDS sit at desks and swing their legs. The solar system 
           hangs in the corner.

                                 TEACHER
                        Each of you will have a summer pen 
                        pal. You’ll exchange addresses and 
                        write one another letters.

           Little Kevin looks at the back of Little Amber’s head, a few 
           rows ahead of him.

                                 TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        I’m passing out different colored 
                        paper right now. You need to find 
                        the person with the same color as 
                        you. That’s your pen pal.

           The teacher drops an orange paper circle on Little Kevin’s 
           desk. He picks it up and looks at it, then puts it down. 

           Little Amber appears at his desk. She holds an orange circle. 
           She smiles and puts their circles on top of one another.

                                                             BLACK OUT.

           In the inky black we hear the sound of a heart monitor beep-
           beeping, beep-beeping. A regular human heartbeat. 
                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        About two months after the launch, 
                        I figured out that Amber and I were 
                        still looking at the same sunset.

           A white line splits the screen in two, getting redder as the 
           sun travels to it from both directions, crossing space in one 
           half and crossing the Earth’s sky in another. 

           Underneath the heartbeat sound, there’s an echo of sorts. A 
           more rapid, fainter beat. But strong.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        If you go to Mars too fast your 
                        bones get crushed to powder. That’s 
                        if the radiation doesn’t get you 
                        first. Or the isolation insanity. 

           The “suns” disappear into one another. The heartbeats merge, 
           overlap, and are overtaken by canned TV laughter.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        I’ve been spending a lot of time on 
                        the internet, researching Mars. 

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kevin sits on Voyager. Amber, in her MarsNow spacesuit, sits 
           next to him, her hands on her knees. She looks skinnier, 
           paler. She opens her mouth wide, as if to scream. 

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Oh, and this has been happening. 
                        Which is totally fine.

           He stares at the TV as the laughter peals louder and louder 
           around him. He does not laugh. He doesn’t react at all.

           Suddenly a woman, TANYA VARGAS, 28, crosses him and sits 
           down. She’s the cashier from the grocery store we saw 
           earlier. She grabs his inner thigh playfully, bites his ear. 

           Amber isn’t there. Never was.

           The canned laughter grows louder. Still, Kevin doesn’t react.

           Marcus crosses the other way and sits, distributing Mr. 
           Fatty’s bags. He claps Kevin on the shoulder. 

           They eat burgers and fries in SLO MO. Tanya laughs. Marcus 
           laughs. Kevin is barely there. He closes his eyes.
           INSERT TITLE: 6 MONTHS AFTER LAUNCH.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The laughter has stopped. The TV plays quietly. Tanya snoozes 
           on Kevin’s lap. Marcus reclines, half asleep. He peels 
           himself up.

                                 MARCUS
                        Alright, I’m out. Goodnight man. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah, us too probably. Night.

           Marcus leaves. Kevin looks down at Tanya, who snores softly. 
           He shifts his legs gently, but she doesn’t wake up. 

           Marcus goes into the pot room. The door swings open, 
           revealing that the pot area has been covered over with a 
           tarp. There’s a mattress on the floor. 

           Kevin stares. The heartbeat rises, briefly: beep-beep, beep-
           beep. Then Marcus uses his foot to kick closed the door.

           Kevin moves his legs again, but Tanya just wiggles and 
           settles in deeper. Kevin gently slides out and her head drops 
           with a thud. He winces, but she doesn’t wake up.

           He picks up the remote to turn the TV off. Then suddenly —

           Amber’s smiling face fills the screen. Kevin turns it up.

           INT. MARSNOW LIVING SPACE - SPACETIME

           The familiar shape of the white, egg-like pod. 

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        Six months ago, two brave yet 
                        ordinary citizens took the ultimate 
                        leap and went to Mars, Now. 

           A series of clips from the show: 

           -- Amber and Adam in their suits, in a line. 

           -- The contestants exploring their pod. 

           -- The shoulder fix and forehead touch. 

           -- Adam and Amber’s win. 

           -- They smile and wave as they get in the pod.
                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        Amber and Adam dazzled us with 
                        their candidness and courage and 
                        obvious chemistry. Now, six months 
                        later, they’re ready to start the 
                        next phase of their journey.

           Back to the pod. It floats through space like a giant egg.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        Now the real adventure begins. On 
                        Mars.

           A title card overtakes the screen: MarsNow Season 2: Mars. 
           Now. Season Premiere Thursday at 7pm.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Kevin breathes in and out raggedly. 

           Closeup on his face as Tanya’s tongue enters his right ear. 
           He appears not to notice.

           He continues to stare, distraught. Tanya kisses and licks his 
           ear. Widening out, we see that her hand is in his sweatpants, 
           working vigorously. He’s unmoved.

           After a beat, he returns to himself. Kevin reaches down and 
           stops Tanya’s hand for a moment, then lets her resume.

           INT. CITY BUS - THE NEXT DAY

           Kevin rides the bus. He listens to music on headphones. The 
           bus stops at a stop light. 

           He looks up to see a billboard for MarsNow. Amber’s and 
           Adam’s faces peer out over the city, huge and inspiring. 

           He closes his eyes. Then he opens them again. 

                                 KEVIN
                             (to us/no one)
                        I was doing really well. I am doing 
                        really well. I’ve been reading 
                        about Mars. I started jogging.

           An OLD LADY next to him turns to look at him.

                                 OLD LADY
                        I beg to differ.
                                 KEVIN
                        No. No. I am doing really well.

                                 OLD LADY
                        You jogged three times and skimmed 
                        the Mars Wikipedia page. And for 
                        about ten minutes you read the Mars 
                        Volta page instead. 

                                 KEVIN
                        They were a good band!

                                 OLD LADY 
                        They were weird.

                                 KEVIN
                        I have an idea. A plan. I’m almost 
                        ready. I’m going to see Amber. I’m 
                        fine.

                                 OLD LADY
                        Oh yeah? Then why is her creepy non-
                        ghost hanging around?

                                 KEVIN
                        Because she’s — I don’t know.

                                 OLD LADY
                        Uh huh. And how’s that working out, 
                        honey? 

                                 KEVIN
                        Fine.

                                 OLD LADY
                        Fine. Everything’s fine, says the 
                        kid who conjured the ghost of his 
                        totally alive ex-girlfriend. 

                                 KEVIN
                        She’s not my ex-girlfriend. We 
                        never broke up. 

                                 OLD LADY
                        Oh? So then what are you doing with 
                        that nice girl that gives you hand 
                        jobs on the couch most nights?

                                 KEVIN
                        Tanya. Her name’s Tanya. 

                                 OLD LADY 
                        I know her name, dumbass. I’m you.
                                 BUS DRIVER (O.S.)
                        He’s dicking her around, that’s 
                        what he’s doing.

           Reveal the BUS DRIVER, looking back through the rear view.

                                 OLD LADY
                        Literally.

           The Bus Driver and the Old Lady laugh, like Kevin and Marcus 
           would while stoned. Long distance high five, pound, etc.

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m just figuring things out. 

                                 OLD LADY
                        Stalling, more like. 

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        Yeah, kid. Get your shit together. 
                        She’s not coming back. She left you 
                        behind on purpose. 
                             (to the Old Lady)
                        Can you imagine? Brutal.

                                 OLD LADY
                             (to Bus Driver)
                        Absolute brutality!

                                 KEVIN
                        Shut up. I just need to talk to 
                        her. Just one more time.

                                 OLD LADY
                        She humiliated you. Forget her. 

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m trying, goddamn it!

           The Old Lady gets very close to Kevin’s ear.

                                 OLD LADY 
                        You’ve never tried to do anything. 
                        Except love Amber Kivenen. And look 
                        where that got you.

                                 KEVIN
                        Fuck off!

           The Old Lady’s tongue darts out and into his ear, Tanya 
           Vargas-style. Kevin flinches.
           INT. CITY BUS - SAME

           Off the flinch, Kevin wakes up. Beside him, the Old Lady sits 
           placidly, reading a bible. The driver...drives.

           Kevin rubs his face, lightly touches his ear. He looks 
           around, getting his bearings. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Shit!

           The Old Lady tsk-tsks, obviously disapproving of such 
           language.

           Kevin rudely scrambles over her and gets off the bus. She 
           shakes her head and goes back to reading.

           INT. MORGUE SET - DAY

           A body lies on a slab, covered in a sheet. A PATHOLOGIST 
           stands over it.

                                 PATHOLOGIST
                        Just a warning, Dick, it’s worse 
                        than any case I’ve seen.

           Reveal the TV Detective from earlier, looking across at the 
           Pathologist. We’re on set.

                                 PATHOLOGIST (CONT’D)
                        And that’s saying something, cuz I 
                        was in ‘Nam.

           They look up grimly at each other, and nod. The Pathologist 
           lifts the sheet.

           It’s Kevin, “dead” again in some extremely gnarly makeup.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Wow. I never realized syphilis 
                        could get this bad.

           INT. MORGUE SET - LATER

           Kevin hops up off the slab. He’s wearing a nude bodysuit 
           below the sheet line.

                                 DETECTIVE
                             (actor, with accent)
                        Say, Kevin.
                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah.

           The Detective gets closer. He whispers.

                                 DETECTIVE
                             (actor, with accent)
                        You still have that nice ganja? My 
                        girlfriend Svetlana loved it. She’s 
                        24, by the way. 

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Amber didn’t let me sell on set. 
                        Crossing the streams, she called 
                        it. But she’s not here. There’s 
                        just one problem.

                                 KEVIN
                        Uh, we’re out right now. But I can 
                        get you some soon.

                                 DETECTIVE
                             (actor, with accent)
                        How soon?

                                 KEVIN
                        Um, soon. I promise.

           The Detective winks, then slaps Kevin hard on the back.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Kevin sits on Voyager, watching TV. Tanya comes out of the 
           shower in a towel. She stops, takes the towel off and uses it 
           to dry her hair. Nude.

           Kevin watches her. He smiles. She winks at him.

                                 TANYA
                        I’m going to bed. You coming?

                                 KEVIN
                        Pretty soon, yeah. 

                                 TANYA
                        Cool. (Beat) Hey Watkins.

           She lifts herself off him and heads towards the bedroom. At 
           the doorway, she stops. There’s a look of love in her eye.

                                 KEVIN
                             (cutting it off)
                        Let’s go on a road trip.
                                 TANYA
                        Yeah?

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah. to the desert. I’ve always 
                        wanted to go to the desert.

                                 TANYA
                        Can I drive?

                                 KEVIN
                        Definitely.

                                 TANYA
                        Okay, let’s do it.

           She flashes him. He pretends to be shocked, fanning himself 
           like a scandalized Southern belle. She goes into the bedroom 
           and closes the door. He breathes out.

           Immediately, Amber’s “ghost” appears on the futon, sitting 
           and staring out as before. Kevin doesn’t look at her.

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m fine. I’m okay. I’m an asshole.

           Kevin reaches down and grabs the pipe. He lights it, inhales, 
           and offers it to Amber’s ghost, mindlessly. She turns her 
           head to him and opens her mouth.

                                 AMBER’S GHOST (V.O.)

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (BACK TO SCENE)

           Kevin wakes up prostrate on the futon with his phone in his 
           hand. “Amber” is not there.  

           He looks at his phone: 3:34 AM. He can hear a faint noise 
           coming from it. He lifts it to his ear.

                                 HOTLINE OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Thank you for calling the MarsNow 
                        hotline. The hotline is now closed. 
                        Please hang up. (Beat) Thank you 
                        for calling the MarsNow hotline. 
                        The hotline is now closed. Please 
                        hang up.
           Kevin hits the button to hang up. The TV casts silent bluish-
           white light across him and the dark room.  

           He looks up at the ceiling, looking for the face. He can’t 
           see it. He frames his hands, still nothing. He drops his 
           hands to his chest and closes his eyes.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Like the blink of an eye, it’s morning. Kevin snores with his 
           mouth wide open. Closeup on his mouth as the end of a necktie 
           slowly drops into it. Kevin coughs but keeps sleeping.

           A snicker can be heard. The tie moves up and out of frame. 
           Marcus’s hand enters. He pokes Kevin in the shoulder.

                                 MARCUS (O.S.)
                        Hey dude. 

           Kevin snorts awake. Marcus hangs over him, dressed in a 
           burnout’s idea of a nice shirt and tie. The bottom of his tie 
           is wet from Kevin’s mouth. He flaps it to dry it.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        You were out cold. Couching again? 

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah. Sorry.

                                 MARCUS
                        So, you’re going on a road trip 
                        with Tanya, huh?

                                 KEVIN
                        You heard that? (Beat) How much do 
                        you hear?

                                 MARCUS
                        Everything.

                                 KEVIN
                        Sorry.

                                 MARCUS
                        Don’t be. I don’t need to watch 
                        porn anymore. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Aw, man.
                                 MARCUS
                        Cool about the road trip. It’s 
                        funny, though, you’ve never told me 
                        you want to visit the desert.

                                 KEVIN
                        Well, I do.

                                 MARCUS
                        Lots of cool shit happens in the 
                        desert, for sure. Peyote. The Grand 
                        Canyon. Space ship launches.

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah.

                                 MARCUS
                        Okay, well. Time for work. (Beat) 
                        Hey man. If I don’t say it enough, 
                        thanks for letting me move in here. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Of course, dude. 

           There’s a nice quiet moment between them. 

           Then Marcus squats down like he’s a dancer in a 90s hip hop 
           video, his hands on his knees, ass out. He farts. He laughs.

           He dips out. Kevin covers his face with his shirt. He looks 
           over at the den/bedroom. The door is ajar.

           INT. BEDROOM/DEN - CONTINUOUS

           Kevin looks into the bedroom. All traces of Amber are gone. 
           The room has been “Tanya-ized.” Scarves drape most surfaces, 
           there are pictures on the wall, and the bed has an actual 
           frame. It’s nice. Feminine.

           The bed has been neatly made. Tanya is gone for the day.

           Kevin looks around and sighs. He closes the door.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kevin walks out into the living room and towards the kitchen. 
           He stops outside the Pot Room, now Marcus’s bedroom. He puts 
           his hand on the doorknob and moves to enter. 

           The sound of a heartbeat monitor: beep-beep, beep-beep. Then 
           through it, the heart itself: thump-thump, thump-thump. And 
           again, the rapid beat: th-thum-thump, th-thum-thump.
           Kevin’s hand moves to turn the knob, but he can’t. 

           He recoils, then turns towards the kitchen. As he does, the 
           sound dissipates.

                                 KEVIN
                             (to us)
                        I’m figuring it out, okay? I’ve got 
                        it. Don’t look at me.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Marcus and Tanya are on the futon in sweatpants, sharing a 
           bag of chips and the amber-colored pipe.

                                 MARCUS
                        Kevin! It’s going to start! In like 
                        a minute!

                                 TANYA
                        Kevin! Get in here!

                                 MARCUS
                        Kevin! Don’t be a turd!

           Tanya makes a fart noise with her mouth. Marcus laughs 
           through a smokey exhale.

           INT. BATHROOM - SAME

           Kevin stands at the bathroom sink, looking in the mirror. He 
           breathes in, then out. Again. 

           Kevin closes his eyes. 

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT (BACK TO SCENE)

           Kevin leans over the sink, breathing heavily. He tries to 
           control his breath.

           He splashes water on his face. 

           When he comes back up, Amber’s Ghost is behind him. He shuts 
           his eyes. She’s gone.

           He puts his hand to his heart. It flutters nervously: Beat-
           beat-beat. Beat-beat-beat. He steels himself.
           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Kevin enters the living room, stone-faced.

           Tanya and Marcus look at him, smiling goofily. Like a 
           pantomime in slo-mo, they move apart and pat the futon 
           between them. Marcus sweeps a wayward chip onto the floor.

           Kevin sits, slowly. Marcus claps him on the back. Tanya grabs 
           his hand and claps it between both of hers. She clamps all 
           three hands between her thighs tightly.

           The three of them breathe in, then out. They stare at the TV.

           On screen, the credit sequence begins. Blackness swirls into 
           planets sailing by, obviously CGI-ed. The screen slowly fills 
           with the orange swirls and bumps of Mars. 

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        It’s been six months. 183 days. 
                        4380 hours. 262,800 minutes. And 
                        now, we’re seconds from a miracle. 

           EXT. MARS - CONTINUOUS 

           The images become less CGI and more realistic as Mars comes 
           into view. There are mountains and craters, entire 
           continents. It’s beautiful and terrifying. 

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        Since they left us, Amber and Adam 
                        have been in their confinement pod 
                        sailing above earth. There’s not 
                        much to do up there except talk. 
                        Apparently, they have been playing 
                        a lot of Uno. Hahaha adorable.

           One of the formations rolls by in a swirl of space-dust. It 
           looks like a human face. 

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They all stare, slack-jawed.

                                 KEVIN
                        Did you guys see that?

                                 TANYA
                        See what?

                                 KEVIN
                        Cydonia. The face on Mars.
                                 TANYA
                        No?

           Marcus puts down the pipe.

                                 MARCUS
                        I never thought I’d say this, but I 
                        don’t think I’m going to be able to 
                        watch this high.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        You are looking at the first ever 
                        live feed of the surface of Mars.

           Awed silence, punctuated by Marcus crunching a chip.

           INT. MARSNOW CREDITS - CONTINUOUS

           A vast swirling orange nothing, just the surface of Mars. 
           Suddenly, a tiny, white orb comes into view. 

           INTERCUT: LIVING ROOM/SHOW.

                                 HOST (V.O.) 
                        Here they come. Let’s take a look.

           A blurry black and orange adjustment and then the orb, larger 
           and closer, edges into view. 

           Two wing-like flaps open on either side of it and the frame 
           shakes violently as the orb seems to tilt and wobble.

           Kevin, Marcus, and Tanya all lean forward. Tanya chews the 
           nails on her free hand.

                                 TANYA
                        This is intense.

           The entire universe holds its breath. The little orb hovers 
           before disappearing in the atmosphere.

           Kevin searches the screen, his eyes wide.

           The blurry-closeup view reveals nothing but dust.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        We are awaiting visual 
                        confirmation.

           The dust thins, and the shaking stops. The white pod is 
           revealed, sitting flat and calm on the surface of Mars. 

           A massive CHEER goes up. 
           INT. MARSNOW CONTROL - SAME

           Reveal the Houston-like control room for MarsNow, stacked row 
           on row with dozens of overly-attractive ENGINEERS. They are 
           too coordinated in their cheering. All wear grey versions of 
           the white MarsNow jumpsuits. 

           With them, in a specially lit central throne, is the Host. 

                                 HOST
                        Haha, wonderful. Yes! They landed! 
                        And this is the MarsNow control 
                        room. There are 4,113 cameras 
                        watching and 8,42 microphones 
                        listening from my strategically 
                        placed satellites around Mars, on 
                        Mars Rovers, and inside the MarsNow 
                        Living Space. These 48 engineers 
                        will be following the action live, 
                        24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

           Behind him, on a wall of screens, we see the various cameras 
           that will track Amber and Adam, including Wall-E like Rovers 
           with comical camera arms.

           An ENGINEER enters frame, smiling robotically. 

                                 ENGINEER
                        Sir? It’s time.

                                 HOST
                        Perfect. Let’s watch. 

           The Host extends his arm and points, and the camera 
           robotically follows.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - SAME

           The trio sits, glued to each other. They hold their breath.

           Marcus breathes out, releasing a cloud of pot smoke and a few 
           staccato coughs.

           EXT. MARS - SAME

           The pod sits placidly, as winds whip up and around it.

           The camera, clearly a Rover, moves forward awkwardly, then 
           robotically to the right, then left, finding its frame on the 
           pod in that jerky way that robots do.
                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        Our state-of-the-art RoboCameras 
                        are adjusting to new visual 
                        information, just like us.

           Suddenly, a seam appears in the center of the orb.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        This is it. Amber and Adam have 
                        been in confinement for six months, 
                        receiving nutrients and being 
                        monitored by our health team. They 
                        are both in perfect health, and 
                        they are ready to show you just how 
                        ready they are to start a new life 
                        on Mars. 

           The seam widens, like an opening eye, revealing a transparent 
           glass window beneath. The camera continues finding focus as 
           two blurry figures come into view.

           As the image resolves, we see Amber and Adam in better focus. 
           They hold hands.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Tanya chews her thumbnail. Kevin takes tiny sips of air. 
           Marcus lifts, lights, and inhales the pipe.

           EXT. MARSNOW LIVING SPACE - SAME

           Amber and Adam stand, proudly. They’re in white MarsNow 
           jumpsuits, but Amber’s is modified in the middle.

           INTERCUT: LIVING ROOM/SHOW.

           Kevin leans forward, trying to figure out what he’s seeing.

           As if on cue, Amber and Adam smile and wave to the audience, 
           then they turn to each other and kiss. Amber backs up a step 
           and frames her torso with her hands.

           She’s clearly, visibly pregnant.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Kevin wrenches his hand from Tanya’s thighs. After a beat he 
           stands, hitting several things off the table and onto the 
           floor. The Dollywood ashtray breaks.
                                 HOST (O.S.)
                        Yes, that’s right. Now, finally, we 
                        here at the proud MarsNow family 
                        get to share some fun news: Amber 
                        and Adam are expecting. 

           Kevin stumbles over Marcus, pushing his head back with his 
           hand and kicking him, hard. Marcus is clearly in pain, but 
           says nothing, swallowing it.

           Kevin stumbles further and falls to his hands and knees. He 
           makes a strangled sound.

           Tanya goes to say something, but Marcus shakes his head 
           firmly at her. Kevin lingers on the floor.

                                 HOST (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        A massive thanks is due to our 
                        MarsNow medical staff for taking 
                        such good care of Amber on the way 
                        here. She and the baby are both 
                        healthy. She is due in 2 months.

           Kevin hears all of this with his face towards the bathroom. 
           His head drops as he flops himself in and slams the door. 

                                 HOST (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Yes, as all of you already sensed: 
                        These two have been in love since 
                        this crazy experiment started. 
                        Hahahahahaha!

           The Host continues laughing, like he just learned the meaning 
           of the word. It’s weird and monotone.

           From within the bathroom we hear —

                                 KEVIN (O.S.)
                        Hahahahahaha!

           On TV, Amber and Adam wave and pose from the pod’s window, 
           blips on a big orange surface. Inspirational music swells.

           Marcus and Tanya sit, stunned.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kevin slides down and into the tub. His breathing is ragged 
           and pained. He shifts uncomfortably, puts his hand to his 
           chest, and tries to control himself.
           Then he hears it: The heart monitor. The beep-beep, thump-
           thump, then the th-thum-thump. A baby. That’s what that is. 
           That’s what he’s been hearing. 

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Kevin snoozes on Voyager. A pregnancy test drops onto his 
           chest, and he wakes up. He picks it up, then realizes what it 
           is, and sits up.  

           Amber sits beside him and crosses her arms.

                                 AMBER
                        It’s super early. Plus, the women 
                        in my family tend to miscarry so 
                        don’t worry. My mom had like, four 
                        of them before I was born. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Okay.

                                 AMBER
                        And if for some reason I don’t, 
                        I’ll get an abortion. Okay?

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah. That’s...okay.

                                 AMBER
                        I do want kids. But not yet.

           Kevin looks to Amber for a cue. Her face is impassive. 

                                 KEVIN
                        No?

                                 AMBER
                        Here? Look around. We’re 
                        not...Yeah. What a mess.

           Amber tears up. She wipes her eyes. Kevin is frozen. He 
           grasps for something to say.

           She reaches out to grab Kevin’s hand. Kevin puts the test 
           down on the table, wipes his hand on his shirt, then holds 
           her hand back. They laugh a little.

                                 KEVIN
                        I mean, you did pee on it.
                                 AMBER
                        It’s true, I peed on that so hard.

           They laugh harder. Kevin puts his arm around her. 

           He touches her face with the same hand that held the test. He 
           holds her down. She squirms. They laugh.

                                                         END FLASHBACK.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT (BACK TO SCENE)

           Kevin lies in the dry tub, eyes closed. He opens them and 
           looks at the line of several loud and colorful shampoos and 
           soaps belonging to Tanya. 

           He picks up a foot callous grater, puzzled. He opens it and 
           dried foot skin falls on him like confetti. He laughs. The 
           laughs turn into to a scream. He muffles it with his hand.

           INT. CAR - DAY

           Tanya is driving, smiling and singing along to the radio. 
           Kevin watches her. 

                                 TANYA
                        This was a good idea, Watkins.

                                 KEVIN
                        Yes it was.
                             (to us)
                        I’m an asshole.

                                 TANYA
                        Oh look at this place! We are 
                        stopping here. 

           She pulls over and hops out of the car. 

           INT./EXT. CAR/ROADSIDE STOP - CONTINUOUS

           An alien-themed roadside pit stop, a la Roswell.

                                 TANYA
                        You coming?

                                 KEVIN
                        In a minute.
                                 TANYA
                        Okay. I’m going to buy some 
                        postcards. 

           She gets out of the car and strides towards an outdoor 
           postcard stand.

           A handpainted sign reads “Send a postcard to space!”

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. SMALL HOUSE - DAY

           Close on the mail slot in a house. Little Kevin stares at it.

           Suddenly, the slot opens and mail pours in. Little Kevin 
           pounces on it and rifles through it, extracting a letter.

           INT. LITTLE KEVIN’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Little Kevin hurriedly closes the door to his bedroom.

           He sits down on the floor and puts an envelope down, 
           smoothing it. In neat, girly handwriting, it reads:

           to: Kevin Watkins
           1472 Sycamore Street
           Eugene, OR
           United States of America
           The World
           The Milky Way
           The Universe

           And

           From: Amber Kivenen
           Gymnastics Camp
           Colorado
           United States of America
           The World
           The Milky Way
           The Universe

           Little Kevin opens the letter and reads, his lips moving.

                                 LITTLE AMBER (V.O.)
                        Dear Kevin. I hope you are having a 
                        nice summer so far. I am at 
                        gymnastics camp. It is hard but 
                        fun. I made a new friend, her name 
                        is Rachel. She is Jewish and lives 
                        in California. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LITTLE AMBER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I am not Jewish and I live in 
                        Eugene with you. Ha Ha. See you 
                        later. Amber.

           Kevin looks at the letter. He tapes it to the wall.

                                                         END FLASHBACK.

           INT. CAR - DAY (BACK TO SCENE)

           Kevin sits in the car, sinking into the seat.

           He looks at a sign out the window that says “Los Alamos 
           Testing Site - 45 miles.”

           Tanya gets back in the car. She’s wearing alien-eyeball 
           shaped sunglasses and sucking on a green lollipop.

                                 TANYA
                        I love it here. Eat this.

           She takes the lollipop out of her mouth and shoves it in 
           Kevin’s. He absently takes it.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Kevin and Tanya are sitting up in bed. Tanya is flipping 
           through channels on an old TV. 

           She comes across the new MarsNow episode. On TV, Amber is 
           inspecting a fledgling tomato plant.

                                 TANYA
                        Do you want to watch?

                                 KEVIN
                        Sure.

                                 TANYA
                        I’m surprised. If I were you, I 
                        wouldn’t want to. 

                                 KEVIN
                        No?

                                 TANYA
                        I mean, isn’t it weird to watch 
                        your ex-girlfriend live an entirely 
                        different life every week? It’s 
                        like Instagram on steroids.
                                 KEVIN
                        I don’t mind it.
                             (to us)
                        I do mind it.

                                 TANYA
                        Hm. Well that’s probably cuz you’ve 
                        got me. 

           Tanya snuggles in to Kevin’s armpit just as, on TV, Adam 
           comes up behind Amber and gives her a kiss. He places his 
           hands on her belly and they sway together there for a moment.

                                 KEVIN
                             (to us)
                        I’m such an asshole.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER

           In the early morning light, Kevin quietly dresses in a cheap 
           white jumpsuit, the kind you buy to paint in. He grabs a 
           shoulder bag and tiptoes out the door. Tanya sleeps.

           EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - DAY

           A rental car with Oregon plates turns down an access road 
           that says “Los Alamos Testing Site. Restricted Area.”

           INT. CAR - SAME

           Kevin drives, eating a power bar. He drops the wrapper on the 
           seat beside him, next to a few more. He eyes the shoulder bag 
           in the backseat.

           EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - LATER

           The car pulls up to a heavily guarded gate. On the gate next 
           to several warning signs is a newer sign that says “Home to 
           the MarsNow Official Launch Site.”

           In the distance, behind fencing, there’s a series of squat, 
           ugly buildings and a giant, new-looking glass structure.

           INT. CAR - SAME

           Kevin breathes out, slowly. He’s ready. He rolls down the 
           window, and the car is immediately surrounded.

           A scary GUARD leans down into his window, gun in view.
                                 GUARD
                        Sir, this is a government 
                        restricted area.

                                 KEVIN
                        Hello, officer. How are you today?

           The guard doesn’t speak.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        I’m not here for the government, 
                        I’m here for MarsNow. 

                                 GUARD
                        As I said, this is a restricted 
                        area. Please turn your car around 
                        or we will take possession of it.

                                 KEVIN
                        Um, okay. But I need to talk to 
                        MarsNow. They have my girlfriend 
                        and I need to go to Mars to get 
                        her. I’ll show you.

           Kevin reaches for the shoulder bag in the backseat. As he 
           does, myriad guards with many guns appear.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

           A grey, sterile room. Kevin sits with his hands zip-tied at a 
           metal table. Across from him, OFFICER SHELBY looks at a bunch 
           of documents and files from the shoulder bag.

           It’s a mix of things from pictures of Kevin and Amber 
           together, notes and letters from her, including a few penpal 
           letters, and other personal items. 

           Officer Shelby holds up a boardwalk caricature of Kevin as a 
           skateboarding potato with “Tater toter!” written under it.

                                 OFFICER SHELBY
                        This is you? You’re Tater toter?

                                 KEVIN
                        Yes ma’am. (Beat) Can I use the 
                        bathroom?

                                 OFFICER SHELBY
                        You’re not wearing a diaper? Most 
                        of the kooky murderous astronaut 
                        types wear a diaper.
                                 KEVIN
                        I’m not kooky or murderous or an 
                        astronaut. Or wearing a diaper.

           Amber’s Ghost watches from the corner.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        I’m not murderous or an astronaut 
                        or wearing a diaper.

                                 OFFICER SHELBY
                        I getcha. Okay. Hmm.

           A beat. Officer Shelby studies a nervous Kevin. As she does, 
           her face goes from stern professionalism to motherly concern.

                                 OFFICER SHELBY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s see: Your girlfriend left you 
                        to go to Mars and you thought you’d 
                        come here and go to Mars, too. But 
                        they thought you were crazy because 
                        you drove up in a rental car 
                        wearing a jumpsuit you bought at a 
                        dollar store with a belly full of 
                        energy bars. Is that it?

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah, that’s it.

                                 OFFICER SHELBY
                        It’s an admirable grand gesture. I 
                        get it. My ex-husband once caught 
                        the fly ball at a Diamondbacks game 
                        and gave it to me. Those kinds of 
                        things matter. But, and I say this 
                        with love, you seem a little kooky.

                                 KEVIN
                        My heart is broken.

           It slips out. Kevin is surprised.

                                 OFFICER SHELBY
                        Oh, sweetie. I can see that. But 
                        it’s not going to get fixed here. 
                        It has to get fixed here.

           She pokes him in the chest, a little too hard.

                                 OFFICER SHELBY (CONT’D)
                        Now, let’s get you back to Oregon, 
                        shall we? Ms. Vargas already picked 
                        up the car, she said to tell you —
           She looks down at her notes. 

                                 OFFICER SHELBY (CONT’D)
                        Uh, “Fuck off.” So I’ll be taking 
                        you to the airport. K hun?

           Kevin nods, weakly.

                                 OFFICER SHELBY (CONT’D)
                        You need a whizz, right? Let’s get 
                        you that whizz. 

           They both stand. Officer Shelby opens the door.

                                 OFFICER SHELBY (CONT’D)
                        You’re lucky Darrell was in a good 
                        mood today. Normally he just shoots 
                        on site. He’s allowed to do that.

           She gestures brightly for Kevin to leave the room. He does.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Kevin enters in his white jumpsuit. Marcus is watching TV.

                                 MARCUS
                        Hey dude. How was the vacation? 
                        (Beat) Where’s Tanya?

           Kevin looks through Marcus. After a beat, he looks up at 
           Marcus’s/the pot room. 

           In one move, he runs at the door with full force and swats it 
           open. It cracks against the opposite wall.

           Marcus stands up sharply.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Uh, dude, maybe.

           But it’s too late. Smash, crash. Off Marcus’s wince we see 
           Kevin, through the crack in the door. He’s knocked two dead, 
           crusted plants down and onto Marcus’s stuff.

           INT. MARCUS’S ROOM/POT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Marcus stands in the doorway as Kevin tosses plants around 
           the room. He tries to protest, weakly. 

           Kevin keeps tossing things: Plants, dirt, pieces of hose, 
           fertilizer, vials of various things are tossed and smashed.
           With every smash, shards of an image:

           INT. MARSNOW LIVING SPACE - SAME

           Amber, mask on, tending to her Mars plants with loving ease. 
           Spraying, trimming, picking, and eating abundant greens. She 
           is smiling, radiant, an Earth Mother, a magician. She smiles.

           INT. MARCUS’S ROOM/POT ROOM - SAME

           Kevin slumps down, as though to sit in his destruction.

           After a moment, Marcus moves cautiously towards him. Kevin 
           pops up with a pot plant in his arms and rushes the door.

           He thrusts the plant at Marcus, who takes it.

           EXT. BACKYARD - LATER

           Kevin, covered in dirt, desperately scrapes a hole in the 
           hard yard with a small gardening trowel. Marcus watches. On 
           the ground nearby is a clump of moldy, dry, dead pot plant. 

           Marcus edges away and around the side of the house, emerging 
           with a big, flat snow shovel. He awkwardly tries to help. 

           EXT. BACKYARD - LATER

           A modest, odd hole has been carved out of the lawn. Kevin 
           stomps the dead plants into it, but the heap is larger than 
           the hole. He jumps over and over, grunting with effort.

           Marcus sits on the grass and watches his friend flail. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Kev.

           Kevin jumps and grunts.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Kevin, stop. Stop!

           Marcus stands up.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Stop fucking doing this!

           Kevin stops. He tries to step off the pile and stumbles, 
           falling sideways. Marcus tries to catch him and they both 
           fall together, embracing.
           After a moment, Kevin calms and lies still. Marcus holds him, 
           big spoon to little spoon.

           The pile of plant and hole is a dark smear in a darker yard.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        I have an idea.

           EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Kevin and Marcus stand over the pile of dead plants. Marcus 
           lifts a joint to his lips and lights it with a match.

           He throws the match on the pile of leaves dramatically. It 
           fizzles out.

           EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Marcus takes a swig of bad, though high-proof, booze. He 
           shakes his head and passes it to Kevin, who chugs it.  

           Marcus steals it back, then pours the remainder on the plant 
           pile. He lights a match and tosses it again. This time, 
           though slowly, it takes. 

           The two friends stand, staring at the blaze. Marcus throws 
           his arm around Kevin.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY

           In the soft morning light, Marcus snores on Voyager 
           shirtless. His hand is down his pants. He has black soot 
           smeared under either eye like football eyeblack.

           Kevin is curled on the floor beside him, sleeping in the 
           fetal position, twitching and clutching the bottle of booze. 

           They are surrounded by dirt and fragments of dead plant. 

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Kevin wakes up and Marcus is gone.

           He unfurls stiffly and smacks his dry, white-rimmed lips. He 
           looks down at the bottle and pushes it under the futon. 

           After a beat, he half rises and pulls himself up onto Voyager 
           with considerable effort.
           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - LATER

           A door slams and Kevin startles, opening an eye.

           The door to his and Tanya’s room is shut. He half-heartedly 
           lifts his head and peels open the other eye, then collapses 
           back down.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - LATER

           A shuffle as the bedroom door opens, and Tanya heaves herself 
           out with several items under both arms. 

           She uses one leg to push the coffee table towards the futon, 
           which stirs Kevin. He peers at her through one eye. 

           She heaves and stumbles her way across the living room, 
           dropping her stuff with a thud at the front door.

           She comes back and stares at Kevin, arms folded. He limply 
           looks up at her. Her eyes fill with tears.

                                 TANYA
                        I know you don’t love me. But you 
                        could at least try to like me, 
                        Watkins.

           Kevin peers at her. His dry, white lips open and close. He 
           curls around himself and sinks into Voyager. 

           Suddenly, Tanya pulls a blanket up over Kevin’s shoulders, 
           tucking him in tenderly. She kisses his head, a bit too hard.

           She leaves, then returns, smacking Kevin across the head a 
           few times. He recoils slightly, but mostly takes it.

           After a few awkward, noisy moments, Tanya leaves.

                                 KEVIN
                             (to us/Voyager)
                        I’m the biggest asshole alive.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Kevin sleeps under the blanket. Pots and pans are banging in 
           the kitchen. Kevin sniffs the air, which fills with smoke.

                                 MARCUS (O.S.)
                        Fuck!
           Kevin sits up, rubbing his eyes. The smoke alarm beeps. A 
           shirtless Marcus runs in the room with a tea towel. He waves 
           at the smoke alarm until it stops.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Morning sunshine!

                                 KEVIN
                        Hey. 

           Kevin sits up, rubbing his face.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        What are you cooking?

                                 MARCUS
                        Well, I was afraid the leftover 
                        weed would go bad, so I made 
                        cookies. But I burned them.

                                 KEVIN
                        Okay.

                                 MARCUS
                        But there was still some shake 
                        left, so I made a cake. Want a 
                        piece?

           Marcus holds up a little cube of green cake.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        I know better than anyone not to 
                        eat this cake. This cake is made 
                        with the weed we didn’t get right. 
                        The shake, the cuttings off of 
                        plants we grew a long time ago. 
                        Growing weed is delicate.

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. POT ROOM - DAY

           Amber, in her mask, stands over the plants cutting them 
           carefully. She places them in a sieve tray and gently shakes 
           them back and forth. The smallest bits fall through to a 
           bucket below. 

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        When we started we were constantly 
                        getting it wrong. Pick too fast and 
                        the high doesn’t stick. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KEVIN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Leave the plant too long, you get a 
                        dark, depressing high. The kind 
                        that obliterates you. 

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY (BACK TO SCENE)

           Kevin reaches for the green cube. He looks at it.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        This shake was that kind, I 
                        thought. Or at least, I hoped. 

           Kevin pops it in his mouth in one bite. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Uh, dude, I was going to suggest we 
                        share that.

           MONTAGE: 

           A woozy, fuzzy series of images and events from Kevin’s POV:

           --Marcus is running around and babbling, unheard, his feet 
           ripping up the carpet like dirt;

           --The carpet starts to sprout plant life, and the walls grow 
           long vines with threatening, tentacle-like tips;

           --Marcus is encircled by vines and disappears;

           --Kevin lies down on Voyager, wrapping his arms around 
           himself, and is swallowed by its mossiness;

           --He is thrown, upright, into a beautiful garden. 

           INT. GARDEN - DAY

           Kevin looks down and realizes he’s naked. All around him are 
           plants. As he looks closer he realizes they’re pot plants.

           He touches a leaf, and as he does, he gags. He opens his 
           mouth and pulls out a long human rib bone.

           A hand reaches out and grabs it. It’s Amber. She’s also 
           naked. She swallows the rib in one bite. She grabs the sides 
           of Kevin’s face, too hard.

           Kevin’s eyes roll back until the sockets are black holes, 
           through which we can see the starry night sky.
                                 AMBER
                        Go down on me.

           Kevin nods and kneels down. He looks at Amber’s pubic hair. 
           It’s mossy green, a miniature of the basement suite’s jungle.

           Kevin opens his mouth to approach the “jungle.” And —

           INT. MORGUE - DAY

           Kevin, half under a sheet, playing a corpse, masturbates. 
           He’s on set. He’s laughing, and his eyes are closed.

           The Detective and an actor playing a CORONER stand over him. 

                                 CORONER
                        He’s really going for it.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        I’ve never wanked high, is it good?

                                 CORONER
                        Oh yeah. Like sitting on your hand.

                                 DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                        I’m not even coming over there. Can 
                        someone call security?

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Marcus sits on Voyager. He stares at the TV. Kevin comes in 
           and flops down beside him.

                                 KEVIN
                        I got fired.

                                 MARCUS
                        Me too. (Beat) What’d you do?

                                 KEVIN
                        I masturbated on set.

                                 MARCUS
                        Damn. I’m surprised you didn’t get 
                        arrested.

                                 KEVIN
                        Oh, I did. 

           Kevin pulls up his sleeve, revealing a county bracelet.
                                 MARCUS
                        Damn. (Beat) I dropped hot oil on 
                        my foot.

                                 KEVIN
                        Ouch.

                                 MARCUS
                        It’s cool, I got cream for it.

           A beat.

                                 KEVIN
                        It’s Thursday, isn’t it?

                                 MARCUS
                        Yeah.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Thursday. Must See TV. 

           INT. GROCERY STORE - LATER

           Kevin and Marcus are grocery shopping. Marcus is babbling 
           about something excitedly, but Kevin isn’t listening.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        I’d started hating Thursdays like 
                        Garfield hates Mondays. Which is 
                        stupid, now that I think of it. 
                        Like, he’s a cat. He doesn’t have a 
                        day job. Why does a cat hate 
                        Mondays? Cats don’t even know what 
                        days are. 

           Marcus stops his inaudible babbling.

                                 MARCUS
                        But he’s, like, a talking cat. That 
                        means all bets are off.

           Marcus starts babbling inaudibly again.

                                 KEVIN
                        Which also doesn’t mean anything. 
                        (Beat) Thursdays. MarsNow days. 
                        Long days, then 7pm and everyone is 
                        watching. And I do mean everyone. 

           Kevin stops in front of rows of cereal: “Mars-Os! Real 
           pumpkin spice flavor!” On the box, Amber and Adam’s faces 
           over an orange circle. Like if Cheerios were neon.
           Kevin looks away. But everywhere he looks is MarsNow: branded 
           orange juice, headbands with the insignia, protein shakes. 
           Amber’s face, assaulting him from all angles.

           He shakes his head. Marcus throws a cereal box in the cart. 
           Kevin looks at him.

                                 MARCUS
                        What?

           INT. GROCERY STORE CHECK OUT - MOMENTS LATER

           Kevin loads items from the cart onto the checkout. He eyes a 
           magazine on the stand with Amber and Adam on the cover. The 
           sub-headline reads “Amber’s Earth friends speak out!”

           Kevin considers this. He puts the magazine on the belt.

                                 CASHIER
                        Oh my god. Aren’t they amazing? You 
                        know, she used to shop here.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah, I know.

                                 CASHIER
                        She was with a different guy then.

           Marcus looks at both Kevin and the Cashier. He grins.

                                 MARCUS
                        What did you think about the other 
                        guy?

           The Cashier really considers this. She stares off into space, 
           sort of through Kevin.

                                 CASHIER
                        Y’know, I don’t remember him. Kind 
                        of a nothing face.

           Marcus snickers. Kevin’s shoulders drop. 

                                 CASHIER (V.O.)
                        Sixty-four seventeen, please.

           The Cashier smiles. Marcus hands over a stack of ones.

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER 

           Kevin unloads groceries. He fishes in his pocket for some 
           change and drops it in a coffee can labelled “Weed $$$”. 
           He looks in the can. It’s pretty empty.

           The magazine he bought is flipped open on the counter. He 
           reads it while he unpacks.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                             (reading)
                        ...Amber’s life on earth was very 
                        different, according to friends 
                        back home. She was a temp, and she 
                        lived in a basement apartment with 
                        a long term boyfriend. A friend, 
                        who asked to remain anonymous, said 
                        Amber “had some hobbies that might 
                        surprise people.” When pressed, the 
                        source said he couldn’t say, but 
                        that Amber’s ability to grow plants 
                        hydroponically was “interesting, 
                        right?” That same friend said he 
                        was happy for Amber, because she 
                        “always seemed sad, and she likes 
                        being important.” The source, who 
                        has known Amber since high school, 
                        asked if there were dogs on Mars. 

           Kevin flips the magazine shut.

                                 MARCUS (O.S.)
                        We should get a big TV. Then I can 
                        put the smaller TV in my room.

           Marcus enters the kitchen. Kevin doesn’t turn to look at him.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        You making mac and cheese?

           Kevin holds up the magazine. Marcus looks at it.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit.

                                 KEVIN
                        What the fuck, man?

                                 MARCUS
                        They said I could be anonymous. And 
                        they paid me $800. 

                                 KEVIN
                        What were you thinking? Why did you 
                        think you had the right? 

           Kevin grabs Marcus and pushes him up against the kitchen 
           counter. He gets in his face.
                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        To talk about her. To talk about 
                        us, at all? to mention me. To fuck 
                        with me in public, to flirt with 
                        Tanya like I don’t exist? To treat 
                        all of this shit like a game, 
                        Marcus. It’s not a game. She’s the 
                        love of my fucking life.

           Kevin lets him go. Marcus recovers.

                                 MARCUS
                        Yeah, I know man. Twelve years is a 
                        long time to watch your best friend 
                        be with the wrong woman.

                                 KEVIN
                        What?

                                 MARCUS
                        You know what. You put her on such 
                        a high pedestal she had to go to 
                        fucking space to get away from you. 
                        Why’d you stay with her, man?

           Kevin pushes Marcus against the counter again, with more 
           force this time. Marcus pushes back, and Kevin slams him 
           back, bashing Marcus’s head against the cupboard.

           Marcus swings and hits Kevin in the mouth. His lip splits. 
           Marcus stares at him, wild eyed and breathing heavily.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Tanya was cool, by the way, and she 
                        liked you, and you really fucked 
                        with her. Prick.

           Marcus turns and leaves the kitchen, going into his room. We 
           hear the door SLAM.

           Kevin lingers a moment, looking down at the magazine, his lip 
           dripping blood. He picks the magazine up and tears at it. 

           After a beat, he grabs the can of money and leaves.

           INT. MR FATTYS - NIGHT

           Kevin and his can of money eat several burgers, alone. A 
           LITTLE GIRL sitting nearby plays with a Barbie-like doll in a 
           MarsNow uniform with a tight braid. 

           The Little Girl makes space noises and makes the doll do 
           flips. Kevin stares at her.
           The Little Girl sees him staring and looks back at him, 
           quizzically. The girl’s MOM notices and looks over at Kevin.

                                 GIRL’S MOM
                             (overly showy)
                        Okay, well we’d better get going, 
                        don’t want to miss the show.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Yay! Amber show!

           The Mom rushes the Little Girl towards the door.

                                 LITTLE GIRL (CONT’D)
                             (to Kevin)
                        Bye!

                                 GIRL’S MOM
                        Don’t talk to him, honey. He’s a 
                        stranger.

           They leave. The Little Girl rubs the Amber doll against the 
           window directly past Kevin as she goes.

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Kevin trudges down the street with his only friend, the can 
           of money. They pass a dive bar. Kevin enters.

           INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Kevin enters the bar, and it matches his mood: Downbeat, 
           dark, quiet. There are TVs on the walls but they are off.

           Kevin sits at the bar with his can. A BARTENDER approaches.

                                 BARTENDER
                        What can I getcha?

                                 KEVIN
                        A beer. 

           The bartender walks off. Kevin looks in the can.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        Uh, and a shot of whiskey. One for 
                        you, too.

           The Bartender gives Kevin the “hang ten” hands. In a moment, 
           she returns with a beer and a shot for each of them. They 
           cheers, then drink.
                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        Thanks. I needed that.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Yeah?

                                 KEVIN
                        I, uh — I’m having a bad day.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Looks like.

           She gestures to his split lip, and hands him a napkin.

                                 PATRON (O.S.)
                        Hey, Linds, it’s almost seven!

           The Bartender checks her watch. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Shit! You’re right.

           She picks up a remote and turns all of the TVs on in quick 
           succession. As she does, the MarsNow credits start on all of 
           them. The scattered PATRONS cheer and whoop, perking up.

           Kevin lowers his head, ruefully. The Bartender returns.

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, what were you saying?

                                 KEVIN
                        Nothing, I’m cool. Can I get 
                        another shot, though?

                                 BARTENDER
                        For sure.

           The Bartender distractedly pours while watching the credits.

           INT. DIVE BAR - LATER

           Kevin drinks another shot. He’s drunk. The rest of the bar, 
           fuller now, is watching the show. Kevin tries not to.

           INTERCUT: Bar/Show.

           On TV, Amber is picking and eating tomatoes. She looks a 
           little drawn and tired. She shakes her head at the taste.

                                 AMBER
                        Mars tomatoes. Not great. I think I 
                        need to adjust the pH of the soil.
           She picks up a little jar of something, and opens it to 
           sniff. Suddenly, she doubles over in pain.

           As she does, she turns her back to the camera nearest her, 
           and we can see a spot of red spreading across the seat of her 
           suit. Kevin sits upright.

           The Bartender puts her hand over her mouth.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Adam!

           The camera flips to Adam. When he hears Amber, he leaps up 
           and runs, just like when she dislocated her shoulder. 

           The bar is silent as a tomb. Kevin stands. He grips his beer.

           Adam reaches Amber and sees her on her knees. He gently picks 
           her up and helps her through the hallway. She pauses in pain 
           again. He guides her through to the medical room.

           He helps her onto the table, then closes the curtain, 
           blocking the camera’s view for a moment. 

           We can hear Amber moaning and crying in pain.

           The bar is still silent.

                                 PATRON
                        I don’t feel like we should be 
                        watching this.

                                 PATRON #2
                        Shh. Shut up.

           The first Patron grabs their coat and leaves the bar. Kevin 
           watches them go.

           Adam opens the curtain, revealing Amber in a gown and under a 
           sheet, her feet in stirrups. She’s breathing hard and crying.

           Adam looks up under the sheet.

                                 AMBER
                        Adam, Adam. Help!

                                 ADAM
                        Shhh, shh. It’s okay, love.

           Adam goes to her for a moment, kisses her head. The camera 
           zooms in to catch it.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        You’re in labor, Amber. 
                                 AMBER
                        It’s too early. 

                                 ADAM
                        No, it’s okay. You’re going to be 
                        okay. The baby’s going to be okay.

           She groans. Adam runs to her, looking under the sheet.

                                 ADAM (CONT’D)
                        This baby is coming. Now.

                                 AMBER
                        What? How?

                                 ADAM
                        I don’t know, but focus, love. 
                        Breathe.

           Suddenly, a picture-in-picture appears in the bottom right 
           corner of the screen. In it is Amber’s parents. We’re 
           watching them watch her give birth.

                                 PATRON #2 
                        Who is that?

                           KEVIN
                                                        BARTENDER
           Her parents.
                                              Her family.

                                 PATRON #2
                        Whoa, really? Damn.

           Amber’s mother and father watch. The picture flips for a 
           moment and we see them full-screen. Amber’s scary dad looks 
           very afraid. Kevin’s never seen that before.

                                 KEVIN
                        He’s scared.

           The picture flips back as Amber screams, one long primal 
           sound. Amniotic fluid splashes the floor and Adam’s feet as 
           he lifts a tiny infant out from behind the sheet and onto 
           Amber’s chest. He joins her.

           The baby is quiet.

                                 ADAM
                             (quietly)
                        It’s a girl.

                                 AMBER
                        She’s amazing. Wake up, baby girl.

           Amber strokes the baby’s face.
                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Adam?

           Adam looks worried. Suddenly, the baby stirs and emits a 
           little cough, then a long, loud wail.

           Amber and Adam react, joyful. Her parents leap up in joy.

           The bar cheers. The Bartender bursts into tears. Kevin can’t 
           help it, he’s cheering too. People are hugging. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Drinks on me!

           Another cheer. Kevin reaches for his can, but it’s not there.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!

                                 BARTENDER (O.S.)
                        Looking for this?

           She holds up the can of money, shaking it.

                                 KEVIN
                        I almost had a heart attack.

                                 BARTENDER
                        People have slippery fingers around 
                        here. Watch yourself. Also, it’s 
                        called a wallet. (Beat) And anyway, 
                        I’ve got this round.

           She pours out a line of shots. People raise them in unison. 

           On screen, Adam is cutting the cord.

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        To Amber and Adam’s baby!

           They all cheers. Kevin smiles, but the moment is fading for 
           him. He takes the shot, then goes to leave.

           Suddenly, outside a crack of thunder and flash of lightning 
           as it starts to rain.

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        Guess you’ll have to stick around.

           She slides him another shot.

                                                             FLASHBACK:
           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Rain falls outside. Kids sit at desks and swing their legs. 
           The solar system, Bill Clinton, and Al Gore, watch over them.

                                 TEACHER
                        Each of you will have a summer pen 
                        pal. You’ll exchange addresses and 
                        write one another letters.

           A few drips of water land on Little Kevin’s desk. He looks up 
           at the ceiling and sees a water-stain face. 

                                 TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        I’m passing out different colored 
                        paper right now. You need to find 
                        the person with the same color as 
                        you. That’s your pen pal.

           The teacher drops an orange paper circle on Kevin’s now-dry 
           desk. He picks it up and looks at it, then puts it down.

           Amber appears. She holds an orange circle. She smiles.

           The light of the scene flickers, glitches. Suddenly, “Ghost 
           Amber,” thin and pale, appears behind Little Amber. She puts 
           a skeletal hand on Little Amber’s shoulder.

                                                         END FLASHBACK.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Kevin jerks awake on Voyager. He’s in his underwear. He 
           touches his aching head.

           The door to Marcus’s room is still closed.

           The Bartender from the previous night tiptoes out of the 
           bathroom in last night’s clothes. She sees Kevin and smiles.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Thanks for a fun night.

                                 KEVIN
                        You too.

                                 BARTENDER
                        See you sometime?

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah. 
                                 BARTENDER
                        Cool, you know where to find me.

                                 KEVIN
                        Thanks.

           She slides her shoes halfway on and leaves.

                                 MARCUS (O.S.)
                        And just like that, the boy becomes 
                        a man.

           Kevin looks up. Marcus is standing in his bedroom doorway.

                                 KEVIN
                        Hey.

                                 MARCUS
                        Congratulations on your third ever 
                        sexual partner. Slow down, ya slut!

           Kevin laughs and touches his sore lip.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Sorry I hit you. But not sorry cuz 
                        you were being a prick.

                                 KEVIN
                        I know. Sorry, man.

                                 MARCUS
                        I’m not over it yet. 

           Kevin nods. They exist in silence for a moment.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Amber had her baby.

                                 KEVIN
                        I know, I saw it.

                                 MARCUS 
                        Pretty cool, right?

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah, it was.

                                 MARCUS
                        You know what else is cool?

           Marcus leaps up and goes into his bedroom, then drags a giant 
           box out of it. It’s a big TV.
                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Ta-da!

                                 KEVIN
                        Oh, man. Marcus. I kind of spent 
                        all our money last night.

                                 MARCUS
                        I know. Luckily your friend Marcus 
                        has a credit card.

                                 KEVIN
                        You do? 

                                 MARCUS
                        I do. Joke’s on them, I’m never 
                        paying it off. Capitalism, baby!

           Kevin laughs and lays back down. He coughs.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Oh no! The man is fading! We need 
                        Pedialyte and Sprite, stat!

                                 KEVIN
                        Oh yeah, would you?

                                 MARCUS
                        Nope! Still mad at you.

           Marcus goes into his room and shuts the door. After a moment, 
           loud punk rock music starts. Kevin rolls over into the futon. 

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. LITTLE KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Little Kevin looks at a new envelope, addressed as before. He 
           opens the letter. His lips move as Little Amber says:

                                 LITTLE AMBER (V.O.)
                        Dear Kevin. I landed a backflip 
                        yesterday which is a big deal. 
                        (Beat) Dear Kevin. The food here is 
                        pretty good. I eat pancakes every 
                        day. (Beat) Dear Kevin. I learned 
                        how to ride a horse. (Beat) I can’t 
                        wait for school to start again. I 
                        miss home. (Beat) How is your 
                        summer? PS: Rachel is my best 
                        friend now. PPS: You never write 
                        back. Are you dead? Ha ha.
           Little Kevin tapes the letters on his wall, all in a row.

           INT. KEVIN’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT

           KEVIN’S MOM tucks him in to bed. She looks up at all of the 
           letters on the wall. A look of concern crosses her face.

                                 KEVIN’S MOM
                        That’s a lot of letters, Tater.

                                 LITTLE KEVIN
                        Yeah, Amber wrote them to me.

                                 KEVIN’S MOM
                        That’s nice. Did you write to her?

                                 LITTLE KEVIN
                        Um. No. Not yet.

                                 KEVIN’S MOM
                        Summer’s almost over. You have to 
                        do something, Tater.

           A momentary glitch. The lights in the room flicker. Behind 
           Kevin’s mom’s head is the papier-mâché solar system. 

                                 KEVIN’S MOM (CONT’D)
                        Pretty soon it’ll be too late.

           Kevin’s mom flickers. She turns into “Ghost Amber.” She bends 
           over to kiss Little Kevin goodnight, her mouth a black hole.

           Little Kevin flinches and tries to get away.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Kevin snaps to, on the couch. Marcus is assembling the new 
           giant TV, sitting on the floor. 

                                 MARCUS
                        There he is!

                                 KEVIN
                        I need to talk to Amber.

                                 MARCUS
                        You already tried, dude. Remember?

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah, I know.

           They sit for a minute. Marcus suddenly leaps up.
                                 MARCUS
                        Oh shit!

                                 KEVIN
                        What? Yeah?

                                 MARCUS
                        Yeah, the writer I talked to. 
                        Sorry. But like, she was saying she 
                        was going to visit the place where 
                        the prick guy is. The command 
                        center or whatever. The place you 
                        tried to go to.

                                 KEVIN
                        Really?

                                 MARCUS
                        Yeah. Those guys can talk to her, 
                        right? Maybe you could go, too? 

                                 KEVIN
                        Marcus. You’re brilliant.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Marcus isn’t dumb at all. He’s my 
                        best and smartest friend.

           Marcus goes to lift the old TV off its stand and hits himself 
           in the dick, then drops the TV on his foot. He yelps.

           INT. SUV - DAY

           Kevin, Marcus, PENNY (the Journalist), and two serious 
           HANDLERS sit quietly in the spacious backseats of a luxury 
           SUV. There’s a divider between them and the front. 

           It’s unusually dark; the windows are blacked out. Marcus 
           tries to press the button to roll a window down.  

                                 HANDLER #1
                        You can’t do that, sir.

                                 MARCUS
                        Okay. But advanced warning I get 
                        car sick sometimes. Why are the 
                        windows black?

                                 HANDLER #2
                        Because the location of the command 
                        center is top secret.
                                 MARCUS
                        Cool. But my friend found it 
                        already.

                                 HANDLER #1
                        No, he found the launch site. The 
                        command center is top secret.

           Marcus tries the window again.

                                 HANDLER #1 (CONT’D)
                        Sir.

                                 MARCUS
                        What if I need to barf?

           Handler #2 produces a small white airsick bag. Marcus takes 
           it. It’s branded with the “MarsNow” insignia.

           Penny studies Kevin and intermittently takes notes in a 
           notebook. Kevin eyes her warily.

                                 PENNY
                        You nervous?

                                 KEVIN
                        Um. Yeah. Yes.

           Penny looks at him, her pen poised.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        Yes, I am nervous.

           She doesn’t write it down. A moment passes.

                                 PENNY
                        When’s the last time you saw Amber? 
                        Like, in person.

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Amber in her sling laughs and smokes weed in slo-mo, from 
           Kevin’s POV. They kiss, he pulls her shirt off.

           She slides under him and smiles at him from below, then 
           closes her eyes. Through his eyes we see her face, moving up 
           and down — they’re having sex. 

                                 KEVIN
                        It was when she hurt her shoulder. 
                        She came home for a couple of days.
                                 PENNY
                        And that’s when you broke up?

           Her face is calm and beautiful, but distant.

                                                         END FLASHBACK.

           INT. SUV - SAME (BACK TO SCENE)

           Marcus snorts. Kevin shoots him a look. Penny takes it in.

                                 PENNY
                        Oh my god. You never broke up.

           Penny smiles at her scoop. She scribbles furiously. Kevin 
           shoots Marcus a look. Marcus shrugs. The SUV hits a bump. 
           Marcus throws up into the MarsNow barf bag.

           INT. MARSNOW CONTROL ROOM - DAY 

           The control room is bustling. The Handlers lead Kevin, 
           Marcus, and Penny in. The Host is leaning over a female 
           EMPLOYEE, his hands on her shoulders. She smiles tightly.

                                 MARCUS
                             (whispering)
                        Prick Alert, one o’clock.

           Handler #1 taps the Host on the shoulder. He shoots the 
           Handler a look, then sees his guests. He switches modes.

                                 HOST
                        Hello. You must be the journalist, 
                        and you two must be the Ex and the 
                        Friend. (Beat, to Kevin) If only 
                        I’d known you were trying to get to 
                        us before. Would have made a great 
                        B-story on those first few episodes 
                        this season. Follow me.

           They all nod assent and follow, Penny in the rear.

           As she passes the female employee, she hands the woman her 
           business card.

           INT. MARSNOW CONTROL ROOM - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           The Host is finishing a tour. Kevin’s watching but not 
           watching. He can’t help but glance over at the giant central 
           screen, where Amber and Adam are sleeping in a darkened room. 
           Beside them is a smaller bassinet-like bed for their baby.

                                 HOST
                        And here’s the nerve center. The 
                        Captain’s chair. This is a direct 
                        line to Amber and Adam. I don’t use 
                        it much. We want them to feel 
                        authentic. We want the audience to 
                        watch them without thinking about 
                        me watching them. Even though I am 
                        a pretty interesting person.

           The Host waits for them to laugh as his dutiful employees 
           would. They don’t, because they don’t have to. He turns away.

                                 MARCUS
                             (fake coughing)
                        Prick.

           The Host gives Marcus a sidelong glance. Marcus smiles.

           Penny takes notes. On a far screen, there are three line 
           graphs, formerly plateaued but high, now all on a steady 
           decline. Penny gestures to it.

                                 PENNY
                        What’s that?

                                 HOST
                        It’s nothing. Some simple 
                        calculations.

           The Host leans over to a nearby Engineer and whispers.

           Suddenly, that monitor goes black. The Host smiles at Penny. 
           She smiles back. When he turns his back, she frowns.

           Marcus looks at her notes. She’s written: Host = Prick. 
           Marcus snorts. Penny hides her notebook from him.

                                 HOST (CONT’D)
                        Try it out, Keith.

                                 KEVIN
                        Kevin.

                                 HOST
                        Yes. Hop in.

           Kevin gets in the Captain’s chair and swivels around. An 
           Engineer approaches the Host, who turns away. There’s a set 
           of headphones to one side. Kevin puts the headphones on.
           He turns a dial and hears three distinct, irregular 
           heartbeats. It’s like what he used to hear, only fainter, 
           less rhythmic.

           He looks up, concerned, but Penny watches the Engineer pit 
           and takes notes. Marcus pops up beside him.

                                 MARCUS
                             (Bad Scottish accent)
                        What’s that Captain? Fire the 
                        photon torpedoes? Aye!

           Marcus reaches for a dial, and the Host grabs his wrist and 
           yanks it away. Kevin scoops the headphones off.

                                 HOST
                             (under his breath)
                        I am a prick. I’m a rich prick. 
                        Stop horsing around or I will 
                        remove you.

           Penny turns. The Host smiles at her. Marcus rubs his wrist.

           Suddenly, there’s a series of soft, musical tones.

                                 ENGINEER (O.S.)
                             (over the P.A.)
                        Morning sequence commencing.

                                 HOST
                        Yes. Here we are. Time to wake up.

           Amber stirs, turning slowly in her bed. She sits up. She 
           coughs a few times, then looks at her palm. Something’s not 
           right.

                                 KEVIN
                        Is she sick?

           He’s ignored. Amber looks at the baby. She picks her up, and 
           the baby cries. She rocks the baby and hums softly.

                                 AMBER
                        We’re too far, aren’t we little 
                        one? Too far from home.

           Kevin watches Amber rock the baby. She kisses the baby on the 
           head. She hums. 

                                 HOST
                        The audience loves this. When we’re 
                        editing the show, we focus on the 
                        human stuff. This stuff.
           Adam stirs, too, and gets up. He’s also a bit shaky, though 
           not as much. He kisses Amber on the head. She folds into him.

                                 AMBER
                             (to the baby)
                        I’m sorry you were born up here. 

                                 HOST
                        This we would put music over. Some 
                        thoughts are private. Right?

           He looks to Penny. She smiles tightly, again. She scribbles.

                                 HOST (CONT’D)
                        How about lunch?

           The three look at each other. Hesitant.

                                 HOST (CONT’D)
                        It will take them a few hours to 
                        get going. Don’t worry.

           They walk towards an exit, flanked by the handlers. The Host 
           leans down to an Engineer and whispers something. 

           Kevin takes up the rear. He slows a half-step. As the doors 
           to the room close behind him, he sees Amber coughing again. 

           She sits down on the bed, shakily. He tries to stay, but the 
           doors close heavy behind him. 

           INT. MARSNOW CAFETERIA - LATER

           Kevin, Marcus, and Penny sit with lunch trays. Marcus eats a 
           giant piece of meatloaf voraciously, chugging milk between. 

           Kevin broods, arms crossed, in front of uneaten sandwich. 
           Penny sips soup and watches Kevin.

                                 MARCUS
                        This reminds me of high school. 

           Marcus surveys the room full of engineers.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        But with more nerds.

                                 PENNY
                             (to Kevin)
                        What are you thinking about?

                                 KEVIN
                        Nothing.
                                 PENNY
                        Help me out. I got you here. You’re 
                        going to talk to her. Give me 
                        something.

           Kevin tries, but he just shakes his head.

                                 PENNY (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Pretend I’m you. If I am, 
                        this is what I’m thinking, okay? 
                        I’m thinking that my ex — not even 
                        ex — girlfriend is on Mars and 
                        she’s not coming back. I have maybe 
                        five minutes to say something to 
                        her. What am I going to say? I 
                        could say, “I miss you.” I could 
                        say “Fuck you.” I could say, 
                        “What’s it like up there?” I say?

                                 KEVIN
                        “Are you okay?”

                                 PENNY
                        Yeah. Why?

                                 KEVIN
                        Because I think she’s not.

                                 PENNY
                        Yes. Why?

                                 KEVIN
                        Because...I’ve never seen her need 
                        someone like she seems to need him. 
                        Except once. In high school. When 
                        she needed me.

           Marcus and Penny shoot each other a glance.

           Suddenly, the handlers appear, as if out of nowhere. Penny 
           and Kevin get up. Marcus shovels a last mouthful and follows.

           INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           They follow the Handlers down a long corridor. Suddenly, the 
           hallway lights flash red, and a long alarm tone sounds. 

           The Handlers start to run. They burst into the control room. 
           Kevin, Marcus, and Penny run after them.
           INT. MARSNOW CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The room is in chaos.

                                 PENNY
                        Chaos is good for us. Stay with me.

                                 MARCUS
                        Whoa. This is like Star Wars.

           Marcus makes a Chewbacca-like noise. Penny and Kevin run down 
           the side of the room. Marcus shoots a fake blaster, making 
           sounds with his mouth. He follows.

           They stop behind a crowd of engineers. Kevin looks up. 

           On screen, Adam is standing near a door labelled “Airlock 
           Passage.” He’s looking into it.

                                 HOST (O.S.)
                             (over the PA, loudly)
                        I want a closeup. On her!

           Kevin turns to a nearby Engineer.

                                 KEVIN
                        What’s going on?

                                 ENGINEER
                        She locked herself in the airlock 
                        with his medical bag. And the kid. 

           The angle changes several times, looking for a good shot.

           INT. MARSNOW LIVING SPACE - CONTINUOUS

           POV of a Wall-E like Rover camera as it comes up beside 
           Amber. She’s inside the airlock passage with her baby in a 
           bassinet and a black bag. She’s holding gardening scissors.

           Amber notices the camera and starts hitting and stabbing it, 
           violently. The angle changes to a CCTV-like overhead camera 
           as Amber destroys the Rover.

           INT. MARSNOW CONTROL ROOM - SAME

                                 KEVIN
                             (whispers)
                        Get it, Slammer. Fuck it up.

           INTERCUT: CONTROL ROOM/LIVING SPACE.
           Amber grunts and screams as she destroys the Rover. Adam’s 
           face is visible through the airlock window.

                                 ADAM
                        Amber, be reasonable. We can figure 
                        this out together.

                                 AMBER
                        There isn’t enough! They did this 
                        on purpose. There’s only a big 
                        enough dose for me and Deanne.

                                 MARCUS
                        Deanne?

                                 KEVIN
                        It’s her mom’s name.

                                 MARCUS
                        Oh yeah, her mom.

           Marcus makes a “big boob” gesture.

           Amber looks up at the camera. Her face is crazed. She sticks 
           her hand in her mouth and pulls out a tooth. She shows her 
           black and bloody gums, and spits blood on the camera lens.

                                 MARCUS (CONT’D)
                        Whoa. Gnarly.

                                 KEVIN
                        Isolation insanity.

           Penny writes furiously. 

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        Amber, please. I can help you both. 
                        We can all take the medication.

                                 AMBER
                        You’re not sick yet! You’re fine. 
                        Stay away. I trusted you. You made 
                        us sick.

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        It’s not me, darling. It’s the 
                        radiation. 

                                 AMBER
                        Don’t call me darling. You don’t 
                        know me, at all.

                      AMBER (CONT’D)
                                                          KEVIN
           I hate the word “darling.”
                                              She hates the word darling.
           Adam tries to open the airlock. Amber stabs at the window 
           with her gardening scissors. She starts crying. She sinks 
           down and pulls the bassinet closer.

                                 HOST (O.S.)
                             (over the PA)
                        Follow them. Stay with them.

           Penny looks up from her scribbling for a moment. Marcus is 
           watching, rapt. Kevin’s nowhere to be found.

                                 KEVIN (O.S.)
                        Hey, Slammer? 

           INT. MARSNOW CONTROL ROOM - SAME

           Heads turn towards the Captain’s chair, which the Host has 
           ceded to Kevin. The look on the Host’s face says he’s 
           smelling ratings. He makes a “Go on,” gesture to Kevin.

           Kevin wears headphones and leans forward to talk into a 
           console microphone.

           Penny and Marcus watch from across the room.

                                 KEVIN
                        Uh, hi. I just, um, I just wanted 
                        to talk to you again. To tell you 
                        that I’m, uh, that I’ve always 
                        loved you. And I always will. 

           Amber looks up, as if to God. She smiles.

           INTERCUT: CONTROL ROOM/LIVING SPACE.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        And I guess also that I understand. 
                        Why you left. That it must have 
                        been hard. Or maybe it wasn’t, and 
                        that’s okay, too. (Beat) This 
                        sucks. Even my goodbye sucks. I’m — 
                        I suck. I’m like a bacteria or 
                        something, growing on you. Or like, 
                        a mushroom. I’m a fucking shit-
                        growing mushroom. You deserve 
                        happiness. You deserve Adam. You 
                        should let him help you. I want you 
                        to get better. That’s it, I guess.

           The Host tries to take the mic away from Kevin. He’s 
           disappointed with how this went.
                                 HOST
                        Okay. You did it.

           Kevin wrestles it back.

                                 KEVIN
                        Actually, no. That’s not it. The 
                        timing sucks but what I really want 
                        to say is: I’m breaking up with 
                        you. I’m — we’re breaking up. We’re 
                        broken up. 

           The Host grabs for the mic again.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        Sorry Slammer I Love You Get Better 
                        Goodbye.

           Adam looks around him, taking everything in. 

                                 ADAM
                        Who is talking? What’s going on?

           Kevin goes to say something, but the Host grabs the mic away.

                                 HOST
                        Cut the mic feed.

                                 KEVIN
                        No, someone should tell him. 
                        Someone should explain.

                                 ADAM
                        Hello? Who’s there?

           The camera flips to Amber, who still looks up, smiling as if 
           she’s been blessed. Her face is enormous, shiny, bloody. 

           Kevin stands looking up at the screen, a small black dwarf 
           star orbiting her giant, bloody face like its the sun.

           He looks at her, searching for a sign she heard. Her eyes 
           flick open.

                                 AMBER
                        We’re all alone. There are stars on 
                        the ceiling. This is our chance.

           Amber takes her baby in her arms and rocks.

           The Host gestures to the Handlers, who surround Kevin and 
           escort him towards the door. Penny and Marcus follow.
           Kevin fights to stay as much as he can. He looks back at 
           Amber on the screen. The orbit is broken. The doors close.

           INT. SUV - LATER

           Kevin, Marcus, and Penny ride in silence.

                                 PENNY
                        I’m not going to write about your 
                        speech. If it makes you feel 
                        better.

                                 KEVIN
                        Okay. (Beat) Why not?

                                 PENNY
                        I think there’s a lot of great 
                        stuff without it.

                                 MARCUS
                        She’s trying to tell you it sucked.

           Penny shoots Marcus a look. He shrugs.

                                 KEVIN
                        It did suck, didn’t it?

                                 PENNY
                        No. I mean, kind of. Did you think 
                        about what you were going to say 
                        ahead of time? At all?

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah. I did. But I chickened out. 

                                 PENNY
                        What were you going to say?

                                 KEVIN
                        I was going to talk about our first 
                        kiss. I should have but all those 
                        people were there. 

                                 MARCUS
                        This is a good story. I’m in it.

                                 PENNY
                        Tell me. 

           Kevin looks at Penny, then at Marcus.

                                                             FLASHBACK:
           INT. THE KIVINENS HOUSE - NIGHT

           Teenage Kevin walks down the hallway alone. He looks at 
           family photos of Amber through the ages, including her at 
           gymnastics camp with her arm around two other little girls.

           We’ve seen these pictures. They were all used on the show.

           Loud music blares from the other room. Teenage Kevin comes 
           around the corner to a full-on high school party.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        We grew up in Minnesota. The winter 
                        after Amber hurt herself it was 
                        minus-20 every day. We partied 
                        inside a lot.

           A bunch of TEENS are hanging out in the living room, 
           listening to music, drinking, and smoking weed. No Amber.

           Teenage Kevin winds through them, ignored, and into —

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The tidy kitchen, with many Jesuses on display. Teenage 
           Marcus is giggling with a TEENAGE GIRL, trying to heat hash 
           on a knife over the hot stove element.

                                 TEENAGE MARCUS
                        Hey man, is this how you do a hot 
                        knife?

           Teenage Kevin shrugs. Teenage Marcus yelps and drops the hot 
           knife. The girl giggles and jumps out of the way.

           A sliding screen door opens from the freezing outside. 
           Teenage Amber leans in, steam around her red, beautiful face.

           Teenage Kevin just stares, his mouth open. Teenage Amber’s 
           head turns, she looks right at him.

                                 TEENAGE AMBER
                        Hey. Kevin. Kevin Who Smells My 
                        Mom’s Lotion.

                                 TEENAGE MARCUS
                        Dude. Haha. What?

           Teenage Marcus and the girl watch them like an audience. 
           Teenage Kevin tries to ignore them.

                                 TEENAGE KEVIN
                        Uh, yeah.
                                 TEENAGE AMBER
                        Can you pass me that?

           She points at a boiling kettle. It begins to whistle.

                                 TEENAGE KEVIN
                        Oh, yeah. Sure. 

           Teenage Kevin grabs the kettle. Teenage Marcus is giving him 
           goofy, thumbs up, “Get it” type gestures. 

           EXT. DECK - MOMENTS LATER

           Teenage Kevin opens the deck door and comes outside. He 
           closes the door and the winter swallows them. It’s so quiet.

           Teenage Amber, alone, is smoking a joint. She coughs. She’s 
           underdressed, and shivers as she puts the joint out. 

           She hugs herself tighter. Her arm is in a sling.  

           Teenage Kevin hands her the kettle, then takes his hoodie off 
           to give it to her. 

                                 TEENAGE AMBER
                        Thanks. You’re a gentleman.

                                 TEENAGE KEVIN
                        Ha. Yeah. I try.

           There’s an awkward moment while they negotiate kettle and 
           hoodie. She puts the oversized hoodie on over her bad 
           shoulder and takes the kettle from him. 

                                 TEENAGE AMBER
                        Wanna see something cool?

           She swings her arm back, smiling, and tosses boiling water 
           into the frigid air. It instantly turns to steam. 

           Teenage Kevin is genuinely amazed.

                                 TEENAGE KEVIN
                        Holy shit.

                                 TEENAGE AMBER
                        Right? My dad showed me. It’s my 
                        favorite thing about winter. They 
                        do it in Finland cuz there’s 
                        nothing else to do but fish. And 
                        murder people.
                                 TEENAGE KEVIN
                        That’s magic.

                                 TEENAGE AMBER
                        It’s science, but yeah. Pretty 
                        magic. Tres magique. (Beat) Sorry, 
                        I’m really stoned.

                                 TEENAGE KEVIN
                        Yeah. Me too. 

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        This was it. Our first kiss.

           Teenage Amber shivers for a moment in the cold. Teenage Kevin 
           leans in and envelops her in a tender bear hug. It works. 

           Their breaths rise. He kisses her, his eyes closed. It’s 
           brief but sweet.

           They look at each other, still wrapped in a bear hug.

                                 TEENAGE KEVIN
                        You wanna go inside?

                                 TEENAGE AMBER
                        Not yet.

           Teenage Kevin kisses her again, a little better this time. 
           They breathe hot steam in each other’s faces.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Not yet. Steam in winter. Magic.

           A sudden THUD breaks the tension. It’s Teenage Marcus, 
           pressing his mouth against the glass from inside.

                                                         END FLASHBACK.

           INT. SUV - NIGHT (BACK TO SCENE)

           A moment passes. Penny looks at Kevin. Tears shine in her 
           eyes. Kevin smiles and looks down. Marcus is asleep.

                                 PENNY
                        It is a good story. (Beat) Is that 
                        why you love her, that story?

                                 KEVIN
                        I don’t know why I love her. I just 
                        do. Then, before, after. Because 
                        she stayed outside with me? Maybe 
                        that’s all I needed.
                                 PENNY
                        And her? Why did she love you?

                                 KEVIN 
                        Maybe she didn’t. Maybe she just 
                        got used to me. I don’t care.

                                 PENNY
                        Well that is beautiful. And noble. 
                        And the dumbest thing I’ve ever 
                        heard.

           Penny smiles. She doesn’t mean it. Kevin smiles, too.

                                 PENNY (CONT’D)
                             (re: Marcus)
                        Poor guy’s tuckered out, huh?

           They laugh again, quietly.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Kevin and Marcus sit on the futon, eating mac and cheese. The 
           MarsNow theme starts. Kevin sits back and exhales. 

                                 KEVIN
                             (to us)
                        I’ll save us some time. 

           The scene fast forwards around Kevin, with Marcus speeding 
           up. On TV, too. Finally, we see Amber barricaded.

           The fast forwarding stops as Amber crouches in the airlock. 
           The show has cut around her crazier moments. 

                                 MARCUS
                        Here it is, your primetime debut.

           INT. MARSNOW LIVING SPACE - SAME

           There’s a cut to Adam on the other side of the door. 

                                 ADAM
                        Amber. I love you. I know we only 
                        met recently, but I feel like I’ve 
                        always loved you. And I always 
                        will. And I guess also that I 
                        understand. Why you’re sad. That it 
                        must have been hard to leave earth. 
                        But you deserve happiness. 

           INTERCUT: LIVING ROOM/SHOW.
                                 MARCUS
                        I’ve heard this before.

                                 KEVIN
                        That’s because I said all of this. 
                        Only I said it worse.

                                 MARCUS
                        Well you know, all reality shows 
                        are really scripted. And editing is 
                        it’s own form of storytelling.

                                 KEVIN
                        Shhh.

                                 ADAM
                        We deserve each other. You should 
                        let me help you. I want you to get 
                        better. That’s it.

           After a moment, Amber opens the airlock passage door and Adam 
           goes inside, picking her and the baby up. 

           He carries them into the bedroom and puts them into bed. He 
           kisses Amber’s head. Her face has been cleaned up, and she 
           has clearly been calmed down. Maybe drugged.

                                 AMBER
                             (weakly)
                        Thanks, Tater totter.

                                 ADAM
                        What’s that, darling?

                                 AMBER
                        It’s a nickname.

           A heart-tugging score rises as the sanitized little family 
           snuggles together, on Mars. 

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Back on damp, dank Voyager, Kevin cries. Big, messy sobs. All 
           the crying he ever needed to do, all at once.

           Marcus, shocked, shifts closer. He puts his arm around him.

                                 MARCUS 
                        I can’t believe that prick stole 
                        your speech. Billionaires, man. I 
                        wish we had some weed.
                                 KEVIN
                        I’m just going to go to bed.

           Kevin gets up. Marcus hugs his lower torso. There’s a pinging 
           sound. Marcus picks up his phone. 

                                 MARCUS
                        It’s Penny. The writer. She says 
                        “They’re all pricks. I am crafting 
                        an epic takedown.”

                                 KEVIN
                        You got her number?

           Marcus leans back on the futon, a smug look on his face. 
           Kevin smiles, in spite of himself. He starts away.

                                 MARCUS
                        I love you, man. You okay?

                                 KEVIN
                        Nah.

           INT. DEN/BEDROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Kevin wakes up in his bedroom, in bed. He lies there for a 
           moment, staring at the ceiling. 

                                 KEVIN
                             (to us)
                        I haven’t gotten up in 3 days 
                        except for, you know, biological 
                        reasons. But today I’m going to.

           He sits up and yanks the blinds string. Sunlight floods in.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kevin walks out into the living room. The sun shines in on 
           the futon, lighting it up. 

           Kevin goes to the thermometer. He turns it from 86 to 70.

           There’s a scraping sound at the door. Someone is shoving a 
           package through the mail slot. It falls. 

           Kevin picks it up. It reads “To: Kevin Watkins.” It has a 
           MarsNow logo on it. Kevin opens the door and looks out.
           EXT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Kevin looks up and down the street. He sees a black-windowed 
           car pull away. He runs after it briefly, then stops.

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Kevin settles in on Voyager and opens the package. It 
           contains a bubble-wrapped thumb drive and a note.

                                 FEMALE EMPLOYEE (V.O.)
                        Kevin. Amber wanted you to have 
                        this. I’m not supposed to send it 
                        to you, but fuck it. This place 
                        sucks so bad. They don’t even give 
                        us health insurance. I hope this 
                        gives you some peace.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Kevin sits down at the laptop. He opens it up and inserts the 
           thumb drive. He clicks the drive, which contains only one 
           file. Kevin hovers the mouse over it, then clicks.

           A video starts. It’s the MarsNow pod bedroom. The shot is 
           pointing at the bed. The frame adjusts, then Amber walks over 
           and sits down. She’s still pregnant. Healthy.

           She sits there for a moment, gathering herself. Kevin waits.

           INT. MARSNOW LIVING SPACE - SAME

           Amber adjusts, so she’s sitting comfortably. She sighs.

                                 AMBER
                        Hi Kev. Tater totter. If you’re 
                        getting this, that means things up 
                        here have gone south. The thing 
                        they told us, that we’re not 
                        supposed to tell anyone, is that 
                        it’s way more likely we’ll die up 
                        here than live. This whole thing is 
                        just...never trust a prick, right? 
                        You know they’re up here to extract 
                        minerals? It’s so gross. It’s not 
                        what I expected. But it’s 
                        beautiful, too. I thought it would 
                        make me feel small, but it doesn’t. 
                        I feel enormous. I feel huge. Haha, 
                        present state aside. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AMBER (CONT'D)
                        I keep dreaming that I fill up the 
                        entire sky. I get sad when I wake 
                        up.

           As she continues, we see moments from her and Kevin’s life 
           together — their entire lives — in reverse:

           -- She comes back in the house, backwards, and gets back into 
           the tub with Kevin;

           -- She and Kevin have sex on the couch, backwards, re-
           dressing and lying together smoking;

           -- They cheers with her parents;

           -- She sits with him, telling him she’s going to Mars;

           -- Back, back, back, faster and faster. They’re teenagers in 
           bed together, redressing and sitting awkwardly on the bed.

           -- They kiss in the cold, the mist returning to the kettle;

           -- Teenage Kevin watches as Amber un-hurts herself;

           -- Kevin’s a kid, taking her letters off the wall.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        But what kind of person leaves 
                        someone to go to Mars forever and 
                        never come back? I guess I do. I 
                        just wanted to. The possibility of 
                        it. To think how much further I 
                        could go. I kept meaning to ask you 
                        what you thought, but I already 
                        knew. And I knew you’d never stop 
                        loving me unless I made you. Just 
                        like my dad wouldn’t let me stop 
                        gymnastics unless I hurt myself. I 
                        think I kind of willed it to 
                        happen.  

                        So Tater, I say this sincerely, and 
                        with my whole heart: Stop it. Hate 
                        me as much as you used to love me, 
                        and I hope that hatred makes you 
                        change everything. But I know you, 
                        and I know it won’t. Because I 
                        don’t hate you either. I love you 
                        right down in the deepest, warmest 
                        pit of myself. I think I was bad at 
                        showing you. But I did. Please, 
                        please: Go. Goodbye, Kev. 
           With this, an emotional Amber unzips the top of her MarsNow 
           suit and pulls something from her interior pocket. She 
           unfolds it. It’s a ragged and faded orange paper circle.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           An orange paper circle on a desk. Another one is placed on 
           top of it by a small child’s hand. 

           INT. MARSNOW LIVING SPACE - DAY

           Amber kisses the paper circle. She folds it back up and 
           places it in her interior suit pocket. She zips up.

           She takes a moment to sit and cry, looking into the camera.

                                 AMBER
                        I practiced my speech. Could you 
                        tell?

           She smiles, sadly. Wipes her nose, which comes away bloody.

                                 AMBER (CONT’D)
                        Huh.

           The feed cuts to black.

           INT. KITCHEN - SAME

           Kevin wipes tears from his eyes. He closes the laptop. 

           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Kevin thumbs across books on the bookshelf, finally pulling 
           out his senior class yearbook. He turns it upside down.

           From within, a well-preserved orange paper circle floats out. 
           Kevin picks it up.

           He tears the circle in half. Then again, and again, until 
           it’s in tiny pieces. He throws it up like confetti and lets 
           it fall over his face. As soon as it all lands —

                                 KEVIN
                        Shit.

           He picks it up, piece by piece. He looks under Voyager.
           INT. BASEMENT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           He returns from the kitchen with gloves and a garbage bag.

           EXT. APARTMENT - SAME

           Kevin tosses a pair of trash bags into the waiting cans. 

           He stands, silent for a moment in the sunlight, then looks up 
           at the sky, shielding his eyes.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Kevin Watkins. Okay drug dealer, 
                        terrible hockey player, dead guy in 
                        the worst shows you barely watch. I 
                        don’t mean to shit on myself. I’m 
                        okay. I loved Amber Kivinen.

           He turns, walks around the house and out of sight.

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Yeah, that Amber Kivinen, the one 
                        who went to Mars. On that show, 
                        that time. I stopped watching it.

           A momentary glitch as —

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 

           Two little feet touch. Thunder. Two little hands join. The 
           lights flicker out, then back on.  

           A papier-mâché solar system hangs from the ceiling. On Mars, 
           a tiny human face.

           EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

           Reveal the scooped out half-hole where Kevin and Marcus 
           buried the dead plant. 

           In scorched soil a tiny, fledgling pot bud spouts with 
           conviction.

                                                              FADE OUT.
