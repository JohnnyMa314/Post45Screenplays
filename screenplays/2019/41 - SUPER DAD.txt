           EXT. SKYSCRAPER CRANE -- LOS ANGELES -- DAY

           We're 100 stories in the sky. A panicked 5 year-old girl 
           holds on for dear life as she dangles off a crane's edge.

           EXT. STREET BELOW -- CONTINUOUS

           The girl's parents are in absolute hysterics. Police wrangle 
           a huge crowd of onlookers and news reporters.

                                 MOM
                        My baby!

                                 DAD
                        I turned around for 2 seconds and 
                        she was gone!

                                 MOM
                        Someone save her!

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        I'm sorry, ma'am. She's not going 
                        to make it.

           EXT. SKYSCRAPER CRANE -- CONTINUOUS

           The girl loses her grip and begins to free-fall hundreds of 
           stories down. The crowd gasps, then turns away, until...

           The clouds part. A strong gust of wind blows the trees. Flags 
           billow. An heroic orchestra composition swells.

           WHOOSH! A SUPERHERO soars into frame!

           He swoops up the girl seconds before she hits the pavement. 
           He is...

           LAYTON WADE. Not Superman, but a super man. Chiseled jaw. 
           Infectious smile. 

           EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS

           Layton places the girl down and strikes a superhero pose.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        You saved me, Layton Wade!
                                 LAYTON
                            (with a smile)
                        Next time, let's keep playtime to 
                        the jungle gym, shall we?

           A GATORADE falls from above screen as Layton catches it and 
           holds it to camera.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        When I'm fighting crime or saving 
                        our youth, I drink Gatorade. The 
                        number one sport drink for 
                        superheroes.

                                 DIRECTOR (O.C.)
                        CUT! That's a wrap, everyone!

           An entire production crew enters frame. This was all a 
           Gatorade commercial.

           An attractive WARDROBE FITTER takes off Layton's cape. As she 
           walks away she turns and locks eyes with Layton.

           Layton's polished talent agent, FRANK, 50s, walks up to 
           Layton. His suit costs more than your car. 

           Following him are some of Layton's EXCITED FANS.

                                 LAYTON
                            (greeting the fans with a 
                            big smile)
                        What's a superhero without his 
                        super fans? 

           As Layton signs autographs and takes selfies, he encounters 
           his next fan, SCARLETT WRIGHT, 20, direct, walks with a limp, 
           and has nothing for Layton to sign.  

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        What am I signing?

                                 SCARLETT
                        I don't want a signature Mr. Wade. 
                        I want to tell you about my 
                        business.

                                 FRANK
                            (stepping in)
                        There's Layton's publicist. 
                            (pointing)
                        She'll be happy to connect you and 
                        Layton at his next best 
                        convenience. 
                                 SCARLETT 
                        Really quick if I may... 

                                 FRANK
                        You may not. 

                                 SCARLETT
                        My name is Scarlett Wright. I'm the 
                        founder of a startup tech company 
                        called Abled that develops 
                        exoskeletons for children with 
                        physical disa-- 

                                 FRANK
                        I'd hate to call security on an 
                        unwanted guest. 

           Scarlett leaves, but not without anguish. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Some fans don't let up, do they... 

                                 LAYTON
                        Speaking of not letting up. How 
                        about Kobe with 48 against the Suns 
                        last night! 
                            (Reminder: It's 2008)

                                 FRANK
                        Reminds me. I owe my...  
                            (pulls out phone and paper 
                            contract)
                        Here, sign this.

           Frank gives Layton a BIC PEN to sign the contract with. As 
           Layton signs, Frank snaps a shot with his phone.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Hold the logo towards me and smile.
                            (taking a picture)
                        That's going on Instagram. An easy 
                        100 grand. 

                                 LAYTON
                        What? How?

                                 FRANK
                        New thing called "social influencer 
                        marketing." 
                            (beat)
                        And that, my friend, is how you get 
                        a bookie off your ass.
                                 LAYTON
                        You've got a problem, Frank. Maybe 
                        you should try investing your money 
                        in--

           Layton is eyeing the wardrobe fitter and losing focus.

                                 FRANK
                        I see where your head is. Do your 
                        thing.

           Layton struts over to the wardrobe fitter. 

           EXT. SKYSCRAPER CRANE -- CONTINUOUS

           TIGHT ON SCREW: It begins to pop off as the entire crane 
           starts to fall.

           EXT. STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

           The crane comes tumbling down towards the wardrobe fitter as 
           she looks up. Just as it's about to hit her...

           Layton's pupils sharpen, his muscles tense. He springs into 
           action and stops the crane with just one arm. The wardrobe 
           fitter gazes up, realizing her life has been spared.

                                 WARDROBE FITTER
                        Thank you, Mr. Wade.

           Layton cradles the woman with one arm as he holds up the 
           crane with the other.

                                 LAYTON
                        It's Layton. After all of this 
                        saving I could really use a drink. 
                        Care to join?

           She nods "yes." Layton tosses the crane to the side as he 
           flies up into the sky with her. At this moment, we learn 
           Layton Wade is a...

           REAL-LIFE SUPERHERO!

           MONTAGE:

           -Layton pulls up an elevator by the cable with his bare 
           hands. A thankful woman stares up at Layton as he saves her.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Some things fall into place 
                        perfectly, don't they?  
           -CUT TO: An armored truck getting ambushed by several 
           ROBBERS. The woman driver gets forced to the ground with a 
           gun to her head. Layton grabs the gun and knocks out the 
           robber.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                            (to the woman)
                        Don't they know your life is 
                        priceless?  

           -CUT TO: Layton using his super speed to catch a man who just 
           snatched a woman's purse. He delivers a devastating blow to 
           the robber's chest.  Layton brings back the purse.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Who said chivalry is dead? 

           -CUT TO: A TOURIST, RACHEL, walking down the street taking 
           pictures of architecture. She accidentally walks into the 
           path of an oncoming bus. Layton takes the impact as the bus 
           crumbles around him. Layton has a SMALL CUT on his hand.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        I've always hated public transit.

                                 RACHEL
                            (mesmerized)
                        Thank you. 
                            (notices his cut)
                        Oh no. You're hurt.

           Rachel KISSES HER TWO FINGERS, then places them over his 
           wound as a gesture of love to Layton. He smiles.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Better?

           -CUT TO: Each woman in the scenes prior, and others, leaving 
           Layton's house in the morning. Like clockwork, Layton says to 
           each of them "See you soon" knowing full well he won't.

           -The tourist, RACHEL, stands out.

                                 LAYTON
                        When can I see you again?

           -Layton gives her one of his signature METAL CUFFS as a gift, 
           something he never did for any of the other women. Without 
           answering back, Rachel kisses Layton and leaves. We can see 
           the emotion in his eyes that he didn't show before.

           TITLE CARD: "12 YEARS AND 9 MONTHS LATER"
           INT. TV STUDIO -- GOOD MORNING AMERICA -- MORNING

           We're about to begin an interview with Layton and DIANE 
           SAWYER. A MAKEUP GIRL is putting the finishing touches on 
           Layton, who is now visibly older with some wrinkles. Layton 
           wears a tight v-neck floral shirt, red leather jacket, and 
           ripped skinny jeans.

                                 LAYTON
                            (to Frank who is sitting 
                            to the side)
                        Make sure they only get the right 
                        side of my face. The left side 
                        makes me look like a 40-year old 
                        man. 

                                 FRANK
                        You are a 40-year old man... 

           We now cut to the middle of the interview.

                                 DIANE SAWYER
                        So tell me Layton, when did you get 
                        your super powers?

                                 LAYTON
                        I was with my parents in Chernobyl 
                        while they were doing research.
                        Then it happened, a radioactive 
                        monkey bit me.

                                 DIANE SAWYER
                        At what point did you realize 
                        something was... off?

                                 LAYTON
                        I went into puberty 24 hours after 
                        the initial bite.

                                 DIANE SAWYER
                        How old were you?

                                 LAYTON

                                 DIANE SAWYER
                        A pubescent 4 year-old?

                                 LAYTON
                        I had back hair before I learned 
                        how to ride a bike.
                                 DIANE SAWYER
                        Your childhood must have been... 
                        untraditional.

                                 LAYTON
                        I was just like any other kid. Got 
                        good grades. Played football.

                                 DIANE SAWYER
                        We found footage from your sixth 
                        grade football game.
                            (to the producers)
                        Play the footage.

                                 LAYTON
                            (stumbling on his words)
                        How about we just--

           CUT TO FOOTAGE:

           From home-shot footage, we see a young Layton catching the 
           football as he trips into the band stand and knocks down the 
           entire bleachers sending people falling. 

                                 WOMAN 
                        PUT HIM IN THE CIRCUS!

           END FOOTAGE.

           We're back in the studio to see Layton sitting awkwardly.

                                 DIANE SAWYER
                        Is it true they never let you play 
                        football, or any sport again?

                                 LAYTON
                            (getting worked up)
                        Who needs sports anyways? I was 
                        always fine doing things my way.

                                 DIANE SAWYER
                        Can we talk about your parents?

                                 LAYTON
                        There's not much to talk about...

                                 DIANE SAWYER
                        You were only 13 when they passed. 
                        I can't imagine.

                                 LAYTON
                        I'm a superhero. I handled it.
                                 DIANE SAWYER
                        And that's when Frank came into 
                        your life?

                                 LAYTON
                        He discovered me after my parents 
                        left. He was there for me when no 
                        one else was.

                                 DIANE SAWYER
                        He's like a father to you.

                                 LAYTON
                        If by father you mean the man who 
                        taught me how to throw a left hook 
                        and never chase tequila with 
                        anything besides whiskey. A rule I 
                        still live by.

                                 DIANE SAWYER
                        Speaking of. You're known to live 
                        drink-to-drink. Fly woman-to-woman. 
                        It has to be taking its toll. Is 
                        there a reason you haven't settled 
                        down?

                                 LAYTON
                        I never needed anyone else. 

                                 DIANE SAWYER
                        And that brings me to my next 
                        question: Are the rumors true? Are 
                        you going to be the next Bachelor?

                                 LAYTON
                        Diane. Even a superhero needs 
                        saving. I will be the next 
                        Bachelor.

                                 DIANE SAWYER
                        Do you think you'll find love?

                                 LAYTON
                        I know my soulmate is somewhere in 
                        that group of 30 women.

                                 DIANE SAWYER
                            (turns to camera)
                        Layton Wade. Ready for love. And 
                        now an exclusive look at the new 
                        Bachelor.

           BACHELOR TV PROMO:
           EXT. MOUNT EVEREST -- DAY

           Layton is trekking through the snow on the tallest mountain 
           in the world -- SHIRTLESS. Wind swirls around him. His head 
           looks forward, determined to find love.

           SUPER: MT. EVEREST

                                 CHRIS HARRISON (V.O.)
                        This season on the Bachelor...

                                 LAYTON (V.O.)
                        I'm here to prove to America that 
                        if you don't give up on love, 
                        eventually you'll find it.

           INT. MUSCLE BEACH -- VENICE -- DAY

           We're interviewing one of the women, MADDIE.

           SUPER: Maddie. 

                                 MADDIE
                        I admire Layton's strength.

           We pan over to see Layton bench pressing two dozen women at 
           once. All the women gawk at him.

                                 LAYTON (V.O.)
                        I guess you could say I know how to 
                        support a woman.

           INT. INTERVIEW -- DAY

           Layton looks at camera holding a rose. A single tear rolls 
           down his cheek as he drops to one knee.

                                 LAYTON
                        I'm ready to find my partner in 
                        crime-fighting. 

           END BACHELOR PROMO.

           INT. LAYTON WADE'S HOME ENTRANCE -- MORNING

           We're looking up at a staggering 30 ft tall, mahogany door 
           with the initials "L.W." carved in.

           Two gold-plated Egyptian sarcophaguses guard the entrance. We 
           see a zen garden with sand from Mars on a table.
           Pictures of Layton posing with world leaders: Obama, 
           Netanyahu, Merkel, even having a beer with the Pope.

           TIGHT ON: the door handle turning. We see a PAIR OF FEET in 
           sandals enter with purpose. We do not see her face.

           INT. LAYTON'S KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

           The mysterious woman pulls out eggs, bacon, and veggies.

           As she cooks, we see bacon sizzling to perfection. The 
           woman's hands feed vegetables through a juicer. Then she 
           cracks a dozen eggs with precision.

           INT. LAYTON'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           It's too dark to make out. We vaguely see Layton passed out 
           next to several beer bottles. The mysterious woman walks in 
           with a plate of food and a green juice.

                                 MYSTERIOUS WOMAN
                        Alexa, engage morning mode.

           As the lights go on...

                                 LAYTON
                        No!

           We reveal that the room is a GIANT GLASS DOME. There are 360 
           views of LA all around. We're at the top of the hills. This 
           is Layton's room. 

           The mysterious woman is MARIA SANCHEZ, 60, full of attitude, 
           doesn't take shit from anyone, especially Layton.

           Maria pushes a button, engaging the retractable roof to open.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        I'm melting!

           Layton grabs a strip of bacon off the plate.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                            (spitting it out)
                        What the hell is this?!

                                 MARIA
                        Tofu bacon. You're not a young man 
                        anymore. You need to stop chasing 
                        life with...
                            (sniffs Layton)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Whiskey? Plus, a superhero 
                        shouldn't be fat.

                                 LAYTON
                        You think just because I'm a 
                        superhero it means I should have a 
                        six pack? It's not that easy!

                                 MARIA
                        Well Bruce Wayne has a six pack.
                            (fantasizing)
                        Wait. Maybe it's an eight?

                                 LAYTON
                        Bruce Wayne is a fictional 
                        character who thinks he's a bat.

                                 MARIA
                        Regardless, your two pack isn't 
                        cutting it.

                                 LAYTON
                        Why do you think I signed up as a 
                        spokesperson for Nutrisystem?

                                 MARIA
                        Because they're paying you 10 
                        million dollars. 

           Layton has a moment of realization.

                                 LAYTON
                            (panicked)
                        Wait. What day is it?

                                 MARIA
                        The sixth.

           Layton looks at his giant, touch screen, DIGITAL CALENDAR on 
           the wall that's updated in real-time. He has several of these 
           around the house that are also linked to his phone.

                                 LAYTON
                            (looking at the calendar)
                        I forgot to send my publicist 
                        flowers for her birthday!

                                 MARIA
                        I already sent them. Oh. And I 
                        picked up your dry cleaning. And 
                        told the Mayor's office you were 
                        sick for the ACLU speech you 
                        missed!
                                 LAYTON
                        What would I do without you?

                                 MARIA
                        Isn't that a great thought?
                            (beat)
                        Get up. Time to train.

           Maria pulls the covers off Layton to jar him awake.

           INT. LAYTON'S HOME GYM -- A LITTLE LATER

           BEGIN WORKOUT MONTAGE:

           -We see Maria and Layton pedaling on stationary bikes. They 
           both stare forward intently. Maria watches a Spanish Soap 
           Opera as Layton Watches ESPN. 

           -CUT TO: Maria walking on the treadmill as she lifts 5 pound 
           weights. Pan over to see Layton Wade sprinting on the 
           treadmill as he presses 500 pound weights in each hand.

           -On the TV we see a Mad Money hosted by Jim Cramer talking 
           about Scarlett Wright, the entrepreneur we met earlier. 

                                 JIM CRAMER (ON TV)
                        The medical community was blown 
                        away when she introduced her 
                        exoskeleton leg braces. Now young 
                        tech entrepreneur, Scarlett 
                        Wright's renowned company "Abled 
                        Technologies" is set to raise the 
                        bar again by unveiling a state-of-
                        the-art, full-body exoskeleton suit 
                        meant to help kids with physical 
                        disabilities walk again. If it 
                        proves to be the real deal, can you 
                        say "20 BILLION DOLLAR VALUATION!"   

                                 MARIA
                        As much bad as there is in this 
                        world, good people like her give me 
                        hope.  

           -Layton changes the channel to the morning news on KTLA as we 
           see footage of Layton flying into an active bank robbery.

                                 ANCHOR (ON TV)
                        Layton Wade saves the day as
                        he heroically stopped five armed
                        robbers before they could get away
                        with a whopping 10 million dollars. 
                                 LAYTON
                        Not going to lie. I had a few
                        whiskey gingers beforehand.

           We see Layton getting interviewed by reporters on TV.

                                 LAYTON (ON TV) (CONT’D)
                        You guys want to see something
                        funny?

           Layton drapes the back of his cape over his head to make 
           himself look like E.T. Then, he lights up the edge of his 
           finger. 

                                 LAYTON (ON TV) (CONT’D)           
                        E.T. Phone home!  

                                 MARIA 
                        A few?

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. LAYTON'S BATHROOM -- A LITTLE LATER

           On the sink we see the products of a man going through a mid-
           life crisis: wrinkle cream, anti-aging cream, green cream, 
           all kinds of cream.

           Layton comes out of the shower and looks at himself in the 
           mirror, then concern blankets his face. He spots a NEW 
           WRINKLE on his forehead.

           Layton quickly grabs his wrinkle cream. As he goes to squeeze 
           it, NOTHING COMES OUT.

           UP CLOSE: Layton rolls up the tube to try and get the last 
           bit out, but nothing.

           Layton RIPS the tube in half. He then reaches in with his 
           finger and gets the last bit.

           In the process, Layton spots a framed photo of a much 
           younger, wrinkle-free him on the Gatorade commercial as he 
           reminisces. 

           INT. KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

           Layton and Maria are both making protein shakes. They hand 
           each other different ingredients just as the other needs it, 
           knowing exactly what the other needs and when. 
           They both have a newspaper in front of them as Layton PUTS ON 
           HIS READING GLASSES. 

                                 MARIA
                        I'm going to be volunteering at the 
                        hospital the rest of the day. You 
                        should come. The patients would 
                        love you.

                                 LAYTON
                        We paid them plenty of money when 
                        you were sick. That's enough 
                        charity work for me.
                            (beat)
                        See you a little later.

                                 MARIA
                            (as she shakes her head)
                        I'm taking the weekend off.

                                 LAYTON
                        Says who?

                                 MARIA
                        Me.
                            (beat)
                        I'll be back Monday, Niño.

           As Maria is about to exit, she stops.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh yeah. The carpet cleaners are 
                        coming in an hour. Let them in.

           INT. LAYTON'S CORRIDOR -- A LITTLE LATER

           We hear the gate RING. Layton pulls out his phone and 
           connects to the outdoor. He sees a woman and buzzes her in.

                                 LAYTON
                        It's open. 

           A few moments later, the door opens. We see an OLDER WOMAN, 
           this is SHIRLEY SMITH, 65, gray curly hair, looks like 
           everyone's grandma. 

           Next to her we see a girl, ANNA, 12, and her twin brother 
           WILL. 

           Anna wears an OVERSIZED GREEN BAY PACKERS JERSEY and stands 
           more confident than a timid Will who holds a sketch pad. 
                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        About time we put America's youth 
                        to work. 

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Layton Wade?

                                 LAYTON
                        Carpet's in the living room. Might 
                        want to keep the kids away, a lot 
                        of tequila soaked in that thing.

                                 ANNA
                            (under her breath)
                        Not surprised... 

                                 LAYTON
                        Excuse me?

           Will looks at Layton with anxious and apprehensive eyes. 
           Layton takes notice.  

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        What's wrong, kid? It looks like 
                        you just saw a ghost. 

           Will takes a few steps back. 

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Layton Wade, my name is Shirley 
                        Smith. I work for Child Services.

                                 LAYTON
                        You'll have to talk to my agent 
                        about getting me to be a 
                        spokesperson. I'm not cheap. 

                                 SHIRLEY
                        This is your son Will and daughter 
                        Anna. 

                                 LAYTON
                        That's funny. I thought you said 
                        "son and daughter."

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Mr. Wade. Are you familiar with the 
                        name Rachel Meadows?

           This jogs Layton's memory, then he spots the METAL CUFF in 
           Anna's hand. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Where did you get this?
                                 ANNA
                        Now you all of a sudden care?    

                                 SHIRLEY
                            (trying to calm her down)
                        Honey, it's ok.  

           It's the same metal cuff he gave to Rachel in the montage 
           scene earlier.

                                 SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
                        Her mother gave it to her.

                                 LAYTON
                        Where is she?

                                 SHIRLEY
                            (whispering into his ear)
                        She passed away several months ago. 
                        Anna and Will have been in and out 
                        of foster care until we were able 
                        to find her father.

                                 LAYTON
                        Well I hope you find him.

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Layton, I'm here for you to assume 
                        full custody of your twin children.

                                 LAYTON
                            (freaking out)
                        TWINS?! Why can't they be the good 
                        kind? You know, blonde, in their 
                        20s — NOT RELATED TO ME! 

           Layton begins to realize this isn't a joke.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                            (full-blown denial)
                        This is all a very nice story, but 
                        none of this means they're mine. 
                        She could have gotten that cuff 
                        from anywhere.

           Layton bends down and gets close to Will to see if he looks 
           like him. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        He doesn't even have my eyes! 
                            (to himself)
                        Yep, those are my eyes. 

           Anna steps in. 
                                 ANNA
                        Back up! He likes his safe space. 

                                 LAYTON
                            (backing up)
                        ok, ok. Jeeze...  

           Shirley pulls out two BIRTH CERTIFICATES. "Layton Wade" is 
           listed as their father.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                            (to himself)
                        Oh boy.
                            (walks Shirley a few feet 
                            away)
                        Don't they have any other family?

                                 ANNA
                            (hearing Layton's comment)
                        We wish. 

                                 SHIRLEY
                        From what we've gathered, you're 
                        it.

                                 LAYTON
                        But I have a date tonight! 

                                 SHIRLEY 
                            (rolling her eyes)
                        I'm going to need to take a look 
                        around to make sure your home 
                        passes state requirements.

           INT. LAYTON'S LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Shirley has a clipboard in hand.

                                 SHIRLEY
                        State law requires that you have at 
                        least one available bedroom for 
                        every child and one working toilet.

                                 LAYTON
                        It's a 12 bedroom, 7 and a half 
                        bath mansion...

                                 SHIRLEY
                        A simple yes or no will suffice.

                                 LAYTON
                        Yes! But--
           Shirley notices a dozen FUTURISTIC WEAPONS on the wall.

                                 SHIRLEY
                        All firearms must be stored in a 
                        locked cabinet.

                                 LAYTON
                        There's an invisible forcefield 
                        guarding them. But they can't--

                                 SHIRLEY
                            (checking off her last)
                        And do you have a car, valid car 
                        insurance and a clean DMV report? 

                                 LAYTON
                        Clean DMV report? My reactions are 
                        10,000 times faster than any human! 
                        It's impossible for me to crash!

           Shirley starts walking towards the door.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                            (to Shirley)
                        Wait! Where are you going?

                                 SHIRLEY
                        To place the other 50,000 kids in 
                        LA that don't have homes.

                                 LAYTON
                        What's two more?!

                                 SHIRLEY
                        You guys will do just fine.

           Shirley exits. Now it's just Anna, Will, and Layton. Layton 
           calls Maria but it goes right to voicemail.

                                 LAYTON
                            (whispering)
                        Two kids just showed up at the door 
                        Yes, kids, two of them. A girl and 
                        a boy, but the girl seems to hate 
                        my guts and I haven't figured out 
                        the boy yet. I'm having a panic 
                        attack and I need you here RIGHT 
                        NOW! 

           Layton hangs up. Anna and Will stay close as they go to sit 
           on the living room couch.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Don't sit there. 
                                 ANNA
                        But it's a couch...  

                                 LAYTON
                        No it's for show. Sit on the floor.  

           Will looks scared as he notices Layton's abstract art piece 
           featuring the popular anime character, Astro Boy. 

                                 WILL
                        Wow. Astro boy?

                                 LAYTON
                            (clueless)
                        Beats me. Ask my art dealer. 

           Will looks scared as Anna looks around at the house.

                                 ANNA
                        What do you even do all day? Fly 
                        around and pick up girls? 

                                 LAYTON
                            (as he downs two Advil)
                        I'm a superhero! I fight crime! 

                                 ANNA
                        It looks like the only thing you're 
                        fighting is a hangover.

                                 LAYTON
                        Don't listen to what you hear on 
                        TV. 

                                 WILL
                        Whenever we saw you on TV our mom 
                        would shut it off. 

           Layton sees Anna and Will both looking into the kitchen. 

                                 LAYTON
                        You guys hungry? 

                                 ANNA
                        That's a stupid question. It's 
                        lunchtime.     

                                 LAYTON
                        It's only 10... 

                                 ANNA
                        Not where we're from.  
                                 LAYTON
                        I'll order something.

                                 ANNA
                        But we're hungry now.

                                 LAYTON
                        Maria's not here to cook.

                                 ANNA
                        Is Maria your girlfriend?

                                 LAYTON
                        No. She's my house maid. 

                                 ANNA
                        So you're lazy, too? 
                            (beat)
                        Our mom would make us fried cheese 
                        curds. 

                                 LAYTON
                        This is a dairy-free household. We 
                        follow trends in LA.
                            (beat)
                        Lucky you guys didn't show up last 
                        week. I was on the charcoal diet.

           INT. KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

           Layton opens the fridge and spots some raw chicken. Anna and 
           Will look on. 

                                 LAYTON
                        How about some chicken?

           Layton grabs a pan and throws it on the stove. He's moving 
           fast, nervous for his cooking debut.

           Layton grabs olive oil and pours out the entire container.

                                 WILL
                            (whispering to Anna)
                        Think he's ever cooked before? 

                                 ANNA
                            (whispering back)
                        Not a chance.   

                                 LAYTON
                        A healthy pour never hurt nobody. 
                        So I say to my bartender.
           Layton grabs the chicken bare-handed.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Now we throw on the chicken, sit 
                        back, and --

           As soon as the chicken makes contact, the oil begins to POP 
           AND EXPLODE, shooting hot oil in all directions.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        INCOMING!

           Layton's super senses take over. His pupils sharpen. His 
           heart beats fast. THUMP! THUMP! 

           The scene goes SLOW MOTION: Layton flips backwards and 
           shields Anna and Will with his body right as a few drops of 
           hot oil are about to hit both of them.

           He swoops them up and places them at a safe distance.

           Back to NORMAL SPEED. Layton casually looks back to the stove 
           as a small fire has started in the oil. Smoke is pouring out. 
           He walks back...

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                            (with two thumbs up)
                        Don't worry. I'm a superhero, 
                        remember?

           Layton walks to the sink and fills up a cup of water.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        We'll just put out the fire with 
                        some water.

           Layton throws the water on the oil. FLAMES IGNITE.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        GET BACK!

           Anna and Will rush behind the couch and watch the scene 
           unfold. The fire runs up the cabinets. Everything is burning.

                                 ANNA
                        I think we should call 911!

                                 LAYTON
                        Why? It's a controlled burn!
                            (looking at the fire 
                            spreading)
                        Not good. 
           The fire reaches the smoke detector, causing a FOAM FIRE 
           RETARDANT to pour from the ceiling, extinguishing the fire.

           Layton emerges with foam covering his entire body while 
           holding the pan of chicken.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Chicken's up!

           INT. FERRARI -- A LITTLE LATER

           Layton drives his brand new Ferrari while Will and Anna share 
           the front seat.

           Anna and Will eat In N Out while using Will's drawing 
           notebook as a makeshift tray. 

                                 WILL
                        Oops. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Oops what?

                                 WILL
                        I spilled.

                                 LAYTON
                        Not on my Napa Valley leather! 

           We see some of the spill has gotten onto Anna's Packers 
           jersey as well. 

                                 ANNA
                        Some got on my jersey but you don't 
                        see me complaining, do you? 

                                 LAYTON
                        That jersey doesn't cost as much as 
                        a house, does it?  

                                 ANNA
                        Well it means more to me than you 
                        ever will! 

           Layton goes silent. 

           Just then, a call comes into Layton's phone. He answers on 
           speaker.

                                 LAYTON
                        Talk to me. 
                                 POLICE SERGEANT
                        Layton, we have an active bank 
                        robbery at 20th and Olympic. We 
                        need you here fast. 

           Layton hangs up. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Who knows how to drive a stick? I 
                        need to fly somewhere. 

           Will puts up his hand. 

                                 ANNA
                        We're only 12! 

                                 LAYTON
                        Fine!

           Layton pulls over to the side of the road.  

                                 ANNA
                        Why are we pulling over here?

                                 LAYTON
                        I need to put on my superhero suit. 

                                 WILL
                        Superheroes are supposed to wear 
                        those under their clothes.  

                                 LAYTON
                        This is the real world, not the 
                        movies, kid. Do you have any idea 
                        how fast I'd overheat with a flame-
                        retardant suit under my jean 
                        jacket? 

           Layton changes into his superhero suit on the side of the 
           road as Anna and Will twiddle their thumbs. 

           EXT. BANK -- MOMENTS LATER

           We see dozens of police officers and news crews as Layton 
           pulls up with Anna and Will. 

           The POLICE SERGEANT runs up to Layton.

                                 POLICE SERGEANT
                        Who are the kids? 
                                 LAYTON
                            (whispering)
                        They're a short-term arrangement.
                            (to police)
                        Watch them, will you?

           Layton hands Anna and Will over to the police.

                                 WILL
                            (scared)
                        We shouldn't be here. 

                                 ANNA
                        You're just going to leave us here?

                                 LAYTON
                            (to Anna)
                        I need to take the trash out.  

           Layton soars up into the air.

                                 ANNA
                            (to the police officers)
                        Where did he go?

                                 POLICE SERGEANT
                        Get behind me, guys. 

           Anna and Will peer up into the sky as Layton disappears into 
           the clouds. Then...

           INT. BANK -- MOMENTS LATER

           We see 4 BANK ROBBERS. Their guns held against the heads of 
           the hostages. We hear a RUMBLE from above.

           One of the robbers takes a few steps towards the window. The 
           rumbling begins to grow.

                                 ROBBER 1
                        What the...

           Then... WHAM! The glass shatters creating an explosion. 
           Layton enters with such force the entire building shakes.

           He takes a robber by the neck and throws a devastating blow 
           to his jaw, rendering him useless. Layton is immediately 
           fired upon.

           Layton barrel rolls to the right, gaining cover behind a 
           concrete pillar. He peeks out to get a glimpse.
                                 LAYTON
                        There's nowhere to go  — give it 
                        up!

                                 ROBBER 1
                        If you want these people to live 
                        you better get the hell out!

                                 LAYTON
                        You know I can't do that.

           We hear a PIN GET PULLED. Layton spots a small grenade land 
           next to him. He flips down a desk to shield himself as the 
           charge goes off, blowing him out the front entrance.

           EXT. BANK -- CONTINUOUS

           It's foggy as Layton regains composure. He turns around, the 
           cops have retreated, except for Anna and Will, who have their 
           arms wrapped around each other. They stand alone and in 
           shock. 

           Layton swoops Anna and Will up, shielding them with his 
           bullet proof cape. The robbers emerge with the hostages and 
           begin to fire.

           Layton picks up a sewer cover and deflects the rounds. The 
           robbers go to reload, this is his chance. He sheds the cape, 
           leaving Anna and Will protected.

           Layton drop kicks Robber 2, he flies back into the glass.  
           Layton then delivers a devastating right hook to Robber 3. 
           Robber 4 pulls a knife and charges. Layton juts to the side 
           like a matador, using his back leg to kick him into a cement 
           barrier. Layton runs up to Anna and Will.

                                 LAYTON
                        Are you guys ok?

                                 ANNA
                        I'll learn how to drive stick.  

           Will nods his head in agreement. 

           Layton pulls out his phone as reporters surround Layton.

                                 LAYTON
                            (to Anna and Will)
                        You guys are ok. 
                            (the Ferrari has been shot 
                            to smithereens)
                        Can you guys call an Uber? I need 
                        to feed the press.
           Anna grabs the phone from Layton and calls one.

           EXT. BANK -- A MINUTE LITTLE LATER

           As Layton is answering to reporters, a Prius Uber pulls up.

                                 LAYTON
                            (to Anna)
                        A Prius? Didn't you request a black 
                        car?
                            (noticing a woman inside)
                        Wait. Are there--

                                 ANNA
                        I got us an Uber Pool.

                                 LAYTON
                        What's that?

                                 ANNA
                        It's what our mom used to call. You 
                        share the ride.

           INT. UBER -- MOMENTS LATER

           Layton is sitting shotgun. Anna and Will sit in the back 
           between a tourist, SUSAN, 50. Susan peers at Layton.

                                 SUSAN
                            (whispering on her phone)
                        He looks exactly like Layton Wade. 
                        But he's too old. He must be
                        one of those Hollywood Blvd 
                        superhero panhandlers.

           Layton can hear their conversation. So while the car is going 
           70 + MPH on the 405 Freeway, he casually opens the door and 
           FLIES next to the back window, staring the tourist down.

                                 LAYTON
                        What was that? I couldn't hear you.

           The tourist is in shock. Anna and Will giggle to themselves.

           INT. LAYTON'S HALLWAY -- THAT NIGHT

           Layton peeks into Will's room. As he opens the door, he 
           notices Will isn't there. 

           Concerned, he goes to check on Anna. As he opens the door...
           He sees Will and Anna sleeping in the same bed together, 
           sound asleep. 

           He quietly walks in. There things are still packed. Anna 
           holds her Packers jersey while she sleeps. 

           Next to them on the nightstand is a FAMILY PORTRAIT that Will 
           drew showing their mom, Anna, and Will as one happy family.

           Then, Layton notices a CRUMPLED UP POSTER. He picks it up and 
           un-crumples it to reveal...

           A poster he signed and sent back as FAN MAIL to Anna. 

           INT. LAYTON'S BEDROOM -- A LITTLE LATER

           Layton watches ESPN in bed all alone. 

                                 ESPN HOST
                        ...And the Rams are gearing up for 
                        an undefeated season. 
                            (next story)
                        But how about this one folks, Jared 
                        Goff and Todd Gurley were seen 
                        stumbling out of One Oak last night 
                        with none other than Layton Wade 
                        as--

           Layton shuts off the TV as a look of disappointment about 
           himself comes across his face.  

           INT. ABLED HEADQUARTERS -- NEXT MORNING

           The press is wrapping up an interview with Scarlett Wright at 
           her state-of-the-art headquarters. 

                                 PRESS
                        This new technology sounds 
                        revolutionary from what you've 
                        already created. So what about 
                        those who say the tech you plan on 
                        introducing isn't possible yet? 

                                 SCARLETT
                        Every time you create something 
                        extraordinary, there should be 
                        questions. And to me that's a sign 
                        you've done something 
                        transformative and life-changing. 
                                 PRESS
                        If it proves to be not what you 
                        say, we imagine the consequences 
                        will be devastating to your future 
                        at this company.   

           Scarlett's assistant, DARIAN steps to the podium. 

                                 DARIAN
                        That's enough questions for now. 
                        Thanks everyone. 

           Dorian ushers Scarlett into a back laboratory away from the 
           press. 

           INT. ABLED LABORATORY -- CONTINUOUS

           We get a look at the lab. There's millions of dollars worth 
           of tech. Scarlett and Darian sit down with SPENCER, and 
           BLAIR, two second-in-command executives for the company, who 
           are standing up. 

                                 SCARLETT
                        Please. Sit down. I wouldn't want  
                        to make you guys work any harder...   

                                 SPENCER
                            (slightly nervous)
                        Have you seen the headlines? Never 
                        been better!  

                                 SCARLETT
                        Let's not kid ourselves. We're in 
                        trouble. 
                            (to Blaire)
                        Is the innovation team close?

                                 BLAIR
                        Our new power source keeps failing. 

                                 SCARLETT
                        And our attempt at outside funding? 

                                 SPENCER
                        I'm afraid cut short. 

                                 SCARLETT
                        I saw all over the news. I thought 
                        Blackwater could pull off 
                        anything...

                        team and go straight for the

                        And as we do, let's never forget 
                        our mission to make the impossible,

           INT. LIVING ROOM -- THAT MORNING

           Layton is scrambling to get his shoes on.

                                 LAYTON
                            (yells out to Anna and 
                            Will)
                        We're leaving in 30 seconds for 
                        school!

           Layton's phone rings.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                            (answering)
                        Hello?

                                 SHIRLEY (V.O.)
                        Layton? This is Shirley from Child 
                        Services.

                                 LAYTON
                        Give me some good news. Please!

                                 SHIRLEY
                        My team and I have done some 
                        research and found out Anna and 
                        Will do have an aunt. Now we 
                        contacted her and she is able to 
                        take them, but she's out of the 
                        country until next month. So you'll 
                        need to keep custody until then.

                                 LAYTON
                        A WHOLE MONTH?!

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Mr. Wade...

                                 LAYTON
                        Ok. That's fine. One month. I think 
                        I can survive.
                                 SHIRLEY
                        In the meantime I'll coordinate 
                        with their aunt.

                                 LAYTON
                        You're my hero.

           Layton hangs up and walks over to the DIGITAL CALENDAR. He 
           writes in on the date "PACKAGE PICKUP" on the date. 

           Then, we hear SCREAMS from the bathroom.

           Layton rushes over.

           INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           The place is FLOODED. Layton's BIDET is broken and shooting 
           water everywhere. Layton takes off his EXPENSIVE BLAZER, 
           throws it on the hallway floor, and goes in.

                                 LAYTON
                        What happened?!

           Anna is standing there not knowing what to do. 

                                 ANNA
                        The toilet shot water up my ass! So 
                        I nudged it!

                                 LAYTON
                        Nudged it?! It's broken in half!

           Layton tries to stop it, but water shoots into his face. Will 
           runs in and PLACES HIS NOTEBOOK under his shirt to protect 
           it. 

                                 WILL
                        It's angry!

                                 LAYTON
                        How do we shut the water off?!

           Layton is panicking, he starts to twist the water shut-off 
           knob but breaks it off, even more water shoots out.

           Layton freaks out even more, trying to plug the leak with his 
           hand, but more water sprays out.

           He ends up accidentally ripping the toilet out of the ground, 
           water floods the bathroom.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Get me something to plug the hole!
           Will runs away, then emerges with Layton's expensive blazer. 
           Without looking, Layton grabs it and begins to plug the hole.

           Will and Anna are both drenched, but for some reason Will 
           only has a few drops on him.  

           He's relieved, until he notices.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        This is a $10,000 blazer! 

                                 WILL
                            (with a smile)
                        Well. It stopped the water, didn't 
                        it?

           Anna high-fives Will as Layton just shakes his head in 
           disappointment.

                                 LAYTON
                        Get in the car. We're going to be 
                        late to school. 

           INT. FERRARI -- A LITTLE LATER

           Layton is nearing the Middle School with Anna and Will. 

                                 ANNA
                        We'll get out here. 

                                 LAYTON
                        But the drop off is up there...  

                                 WILL
                        We're fine here.    

                                 LAYTON
                        Wait a second. Are you guys 
                        embarrassed of me? 

           Nothing from the kids. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Guys! I'm famous!

                                 ANNA
                        You're embarrassing.
           EXT. BEVERLY HILLS MIDDLE SCHOOL -- MOMENTS LATER

           Layton pulls up as Anna and Will step out. We look around to 
           see kids in designer clothes and notice every other car is a 
           Mercedes. 

           The kids feel out of place as the school's principle, MR. 
           WALTER rushes out, ecstatic to meet Layton, and not even 
           noticing Anna and Will at first. 

                                 MR. WALTER
                        What a pleasure it is to meet a 
                        real-life superhero! Welcome to 
                        Beverly Hills Middle School. And if 
                        I may say, 
                            (checking him out from 
                            head to toe)
                        You're like a walking, talking 
                        jungle gym. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Nice to meet you too, boss.

                                 PRINCIPLE WALTER
                            (flattered)
                        Boss? Who, me?! Why thank you. 
                            (gets close to Will and 
                            Anna)
                        It must be pretty cool to have a 
                        superhero as a daddy. 
                            (catching himself)
                        Dad. I mean dad. 

           Will takes a step back when the Principle goes to shake his 
           hand. 

                                 ANNA
                            (gesturing with her hands)
                        This is Will's safe space. Respect 
                        it. 

                                 PRINCIPAL WALTER
                            (backing off)
                        Sorry about that. Let's give you 
                        guys a quick tour, shall we? Mr. 
                        Wade, are you coming? 

                                 LAYTON
                        I actually have to get going. 

           A few parents come over to Layton and gawk. 

                                 PARENT 1
                        Are you Layton Wade?
                                 PARENT 2
                        You have such a presence.  

                                 LAYTON
                            (loving it)
                        Who wants an autograph? How about a 
                        selfie?

                                 WILL
                            (to Anna)
                        He doesn't even care about us.

                                 ANNA
                        Don't worry. We have each other. 

           INT. SCHOOL -- MOMENTS LATER

           Principle Walter shows Will and Anna to class. 

                                 PRINCIPAL WALTER
                        Will. Your first period is going to 
                        be art class. And Anna, your first 
                        period will be history.

                                 ANNA
                        Different classes?

                                 WILL
                        But we always--

                                 PRINCIPAL WALTER
                            (cutting off Will)
                        You guys will be just fine. 

                                 ANNA
                        Good luck, bro. Love you.  

                                 WILL
                        Thanks, sis. Love you, too. 

           Anna and Will do their unique handshake then hug. As Will 
           goes into class, he maintains eye contact with Anna. It's 
           emotional for them to separate.  

           As Will goes into class, another teacher runs up to Principle 
           Walter. 

                                 TEACHER
                        We need you in the science 
                        department. Mrs. Daniel's is having 
                        another breakdown. 
                                 PRINCIPAL WALTER
                            (whispering to the 
                            teacher)
                        Grab a Xanax from Nurse Wendy. 
                        Actually, grab two. I'm going to 
                        need one.  
                            (to Anna)
                        Would you excuse me, Anna? 

           Principle Walter and the teacher run off. 

           As Anna walks to class, she's stopped by a group of girls. 
           They all wear designer clothes and sport designer bags. The 
           popular girl, ABBEY, 12, confronts Anna. 

                                 ABBEY
                            (all smiles)
                        OMG. I love your backpack! 

                                 ANNA
                        Really? Thanks! 

                                 ABBEY
                            (darn right mean)
                        No. It's hideous — like you.  

           Abbey's squad all laugh at her joke. Then we see Abbey notice 
           Anna's Packer's jersey. 

                                 ABBEY (CONT’D)
                        Your clothes don't even fit.  

                                 ANNA
                        It was my mom's... 

                                 ABBEY
                        Did she dress like a boy, too? 
                            (beat)
                        You're pathetic. 

           The group of girls walk away as Anna turns away sad. But 
           then, something catches her eye... 

           The PEEWEE FOOTBALL OPEN TRYOUTS SIGN UP SHEET. She picks up 
           the pen and signs up.  

           INT. ART CLASS -- CONTINUOUS

           Will goes to sit down as the class begins. He takes a pencil 
           out of his pocket and begins to sketch. 

           He slowly peeks at a girl sitting next to him, this is REN, 
           an artsy girl. She has Will's full attention. 
           As Will continues to sketch, his pencil breaks. 

                                 REN
                            (noticing)
                        Here, I have an extra. 

                                 WILL
                            (voice cracks)
                        Thanks. 

           Will is beyond embarrassed of his voice cracking as he puts 
           down his head. Ren kind of smiles. 

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE -- MORNING

           Layton and his agent Frank stand on a soundstage as Layton 
           prepares to do a promo piece for The Bachelor. 

                                 FRANK
                        You have twins...  

                                 LAYTON
                        I know can you believe it?

                                 FRANK
                        Of course I can believe it! I'm 
                        shocked there aren't more!

                                 LAYTON
                        We need to figure this thing out 
                        together. And fast.

           A text comes in on Frank's phone. His eyes widen.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 FRANK
                        Nike wants to make a deal!

                                 LAYTON
                        I've had Nike before.

                                 FRANK
                        Not like this you haven't! No one's

           The director interrupts them. 

                                 DIRECTOR
                        Layton. We're ready for you.

                                 LAYTON
                            (winking at Frank)
                        Time to say I do.

           EXT. SCHOOL -- LATER THAT AFTERNOON

           Layton pulls up to the school to pick up Anna and Will. 
           Football tryouts catch his attention as he parks the car and 
           walks over. 

           As he looks closer he spots...

                                 LAYTON
                            (to himself)
                        Anna?

           Anna is making plays on the field. Her speed is impressive, 
           darting around boys much bigger than her. But she can't catch 
           the ball to save her life.  

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD -- MOMENTS LATER

           Layton spots Will sitting in the stands by himself as he 
           draws in his notebook. 

                                 LAYTON
                        What's she doing down there?

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Playing football. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Why aren't you down there? 

                                 WILL
                        I don't like sports. I do Anime. 

                                 LAYTON
                        You what?

                                 WILL
                        Anime. It's Japanese for animation.  

                                 LAYTON
                        Well how do you say "Football is 
                        life" in Japanese. 
                                 WILL
                            (speaking Japanese)
                        Sakkā wa jinseidesu. 

           Layton is impressed. 

                                 LAYTON
                        But every kid needs a sports hero 
                        to look up to! 

                                 WILL
                        Goku is my hero. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Go who? 

                                 WILL
                            (stands up proud)
                        Goku. Born on the planet Vegeta. 
                        Just before it was destroyed he was 
                        sent to Earth. He acts as the 
                        protector of all humanity. But 
                        don't let his aggressive fighting 
                        style fool you, his heart is bigger 
                        than the universe. 
                            (sits down humbly)

           Layton looks dumbfounded. 

           Anna comes off the field and spots Layton and Will sitting 
           awkwardly together in the stands. 

                                 LAYTON
                        So... football?  

                                 ANNA
                        Is there a problem? 

                                 LAYTON
                        Some of these guys are pretty 
                        big...   

                                 ANNA
                            (confident)
                        I'd only be scared if they could 
                        catch me.  

                                 LAYTON
                        You were the fastest one out there.   

                                 ANNA
                        I was open every time but the 
                        quarterback only threw it to me 
                        once. 
                                 LAYTON
                        Your handwork needs some work. Let 
                        me show you how it's done.  

                                 ANNA
                        I don't need any help. We've been 
                        fine without you.  

                                 LAYTON
                        I know what it's like to be looked 
                        at differently on the field. 

                                 ANNA
                        Yeah, people look at you and 
                        idolize you. People look at me and 
                        find something to make fun of. We 
                        don't belong here.

                                 LAYTON
                        Just give me a chance. And let's 
                        show these guys which girl is boss. 
                        Alright?

           Anna kinds of nods unsure. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        We'll work on some fundamentals 
                        tomorrow morning. 
                            (looks at Will who is 
                            drawing)
                        Will, you're coming too. Let's see 
                        if we can turn you into a 
                        playmaker. 

           Will looks bummed. 

           INT. ANNA AND WILL'S ROOM -- EARLY MORNING

           It's 5am. Layton enters and opens the curtains. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Rise and grind! 

                                 ANNA
                        My eyes!

                                 WILL
                        Let us sleep!

           Anna and Will now remind us of Layton when Maria woke him up 
           earlier. 
                                 LAYTON
                        You guys are acting like a couple 
                        of vampires... Now get up! We've 
                        got work to do. 

           EXT. PARK -- A LITTLE LATER THAT MORNING

           Layton, Anna, and Will are at the park. Layton holds several 
           footballs. Anna is wearing her Packers jersey. Will draws in 
           his notebook while sitting on the grass.  

                                 LAYTON
                        You've come here as kids, and will 
                        leave as playmakers.  

           Anna nods confidently as she tightens her receiver gloves. 
           Will just keeps drawing.  

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Will, eyes up here. 
                            (beat)
                        The most important part of being a 
                        good receiver is catching the ball. 

                                 ANNA
                        Well duh. But how?

                                 LAYTON
                        The teardrop.

           Layton makes the shape of a teardrop with his hands. 

                                 ANNA
                        Oh is that why some guys have a 
                        teardrop tattooed on their face?

                                 LAYTON
                        Exactly the reason. For sure not 
                        because they've killed someone or 
                        anything. 
                            (beat)
                        Now let's put it to the test. 

           Anna runs up to the line, ready to sprint out and catch the 
           ball. Just as... 

           A GROUP OF WOMEN begin to do yoga in the background. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                            (to Anna)
                        I'll go first. Throw it to me. 
                                 ANNA
                        Ok... 

           Anna is confused she doesn't get to run the play first. But 
           she hikes the ball and throws it to the selfish Layton. 

           Layton runs towards the women and makes the catch by shaping 
           his hands like a teardrop. 

                                 LAYTON
                            (to the women)
                        Is anyone here named Mary? 
                            (beat)
                        Because I just hailed you. 

           Layton runs back to Anna, proud of his dad joke. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        You see what I did there with my 
                        hands? Do it with me. 

           Layton Makes the teardrop gesture as Anna does it back. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        That's it. If you catch the ball 
                        right in the teardrop, you'll never 
                        drop it.  

                                 ANNA
                        Ok, my turn?

                                 LAYTON
                        Let me get one more. Throw it a 
                        little deeper this time, cool?

                                 ANNA
                        Alright...  

           Anna hikes the ball as Layton runs out towards the women. 

           As Layton catches it, he goes right into a downward dog yoga 
           position next to the women. 

                                 LAYTON
                            (to the women)
                        I call this one the "downward deep 
                        route." 

           Layton runs back to Anna. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        What a catch, right?
                                 ANNA
                        Is it my turn yet? Tryouts are 
                        today after school...  

                                 LAYTON
                        Yeah but let's hurry up. I've got 
                        another commitment this morning. 
                            (referring to the 
                            Bachelor)

           INT. LAYTON'S KITCHEN -- THAT MORNING

           Layton, Anna, and Will all walk in to Maria cooking a 
           delicious pancake, eggs, bacon, and fruit breakfast. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Guys, this is Maria. 

                                 WILL
                        Very nice to meet you, I'm Will. 

                                 ANNA
                        Wow. What you're making looks 
                        delicious. 

                                 MARIA
                            (to Layton)
                        There's no way they're yours. They 
                        have manners. 

           Layton gives her a look. 

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        How about some breakfast, guys. 

                                 ANNA/WILL
                        Thanks.

                                 LAYTON
                        Yeah thanks.

                                 MARIA
                            (to Layton)
                        Make your own. Now that you're a 
                        father, you need to learn how to 
                        cook, clean, and do laundry.

                                 ANNA
                        Can we go back to bed?

                                 LAYTON
                        Go ahead. I'll wake you guys up in 
                        an hour or so for school.  
           INT. ANNA AND WILL'S ROOM -- AN HOUR LATER

           Just as Anna and Will are getting up, Layton emerges with a 
           load of FINISHED LAUNDRY. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Maria's got some competition. 

           Anna fearfully springs up. 

                                 ANNA
                        Did you wash my Packers jersey?! 

                                 LAYTON
                        It's so fresh and so clean, clean. 

           Anna's eyes begin to well up. 

                                 ANNA
                            (getting emotional)
                        That was my moms and it still 
                        smelled like her! How could you?!

                                 LAYTON
                            (choking on his words)
                        Anna, I'm so sorry. 

                                 ANNA
                        You don't even care about us. Just 
                        like you didn't care when I tried 
                        to contact you by sending you that 
                        letter — all you sent back was a 
                        signed poster! 

                                 LAYTON
                            (ashamed of himself)
                        I didn't know... 

           Anna cries under the covers as Layton leaves.  

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NEXT DAY

           The second day of tryouts are happening. Up in the stands we 
           see Layton and Will. 

           The COACH address the team. 

                                 COACH
                        Not everyone's going to make it. 
                        But in 2 weeks a team of players 
                        will represent our school in the 
                        home opener. Now let's put in some 
                        hard work. 
           The team breaks as they line up for the play. Anna lines up. 

                                 LAYTON
                            (yelling down)
                        Come on, Anna! 

           Anna looks up, giving Layton a face like she's still unhappy 
           with him. 

           The quarterback, JOEY, a jock, hikes the ball. Anna sprints 
           out, jukes left, and then goes up for the ball but she misses 
           the catch. 

           EXT. FOOTBALL STANDS -- CONTINUOUS

           Layton gets up in a rage. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Cut that kid! My housemaid can 
                        throw better than him!  

           That's when a woman, STACY, 30s, a little unkempt, gets up 
           ready to combat Layton. 

                                 STACY
                        Excuse me? That's my son you're 
                        talking about. Who in the hell do 
                        you think you are? 

                                 LAYTON
                        I'm Layton Wade. The superhero. 
                        Everyone knows that.  

                                 STACY
                        Oh sure! I'll take criticism from a 
                        40 something year-old that acts and 
                        dresses like a 20 year-old trust 
                        fund baby!

           We see Layton flexing his arms and sucking his stomach in as 
           other moms gawk at Layton.

                                 STACY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe if I didn't have to work two 
                        jobs and pay a mortgage I'd have 
                        more time to be a fangirl.

           Layton stands there a bit speechless.
           EXT. DOWN ON FIELD -- CONTINUOUS

           Anna goes to lineup for another play. We see ABBEY and the 
           rest of the cheerleaders on the sidelines. 

                                 ABBEY 
                        Hey, Anna. Did your voice drop yet? 
                        It looks like you're wearing the 
                        right kind of pads.  

           Anna is sad until...

           NATHAN, a cute linebacker comes up to Anna. 

                                 NATHAN
                            (encouraging)
                        Don't listen to them. You were so 
                        close to catching that. 

           Now with a surge of confidence, Anna lines up as Joey hikes 
           the ball. She sprints forward, outpacing the defensive back 
           as Joey throws the ball her way. 

           Anna never loses eye contact, and as the ball comes close, 
           she creates a teardrop shape with her hands, CATCHING THE 
           BALL. 

           As she looks up in the stands, we see Layton holding up the 
           teardrop shape with his hands too. 

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD STANDS -- CONTINUOUS

           Layton springs up along with Stacy. They both jump up and 
           down and grab each other in excitement...

           Until they realize they still hate each other. 

           Layton sits down, and as he looks over to Will...

                                 LAYTON
                        That could be you out there--

           Layton sees Will's attention is on REN, the cute girl from 
           his art class. She's painting a GIANT FOOTBALL HOME OPENER 
           BANNER as she WAVES TO WILL.  

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        You're just like your old man. Give 
                        me some. 

           Layton goes for a high-five. He doesn't give one back. 
                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Oh yeah. You're safe space. My bad.  
                            (beat)
                        Who is she?

                                 WILL
                        She's just a girl. 

                                 LAYTON
                        If she's just a girl why don't you 
                        just go talk to her? 

                                 WILL
                        Ok fine I will. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Ok. Do it. 

                                 WILL
                        She's busy. 

           Layton realizes Will is nervous. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Listen here, little cub, everything 
                        the light touches... CAN BE STOLEN 
                        FROM YOU. Ya got that? Now go talk 
                        to her before someone else does. 

                                 WILL
                        What should I say? 

           A call comes into Layton's phone. 

                                 POLICE SERGEANT
                        Layton, there's a robbery going 
                        down at Caltech in Pasadena. 

                                 LAYTON
                        CalTech? There's no money to steal 
                        there...  

           Layton hangs up and turns towards Will.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        To be continued. Stay here with 
                        your sister until I'm back. 

           Layton flies up into the sky. 
           EXT. CALTECH -- MOMENTS LATER

           Layton hits the pavement with force. It sends a shockwave 
           rippling through the campus. Layton surveys the scene. 
           There's commotion coming from the TECH LAB.  

           It's quiet, a little too quiet. Then... BANG BANG! A barrage 
           of bullets hurdle towards Layton. He dives behind a pillar.

           We hear mutters inside from the robbers. Then, sirens in the 
           distance. More bullets fire outside.

           Layton uses his cape as cover as he runs up to the entrance.

           The gunfire stops, he looks in, but can't see the shooters. 

           INT. CALTECH LAB -- MOMENTS LATER

           The place is filled with vital tech and equipment. Layton 
           walks around slowly - on his guard. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Feels a little extreme for a 
                        science project. 

           Then, a table of beakers behind him is bumped. Layton turns 
           just in time to see an ARMED MAN stand up with a gun aimed at 
           him.  

           In this moment Layton acts. He throws a glass beaker at the 
           gunman, stunning him, and somersaults over a table towards 
           him. Twisting the gunman's arm to disable him, he drives an 
           elbow into his face, knocking him out. 

           Two more come around the corner, but Layton quickly leaps 
           toward the first man and in mid-air uses his legs to twist 
           him to the ground. Before the other man can get a clear shot 
           Layton spins around and sweeps the man's legs. As he falls 
           he's disabled by a punch to his throat. 

           Out of the corner of his eye, a new robber, MARCO, punches 
           Layton across the face and actually sends him to the ground. 

           Quickly recovering, Layton flies towards Marco, delivering a 
           knee to his stomach. Before Marco can recover Layton spins 
           and drives his heel into his chest, sending him flying into 
           the wall and crumbling to the ground. 

           Slowing getting up, Layton walks over to deliver a final 
           blow. Just as he's about to make contact, the man's hand 
           comes flying up and stops Layton's attack cold, with a...
           BIONIC EXOSKELETON ARM. The shock of this stuns Layton for a 
           moment. Allowing Marco to drive his fist into Layton's chest, 
           sending him flying back into the wall with force. 

           A few seconds later Layton gets up dazed and confused as a 
           few POLICE OFFICERS run into the scene. Marco is gone.  

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        You alright?

                                 LAYTON
                        What the hell was that?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        We've got guys looking for him now. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Whatever that guy was wearing... it 
                        wasn't human. 

           Layton shakes it off and gets up. 

           INT. LAYTON'S BEDROOM -- THAT NIGHT

           Layton is getting ready to go to bed when there's a knock at 
           the door. Anna walks in. 

                                 ANNA
                        Hey... Can I use your Postmates? 

                                 LAYTON
                        What do you need? 

                                 ANNA
                        Supplies.  

                                 LAYTON
                        Maria already got you and Will a 
                        bunch of school supplies. 

                                 ANNA
                        Not those kind of supplies. You 
                        wouldn't understand. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Why? 

                                 ANNA
                            (shy)
                        Because I think I just got my first 
                        period. 
                                 LAYTON
                        You got your first what? 

                                 ANNA
                        My first period.  

           TIGHT ON Layton as a bead of sweat appears from his brow. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        I need a pad. 

                                 LAYTON
                        An iPad? Lucky for you, I have a 
                        sponsorship with Apple! How many 
                        pads do you want? Screw it how 
                        about a lifetime supply? 

                                 ANNA
                        There's blood. 

                                 LAYTON
                            (voice trembling)
                        Blood?

                                 ANNA
                        Yeah...  

                                 LAYTON
                            (trying to remain calm)
                        I'll fly to the store, and get you 
                        some supplies. How hard can that 
                        be?

           Layton pulls out his phone and calls Maria.

                                 MARIA (V.O.)
                        You better be dying if you're 
                        calling this late. 

                                 LAYTON
                        I need you here — now! Anna is 
                        becoming a woman! 

           INT. RALPH'S -- TAMPON AISLE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Layton is hiding under a hat, as he looks at hundreds of 
           varieties of tampons. Fear sets in. 

           The scene depicts a horror movie. Layton darts his head left, 
           then right, tunnel vision sets in. 

           A LOUD CRASH at the end of the aisle. A person DROPS 
           CRANBERRY JUICE as it leaks all over the floor. 
                                 LAYTON
                        Someone stop that leak!

           Layton calls Anna on his phone. 

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                                 LAYTON
                        I'm here, my phone's about to die, 
                        and I don't know what to do! People 
                        are looking at me funny!

           INT. ANNA'S BATHROOM AT LAYTON'S -- CONTINUOUS

           Anna is pacing in the bathroom. 

                                 ANNA
                        Can you just pick out some? 

           INT. RALPH'S -- TAMPON AISLE -- CONTINUOUS

           Layton is freaking out. 

                                 LAYTON
                        There's hundreds!  

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        Wait! Tampax!  

           Layton spots the Tampax brand. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Which ones?! There's seven dozen 
                        different Tampax variations! 

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        Well. Do they have any that smell 
                        like tulips?

                                 LAYTON
                        Tulips?! Do you want me to check 
                        for daffodils, too?! I'm not at the 
                        farmer's market, honey!

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        Please?

                                 LAYTON
                        So now I have to smell them?!
                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        It'll say on the box. 

                                 LAYTON
                        I forgot my reading glasses! I 
                        can't read the fine print! You're 
                        lucky I have super smelling 
                        capabilities! 

           Layton begins to SMELL THE BOXES OF TAMPONS one by one. Then, 
           Layton's phone dies. 

           Layton calls her back on the Ralph's phone located on the 
           pillar of the aisle.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        My phone died!  

           Layton's arm accidentally bumps into the "INTERCOM" button. 

           INT. FRONT OF RALPH'S -- CONTINUOUS

           Layton's voice comes over the intercom as people shop. 

                                 LAYTON (INTERCOM)
                        So now I'm a superhero by day, 
                        tampon sniffer by night! My god if 
                        anyone found out about this... 

           Everyone stops what they're doing to look up as Layton 
           realizes he's on the intercom. 

           INT. ANNA AND WILL'S ROOM -- A LITTLE LATER

           Anna is in bed, as comfortable as can be. Layton goes to shut 
           the door just as we hear...  

                                 ANNA
                        Thanks. 

           This catches Layton off guard as he smiles back at Anna. 

           INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           Maria is in the hallway smiling at Layton who shuts the door. 

                                 MARIA
                        You handled it all by yourself. I'm 
                        proud of you, Niño. 
           INT. LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Will is up drawing in his notebook as Layton enters. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Crazy night, huh?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah...

                                 LAYTON
                        Something on your mind, squirt?

                                 WILL
                        Squirt? This isn't a 90s sitcom. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Fair. How about a beer?

                                 WILL
                        Sure?

                                 LAYTON
                        Hell no I'm still your elder. Now 
                        what's on your mind?  

                                 WILL
                        Nothing important. 

                                 LAYTON
                        What's her name again?

                                 WILL
                        Ren. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Now we're getting somewhere. So 
                        what's the problem? Is she too 
                        scared to talk to you because your 
                        dad's a superhero? 

                                 WILL
                        The opposite. When I talk to her it 
                        feels like I become possessed by a 
                        kid with no game. 

           Layton gives him a look like "You are a kid with no game."

                                 LAYTON
                        Right... 
                            (beat)
                        If you want to play the game, you 
                        need to understand the 
                        fundamentals.
                                 (MORE)
                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        And guess who wrote the playbook?
                            (beat)
                        Your old man. Now get up.  

           Will gets up. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Every player needs to survey the 
                        field. Walk in, and take a look 
                        around, let everyone know who's 
                        boss by puffing that chest out. 

           Will nods his head. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Next, add a little depth to that 
                        voice of yours. Girls love a low 
                        voice.

                                 WILL
                            (in a low voice)
                        Like this?

                                 LAYTON
                        Irresistible. Now show her you know 
                        how to move. It all starts in the 
                        left foot. Like a spark that 
                        travels up your body, out of your 
                        finger tips, and into her soul. 

           Layton flicks his foot as he shows Will the move. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Then, do the mailman. 

                                 WILL
                        What's the mailman?

                                 LAYTON
                        Post up. Take your right arm and 
                        plant that thing. Let her know you 
                        have every intention of sticking 
                        around. 
                            (beat)
                        And it's as easy as that. 

                                 WILL
                        That was easier than I thought. 
                        Thanks for the help. 
           INT. ABLED LABORATORY -- THAT NIGHT

           Spencer, Blaire, and Darian are gathered around Scarlett as 
           she addresses them.

                                 SCARLETT
                        Can someone explain to me what the 
                        hell happened today?

                                 DARIAN
                        Layton Wade showed up. He took down 
                        two of our men. Marco got away 
                        thanks to the bionic exoskeleton 
                        arm. 

           Scarlett slams her fists on the table. Everyone flinches.

                                 SCARLETT
                        I'm sorry. 
                            (smiles)
                        Sometimes I just get, a little 
                        angry when people get in my way. 
                            (beat)
                        We need to get our hands on the 
                        Thorium. 

                                 BLAIRE
                        Our investors are getting nervous. 

                                 SCARLETT
                        Assure them. 
                            (beat)
                        I can't fail. My livelihood, my 
                        reputation, it's all on the line. I 
                        could lose the entire company — 
                        that I built, if we don't stop 
                        Layton.      

           Scarlett's right-hand man, MARCO, walks in with a folder. 
           He's the one who punched Layton with the bionic arm.

                                 MARCO
                        I've got something for you, Miss 
                        Wright.

                                 SCARLETT
                        What's this?

                                 MARCO
                        We found Layton Wade's soft spot. 
                        He has kids. 

           He lays out pictures taken undercover of Layton, Anna, and 
           Will.
                                 SCARLETT
                        I love children. When Can I meet 
                        them? 

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY -- NEXT MORNING

           Will is pacing back and forth outside the art class as he 
           spots Ren painting the home opener football banner inside.  

           INT. ART CLASS -- CONTINUOUS

           Will enters, he goes for it. Will puffs up his chest.

                                 REN
                            (a little confused)
                        Will. Hi?

           Will then deepens his voice 

                                 WILL
                            (deep)
                        Ren. Hey there how are you doing? 
                        You doing good? 

                                 REN
                        What's wrong with your voice?

                                 WILL
                        I think you mean't, what's right 
                        with my voice.   

           Will flicks his foot then does the move Layton taught him. 
           Ren is weirded out.  

                                 REN
                        Will. Are you having a medical 
                        episode? 

           Then, Will goes to plant his arm up on the table next to her, 
           SPILLING THE PAINT CAN ALL OVER THE BANNER. It's ruined. 

                                 REN (CONT’D)
                        Are you serious right now?!

                                 WILL
                        Ren I'm so sorry!

                                 REN
                        Just get away from me! You just 
                        ruined everything!

           Ren runs out as Will tries to stop her. But there's no hope. 
           EXT. FOOTBALL STANDS -- LATER THAT DAY

           Tryouts are happening. Layton enters and sits down next to 
           Stacy. There's a moment of awkwardness.

                                 LAYTON
                        Is this seat taken?

                                 STACY
                        Don't you want to sit with the 
                        bimbos?

           We see the other moms gawking at Layton. 

                                 LAYTON
                        You're just mad because they're not 
                        hiding who they are.

                                 STACY
                        Well have you told any of their 
                        kids they suck yet? 

                                 LAYTON
                        I'm sorry for making fun of Joey. 
                        I've come to know the feeling 
                        lately. Being a superhero is one 
                        thing, but being a parent? Let 
                        alone a single parent to a set of 
                        twins, I don't know how people do 
                        it.

                                 STACY
                        It's not that hard.

                                 LAYTON
                        Really?

                                 STACY
                        Not at all. When he wants nothing 
                        to do with me I just pop open a 
                        bottle of wine and hide in my 
                        closet.

           Layton laughs.

                                 STACY (CONT’D)
                        It's not easy for me. Do you know 
                        what Joey told me he wants to be?

                                 LAYTON
                        A lawyer?

                                 STACY
                        A meathead.
           EXT. ON THE FIELD -- CONTINUOUS

           As Anna plays catch with Nathan, the ball gets past her and 
           rolls up to Abbey's feet who is cheerleading.

                                 ABBEY
                        How does it feel being bad at 
                        everything you do? 

           The confidence gets knocked out of Anna. 

           EXT. FOOTBALL STANDS -- CONTINUOUS

           Layton and Stacy are in the middle of their conversation. 

                                 LAYTON
                        I'm sure his dad can keep him in 
                        line. 

                                 STACY
                        He's not around.

                                 LAYTON
                        Oh he works a lot, or?

                                 STACY
                        No. He's just like every other man 
                        on earth... worthless.

           Layton kind of smirks, considering himself not in the 
           category of "worthless man."

                                 STACY (CONT’D)
                        And incapable of being responsible 
                        for anything. He walked out when he 
                        found out I was pregnant with Joey. 
                        How can you not be there for your 
                        own child?

           Layton then realizes he just may be in this category.

                                 LAYTON
                            (talking about Joey)
                        It looks like he's got a good head 
                        on his shoulders... 

           Joey is punching himself in the helmet. 

                                 STACY
                        It's getting bigger every day. I'm 
                        afraid he's becoming just like his 
                        dad. An egotistical asshole.
                                 LAYTON
                            (switching topics)
                        Sometimes I have to leave 
                        unexpectedly, because, you know, I 
                        fight crime and stuff. Think I can 
                        grab your number just in case I 
                        can't give Anna a ride home? 

           Stacy smiles in agreement as she opens up her backpack and 
           PULLS OUT HER PHONE. 

           Then their attention gets brought to the field where Joey 
           hikes the ball. 

           Anna darts forward. Side stepping, then sprinting to the end 
           zone. 

           Joey lets the ball fly. The perfect spiral. Anna follows it 
           with her eyes, never losing contact. 

           She shapes her hands in a teardrop shape and makes the catch. 
           Touchdown. But not without getting tackled.  

           Nathan, the boy that makes Anna blush, comes up to her and 
           helps her up. 

                                 NATHAN
                            (with a smile)
                        You're giving these guys a run for 
                        their money. 

                                 ANNA
                            (with big eyes)
                        Thanks. 

           EXT. FRONT OF SCHOOL -- MOMENTS LATER

           An angry Will walks out the front door, to a waiting Layton 
           and Anna. 

                                 WILL
                        I should have never listened to 
                        you!

                                 LAYTON
                        What are you talking about?

                                 WILL
                        Your advice screwed me over! 
                                 SCARLETT (O.C.)
                        Don't worry Layton, all kids tend 
                        to dislike their parents around 
                        this age. 

           We pan over to see Scarlett and Darian outside of the school. 
           A luxury black SUV waits for them.  

                                 SCARLETT (CONT’D)
                        Offspring want their own identities 
                        separate from their procreator. 
                        Hard to imagine he doesn't want to 
                        be like his superhero father... 

                                 LAYTON
                        Scarlett Wright? 

                                 SCARLETT
                        Layton Wade.

                                 ANNA
                        Who's she? 

                                 LAYTON
                        She works on very important science 
                        projects.  
                            (to Scarlett)
                        How's it coming? It seems like you 
                        have more important things to be 
                        tending to than hanging out at a 
                        middle school. 

                                 SCARLETT
                        I fund the science departments of 
                        over 200 schools in Los Angeles. I 
                        need to check on my children, after 
                        all, they are the future of this 
                        great society we live in. 

           Layton kind of rolls his eyes. There's already tension in 
           this relationship.  

                                 SCARLETT (CONT’D)
                        They can't all be as lucky as us, 
                        Layton. Born a superhero. Hell, you 
                        can fly. The kids that we're 
                        helping can't even walk.

                                 LAYTON
                        I don't take it for granted. 

                                 SCARLETT
                        You have no idea the impact you're 
                        making on these kids. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SCARLETT (CONT’D)
                            (looking at him dead in 
                            the eyes)
                        No idea. 
                            (then to Will and Anna)
                        Guys, your father is an inspiration 
                        to the world. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Give yourself a little credit, too 
                        why don't you. 

                                 SCARLETT
                        I owe everything I have to 
                        everyone's that ever doubted me. 
                        Everyone that said I couldn't do 
                        it. I want to give those kids hope 
                        that they can walk again. Play 
                        catch again. Ride a bike again.  

           TIGHT ON: Scarlett's leg, we see she has a PROSTHETIC, 
           EXOSKELETON LEG. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Well we have to run. 

                                 SCARLETT
                        Be safe out there. And what a 
                        pleasure seeing you again all of 
                        these years later. 

           Layton, Anna and Will all leave. Scarlett makes a call.

                                 SCARLETT (CONT’D)
                            (on the phone)
                        Do it. 

           INT. SUV -- CONTINUOUS

           We see Marco, Scarlett's right hand-man begin to follow 
           Layton in his Ferrari. 

           INT. FERRARI -- CONTINUOUS

           They come up to a light as heavy traffic comes through the 
           intersection. Will still won't talk to Layton.  

                                 LAYTON
                        Listen, Will. I'm sorry. I didn't 
                        mean to--
           INT. SUV -- CONTINUOUS

           Marco guns it, smashing into the back of Layton's Ferrari and 
           sending it THE CENTER OF THE INTERSECTION into oncoming 
           traffic.

           INT. LAYTON'S FERRARI -- CONTINUOUS

           Layton looks out of the corner of his eye to see another car 
           about to T-Bone them on Anna and Will's side. Then... time 
           freezes.

           EVERYTHING MOVES AT A MILLISECOND PACE. Layton's super senses 
           kick in. He tears off his seat belt.

           Layton looks to his right. The car makes impact. As it begins 
           to crush the car in slow motion, Layton uses his lightning 
           speed to rip off the seat belt as he cradles Anna's head and 
           grabs her body.

           The car is now crumbling in, just inches away from their 
           heads. Layton uses his back leg to kick out the drivers side 
           door as he grabs Will.

           He holds Anna and Will in his arms and flies out just in 
           time, saving them from certain death.

           EXT. ROAD -- CONTINUOUS

           TIME GOES BACK TO NORMAL SPEED.

           At this moment, the two cars make a devastating impact, but 
           thanks to Layton's super speed, he got Anna and Will out 
           unscathed.

                                 LAYTON
                            (panicked)
                        Tell me you guys ok.

           Anna and Will are shaken, but fine. Her eyes begin to well 
           up.

                                 ANNA
                        You saved us. 

           Layton turns around to check on the driver. She's dazed but 
           ok. 

           Then, he notices the SUV that hit them, the driver, Marco, is 
           gone. Layton grows suspicious as he holds onto his kids.
                                 LAYTON
                        Will. I know I'm not always right 
                        and I'm sorry. I'm new to this dad 
                        thing.  

           Layton embraces both Anna and Will and breathes all of them 
           in. He grips them tight with his eyes closed.

           The entire scene brings emotion to Layton's eyes. He now 
           realizes what it means to be a father.

           INT. ANNA AND WILL'S BEDROOM -- THAT NIGHT

           Anna and Will are fast asleep as Layton checks on them from 
           the doorway. Again, He sees the small FRAMED DRAWING on their 
           nightstand of Will, Anna, and their mom. 

           He grabs it and looks, then looks back to his sleeping kids.  

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Layton pulls out his phone and opens Instagram.  

           He searches for "Rachel Meadows." His eyes widen as he finds 
           her page and begins scrolling through photos of her Anna, and 
           Will. One of Anna and Will at a school play, another of her 
           and Will in Halloween costume. 

           Layton smiles with loving eyes as he comes across a beautiful 
           photo of Anna, Will, and their mom at LAMBEAU FIELD, where 
           the Packers play. He SCREENSHOTS the photo and makes it his 
           background. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Layton sits down and opens his laptop. He looks determined. 

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           -Layton researches what it takes to be a successful coach: 
           the compassion, patience, and heart you must have.   

           -Layton looks up anime art, specifically Dragon Ball Z and 
           Goku. 

           -Next we see him in the kitchen trying out different recipes 
           and attempting over and over to master cooking techniques. 

           -Layton gets in bed as a more confident father, ready for a 
           big day the next morning.  
           END MONTAGE.

           EXT. PARKING LOT -- NEXT MORNING

           A brand new, Bentley SUV pulls up. A giddy Layton jumps out. 
           He opens the back door and lets out Anna and Will, they're 
           both blindfolded. 

                                 ANNA
                        What's going on?

                                 WILL
                        Don't they only blindfold people in 
                        kidnappings?

                                 LAYTON
                        Don't take them off yet!

           EXT. UNDISCLOSED AREA -- MOMENTS LATER

           We're TIGHT ON Anna. 

                                 ANNA
                        Can we take them off now?

                                 LAYTON
                        Go ahead!

                                 ANNA
                            (mesmerized)
                        Wow. 

           We're at the 50 YARD LINE OF THE LOS ANGELES RAMS STADIUM. 

           Anna and Will look around in wonder. 50,000 seats. It's an 
           unbelievable sight.  

                                 WILL
                        Are you sure we can be here?

                                 ANNA
                        This is amazing!

           Layton holds out a custom #12 RAMS JERSEY for Anna with the 
           name "Wade" stitched on the back.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Is that mine?

                                 LAYTON
                        I'm sorry about washing your mom's 
                        Packers jersey.
                                 (MORE)
                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        I still feel horrible. I wish I 
                        could take it all back. But I want 
                        you to have this. You don't have to 
                        wear it if you don't want to. But 
                        it's yours.    

           Anna pauses for a second, then to Layton's happiness, puts on 
           the Jersey. She gives Layton a big hug.  

           As Anna and Will turn around, Layton FLIES UP without them 
           noticing.  

                                 ANNA
                        Hey, where'd he go?

           Layton comes on over the stadiums INTERCOM. He's flown over 
           without them noticing.  

                                 LAYTON (O.C.)
                        Ladies and gentlemen. Please direct 
                        your attention to the center of the 
                        field. To the new rookie hailing 
                        from Green Bay, Wisconsin: Anna 
                        Wade! 

           Anna and Will laugh at their dad. 

           EXT. RAMS FOOTBALL STADIUM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Layton pulls an actual coaching playbook out that he made. 
           Him and Anna line up for a play just as...

           SEVERAL RAMS CHEERLEADERS WALK ON THE SIDELINES TO PRACTICE.

           Anna notices Layton's attention goes to them. 

                                 ANNA
                        Do you want me to throw to you 
                        again, or... 

           Layton thinks for a second. 

                                 LAYTON
                            (with a smile)
                        This is your day to shine, not 
                        mine. Now let's run some plays.  

           Anna smiles back at Layton, ready to play. 

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           -Layton works on Anna's footwork, catching skills, and ball 
           handling technique. 
           -We see Layton there with her every step of the way to help 
           her be a better player as he shows off his new father skills. 

           -On the sidelines we see Will drawing, but we're not sure 
           what. 

           END MONTAGE.

           EXT. RAMS FOOTBALL STADIUM -- CONTINUOUS

           There's time for one more big play. Anna is eager and ready.  

                                 LAYTON
                        And now, we're going to attempt 
                        what no football receiver has ever 
                        done. The 100 yard touchdown play. 
                        Can she do it? The world watches in 
                        anticipation! 

           Will lines up on the end zone line, ready to hike it to 
           Layton. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Ready!

           Anna nods her head. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Hike!

           Will doesn't hike it. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        That means throw it to me! 

           Will throws it back. Anna sprints down the field. Layton 
           HURLS THE BALL UP, it goes 500 feet into the sky. 

           Anna eyes it as she runs her buns off down the field with 
           impressive speed.  

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        ANNA! DOWN THE SIDE LINE! CAN THEY 
                        CATCH HER? SHE'S PULLING AWAY! 

           Anna springs the entire field in record time, the ball is 
           coming down, she makes a heart shape with her hands and makes 
           a miraculous catch. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        ANNA!TOUCHDOWN RAMS! UNBELIEVABLE! 
                        OH MY GOODNESS, WHAT A PLAY! 100 
                        YARDS! THIS IS HISTORY, EVERYONE! 
           Layton picks up Will as they fly to the end zone. Layton puts 
           Anna on his shoulders as they celebrate. 

           EXT. RAMS STADIUM SIDELINES -- CONTINUOUS

           We see Frank talking to his bookie on the phone.

                                 FRANK
                            (secretive)
                        I'll have the money! You know I'm 
                        good for it. My client is about 
                        cash in on the biggest endorsement 
                        deal EVER -- just give me until the 
                        Bachelor starts up next month.

           Frank hangs up just as Layton walks up to him.

                                 LAYTON
                        Everything cool?

                                 FRANK
                        No. Everything is not cool. You 
                        missed a Bachelor appearance 
                        because of this stunt. The Bachelor 
                        should be your top priority. 
                        Without it, there's no 300 million 
                        dollar endorsement deal from Nike!

                                 LAYTON
                        But look at how happy my kids are!

           We see Layton looking for Anna and Will.

                                 FRANK
                            (waves at his face)
                        Hello?! Anyone in there?!
                            (beat)
                        The old Layton would always put 
                        money first. Clean up your act. 
                        That's money I need, too.

           Layton nods in agreement.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        We have our biggest Bachelor promo 
                        with Chris Harrison coming up. 
                        You're not missing it.  

                                 LAYTON
                        I'll be there. I promise. 
           INT. LA CONVENTION CENTER -- A LITTLE LATER

           We're tight on Will as he looks out in amazement. We're at...

           ANIME CON! The Mecca for all things anime. 

                                 WILL
                        Are you kidding me?! This is the 
                        coolest thing ever! 

           Layton, Will, and Anna walk inside as fans begin to notice 
           it's the world famous Layton Wade. Dozens of fans come up to 
           him.  

                                 FANS COLLECTIVELY
                        OMG! Layton Wade! Is that you?!

           Layton's attention leaves Will and Anna and goes to the fans.

                                 ANNA
                        Here we go again...

                                 WILL
                        We can't be surprised, can we... 

           Until...

                                 LAYTON
                        Layton Wade? Yeah right. You guys 
                        really think Layton Wade would be 
                        this pudgy in real life? I mean, 
                        the guy's a superhero for crying 
                        out loud! Sorry to disappoint.  

           Layton looks at Anna and Will and winks. They smile back as 
           the fans believe Layton and leave. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Now where were we? 

           Will spots an extravagant booth in the distance. 

                                 WILL
                        Whoa! Is that the Dragon Ball 
                        universe?!

                                 LAYTON
                        Goku is summoning us. 

           The look in Will's eyes is pure joy. 

           BEGIN MONTAGE:
           -Layton, Will, and Anna strike poses together in front of a 
           green screen that make it look like they're in Dragon Ball Z. 

           -Will is getting drawing lessons from the world-famous Anime 
           artist Masashi Kishimoto as he shares some knowledge with 
           Will. 

                                 MASASHI
                        Drawing isn't born out of the hand, 
                        it's born out of the heart. 

           Will nods in agreement. Then Masashi looks up at Will. 

                                 MASASHI  (CONT’D)
                        When people are protecting 
                        something truly special to them, 
                        they truly can become... as strong 
                        as they can be. 

           Layton nods in agreement, really connecting to the statement. 

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. CONVENTION CENTER -- MOMENTS LATER

           Layton is walking out as Will and Anna walk behind him. We 
           hear some SNIFFLES from both of them. 

                                 LAYTON
                            (urning around)
                        Oh no. What's the matter?

           Layton spots a few tears in Anna and Will's eyes. 

                                 ANNA
                        Nothing. We're fine.

                                 LAYTON
                        If you guys tell me, maybe I can 
                        make you feel better.

                                 ANNA
                        We miss our mom. We wish she was 
                        here to see this.

                                 LAYTON
                        What was your guys' favorite thing 
                        about her?

                                 WILL
                        How tight she hugged me.
                                 ANNA
                        And when I was sad she would cheer 
                        me up.

                                 LAYTON
                        Is that where you both get those 
                        beautiful smiles of yours?

           Anna and Will kind of smile.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Or maybe it's from me.

           Layton contorts his face and smiles while making a goofy 
           expression.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        How's this for a smile?

                                 WILL
                        When's the last time you went to 
                        the dentist?

                                 ANNA
                            (laughing, wiping away 
                            some tears)
                        Don't be stupid!

                                 LAYTON
                        Listen. That smile of yours. Every 
                        time you show it to the world, your 
                        mom will smile up there, too. Ok?

           Will and Anna both nod as Layton grips them both tight. Both 
           Anna and Will wrap their arms around Layton. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Listen, guys. I'm sorry. I'm sorry 
                        I wasn't always there for you guys. 
                        I'm trying my best. I know I can't 
                        buy your affection, and I don't 
                        want to. I just wanted to give you 
                        something to smile about today. 
                        It's hard to imagine the two 
                        sweetest and lovable kids coming 
                        from a guy like me. 
                            (beat)
                        Your love for each other is 
                        stronger than any superhero power. 
                        And that's special.  
                                 ANNA
                        We don't care that you're a 
                        superhero or that you can fly 
                        around. We just like when you're 
                        here.  

           Will nods in agreement. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Dad. You're lonely. Maybe you need 
                        a serious girlfriend.

                                 WILL
                        Key word: serious. 

                                 LAYTON
                        I have plenty. 

                                 ANNA
                        Oh yeah? And when's the last time 
                        you texted one of them before 10pm?

           Layton doesn't have a response. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        How about Joey's mom?

                                 LAYTON
                        Stacy?

                                 ANNA
                        Yeah. I've seen you guys talking.  

                                 LAYTON
                        Oh she's just a girl. 

                                 ANNA
                        Ask her out!

                                 LAYTON
                        I don't think she would respond 
                        well to how I pick up girls...

                                 WILL
                        Ya think?

                                 LAYTON
                        She'd never go for me. She's too 
                        emotionally stable.  

                                 WILL
                        You won't know until you try. 

           Anna sneakily grabs Layton's phone. 
                                 LAYTON
                        We'll try later.

                                 ANNA
                        How about now?

           Anna holds up the phone, it's already calling Stacy.

                                 STACY (V.O.)
                        Hello?!

           Layton doesn't say anything. He's clueless so Will and Anna 
           coach him. 

                                 WILL
                            (mouthing)
                        Hi. It's Layton.

                                 LAYTON
                        It's Layton!

           INT. STACY'S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           Stacy has a bit of a surprised look on her face.

                                 STACY
                        Layton?

           INT. LA CONVENTION CENTER -- CONTINUOUS

           Will doesn't want him to screw this up.

                                 WILL
                            (mouthing)
                        How are you doing?

                                 LAYTON
                        You doing good, Stacy?

                                 STACY (V.O.)
                        I'm fine. Is there something you 
                        need? My hands are full.

                                 WILL
                            (mouthing)
                        We should date!

                                 LAYTON
                            (bursts it out)
                        We should mate!

           Will facepalms.
                                 STACY (V.O.)
                        Mate?

                                 LAYTON
                            (awkward)
                        Date! Want to like, go on a date 
                        tomorrow night? Just me and you. 
                        Because that's what a date is 
                        right? Ha! When two people--

                                 WILL
                            (mouthing)
                        Stop talking!

           There's a silence over the line, then...

                                 STACY (V.O.)
                        Sure... 

                                 ANNA
                            (mouthing)
                        Ask to pick her up!

                                 LAYTON
                        Pick her butt?

           Anna can't control her laughter and bursts out.

                                 STACY
                        Excuse me? Who else is there?

                                 LAYTON
                            (to Stacy)
                        No one! How about I pick you up!

                                 STACY (V.O.)
                        I'm not off till 7.

                                 LAYTON
                        I'll be there at 7:30!

           Layton hangs up. Anna walks up to Layton, grabs him by the 
           neck, and pulls him down to her level.

                                 ANNA
                        You need a lot of work.

           As Layton gives her a hug, a CALENDAR NOTIFICATION POPS UP on 
           his phone. He sees the "PACKAGE PICKUP," he set prior, 
           reminding him that the day Anna and Will are supposed to get 
           picked up on the same day as the season opener football game. 
           INT. LAYTON'S LIVING ROOM -- LATER THAT DAY

           Maria Anna, and Will are playing a board game when Layton 
           emerges in a deep v neck and tight jeans.

                                 MARIA
                        You look like a villain from the 
                        Jersey Shore.

                                 ANNA
                        Let's make you handsome.

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           -In the bathroom Layton sits on a chair as Will touches up 
           his facial hair with a razor. 

           -Layton emerges with a suede suit on to get Anna and Maria's  
           opinion.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Too soft.

           -He comes out with a bright neon sweater on.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Too blinding. 

           -The next scene we see Layton handing Anna and Maria his 
           hipster clothes as they put them in bags labeled "donations."

           -Layton emerges with a gentleman's outfit: Kashmir cardigan, 
           Henley shirt, a nice pair of jeans, and oxford shoes.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Superhero chic. She'll love it!

           -We see Anna doing Layton's hair. She gels it up and runs a 
           comb through it.

           -We see Layton looking suave as hell as Anna and Will stand 
           next to him proud of themselves. Maria gives Anna and Will 
           high-fives.

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. LAYTON'S HOME -- FRONT ENTRANCE -- MOMENTS LATER

           As Layton ties his shoe, he stops to notice Maria brushing 
           Anna's hair as Will works on a drawing. He walks over.  

                                 LAYTON
                        What are you drawing there?
                                 WILL
                        It's a surprise. 

                                 LAYTON
                        I can't wait to be blown away. 
                            (beat)
                        I'll come into your guys' room 
                        tonight and tell you goodnight, 
                        alright? Be in bed by 9. We have a 
                        big day tomorrow. 

                                 ANNA
                        Hey, you know. Will and I were 
                        thinking. We want to try having our 
                        own rooms. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Really? I mean. Of course. 

           Maria looks at Layton and smiles as Layton looks at the 
           CALENDAR on his phone one more time. 

           EXT. LAYTON'S FRONT ENTRANCE -- CONTINUOUS

           Layton pulls out his phone and calls Shirley from Child 
           Services.

                                 LAYTON
                        Shirley. It's Layton Wade.

                                 SHIRLEY (V.O.)
                        Is everything alright for Anna and 
                        Will's aunt and I to come next 
                        Friday?

                                 LAYTON
                        Actually--

           We see Maria step outside.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        I've been thinking and I've decided 
                        I want Anna and Will to stay with 
                        me. I want to make it official.

                                 SHIRLEY (V.O.)
                            (perks up)
                        Really?

                                 LAYTON
                        They're my kids, and they deserve 
                        to have their father.
                                 SHIRLEY (V.O.)
                        Of course Layton. And 
                        congratulations on such a huge 
                        milestone in your life. I think you 
                        guys will be very happy together. 
                        I'll begin the paperwork.

           Layton hands up. Maria gives Layton a big hug.

                                 MARIA
                        I'm so proud of you. When are you 
                        going to tell them?

                                 LAYTON
                        After the game. Yeah! 

           Just then, Anna and Will come outside.

                                 ANNA
                        You've got this!

                                 WILL
                        Whatever you do, don't do what you 
                        told me to do.  

                                 LAYTON
                            (goes for a high five)
                        Give me some.

           Layton leaves with a new sparkle in his eye.

           EXT. PARK BENCH -- SUNSET

           It's golden hour. Layton pours Stacy a glass of wine.

                                 STACY
                        Why did you want to take a person 
                        like me out?

                                 LAYTON
                        A total babe?

                                 STACY
                        Shut up. You know. Living paycheck 
                        to paycheck.  Real boobs.

                                 LAYTON
                        How do I put this... I'm used to 
                        dating--

                                 STACY
                        Floozies?
                                 LAYTON
                        Girls that want to be seen with me, 
                        not be with me.

                                 STACY
                        When I met you, I definitely didn't 
                        see much. Besides your good side: 
                        Anna and Will. 

                                 LAYTON
                        I'll be honest. When Anna and Will 
                        were dropped off, I saw these two 
                        annoying, constant question-asking, 
                        bugs. 

           Stacy kind of rolls her eyes. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        And then this layer peeled back and 
                        I saw this sweet and smart brother 
                        sister combo that are so different 
                        but so alike at the same time in 
                        the best ways possible. 

                                 STACY
                        That's very sweet of you. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Can I be honest with you?

                                 STACY
                        Maybe?

                                 LAYTON
                        When I first met you, I saw this 
                        bitter-as-hell, closed-off-to-the-
                        world, woman. But then I got to 
                        know you, and all you want to do is 
                        give a good life to your son. 

                                 STACY
                        Well when I met you...

           Layton is waiting eagerly for a compliment.

                                 STACY (CONT’D)
                        I thought you were a misogynistic, 
                        self-centered, mid-life-crisis-
                        suffering prick.

                                 LAYTON
                        Tell me how you really feel.
                                 STACY
                        And then I pulled back a layer, 
                        then another, then 30 more, and 
                        there was this gentleman that looks 
                        like he actually does have a heart. 

           Layton gives her a look like "who? Me?"

                                 LAYTON
                        It's been a while since I got a 
                        compliment.

                                 STACY
                        What about your parents? They must 
                        give you plenty. Especially growing 
                        up a superhero.

                                 LAYTON
                        I didn't have much time with 
                        them...

                                 STACY
                        Oh I'm sorry. What happened?

                                 LAYTON
                        I was 13 and I was playing catch 
                        with my dad in the backyard. I 
                        threw a football right through the 
                        garage door. You know, because of 
                        my super strength.
                            (beat)
                        I went with my parents to get a new 
                        door. We're driving down the road. 
                        It's pouring rain. Can hardly see. 
                        This truck swerves into our lane. 
                        It obliterated the car. My parents 
                        didn't stand a chance. But me? I 
                        didn't even have a scratch. 

                                 STACY
                        I'm sorry. I'm sure you have a lot 
                        of guilt.

                                 LAYTON
                        It taught me to cut people off 
                        before feelings set in. Friends. 
                        Girlfriends. Everybody. And live 
                        every second like it's my last.

                                 STACY
                        You're not a young man anymore.  
                                 LAYTON
                        That's what I'm scared of. But it's 
                        changing now that Anna and Will are 
                        in my life. They're showing me what 
                        matters. And sometimes what matters 
                        is right in front of you. 
                            (a shared smile, then 
                            beat)
                        Being a single parent isn't easy. 
                        You know.

                                 STACY
                        Not raising Joey in a two parent 
                        household makes me afraid I'm going 
                        to ruin him. Do I shower him with 
                        love? Show him tough love? I'm 
                        clueless.

                                 LAYTON
                        From what I've seen, you're doing 
                        great.

                                 STACY
                        And now they're reaching the age 
                        where they're going to start 
                        dating. 

           Layton gives her a confused look. 

                                 STACY (CONT’D)
                        What do you think of Nathan, 
                        anyways?

                                 LAYTON
                        Nathan?

                                 STACY
                        Yeah. Anna and Nathan are going 
                        out. She didn't tell you? 

           Layton's fist clenches. 

                                                        SMASH CUT:

           EXT. DRIVE WAY -- NIGHT

           Layton and Nathan are face-to-face. Nathan, the 12-year old 
           from the football team takes a nervous gulp as the world's 
           only superhero stares him down. Anna is already in the car.

                                 LAYTON
                        Don't you dare be thinking that.  
                                 NATHAN
                        Don't be thinking what, Mr. Wade? I 
                        didn't say anything. 

                                 LAYTON
                        I'm a superhero. I can read minds. 

                                 NATHAN
                        You can?

                                 LAYTON
                        Yes. Why are you thinking that?

           Clearly Layton can't read minds but the kid doesn't know 
           that. 

                                 NATHAN
                        Well aren't you supposed to think 
                        about your mom and dad if you think 
                        you're about to die?

                                 LAYTON
                        Good boy. 

                                 DEBRA (O.C.)
                        Thanks again for driving them!

           We see Debra standing at the doorway. Layton smiles back and 
           puts his arm around Nathan. 

                                 LAYTON
                        What a great son you have here! 
                        I'll have them back by 9!

           INT. SUV -- MOMENTS LATER

           Layton is driving on the 405 at 70+ MPH, but he never breaks 
           eye-contact with Nathan as he stares at him through the REAR-
           VIEW MIRROR. 

                                 NATHAN
                            (nervous)
                        Mr. Wade. Maybe you should keep 
                        your eyes on the road?

                                 LAYTON
                        My super senses use a sonar system 
                        to detect the entire roadway. 

           Anna doesn't notice as she stares out of the window. 
                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                            (never breaking eye 
                            contact with Nathan)
                        As a superhero, I constantly scan 
                        for possible threats. And when I 
                        find them. I lock my eyes on their 
                        every move. Like a guided missile. 
                        Ready to release fire and fury 
                        until the threat has been 
                        terminated. 

           Nathan takes a big, nervous gulp. Layton is driving straight 
           towards the back of a truck as he keeps eye contact with 
           Nathan through the rear-view mirror. 

                                 NATHAN
                            (scared)
                        Sir there's a--!

                                 LAYTON
                        Truck? I know. I saw him a mile 
                        back. 

           Layton drives right around the truck without ever breaking 
           eye contact with Nathan. 

           EXT. MOVIE THEATER -- MOMENTS LATER

           Anna is waiting by the entrance door but Layton grabs 
           Nathan's shoulder to hold him back. 

                                 ANNA
                        Dad, what are you doing?

                                 LAYTON
                        Give us one second, honey. We just 
                        need to have a chat.  

           Layton turns to Nathan. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        I don't know what you want. If you 
                        are looking to date my daughter I 
                        can tell you don't have my 
                        blessing, but what I do have are a 
                        very particular set of skills. 
                        Skills I have acquired over a very 
                        long career of being a superhero. 
                        Skills that make me a nightmare for 
                        boys like you. If you resist from 
                        kissing my daughter, you'll never 
                        hear from me again.
                                 (MORE)
                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        But if you even go as far as 
                        kissing her on the cheek, I will 
                        look for you, I will find you, and 
                        I will destroy you. Do you 
                        understand?  

                                 NATHAN
                            (with a shaky voice)
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 LAYTON
                            (joyful to both of them)
                        Now you guys have fun now! But not 
                        too much fun, though. The big 
                        game's tomorrow!  

           INT. ABLED LABORATORY -- THAT NIGHT

           A giddy Scarlett is about to unveil brand-new tech to her 
           team. Darian stands by her side with Marco. Blaire and Scott 
           stand behind them. 

                                 SCARLETT
                        Side projects are important. This 
                        is one I was hoping I'd never have 
                        to use unless someone got in my 
                        way. 

           Darian pulls down the sheet. We unveil...

           A MILITARY-GRADE EXOSKELETON SUIT. It would make any human, 
           well, superhuman. 

                                 BLAIR
                        This looks like it was made for 
                        combat, not for kids. 

                                 SCARLETT
                        Combat against the only person 
                        coming between me and my dream. 
                            (beat)
                        It's just missing the Thorium power 
                        source. 

                                 DARIAN
                        Caltech is the only research lab in 
                        the world that has working Thorium. 
                        But what if Layton shows up again?

                                 SCARLETT
                        Then I'll be ready for him. But 
                        let's try taking what's precious 
                        from him first. 
           INT. ART CLASS -- NEXT MORNING

           We see Ren working on a new banner as Will walks in. He takes 
           a big nervous breath in. 

                                 WILL
                        Hey Ren. 

                                 REN
                        I don't want to talk to you. 

                                 WILL
                        I wanted to say sorry about 
                        yesterday. That wasn't me. 

                                 REN
                        Yeah it was. It was literally you. 

                                 WILL
                        I mean, it wasn't who I am. I took 
                        some bad advice and it backfired. 

                                 REN
                        You're just like the rest of them. 

                                 WILL
                        I know I can't make it up to you, 
                        but I really wish I could have gone 
                        with my gut instinct. I wish I 
                        approached it like I draw. You 
                        know. Just come up to you like I 
                        would a blank canvas. To not think 
                        so hard and to just be natural and 
                        draw what comes to my mind. And 
                        then maybe, just maybe there would 
                        have been something worth it... I'm 
                        sorry I ruined everything.

           Will begins to walk away with his head hung low.

                                 REN (O.C.)
                        I could really use some help on 
                        this banner before the big game. 

           Will turns around, Ren is smiling back at him. 

           INT. BACHELOR SOUNDSTAGE -- DAY

           Frank looks stressed as he calls Layton. Behind him we see an 
           entire crew, interview chairs, etc. for the Bachelor promo. 
           And the man of the hour: CHRIS HARRISON, Bachelor host.
                                 CHRIS HARRISON
                            (to Frank)
                        Where is he?

                                 FRANK
                            (unsure)
                        He'll be here.

           EXT. SCHOOL SPORTS LOCKER ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Layton holds flowers as he leads Anna to the locker room 
           entrance. Stacy and Joey are right behind them. Layton's 
           phone rings.

                                 LAYTON
                        Hello?

                                 FRANK (V.O)
                        DUDE! Where are you?! Your live 
                        Bachelor kick-off promo starts in 5 
                        minutes!

                                 LAYTON
                        Being a dad — sorry!

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        You said you'd be here! There are 
                        30 beautiful woman waiting!

                                 LAYTON
                            (whispers so Anna can't 
                            hear)
                        I'm keeping Anna and Will, Frank. 
                        Isn't it great?! Gotta go!

           Layton hangs up.

                                 STACY
                        Is everything ok?

                                 LAYTON
                        More than ok. 

           Layton puts his arm around Stacy in a very gentleman-like 
           manner. Joey takes notice of this. 

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS

           Frank goes to the side of the stage and makes a call.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Child Services. Can I help you?
                                 FRANK
                        I want to speak to Shirley Smith. 

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        One moment, please.

                                 SHIRLEY (V.O.)
                        This is Shirley.

           INT. LAYTON'S KITCHEN -- MORNING

           Will and Anna come out from their own rooms to something 
           glorious... Layton has cooked a magnificent Breakfast. 

           It's food galore. It's reminiscent of the feast in Hook.
           Pancakes shaped like footballs. Roasted salmon. Glorious
           scrambled eggs. We pan over to see Layton, looking at his 
           creation.

                                 LAYTON
                        Today's the big day. 

           Anna and Will's jaws drop as Maria walks in just as stunned. 

           EXT. SCHOOL SPORTS LOCKER ROOM -- THAT AFTERNOON

           Just as they're about to walk in the entrance, Layton pep 
           talks Anna. 

                                 LAYTON
                        No matter what happens, you've 
                        already blown me away by how 
                        talented and beautiful you are.  
                            (to Anna)
                        But seriously. Go prove girls can 
                        run this game. 

           Anna is determined as she feels the love from her dad. 

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD STANDS -- MOMENTS LATER

           Layton and Stacy are up in the stands excited to see their 
           kids play. Maria is next to Layton on the edge of her seat.  

           Up at the top of the stands we see Will and Ren, ready to 
           unveil their home opener banner. 

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Here come the Titans!
           The football team runs onto the field. We see Anna look up in 
           the stands and wave at her dad. 

                                 LAYTON
                        That's my daughter!

           We see Will and REN let the banner roll down, unveiling a 
           BEAUTIFUL ART PIECE. Layton looks up at them.  

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        And that's my son!

           Will walks down by Layton as he gives his son a high-five. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                            (referring to Ren)
                        How'd you do it?

                                 WILL
                        I was just myself. 

                                 LAYTON
                        I'm so proud of you. You're a true 
                        gentleman. Your mom raised someone 
                        special. And I feel so lucky that I 
                        get to be your dad.  

           We look up and see Ren smiling down at Will. 

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Now go do your thing. 

           Layton looks over at Stacy as he wraps his arm around her 
           shoulder and pulls her in. They both smile. 

                                 STACY
                            (winking)
                        You've learned a lot from your son. 

                                 LAYTON
                            (proud)
                        His mother taught him how to be a 
                        man. And I couldn't be more proud.  

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD STANDS -- A LITTLE LATER

           We're now in the 4th quarter as the game is tied. Layton and 
           Stacy are standing on their feet. 

           The opponent team is up by 3. 

           Joey lines up for the hike. Anna is ready to make the play of 
           the game. 
           We see the group of cheerleaders on the sidelines. Abbey 
           shouts to Anna. 

                                 ABBEY
                        Break a leg out there. 

                                 ANNA
                        Thanks?

                                 ABBEY
                        No, seriously. Break a leg. At 
                        least you'd be doing something 
                        productive. 

           The ball gets hiked. Joey hands it off to the running back. 
           He jukes to the right. 

           The linebacker is making a beeline towards the running back, 
           who happens to be in direct line of the cheerleaders. 

           Anna identifies this. She sees the linebacker is going to 
           take the cheerleaders out before it even happens. 

           She can get out of the way, or take the direct force of both 
           player to save Abbey. 

           Anna sacrifices her own body to save Abbey from serious 
           injury as she dives in between them. 

           ANNA GOES DOWN HARD. 

           EXT. FOOTBALL STANDS -- CONTINUOUS

           People in the stands gasp. Layton is besides himself. 

                                 LAYTON
                        She's not moving!

           Silence, then, a few seconds later... Anna pops up and shakes 
           it off. Layton and everyone else lets out a big sigh of 
           relief. 

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD -- CONTINUOUS

           Abbey's whole demeanor has changed. The girl that she used to 
           bully her has just saved her. Anna is her new hero.  

                                 ABBEY
                            (sincere)
                        Thank you... 
                                 ANNA
                            (with a smile and wink)
                        Don't want you breaking a leg out 
                        there. 
                            (beat)
                        Now are you going to cheer us on or 
                        what?

           Abbey and the rest of the cheerleaders cheer on Anna and the 
           rest of the football team.

                                 ABBEY
                        Go Anna! 

           The team lines up for third down. It's coming down to the 
           wire.  

                                 JOEY
                        Hike!

           Anna darts out, using pure speed to get past the d-back. Joey 
           throws a spiral right at her. 

           It HITS IN HER THE HANDS and bounces off. 

           Anna can't believe herself. Her confidence pummels. Until... 
           She looks up in the stands. 

           Layton is there, making a teardrop shape with his hands. It's 
           all the love Anna needs to get a surge of confidence. 

           Now it's 4th down. The team huddles as Joey addresses them. 

                                 JOEY (CONT’D)
                        Hail Mary. Someone get open. This 
                        is our last chance. Break!

           Anna lines up. The d-backs hang back. 

                                 JOEY (CONT’D)
                        Hike!

           Everyone sprints towards the end zone. 

           Anna is surrounded by boys almost a foot taller than her as 
           Joey hurls the ball up in the sky. 

           Time almost stops. Anna follows the ball with her eyes, 
           judging its every move. 

           A D-back eyes Anna, about to take her out. 

           That's when we see Nathan dive in, blocking the d-back, and 
           protecting Anna. 
           Anna then leaps into the air, jumping so high the other boys 
           don't even come close. She comes down with the..

           GAME-WINNING CATCH. 

           The crowd erupts. Layton is besides himself as him and Stacy 
           embrace with a hug. We even see Ren grab Will and give him a 
           kiss on the cheek. 

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD SIDELINES -- MOMENTS LATER

           Layton, Stacy, Will, and Ren come down to congratulate Anna.   

                                 LAYTON
                        I'm so proud of you. Promise me you 
                        won't forget about your dad once 
                        you go to the pros. 

           The coach runs up to Anna. 

                                 COACH
                        Those hops! I've never seen someone 
                        with a vertical like that! 

                                 ANNA
                        Thanks, Coach. 
                            (to Layton as the coach 
                            walks away)
                        I couldn't have done it without 
                        you. And I'm sorry I wasn't always 
                        that nice to you. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Now come on. Let's go pick up Maria 
                        and get some ice cream.

           INT. LAYTON'S HOUSE -- 30 MINUTES LATER

           As they enter, Layton's eyes go from excitement to shock.

                                 LAYTON
                        What are you doing here?

           It's Shirley, from Child Services, standing next to several 
           POLICE OFFICERS. Behind them is Maria looking very sad.

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Layton. This isn't going to be 
                        easy.

                                 ANNA
                        Dad. What's happening?
           Layton places Anna and Will behind him to protect them.

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Anna and Will. You're going to be 
                        coming with us, ok?

                                 ANNA
                            (getting emotional)
                        I'm not going anywhere. 

                                 WILL
                        Dad what is she talking about?

                                 LAYTON
                        What are you talking about?

                                 SHIRLEY
                        We got a tip Layton. And our board 
                        has determined you are not suitable 
                        to take care of these kids.

           Layton just stands there, not knowing what to say.

                                 ANNA
                        Dad help.

           Will grabs Layton's hand tight. 

                                 LAYTON
                            (in disbelief to Shirley)
                        No. I'm a great father. 

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Is it true you took Anna and Will 
                        to the scene of an active bank 
                        robbery where their lives were put 
                        in direct danger? That is 
                        inexcusable. 

           Layton can't argue against any of her points. In his head, 
           maybe he is a horrible father.

                                 LAYTON
                        Why are you doing this to us?

                                 SHIRLEY
                        You clearly don't understand the 
                        severity of the situation. You are 
                        an unfit father.

                                 LAYTON
                        No.
                                 ANNA
                        Dad tell her no.

           Layton steps forward. The cops hold him back.

                                 LAYTON
                        Like you guys could stop me.

                                 SHIRLEY
                        You're proving my point, Layton. 
                        You're a danger to them. To 
                        everyone, for that matter. 

           Layton steps back as her words sink in.

                                 SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
                            (to Anna and Will)
                        You're going to have to come with 
                        me, ok?

           Anna grips onto Layton's leg and Will keeps a tight hold on 
           Layton's hand.

                                 ANNA
                            (emotional)
                        Dad you're going to stop them 
                        right?!

                                 WILL
                            (tears)
                        Please. 

                                 LAYTON
                        I--
                            (getting choked up)
                        I'm sorry.

           Shirley takes Anna off of Layton as she loses her grip as the 
           police officers pull off Will. 

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Come on, guys. It's going to be ok.

           TIGHT ON: Anna's hand is just about to reach Layton's as his 
           hand slowly pulls away, letting her go.

                                 LAYTON
                        I'm sorry I let you guys down...  

           Shirley leads Anna and Will out. Layton stand there in shock. 
           The door shuts. His kids are gone.

           Maria runs up to Layton with the number of his lawyer.
                                 MARIA
                        Here! Call your lawyer! You can 
                        still get them back! 

           Layton ignores Maria and just stands there.

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        You're not even going to put up a 
                        fight? For your own children? How 
                        could you...

           Layton runs his hands through his hair with aggression. He 
           pulls out his phone and calls Frank.

           EXT. POOL -- CONTINUOUS

           Frank is sitting in a cabana with three women. He answers the 
           phone.

                                 FRANK
                        Layton!

                                 LAYTON (V.O.)
                        I ruined everything.

                                 FRANK
                        What happened?

                                 LAYTON (V.O.)
                        They took my kids. I feel like I'm 
                        not a fit father for them.

           INT. LAYTON'S LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Back on Layton. 

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        Hey man, some things don't last. 
                        Everything is going to be ok.

                                 LAYTON
                        Yeah?

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        Absolutely! I've got a spot this 
                        afternoon at Mama Shelters rooftop. 
                        How about to medicate with some 
                        Goose?

           Layton eyes the alcohol in the corner of his kitchen. Layton 
           hangs up. He walks over to a bottle of whiskey. 
           EXT. LAYTON'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           A crying Anna and Will get ushered into the car by Shirley. 
           Across the street we see Marco, Scarlett's right-hand strong 
           man, and one other guy in a Lincoln SUV.

           INT. LINCOLN -- CONTINUOUS

           A little down the street, Marco and his associate watch Anna 
           and Will get into Shirley's car.

                                 MARCO
                        No Layton in sight.

                                 ASSOCIATE
                        Let's grab them.

           INT. LAYTON'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Layton looks on Anna's bed. We see the Ram's jersey Layton 
           gave her. He gently picks it up and smells it. It reminds him 
           of her. Then, there's a knock. 

                                 LAYTON
                            (yelling)
                        It's open.

           INT. LAYTON'S FRONT ENTRANCE WAY -- CONTINUOUS

           Stacy walks in and sees Layton looking extremely down. 

                                 STACY
                        Surprise!

           She notices something is wrong.

                                 STACY (CONT’D)
                        It's too quiet in here. Layton. 
                        Where's Anna and Will?

           She walks over to Layton.

                                 STACY (CONT’D)
                            (smelling his breath)
                        Are you drunk? 
                            (to Joey)
                        Go in the kitchen, Joey. 

                                 LAYTON
                        They're gone.
                                 STACY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 LAYTON
                        Child services said I was an unfit 
                        father. Because I am. So I let them 
                        go...

                                 STACY
                        You let your kids go? You didn't do 
                        anything to stop them?

           Layton takes another swig of vodka.

                                 STACY (CONT’D)
                        I was wrong about you. How stupid I 
                        was to believe you were actually a 
                        good guy under all of your 
                        superhero bullshit. But guess what? 
                        You're a bad guy through and 
                        through.

           Stacy begins to walk away.

                                 LAYTON
                            (reaching out)
                        Don't go.

                                 STACY
                        Clearly I, nor Anna or Will, were 
                        ever here to let go of in the first 
                        place. 
                            (beat)
                        Don't you know you have to fight 
                        for what you want, Layton? 

                                 LAYTON
                        Please.

                                 STACY
                        Unlike you, I have a job to get to.

           Stacy slams the door behind her. Layton is all alone. 

           EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS

           Marco and his associate rear-end Shirley's car. Both cars 
           pull over to the side of the road. Marco walks up to the 
           drivers window.

                                 MARCO
                        I didn't see you there.
           His associate walks up to the back passenger door where Anna 
           and Will are.

                                 ASSOCIATE
                        But I did see you guys there.

           Tony yanks Anna out of the seat. Shirley tries to stop him 
           but she's no match.

                                 ANNA
                        Help!

                                 WILL
                        Get off of us! 

           They throw Anna and Will into the backseat and drive away.

           INT. ROOF TOP BAR -- LATER

           Layton approaches Frank who's at a table with multiple women. 
           Just when he walks up, a distinctive MAN in a suit is leaving 
           Frank's table. He shares a glance with Layton as they cross.

                                 FRANK
                        There's my boy!

                                 LAYTON
                        Who was that that guy?

                                 FRANK
                        Him? Just my bookie. He was 
                        stopping by for a little 
                        reassurance. Let me tell you, he's 
                        just as thrilled as me that your 
                        whole "dad" phase is finally over.

           Layton think about this comment.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Let's be honest, you didn't want 
                        them anyways.
                            (grabs two drinks)
                        Cheers!

           Layton realizes Frank made the call.

                                 LAYTON
                        It was you.

           Frank is confused.
                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        You made that call. You gave 
                        Shirley that video. Didn't you?

           Layton's pupils sharpen. His fists clench.

                                 FRANK
                        I did it for OUR own good.

                                 LAYTON
                        I'll rip your head off.

                                 FRANK
                        I'm your agent! You can't talk to 
                        me like that.

                                 LAYTON
                        What are you going to do about it?

                                 FRANK
                        I run your contracts. I'm 
                        untouchable.

                                 LAYTON
                        Screw the contracts. Screw The 
                        Bachelor. Screw all of this 
                        unfulfilling bullshit. You're 
                        fired.

           Layton walks out as he takes a shot of someone's drink.

           EXT. TOP OF SKYSCRAPER - MOMENTS LATER

           Marco leads a crying Anna and Will to the edge of the 
           building. We see his other men with guns surrounding them. 

                                 MARCO
                        Your daddy's not going to save you.
                            (to his men)
                        Get me Layton Wade on the phone.

           INT. LIVING ROOM -- A LITTLE LATER

           A devastated Layton holds Anna's Ram's jersey as he breathes 
           it in and tears run down his eyes. 

                                 MARIA (O.C.)
                        Layton. What more could you 
                        possibly want?

           Layton turns around. Maria is standing there.
                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        I think your entire life you've 
                        been scared to be alone. After your 
                        parents died you felt like they 
                        abandoned you. So you made sure you 
                        were the only one in your own life. 
                        Staying young by dating young. But 
                        this isn’t just about you anymore. 
                        This is about two kids who needs 
                        their father.

           Layton thinks for a second, but doesn't answer back. Maria 
           shakes her head in disappointment, then leaves the house.

           INT. LAYTON'S GARAGE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Layton looks into the Ferrari and reminisces. He spots the 
           STAIN on the seat from Will when they first rode in the car. 

                                 LAYTON
                            (to himself)
                        It's a good memory, isn't it... 

           INT. WILL'S ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           On the bed he sees...

           A surprise FAMILY PORTRAIT that Will has been working on. It 
           shows Layton, Will, and Anna as one happy family. This 
           crushes Layton. 

           Determined, Layton pulls out his phone and calls Maria. 

                                 MARIA (V.O.)
                        What is it, Layton?

                                 LAYTON
                        Maria, schedule a meeting with my 
                        attorney tomorrow. We’re not losing 
                        them without a fight. 

                                 MARIA (V.O.)
                        There's the fight in you.  

           Layton hangs up then calls Shirley. 

                                 SHIRLEY (V.O.)
                        Layton!

                                 LAYTON
                        What's wrong?
                                 SHIRLEY (V.O.)
                        They took Anna and Will!

                                 LAYTON
                        Who took them?!

                                 SHIRLEY
                        Two men! Oh my god I'm so sorry 
                        there's nothing I could have done!

                                 LAYTON
                        Where are you?!

           EXT. LA SKY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Layton is flying low to the ground in search for the two men, 
           but he can't find them. His phone buzzes as he lands to take 
           the message.  

           TIGHT ON PHONE: A text from the Police Sergeant "Robbery in 
           progress. Caltech." but Layton ignores it.

           He goes to land on the sidewalk. That's when his phone rings.

                                 MARCO (V.O.)
                        Layton Wade.

           Layton immediately recognizes the voice.

                                 LAYTON
                        Who is this?

                                 ANNA/WILL (V.O.)
                        Daddy! DAD!

                                 LAYTON
                        ANNA! WILL!

                                 MARCO (V.O.)
                        I have something you want.

                                 LAYTON
                        Don't you touch them!

                                 MARCO (V.O.)
                        You want them back? We're at the 
                        U.S. Finance building. You better 
                        hurry. It's a long way down for 
                        such a precious set of twins.
           EXT. TOP OF SKYSCRAPER - MOMENTS LATER

           Layton emerges. He sees Marco hanging Anna and Will over the 
           side of the building. 

                                 LAYTON
                        What do you want?

                                 MARCO
                        It's not what I want, but what my 
                        boss wants. 

           INT. CALTECH LAB -- CONTINUOUS

           Scarlett is wearing her military-grade exoskeleton suit. She 
           stands 10 feet tall. Her other men surround her. Scared 
           employees, including Stacy, are on the ground shaking. 

                                 SCARLETT
                        What's the matter? 
                            (pointing at Stacy)
                        You. Would you be so kind to show 
                        me to the Thorium?

           Stacy leads Scarlett to the reactor. 

           EXT. TOP OF SKYSCRAPER - CONTINUOUS

           Layton inches closer to Marco who is still holding Anna and 
           Will over the edge. The bad guys cock their guns.

                                 LAYTON
                        Kids. It's going to be ok. I 
                        promise.

                                 MARCO
                        Don't lie to them.

           Marco checks his watch. Then makes a call on his phone.

           INT. CALTECH LAB -- CONTINUOUS

           Stacy is taking Scarlett to the Thorium. 

                                 MARCO (V.O.)
                        He's here.

                                 SCARLETT 
                        Good.
           Scarlett hangs up as Stacy opens a lab door, and that's when 
           we see it. 

           A GLOWING BALL OF THORIUM. Scarlett's eyes widen. She walks 
           up to it and grabs it with a special glove. 

           Stacy inserts the Thorium into her suit. Her suit surges to 
           its max potential.  

                                 SCARLETT (CONT’D)
                        It's complete. 

           EXT. TOP OF SKYSCRAPER - CONTINUOUS

           Marco dangles Anna and Will off the side of the building. 
           Layton inches forward in hopes to stop him.

                                 MARCO
                        Now what you're going to do is let 
                        me and my men go, or we'll use you 
                        and your son and daughter as target 
                        practice.

                                 LAYTON
                        Not happening.

                                 MARCO
                        How about I just let them go, and 
                        shoot you? Yeah. Let's do that.

           Just then, a DOZEN POLICE OFFICERS enter the rooftop. 
           Everyone's guns are pointed at each other. It's a standoff.

           TIGHT ON: one of the bad guy's trigger finger shaking. He 
           could fire at any moment.

           BANG! His gun goes off, striking the POLICE SERGEANT. Layton 
           runs over to assist as other guns start firing. MARCO IS 
           SHOT, his hold on Anna and Will releases as they FREE FALL.

                                 ANNA
                            (as her voice fades)
                        DAD!

                                 WILL
                        Help!

           Layton turns and sees Will free-falling. He uses he super 
           speed to fly off the roof and grab Will. 

           But Anna is nowhere to be seen. Layton is devastated, 
           until...
           To our surprise, Anna is FLYING IN THE AIR! She is...

           A REAL-LIFE SUPERHERO! We can hardly believe our eyes as Anna 
           floats heroically in the sky.

                                 LAYTON
                        You can fly?!

                                 ANNA
                        I guess so? COOL!

           Realization sets in for Anna that she too is a superhero. 
           Will is just as surprised. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        OMG I'M A SUPER HERO LIKE YOU, DAD!

                                 MARCO
                        You've got to be kidding...

                                 LAYTON
                        Let's take care of these guys. 

           We see Marco and the rest of the bad guys running towards the 
           exit. Anna and Layton give chase as bullets fly. Will ducks 
           for cover. 

           Anna throws a right hook but misses one of the men. He aims 
           his gun at her. She barrel rolls out of the way just before 
           he fires his gun, but Will is in the line of fire just behind 
           her... 

                                 ANNA
                            (thinking he was shot)
                        Will!

           Close on Will, with his arms over his head, shielding 
           himself. We pull back to real with him that he's fine. We, 
           and he, notice A FORCE FIELD has appeared around Will, saving 
           his life. 

                                 WILL
                        Holy crap! 

                                 LAYTON
                        You too!? My kids are superheroes! 

                                 WILL
                        I never did like people coming into 
                        my safe space...

           His forcefield stops the bullet as it expands protecting 
           Layton and Anna. 
           POW! Layton drop kicks the man. BAM! Anna takes a rope and 
           flies around the bad guys, tying them up.

           The officer hauls them away as Layton goes over to Anna and 
           Will.

                                 LAYTON
                        Guys, I wanted to say I'm sorry. I 
                        didn't want to let you go. I really 
                        didn't, But thought I wasn't good 
                        enough for you. I thought I 
                        couldn't be the dad you deserved. 
                        You're the smartest, sweetest kids 
                        I could ask for.

                                 WILL
                        You're the only dad we want. 

                                 ANNA
                        We love you, dad. 

           Layton spots a SMALL CUT on Anna's face. He then KISSES HIS 
           TWO FINGERS and places them over the wound to comfort her, 
           just like Rachel and Anna did to him previously.

                                 LAYTON
                        Love you guys.

           Anna, Will, and Layton embrace. Then Layton goes to the 
           Police Sergeant to make sure he's ok.

                                 POLICE SERGEANT
                        I'm fine. But get to Caltech. 
                        Officers are responding but 
                        something bad is going on over 
                        there. Something real bad.  

                                 LAYTON
                            (realization Stacy's 
                            there)
                        Stacy... Oh no.

                                 ANNA
                        I can help!

                                 WILL
                        So can I!

                                 LAYTON
                        You guys have done great, but 
                        you're still just kids. I've got 
                        this.

           Layton flies off to save Stacy.
           INT. CALTECH -- CONTINUOUS

           Layton crash lands through the roof of Caltech, stopping the 
           bad guys in their tracks.

                                 LAYTON
                        Daddy's home.

           One of the bad guys grabs Stacy and holds a gun to her head.

                                 STACY
                            (plea for help)
                        Layton...

                                 BAD GUY
                        I'll shoot her!

                                 LAYTON
                        Be cool. Put the gun down.

           Then, Scarlett PUNCHES THROUGH A WALL, and emerges.

                                 SCARLETT
                            (to her associate)
                        Go ahead. Put it down. 

           Her associate puts the gun down as Layton looks up at the 
           impressive machine she built.  

                                 LAYTON
                            (to Stacy)
                        Get out of here. 

           Stacy leaves with some of the other employees. 

                                 SCARLETT
                        Layton. Again, you're coming in 
                        between me and my goal to better 
                        humanity. 

           Scarlett CHARGES Layton with full force, blowing him back 
           into the wall. 

           Layton springs up and goes to punch Scarlett's suit. His fist 
           is stopped by her powerful exoskeleton arm. 

                                 LAYTON
                        Oh shit--

           Scarlett punches Layton back with so much such force he flies 
           through the 2 cement walls. 
           INT. CALTECH HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           Stacy runs through the halls with the other employees. We 
           hear the destruction Layton and Scarlett are causing in the 
           background.

           Just as they're about to reach the exit, the earlier bad guy 
           appears in front of them, stopping them in their tracks. 

                                 BAD GUY
                        We can't let you guys leave. 
                        Hostages always come in handy. 

           Stacy shields the people behind her. He directs them back 
           inside, gesturing with his gun. 

           As they walk down the hall they continue to hear the chaos 
           around them. 

           Just then, a part of the ceiling collapses on top of them. 

           As they slowly stand, Stacy notices the bad guy's gun has 
           fallen from his hand. As he reaches to get it, Stacy sees an 
           opportunity. She pics up a piece of the rubble and smashes it 
           across his face, knocking him out.

                                 STACY
                        Let's go!

           INT. CALTECH -- CONTINUOUS

           Layton, shaking off being thrown through a wall, flies at 
           Scarlett with super speed, slamming her through the floor and 
           into the ground below. Windows shatter from the shockwave.

           Before he can strike again, Scarlett pile drives Layton back 
           into the ground, and then wraps a death grip around Layton's 
           throat.

                                 SCARLETT
                        Never, ever, come between me, and 
                        my work. 

                                 LAYTON
                            (can hardly speak)
                        You tried to kill my kids. 

                                 SCARLETT
                        The world wouldn't miss them. But 
                        they would miss me. I make a 
                        difference. 
           Layton finds enormous strength from within to crush 
           Scarlett's right robot arm, now useless. 

                                 LAYTON
                        My kids are everything to me. And 
                        they'll have a bigger impact on 
                        this world than you ever will. 

           Scarlett drop kicks Layton with such force, he can't get up. 

                                 SCARLETT
                        It's too bad you'll never get to 
                        see my success. 

           Scarlett winds up her left arm, aligns it with Layton's head 
           and pulls it back, readying for a devastating blow.

           Layton loses all hope, until he turns and sees Stacy worried, 
           with the employees behind her. They're trapped with Scarlett 
           blocking their exit. 

           Layton looks up, and with one last bit of strength, kicks 
           Scarlett off of him. He delivers blow after blow to her suit. 
           It begins to fail. 

           Layton goes for the Thorium. He reaches for it, grabs it in 
           excruciating pain, and throws it outside where it EXPLODES. 

           The suit collapses as Scarlett detaches from her suit.

                                 LAYTON
                        It's over Scarlett. 

           The red and blue lights from outside flash across her face. 
           The police arrive and take away Scarlett.

           EXT. CALTECH -- MOMENTS LATER

           News crews are beginning to arrive. 

                                 LAYTON
                            (to Stacy)
                        I'm so glad you're ok. You wouldn't 
                        believe what happened. Anna and 
                        Will have super powers! I can't 
                        wait for you to see.

                                 STACY
                        Layton, just because you came back 
                        to help me doesn't mean I'm taking 
                        you back. How do I know you can 
                        change?
                                 LAYTON
                        It's not like that.

                                 STACY
                        No? How is it any different?

           Layton hesitates as he's not able to come up with an answer. 
           Stacy walks away. Layton hangs his head low, just as dozens 
           of reporters run up to Layton. All Layton can do is watch 
           Stacy walk away into the night.

                                 REPORTER 1
                        Layton! You're a real hero!

                                 REPORTER 2
                        Are you excited to find the one on 
                        The Bachelor tomorrow?

                                 LAYTON
                        I've already found her.

           Layton flies away, determined to get Stacy back.

           INT. STACY'S APARTMENT -- LATER

           A crying Stacy sits on the couch, looking out the window.

                                 LAYTON (O.C.)
                        I can't lose you again.

           Stacy looks up and sees Layton standing there.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        You shouldn't leave your windows 
                        open. Bugs can fly right in.

           Stacy wants to crack a smirk but she doesn't.

                                 LAYTON (CONT’D)
                        Please, Stacy. Let me show you that 
                        I've changed. Let me show Joey that 
                        I can be that father figure.

                                 STACY
                        They're kids, they don't need a 
                        superhero. They need stability. 
                        They need a dad that shows up and 
                        fights for them. We can't have 
                        someone fly off when things get 
                        hard.
                                 LAYTON
                        When my parents died, I was angry. 
                        That they left me behind. So the 
                        rest of my life, I felt if I let 
                        anyone in, they would just 
                        disappear too, but I'm not scared 
                        anymore. Joey, Anna, Will. You. I'm 
                        going to be there for the hard 
                        stuff. Every minute of every day. 
                        You all saved me, and now if you'll 
                        let me, I want to be the father and 
                        man you all deserve.

           Stacy internalizes this, then smiles. She wraps her arms 
           around Layton as the two embrace each other.

           INT. HOSPITAL -- DAY

           Layton is ready to go on camera for a promotional piece. A 
           MAKEUP girl walks up to Layton.

                                 LAYTON
                        Actually, I'm good.

           Layton has finally embraced his age as he looks to camera.

                                 DIRECTOR (O.C.)
                        Action!

                                 LAYTON
                        Imagine a person who is told their 
                        disability will be a lifelong 
                        struggle.

           Layton puts his hands on a young child's wheelchair just as 
           Stacy, Anna, Will, Maria and Joey walk into frame. They all 
           walk down the hospital hallway as they speak to camera.

                                 STACY
                        Now imagine a place where that same 
                        person is told he can do anything.

                                 ANNA
                        That place is the Los Angeles 
                        Unified Hospital.

                                 WILL
                        Send your love today.

                                 MARIA
                        And give patients hope, strength, 
                        and joy!
                                 DIRECTOR (O.C.)
                        CUT! That's a wrap, everyone.

           We see an entire production crew emerge. The Hospital 
           OFFICIAL, ASHLEY, walks up to Layton.

                                 ASHLEY
                        Here's your promotional check.

           Layton reaches for it, but stops.

                                 LAYTON
                        No need. Put it back into the 
                        hospital where it belongs.

           Maria puts her hand on Layton's shoulder after hearing this. 

                                 MARIA
                        Now that's my boy.

           EXT. HOSPITAL -- MOMENTS LATER

           Layton, Anna, Will, Joey, and Stacy embrace as one happy 
           family.

                                 ANNA
                        What are we going to do the rest of 
                        the day?

                                 LAYTON
                            (with a big smile)
                        I heard cheese fest is happening in 
                        Wisconsin.

           Stacy and Joey hold on to Layton, and Will holds onto Anna as 
           the they all fly up into the sky together. 

                                     END OF MOVIE
