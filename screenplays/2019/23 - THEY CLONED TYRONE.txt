                                                               BLACK...

           Rising, animated CHATTER. And the RATTLE of dice. 

                                 GOLD GRILL (V.O.)
                        Seven eleven, c’mon, show me love.

           THE CLEAR BLUE SKY

           Monochromatic... until a 747 soars into view, two suspicious 
           ass VAPOR TRAILS tracing its flight path... But nevermind 
           those for now. Let’s just DRIFT ALL THE WAY DOWN to the

           SIDEWALK,

           where TWO DICE TUMBLE TO A STOP ON THE PAVEMENT: snake eyes. 
           Hungry hands swoop in, scooping up loose bill, placing bets.

                                 GOLD GRILL
                        Man now I know these dice loaded.

                          DREADS
           Yeah, yeah, blame the dice. 
                                                        TANK TOP 
                                              Nigga shut yo whinin’ ass up.

           Just your friendly neighborhood dice game. Then... a SQUEAK. 
           Wheels in need of WD-40. Heralding the arrival of BABY G, 7-
           ish, a Capri Sun in his hand; he kickstands his bike...

                                 BABY G
                        Y’all seen Fontaine?

                                 GOLD GRILL
                        Naw, now move out the way. 

           Annoyed, Baby G rides off. And we FOLLOW HIM through this 
           derelict Southern neighborhood colloquially known as  

           THE GLEN,

           past boarded up abodes and homes barely holding on... old 
           folks fighting unkempt crab grass with push-mowers... a 
           school bus he should probably be on right now... rusted 
           lemons... crackheads... 

           It’s active out here. Folks just... around. Baby G sips his 
           juice, continues... We stay with him, until... CLANKING. 
           Metal on metal. Baby G’s eyes snap to the sound’s direction. 
           When he rounds the corner...

                                 BABY G
                        Fontaine!
           A few yards ahead in somebody’s front yard: two SWOLE 
           MUHFUCKAS, huddled over an ad hoc bench, shouting insults at 
           the guy on his back. The guy currently lifting an ungodly 
           number of rusted plates...  

                      SWOLE MUHFUCKA
                                                     BABY G (CONT'D)
           One more! Weak ass nigga!
                                              Hey Fontaine!

           FONTAINE racks the weight with no assistance. Lets out an 
           exhausted GRUNT before finally sitting up and revealing 
           himself to us. Late-20s... ripped like vintage denim... a 
           face as menacing as his physique...

                                 BABY G (CONT’D)
                        Hey Fonta--

                                 FONTAINE
                        I heard you the first time, boy. 
                        Fuck you want?

           I/E. FONTAINE’S ‘79 CUTLASS SUPREME - LATER

           Candy paint... white walled rims... cocaine-white leather 
           seats... a rag-top... Not so much an automobile as a rolling 
           “My Dick’s Bigger Than Yours” billboard. Baby G rides 
           shotgun, knee-deep in another Capri Sun. 

                                 BABY G
                        ... and then there’s Patrick. 
                             (sip)
                        I can’t believe you don’t watch 
                        Spongebob. Why not?
                             (sip)
                        Huh? Fontaine why you don’t watch--

                                 FONTAINE
                        Cause I don’t, aight? Damn.

                                 BABY G
                        ........... My sister Keisha 
                        sixteen, she watch it.

           Fontaine hooks a left, and THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD... we see 
           an ABANDONED LAUNDROMAT up ahead on the corner. 

                                 BABY G (CONT’D)
                        There he go. See, I told you.

           Across the street from the laundromat: a YOUNG DEALER, no 
           older than 17, posted up. Fontaine looks a bit exasperated as 
           he spies a junkie approach... dap the kid up... scuttle away. 
           Nonetheless, he slows the Cutlass to a creep...
           As they pass, Fontaine and the dealer lock eyes. He scowls 
           into the car, right hand resting coolly on his waistband. 
           Fontaine just sighs to himself before speeding back up...

                                 BABY G (CONT’D)
                        On one episode, Patrick starts 
                        workin’ at the Krusty Krab--

           ... hooking a right...

                                 BABY G (CONT’D)
                        --but he keeps messin’ up so 
                        Spongebob puts him on the phones--

           ... then another quick right, through an ALLEY: a shortcut...

                                 BABY G (CONT’D)
                        But then Patrick gets mad cause he 
                        thinks everybody’s callin’ him a 
                        crusty crab. It’s funny.

           One last right, bringing Fontaine back full circle...

                                 BABY G (CONT’D)
                             (....... sip)
                        My grandma got Ninja Turtles on 
                        tape. She got a tape player at her 
                        house. You heard of Ninja Turtles?

           VROOM! The Young Dealer doesn’t even realize what’s happening 
           until the Cutlass is right on his ass. 

                                 YOUNG DEALER 
                        Ay!

           He tries to dodge but -- CRACK! -- fails. Hits the ground 
           hard. Fontaine mechanically hops 

           OUT

           and stalks towards the Young Dealer, who’s HOWLING in pain. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        You hit my car, nigga.

           CRUNCH. Fontaine stomps on the kid’s most-likely-broken leg; 
           he SCREAMS. Eyes burning with anger. 

                                 YOUNG DEALER
                        I swear to God, cuz--

                                 FONTAINE
                        Swear what?! What you gone do? Huh? 
           Fontaine CHOKES his ass, but at the last moment shows mercy, 
           releasing his grip. The Young Dealer gasps as Fontaine 
           confiscates his gun and all the cash in his pockets.

                                 FONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        Did I give you permission to trap 
                        in my hood?

                                 YOUNG DEALER
                        Fuck you. When Isaac--

           Another stomp. Another SCREAM. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        This yo only warnin’, hear me? And 
                        tell that bitch ass nigga Isaac if 
                        he want smoke, he know where I’m at.

           FONTAINE’S CUTLASS - LATER

           Fontaine sorts through his new cash. Gives Baby G a five.

                                 BABY G
                        Five dollars? Where the rest?

                                 FONTAINE
                        Ain’t no rest, that’s all you get 
                        for wastin’ my time. 

                                 BABY G
                        Maaaann, I’m tired of snitchin’. 
                        When you gone put me on? 

           For a moment, Fontaine’s hardness cracks as he recognizes 
           Baby G for what he is: a child. But only for a moment.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Boy if you don’t go do some damn 
                        homework or sum’n. Get the hell out 
                        my car... Talkin’ bout put you on.

           Baby G sucks his teeth. Dips. Fontaine can only sigh.

           INT. WE GOT DRANKS! MINI-MART - LATER

           Fontaine, grabbing an ANACONDA MALT LIQUOR. 

           REGISTER - LATER

           Already sippin’ that 40. “Have You Seen This Person?” flyers 
           adorn the safety glass: all black men and women.
                                 FONTAINE
                        ... pack of ‘Rillos, and let me get 
                        one of them scratch-offs.

           He drops a few crumpled bills on the counter; as he walks

           OUTSIDE,

           he tries his luck with the scratch-off: You Lose! Immediately 
           litters the worthless lotto ticket. When he rounds the 
           corner, he comes across FROG, 50s, homeless. Incoherent, 
           wasted, an empty 7/11 cup in his hand. 

                                 FROG
                        It’s in the water, youngblood. 

                                 FONTAINE
                             (blessing his cup)
                        I know, Frog. I know. 

           INT. FONTAINE’S TRAP HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           CLOSE on an OLD POLAROID clipped to the refrigerator: A 
           TEENAGE FONTAINE AND A YOUNG BOY, NO OLDER THAN TEN. They 
           look a lot alike. PULL OUT to reveal the kitchen: baking 
           soda... uncut coke... dirty dishes... and Fontaine making 
           PB&J sandwiches. He grabs one of the sandwiches, heads into

           THE LIVING ROOM.

           More unsavory accoutrements. A trap house of the highest 
           order. He makes his way to a CLOSED DOOR. KNOCKS. 

                                 FONTAINE 
                        Mama, you hungry? 

                                 MAMA (O.S.)
                        ......... I’m okay, baby. Josephine 
                        had a fish fry over at the community 
                        center last night. Still full.

           LATER

           Fontaine, on the faux-suede couch. Smashing his lunch with a 
           side of malt liquor. Smoking purp between bites. Watching TV. 

           ON THE SCREEN... a poorly-shot commercial: hackneyed zooms on  
           a bucket of fried chicken. Inserts of folks lovin’ the shit 
           outta said chicken. Motherfuckers dancin’ after every bite. 
           Barry White’s long-lost brother narrating. 
                                 COMMERCIAL (ON TV)
                        --Gon’ getcha summa dis here limited-
                        time-only Hotbox Spicy Chicken! 
                        Cause remember, who needs vices when 
                        you got all these herbs and spices 
                        at discount prices. So if you’re in

                        brown... at Got Damn! Fried Chic--

           KNOCK, KNOCK... Fontaine gets up, heads to the door. Listens. 
           But doesn’t open it yet. Peephole’s covered with duct tape.

                                 A DEEP VOICE (O.S.)(MUFFLED)
                        .... Domino’s, mane. 

           Must be the password, cause Fontaine unlocks all six latches 
           and opens the door, revealing BIG MOSS, 20s, perspired. Looks 
           the part of a delivery man, right down to the pizza bag.

                         FONTAINE
                                                        BIG MOSS
           Big Mosssss. 
                                              Wus hannin’.

           He follows Fontaine to the couch. Plops down beside him. They 
           open a pizza box. But it ain’t pizza inside... it’s rubber-
           banded bundles of dead presidents. Fontaine starts feeding 
           stacks into the MONEY COUNTER on the coffee table.

                                 BIG MOSS (CONT’D)
                        You straight, mane? 

           Big Moss whips out a battery-powered POCKET FAN. It’s loud.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Isaac keep tryna make a play over 
                        by the laundromat. 

                                 BIG MOSS
                        Say the word, we’ll roll out.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Nigga you look like you bout to 
                        pass out. Go get some damn water. 
                        Sweatin’ all over my couch. 

                                 BIG MOSS
                        This ol’ dusty ass couch...

           He heads into the kitchen. Fontaine gets back to the money... 

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... This shit light... Ay! The hell 
                        goin’ on Big Moss...
           Big Moss returns, fanning himself, eating that other PB&J.

                                 BIG MOSS
                        Say what now?
                             (off Fontaine, who’s 
                              staring at his sandwich)
                        ....... I wasn’t thirsty, damn. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... This is three bands short. 

                                 BIG MOSS
                        See what had happened was... I 
                        couldn’t find Slick Charles. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        He wasn’t at the Motel 6?

                                 BIG MOSS
                        Nawl.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Well where else did you look?

                                 BIG MOSS 
                        That’s pretty much it. That’s where 
                        he usually be...... I can go check--

                                 FONTAINE
                        I’ll find him. 

           I/E. FONTAINE’S CUTLASS / THE TRACK - NIGHT

           A street you zoom through unless you’ve got “business” here. 
           PROSTITUTES prowl the corners, heads turning like owls when The 
           Big Dick Cutlass swerves into view. Fontaine rolls down the 
           window as BIDDY, an old PRO in pink spandex, steps forward. 

                                 BIDDY
                        Hey Fontaaaaaaaaine.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Where Slick Charles at?

                                 BIDDY
                        Oh... He must owe you money.

                                 FONTAINE
                        That toot you snortin’ ain’t free. 

                                 BIDDY
                             (wiping her nose)
                        Well maybe I seen’t him, maybe not.  
                                 FONTAINE
                        I just wanna check in with him.

                                 BIDDY
                        Right. And I just wanna save a lil 
                        money and go back to school.
                            (he coughs up a fifty)
                        ... The Royal. 

           Fontaine drives off. But WE STAY HERE... until we spy the 
           headlights of a CHEVY CELEBRITY in the distance pop on... it 
           pulls away from the curb... heads after Fontaine... 

                                 YO-YO (V.O.)
                        Fuck you, Slick Charles! I’m 
                        retiring. For real this time. 

           INT. THE ROYAL MOTEL - ROOM 22 - NIGHT

           YO-YO, 20s, eyes that haven’t given up hope yet, stuffs her 
           shit in a small suitcase: clothes, make-up compacts, stacks 
           of half-finished CROSSWORD PUZZLE BOOKS. 

           SLICK CHARLES, mid-30s, beleaguered, paces by the smoked-
           stained door, garbed in a gaudy purple suit circa The Players 
           Ball 1996. Some of his OTHER PROS lounge around lazily. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Slow down... Just... tell me why my 
                        Ace Poon Koon is feelin’ blue 
                        instead of brand got damn new.

                                 YO-YO
                        ... So this clean-cut white nigga 
                        pulls up in a G-Wagon, so my spider 
                        senses already tinglin’; I mean he 
                        either twelve or on some Hannibal 
                        shit, but I get in the car anyway. 
                        So we go around the corner, hit the 
                        lights. He pulls his pants down, 
                        whips out a razor blade, cuts his 
                        junk with it. Looking at me like 
                        I’m supposed to touch that nasty 
                        shit. Fuck I look like?  

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        ... Yo-Yo, sweetheart... ya looks 
                        like a hoe.

                                 YO-YO
                        See, I ain’t gotta deal with yo 
                        bullshit no more. You know why? 
                        Block chain. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 YO-YO (CONT'D)
                        Remember Thursday Tony, the trick I 
                        used to see on Tuesdays who lost his 
                        house investing in bootleg Bitcoin? 
                        Well his plight got me researching 
                        the shit. Cryptocurrency’s a bubble, 
                        everybody knows that. But block 
                        chain? That’s the future. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Oh you gone invest in block chain 
                        now? That before or after you drop 
                        everything to backpack through 
                        Patagonia? By the way, did Interpol 
                        ever hit you back about that résumé? 
                        How’s that novel coming?

                                 YO-YO
                        Kiss. My. Ass, Slick Charles!

           I/E. FONTAINE’S CUTLASS - NIGHT

           Approaching a motel with a half-lit neon marquee:

                                TH_  R_YAL  _O_EL
                     Free   HBO    and   Continental   Breakfast

           Fontaine turns into the lot. Parks. Hops

           OUT

           the whip. Spots Yo-Yo coming towards him, making a big to-do 
           of her exit. As they pass each other--

                                 YO-YO
                        He in room 22.

           Perfect. Fontaine continues to room 22. RAPS on the door.

                                 SLICK CHARLES (O.S.)
                        Girl that’s why I named ya Yo-yo, 
                        cause ya always come right baaa--

           The door opens--

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        --aaaaahhhh shit!

           --and CLOSES just as quickly. But Fontaine’s already BRUISING 
           HIS WAY INSIDE before Slick Charles can lock it. 
                                                        FONTAINE
                  SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
           Playa, playa, I can explain!
                                              Fuck you, Slick Charles! 

           SHAPOW! Fontaine SLAPS THE TASTE OUT OF HIS MOUTH. The other 
           pros raise subtle “Oh, damn” eyebrows, stifling laughter. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Got dammit! Look, a pimp ain’t tryna 
                        finesse ya, playa! I just ain’t as 
                        liquid as I’d like to be right now!

           Fontaine starts digging through his shit...

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        Hold up now, Fontaine! I am the 
                        2005 International Players Ball 
                        “Pimp of the Year!” Show me some 
                        muthafuckin’ respect!  
                             (Fontaine finds his stash)
                        Come on, that’s all my contingency! 
                        These hoes ain’t earnin’ like they 
                        usually do with this recent cold 
                        front. Gimme a few mo’ days.
                             (Fontaine heads out)
                        You’s a grinch, ya hear me?

                                 FONTAINE
                        Be honest witcha, I been kinda 
                        annoyed all day. Been itchin’ to 
                        knock a nigga the fuck out. So how 
                        bout it? You get an extension, and I 
                        get to knock you the fuck out. Deal?

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Just take the shit. Dramatic ass.

           He does. Slams the door behind him. The girls don’t even look 
           up, still painting their nails and watching TV, “oblivious.” 

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        ... Y’all ain’t shit.

           INT. FONTAINE’S CUTLASS - LATER

           Fontaine hops in. Takes a moment. Notices the CHEVY CELEBRITY 
           parked right behind him. Bullshit-meter flashing neon red, 
           Fontaine scoops his .45 out the stash-box. Cautiously steps 

           OUT.

           You can hear the BASS through the car’s aluminum frame as 
           Fontaine pounds on the trunk. 
                                 FONTAINE
                        Ay! Move this shit!

           The Chevy’s rear window rolls down... 

                                 THE RADIO (IN THE CHEVY)
                        Stomp a muthafucka, steal a 
                        muthafucka! (Skeet, skeet!) Shoot a 
                        muthafucka, kill a muthafucka! 
                        (Skeet, skeet!)

           ... revealing the YOUNG DEALER FROM BEFORE. ISAAC, 30s, rival 
           dealer and the kid’s OG, at the wheel. And just as Fontaine 
           recognizes him, a SNUB-NOSE .38 emerges from the dark window--

           BANG! BANG! BANG! 

           No time to shoot back; he recoils, scrambles into 

           HIS WHIP,

           throws that bitch in reverse, crashes into the Celebrity. 

           Fontaine grimaces. Breaths slowing... adrenaline coursing... 
           immobility encroaching... Feels his ribs... 

           ... they’re covered in blood. 

           The Young Dealer appears outside his window. They share a 
           moment of eye contact, and in that moment, we see fear in the 
           kid’s heart. Nonetheless, he summons the wherewithal and--

           BANG! BANG! BANG!

           Glass SHATTERS... the Young Dealer scrambles... TIRES SCREECH 
           as the Chevy burns rubber... Fontaine tries to find his 
           bearings... Keep your eyes open... to grit it out... Keep 
           your fuckin’ eyes open, goddammit!... to hold on... as we--

           SLIP INTO HIS POV... and watch the world grow dark... each 
           blink labored, each blink enshrouding us in TOTAL BLACKNESS... 

           Blink... the Little Trees air freshener speckled with 
           blood... Blink... Slick Charles watching, horrified, in the 
           distance... Blink... shape and form slowly congealing into 
           unidentifiable haze...

           .                                              ....... Blink.
                    THEY CLONED TYRONE.
           INT. FONTAINE’S TRAP HOUSE - HIS ROOM - MORNING

           ... But lo! OUR EYES OPEN... revealing Fontaine’s room. When 
           shit finally comes back into focus, he springs the fuck up in 
           bed. Immediately feeling for bullet holes... Not a scratch.

           Takes a while for him to shake it off. 

           EXT. SOMEBODY’S FRONT YARD - LATER

           Fontaine, bangin’ on the weights.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - LATER

           Walking through the hood. Coming across a JUNKIE writhing on 
           the ground. Stepping over him without a second glance.

           EXT. WE GOT DRANKS! MINI-MART - LATER

           Anaconda and a scratch-off: You Lose! Litters the ticket as 
           he turns the corner and spots Frog. Pissy drunk. Incoherent.

                                 FROG
                        Youngblooood. Don’t brush ya teef.

           He holds up his 7/11 cup. Fontaine blesses him. Continues. 
           But quickly stops when he notices someone in the distance...  
           a man... frantic... dragging himself inch by inch towards the 
           mini-mart... a large red stain on his shirt...

           Fontaine squints, steps forwards to get a better look. His 
           eyes must be playing tricks on him: Is that...... me? 

           ERRRRK! A beastly, matte-black Charger SWERVES into view, 
           right in front of whoever the fuck that is. The doors open; 
           two MYSTERIOUS MEN pounce out like S.W.A.T. and accost him. 

                                 WHOEVER THE FUCK THAT IS (DISTANT)
                        Wait! Wait! Get off me! Noooooooo!

           And just as soon as they came -- ERRRRK! -- they peel off. 
           The hood goes on about its day. For a while, Fontaine just 
           stares at the empty street: Weird... Frog laughs. 

                                 FROG
                        Off to see the wizard...

           INT. FONTAINE’S TRAP HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Another PB&J. Fontaine grabs his half. Heads into the 
           LIVING ROOM

           and to his mama’s door. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        Mama... Want sum’n to eat?

                                 MAMA  (O.S.)
                        ............ I’m okay, thanks baby.  
                        I’m watching my stories. 

           En route to the couch, Fontaine notices the PIZZA BOX on the 
           coffee table. He sighs, the sight of it jogging his memory.

           INT. THE ROYAL MOTEL - ROOM 22 - LATER

           Slick Charles, sitting in a (most likely) pissed-stained 
           chair. Smoking the life out of a Newport when-- KNOCK, KNOCK! 
           He almost swallows his cigarette. But he does so quietly. 
           Eyes narrowing. His girls don’t knock like that...

           KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK! Slick Charles steels himself... creeps 
           towards the ratty window curtains... slides them to the side--

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Jesus!

           --and spies Fontaine staring back at him. He damn near dies.

                      FONTAINE (O.S.)
           Open the door!
                                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT'D)
                                              Hell nawl! It’s too early for 
                                              the voodoo bullshit!

                                 FONTAINE (O.S.)
                        You got five seconds!....... Five!

           Slick Charles paces: You are not goin’ crazy, Slick Charles...

                                 FONTAINE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Four! I’m serious, Slick Charles! 

                       SLICK CHARLES
                                                 FONTAINE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           There is a rational 
           explanation, Slick Charles...
                                              Three! I’ma bust ya shit 
                                              open!

           Fuck it. Slick Charles opens the door. Fontaine bursts in. 

                                 FONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        You know why I’m here! 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Can we talk about the more pressin’ 
                        matter at hand?!
                                 FONTAINE
                        And what’s that?

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        That you died!

           His words land, but Fontaine ignores it. Or tries to. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        The hell is my money?!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Did you not hear me?! You. Got. 
                        Lit. Up. They killed yo black ass!

           It’s just too insane to believe. Prophetic dream be damned.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Don’t make me ask you again.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        You took it! Last night! Went all 
                        through my personal effects!
                        Don’t believe me? Yo-Yo stepped out 
                        on me right before you came. She 
                        had to saw somethin’. 

           I/E. FONTAINE’S CUTLASS / THE TRACK - LATER

           Fontaine at the wheel; Slick Charles in the backseat, 
           slouched aaaaall the way down, dark shades hiding his eyes. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Go head. Put the 2005 International 
                        Players Ball “Pimp of the Year” in 
                        the backseat. Emasculate me in front 
                        of my employees.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Be glad you ain’t in the trunk.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        I’m lookin’ fool, leave me ‘lone...
                        There she go. In the inconspicuous 
                        lime green dress.

           Up ahead, Yo-Yo’s hopping into somebody’s car. Fontaine tails 
           them around the corner. Pulls up alongside. Rolls down his 
           window. Gets the john’s attention; he rolls his down, too.

                         THE JOHN
           You don’t see we busy here?
                                                        FONTAINE
                                              My bad Yo-Yo. Gotta steal you 
                                              for a minute.
                                 YO-YO
                        That Slick Charles’ broke ass in 
                        the back?

                                 SLICK CHARLES (O.S.)(DUCKED DOWN)
                        .......... No.

           FONTAINE’S CUTLASS - LATER

           Yo-Yo scoots into the front seat. Slams the door. Sighs.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Usually when I hear retirement I 
                        think Boca Raton... California...

                                 YO-YO
                        I am retired. I just need enough 
                        bread to get to Memphis-- 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Ah, the slippery slope of 
                        recidivism.

                                 YO-YO
                        --And when I get there, I’ll find me 
                        a real man who appreciates a woman 
                        with ambition. Not some McDonald’s 
                        dollar menu has-been ass nigga in a 
                        Goodwill suit!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Ooooooh? This here is baby 
                        cashmere! This costs more than that 
                        coochie can crank in a lifetime! I 
                        ain’t no has-been and ain’t nothin’ 
                        wrong with my suit! 

                           YO-YO
                 (pulling a loose thread)
           Except that the seams are 
           coming out! Broke ass bitch!
                                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT'D)
                                              Stop it!... Stop! This ain’t 
                                              Pretty Woman! You ain’t Julia

                                 FONTAINE
                        Hey! 
                             (they both shut up)
                        Look... I just need you to clear 
                        sum’n up for me, then you can be 
                        right back on ya merry hoein’ way.

                                 YO-YO
                        ... Shoot.
                                 FONTAINE
                        Did we see each other last night?

                                 YO-YO
                        Not like that.

                                 FONTAINE
                        No, like, literally. Did you see me?

                                 YO-YO
                        You ain’t Kevin Bacon, are you?

                                 FONTAINE
                        What? 

                                 YO-YO
                        Hollow Man-- yes, nigga, I saw you.

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... And did you hear gunshots after?

                                 YO-YO
                        I got ears, don’t I? Somebody was 
                        lettin’ them bitches off. Be 
                        honest, I thought it was you.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Damn girl, you thought I was dead 
                        and ain’t come check on a pimp?

                                 YO-YO
                        So I can get shot, too? You know 
                        Fontaine crazy. No offense, Fontaine.

                                 FONTAINE
                        So you ain’t see nothin’.

                                 YO-YO
                        I ain’t say all that. You know ya 
                        girl gotta know what’s going on in 
                        these streets so I doubled back 
                        after a cool lil minute. Think I saw 
                        the perpetrators leaving.

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... And?

                                                      SLICK CHARLES

                                              Holon, I ain’t sanction no--
                           YO-YO
           You twelve now? Damn. I mean, 
           I recognized the whip. I do 
           house calls over on 2nd and 
           sometimes I see it parked a 
           few driveways down.
                                 YO-YO
                             (off Fontaine’s look)
                        Let me guess. I’m coming with you.

           LATER

           The gang, if we can call it that, creepin’. Funk Flex’s BOMB 
           DROP (or a cheap derivative thereof) pipes in on the radio...

                                 THE RADIO (DJ STRANGELOVE)
                        What it is, what it do! It’s ya boy 
                        DJ Strangelove on the muthalovin’ 
                        ones and twos!
                             (AIRHORNS)
                        This that new Ruckus, “Heart Rate 
                        Slow!”

           ... then a CHOPPED AND SCREWED BEAT drops...

                                 THE RADIO (RUCKUS)(CONT’D)
                        Heart rate slow, heart-heart rate 
                        slow. Got drank in my cup, eyes-
                        eyes gettin’ low. Heart rate--

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Can you change this depressive ass 
                        shit? Every time this song come on 
                        I wanna go straight to sleep.

           Fontaine ignores him. Slick Charles crosses his arms and 
           yawns. For some reason, Fontaine and Yo-Yo yawn, too. Then...

                                 YO-YO
                        This street right here...

           They slow to a crawl as Fontaine turns onto the seedy street.

                                 YO-YO (CONT’D)
                        There. Eleven o’clock.

           Slick Charles looks around, no Chevy Celebrity in sight...

                                                        FONTAINE
                                              Shhh, wait...
                       SLICK CHARLES
           Yo-Yo, sweetheart, this ain’t 
           no joke. Fontaine, playa--

           ... but there is a MATTE-BLACK CHARGER... Parked in the 
           driveway of a trap house. Fontaine kills the engine...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Umm, you got a Rambo-esque look 
                        about you right now. I think I’ma 
                        just wait in the car--
           But Fontaine’s already COCKING his .45. His eyes meet Slick 
           Charles’ in the rearview mirror.

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        Know what, fresh air sounds good.

           Reluctant, Slick Charles and Yo-Yo follow Fontaine

           OUTSIDE.

           Crouch-walk towards the house. They reach the door; it’s 
           labeled with a brass #1. Curtains cover the barred windows 
           and there’s a welcome mat that reads, “Home Sweet Home.”

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        So what’s the plan? Knock on the 
                        door? Say, “Wussup, I’m lookin’ for 
                        the niggas who shot me last night?”

           But Fontaine’s too busy listening for movement inside. He 
           tries the handle... locked. With no ado, he tries option 
           number two: KICKING THAT SHIT IN.

                  SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                                                          YO-YO
           Damn, Fontaine.
                                              Damn, Fontaine.

           They quickly slip

           INSIDE.

           Dark as fuck, save for the eerie glow of moonlight shining 
           through the windows. Also, empty as fuck. No furniture, 
           nothing on the walls, nada. Unsettling to say the least...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Okay, great. Nothin’ to see here. 
                        Let’s shake it. 

           Yo-Yo creeps right up behind Slick Charles, leans in...

                                 YO-YO
                        You ain’t scared, is it?

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                             (jolted)
                        Hey! This ain’t no time for jokes!

           Slick Charles straightens his jacket in a huff as Fontaine 
           stalks deeper, sweeping the shadows with his .45. Curious, Yo-
           Yo starts poking around, makes her way towards 
           THE KITCHEN.

           She opens the fridge, illuminating the room. Peeks inside...

                                 YO-YO
                        Fridge works.

           ... It’s filled with COFFEE CREAMERS, APPLE SLICES, PEANUT 
           BUTTER, TUPPERWARE. One has a sticky-note attached: “Don’t 
           eat my sandwich, Tanner!!!” Yo-Yo squints: That’s odd...

           IN THE LIVING ROOM

           Eyes narrowed, Fontaine pushes open the first door he sees, 
           revealing a HALF-BATH. Taped to the mirror, a LAMINATED CARD 
           that reads: “Employees Must Wash Hands.”

                                 SLICK CHARLES (O.S.)
                        Yo! Yo-Yo! Fontaine! 

           Fontaine and Yo-Yo quickstep to Slick Charles, who’s 
           frantically pointing. Their eyes snap to a door halfway down 
           the hall. Bluish light flickers from a crack beneath it... 
           Aww shit. Fontaine edges towards the door...

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        You goin’ the wrong way!

           Salty, Slick Charles tiptoes after him, Yo-Yo pulling up the 
           rear. Feels like Michael Myers is just around the-- CRUNCH... 

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        For real, Yo-Yo?! Snack time? Now?!

           She responds with churlish SMACKING as she finishes her apple. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        Quiet.

           Fontaine steadies his breath... clutches his .45... explodes 

           INSIDE THE ROOM.

           Card table, few empty Tab cans, a SODA MACHINE, and a CRT TV 
           perched catty-corner up near the ceiling. ON IT... a muted re-
           run of Don Siegel’s Invasion of the Body Snatchers... 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        A break room in a trap house?

                                 YO-YO
                        This is some Twilight Zone shit...
           Fontaine stares up at a grainy Kevin McCarthy as Yo-Yo 
           investigates the soda machine. Slick Charles is checking out 
           the half-eaten sandwich on the table when -- CLUNK! -- a can 
           of Tab falls into the tray.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Shit!... You know I got a weak heart!

                                 FONTAINE
                        Shut up.......... Music...

           Faint, indecipherable, but no doubt about it... 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Nope, nope... Not today, Satan. 

           He takes a knee, plucks a GOLD PLATED, PEARL INLAID .38 from 
           a hidden SHOE HOLSTER as Fontaine, .45 still at the ready, 
           leads them back into the dark 

           HALLWAY.

           They inch towards the final door. It’s slightly ajar, and the 
           MUFFLED MUSIC gets louder with each step. They enter the

           ROOM

           to find it, like most of this place, empty. Save for the 
           CLOSET DOOR. The music’s coming from the other side... They 
           creep towards it... sweat materializing on their brows... 
           Fontaine reaches for the doorknob... twists it open... 
           revealing a staircase...

           ... that descends down... 

                                      dooooowwwwnnnnnn...

                                                              doooooooooooooowwwwwnnnnnnn...

           ... into the shadows. Deeper than any staircase in a got damn 
           trap house has a right to go. And swelling up from the deep...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Michael Jackson? 

           His 1979 gift to Earth, “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough,” to 
           be specific. CH-CHICK. Fontaine and Slick Charles look over, 
           Yo-Yo’s cocking the .22 she just plucked from her handbag.

                                 YO-YO
                        They ain’t bout to catch me 
                        slippin’!
           The gang hangs in the doorway. Fontaine eyes Slick Charles...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Be my guest. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        I can always throw you down.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                             (popping his collars)
                        A pimp ventures into the unknown...

                                 FONTAINE
                             (to Yo-Yo)
                        Wait here. 

                                 YO-YO
                        Aww look at you, so chivalrous and 
                        skrong.

           She flips him the bird and cuts in front, following Slick 
           Charles. Fontaine takes one last look around... then descends

           THE LONG ASS SCARY STAIRCASE.

           We can’t see shit, but we can make out their FOOTSTEPS...

                                 THE KING OF POP (O.S.)
                        Don’t stop ‘til you get enough!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        ... This some white people shit we 
                        doin’. Y’all know that, right?

           Still, they continue. Then... LIGHT. Growing larger and larger 
           until they cross the threshold into what appears to be 

           A SPRAWLING SCIENCE LAB.

           Beakers and Bunsen burners, Tesla coils and test tubes, real 
           motherfuckin’ science shit. There’s a Cold War era feel about 
           the place: dim fluorescents bouncing off concrete walls 
           flecked with chipped, forest green paint... scuffed linoleum 
           floors... incongruously cheery, outdated HR posters...

           ... oh, and the GUY IN THE CLEANROOM SUIT. Dancing his ass 
           off, his back turned to us as he works, his PRISTINE AFRO 
           bobbing to the rhythm.

                                 CLEANROOM SUIT 
                        Hoo, I’m meltiiiiing (I’m melting), 
                        like hot caaaandle waaaaaax...
           Dumbfounded, they watch as he pipettes solutions from vial to 
           vial. Until the groove finally compels him to hit MJ’s 
           infamous spin. Mid-twirl, he notices the gang noticing him. 
           When he finishes the 1080, his back is once again turned.

           Everyone freezes...

                                 THE KING OF POP (VIA BOOMBOX)
                        Keep on, with the force don’t stop!  
                        Don’t stop ‘til you get enough!

           Slowly, Cleanroom Suit kills the boombox... turns to face his 
           intruders... and we finally see that... despite his luxurious 
           afro... THIS IS A WHITE GUY.

           They look at him. He looks at them. They look at him...

           ... HE BOLTS. Scrambles towards the only other door in the 
           room, a large, metallic hatch riveted into the opposite wall. 
           He presses his KEY CARD against the reader. The door SLIDES 
           OPEN, revealing an ABSURDLY LONG HALLWAY just as Fontaine 
           catches up and SLAMS him up against the concrete.

                         FONTAINE
                                                     CLEANROOM SUIT
           Nigga, start talkin’. 
                                              Easy, easy! Relax!

                                 FONTAINE
                        I am relaxed! The fuck is all this?

                                 CLEANROOM SUIT
                        I’m just a tech! I’m just a tech! 

           MEANWHILE, YO-YO... is poking and prodding everything in 
           sight, still trying to wrap her mind around this...

                                 YO-YO
                        How is this even... 

           ... while Slick Charles eyes a mound of mysterious WHITE 
           POWDER piled on a scale at one of the lab stations...

                                 FONTAINE 
                        Who are you?!

                                 CLEANROOM SUIT
                        I’m just staff! Don’t hurt me! 

                                 FONTAINE
                        Staff for what? On my mama...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                             (eyes on that powder)
                        You get those answers, Fontaine. 
                        I’ll just... be over here...
           As Fontaine grills Cleanroom Suit, Slick Charles scoops some 
           powder with his pinky. Tastes it. Rubs it on his gums. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        Not cocaine... But...
                             (a good bit more)
                        Woo, that’s good... Got damn.

           He grins. Laughs a little. Suddenly a bit giddy.

           BACK WITH FONTAINE... as -- CRACK! -- he punches Cleanroom 
           Suit square in the mouth. Fontaine jams the .45 right beneath 
           his chin, pushing his head backward.

                                 FONTAINE
                        I ain’t playin’ with yo ass...

                                 CLEANROOM SUIT
                        Please, please! You don’t wanna do 
                        this man, we’re everywhere.

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... Everywhere? Who is “we?”

           For a split second, Cleanroom Suit’s wide-eyed stare flickers 
           over Fontaine’s shoulder. Fontaine clocks it, follows his 
           gaze... to a STAINLESS STEEL SLAB WITH A BODY BAG ATOP IT... 

                                 FONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        ... Slick Charles... 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        You rang?

           Fontaine gestures to Slick Charles: Watch him. Jittery as 
           he’s become, Slick Charles recognizes he’s serious. Does as 
           he’s told. Ambles over. Trains his .38 on Cleanroom Suit.

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                             (giggling)
                        How you doin’, brother?

           Entranced, Fontaine’s legs carry him to the slab. To the body 
           in the bag. The body he’s afraid he’ll recognize...

           BACK BY THE HATCH... Slick Charles twitches involuntarily.

                                 CLEANROOM SUIT
                        Jesus, watch it!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                             (laughing)
                        Where the hell did they find a 
                        white nigga with an afro?
           BACK BY THE SLAB... Fontaine reaches out his hand... ready to 
           unzip the bag... and just as his fingertips touch the zipper--

           CRASH! Yo-Yo DROPS A BEAKER and-- 

                           YO-YO
                                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT'D)
           Shit!
                                              Shit!

           --BANG! Slick Charles SHOOTS CLEANROOM SUIT IN THE FACE.

                  SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                                                          YO-YO
           Oooooooooooh!
                                              Oooooooooooh!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Look what you did!

                                 YO-YO
                        Me?! You just shot him!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        No I didn’t! He’s okay! 
                             (to the corpse)
                        Ain’t that right, playa? You good!

           He’s clearly not.

                                                          YO-YO
                                              That motherfucker’s dead!
                  SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
           Come on, brother! You can 
           walk this off!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        We ain’t got time for yo 
                        negativity! I need some Wet Wipes! 
                        Some Windex! Find me somethin’!
                             (to the corpse)
                        C’mon, playa. On ya feet. Up ya go.
                             (noticing the brain matter)
                        Oh God!... Aight, so Fontaine, I 
                        know this looks bad, but I swear...

           That’s when they notice... Fontaine hasn’t moved. He’s just 
           standing there, staring down at the now-exposed body...

                                 YO-YO
                        Fontaine?

           ... IT’S HIS BODY.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Fontaine?

           Dead as a door nail, six bullet holes in his chest, but no 
           doubt about it... him. As Fontaine tries to make sense of 
           this, Slick Charles and Yo-Yo walk over. Their jaws drop.
                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        ................... Told ya...

           WEEEEOOOOO! WEEEEOOOOO! The alarm. From down that LONG 
           HALLWAY... VOICES... FOOTSTEPS racing to the scene... 

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        Uhh, playa... I think maybe uhh...

           Fontaine’s too petrified to hear him. The encroaching voices 
           grow louder and LOUDER...

                  SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                                                          YO-YO
           Move ya ass, fool!
                                              We gotta go!

           ... as Slick Charles and Yo-Yo shove a dazed Fontaine back up 
           the stairs.

           OUTSIDE - LATER

           The gang hauls ass out the door, Yo-Yo and Slick Charles 
           practically dragging Fontaine to his Cutlass.

                                 YO-YO
                        Gimme your keys...... Fontaine!

           He’s too shell-shocked; she digs them out of his pockets. 
           Then they stuff Fontaine in the backseat. Pile in. Peel out.

           INT. FONTAINE’S CUTLASS - LATER

           Yo-Yo, white-knuckling it behind the wheel. Hyperventilating 
           alongside Slick Charles. Fontaine staring blankly into the 
           ether as the Cutlass rockets down the boulevard.

                                 YO-YO
                        They following us? They ain’t 
                        following us, right? Fuck! We’re 
                        okay, right? Shit!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        You got a real exotic definition of 
                        the word “okay.” I mean what the 
                        fuck was that?! 

                                 YO-YO
                        Do I look like a magic fucking 8-
                        ball?! I don’t know! Just-- we 
                        gotta-- get help or something!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Watch the muthafuckin’ road! 
           She SWERVES to avoid a passing car. Nerves frayed.

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        “We” ain’t gotta do shit! I ain’t 
                        the one who wanted to investigate 
                        the spooky trap house! I ain’t the 
                        one who just saw my own butt naked 
                        ass body layin’ on a table!

                                 YO-YO
                        Nigga you killed somebody!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        We all made mistakes! Let’s not 
                        start pointin’ fingers as to who 
                        killed whom! Know what, pull over. 

                                 YO-YO
                        If you wanna go, make sure you roll 
                        when you hit the ground, cause I 
                        ain’t stopping!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        We just gone ride around all night? 
                        Cause y’all ain’t comin’ back to the 
                        Royal with me. No ma’am. I’m puttin’ 
                        these gator boots down on that. 

                                 YO-YO
                             (chewing her lips)
                        ..... Fuck!...... I know a place...

           EXT. MODEST DUPLEX - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Nothing fancy. But not the worst home you’ll find in the 
           Glen. Yo-Yo quickly leads Fontaine and Slick Charles to the 
           porch. Slick Charles peeks over his shoulder for the 
           boogeyman as Yo-Yo slips the spare key from under a ceramic 
           turtle and opens the door. They hurry

           INSIDE.

           Salmon shag carpet. Plastic couch coverings. Porcelain 
           figurines. A wood-paneled TV playing a late-nite talk show 
           for an empty Lay-Z-Boy recliner. Atop the TV is an old VCR 
           and stacks upon stacks of VHS tapes.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Whose house is this?

                                 YO-YO
                        My grandmama’s... Don’t touch shit.
           YO-YO’S ROOM - LATER

           CLOSE ON an old photo of a buck-toothed teenage Yo-Yo holding 
           up a first place trophy as she smiles proudly beside her 
           SCIENCE FAIR TRI-POSTER: “OF MICE AND MEMORY -- TEACHING 
           PATTERN RECOGNITION TO LAB MICE.” 

           PULLING BACK... we see a few assorted relics of Yo-Yo’s 
           adolescence: more pictures, B2K posters, stuffed animals, 
           couple scholastic awards, and a robust book collection. 
           Fontaine sits idly on her old bed, lost, while Slick Charles 
           thumbs through Yo-Yo’s entire catalogue of Nancy Drew. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        How many adventures did the bitch 
                        go on... 

           He plucks one of the books: The Hidden Staircase. Just as he 
           does, Yo-Yo enters, a styrofoam cup of tea in hand.

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        You ain’t got two cups?

                                 YO-YO
                        I ain’t yo mama. But my grandmama’s 
                        sleep in the other room. So keep it 
                        down, she got ears like a bat.

           Slick Charles slips a flask from his pocket, takes a shot of 
           whiskey. They all sit for a moment...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        I say we go full turkey, stick our 
                        heads in the sand, forget this shit 
                        ever happened.

                                 YO-YO
                        Ostrich, stupid motherf-- How’d I 
                        let y’all drag me in this shit...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        What do I always say? If it don’t 
                        smell right, get out the car. This 
                        shit here? Stank. And I don’t--

                                 FONTAINE
                        That wasn’t me...
                             (then...)
                        I don’t know what that was... but 
                        it wasn’t me. 

                                 YO-YO
                        No one said it was.
                                 FONTAINE
                        I’m me.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        That body was full of holes. Just 
                        like I saw. 

                                 FONTAINE
                             (getting in his face)
                        Do I seem real to you? Do I look 
                        like a fuckin’ ghost?!

                                 YO-YO
                        Fontaine, grandmama!... Listen, 
                        none of us know what the fuck that 
                        was back there. But... But...

           Her eyes catch The Hidden Staircase resting beside Slick 
           Charles. A spark. Scoops the book up.

                                 YO-YO (CONT’D)
                        Look, this kinda stuff happens to 
                        Nancy Drew all the time. She comes 
                        across some weird, kinky shit that 
                        don’t make no sense, but in the end, 
                        it always turns out to be some 
                        regular, vanilla, missionary 
                        position shit on the other side. 

           Fontaine stares at her... then starts for the door. 

                                 YO-YO (CONT’D)
                        Whoa, whoa. Where are you going?

                                 FONTAINE
                        I ain’t got time for this. I’m 
                        goin’ back. 

                                 YO-YO
                        Look, somebody’s fucking with you. 
                        You wanna know who. You wanna know 
                        why. Cool. But the block is hotter 
                        than fish grease right now. Whoever 
                        they are, they’re probably looking 
                        for us as we speak. You go out 
                        there, you’re liable to lead ‘em 
                        right back to us and I ain’t 
                        getting probed for no nigga. So 
                        just... chill here for the night, 
                        okay? Dexter’s lab’ll be there 
                        tomorrow. We will find out what 
                        that missionary position shit is, 
                        just like my girl Nancy, I 
                        promise...... Now please... 
           After a long moment, Fontaine finally relents, lays down on 
           the bed. Frustrated. Exhausted. Tired of talking. Yo-Yo looks 
           at Slick Charles, now sitting in her desk chair. Also beat.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        This some first class bullshit...

           He tries in vain to get comfortable as Yo-Yo exhales and 
           curls up on her bean bag. 

           EXT. YO-YO’S GRANDMAMA’S HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

           Pushing noon...

           INT. YO-YO’S GRANDMAMA’S HOUSE - SAME

           Yo-Yo’s eyes finally flutter open. She bolts upright when she 
           notices her bed is empty. Scrambles to Slick Charles, shakes 
           him; he comes to in his chair with errant karate chops.

                                 YO-YO 
                        Where’s Fontaine?!

           I/E. FONTAINE’S CUTLASS - SAME

           Fontaine driving. Big Moss shotgun, pocket fan in hand. Three 
           other HOMIES crammed in the back. All STRAPPED, all sweating. 

                                 BIG MOSS
                        So these niggas fuckin’ witcha, 
                        huh?... Don’t worry, we’ll get ‘em.

           INT. THE SPOOKY TRAP HOUSE - LATER

           BOOM! The door flies open as Fontaine kicks it in. He bursts 
           inside, .45 ready to blow a muhfucka’s head off... 

           ... and immediately realizes that he’s in the wrong house. Or 
           at least, he must be... because this house is fully 
           furnished. Sofa, TV, smiling family pictures on the walls. 
           The crew floods in behind him. Pocket fan and guns drawn.

                                 FONTAINE
                        What...

           Big Moss watches with raised eyebrows as Fontaine races back 
           outside, verifies the address, and returns bewildered.

                                                    FONTAINE (CONT'D)
                         BIG MOSS
           What we lookin for, big dawg?
                                              No, no, no, no...
           Fontaine hurries into 

           THE BREAK ROOM,

           but it ain’t a break room no more. It’s someone’s bedroom: 
           bed, dresser, dirty clothes on the floor... The entire fuck?

                                 BIG MOSS
                        You good, mane? What’s goin’ on--

           Fontaine pushes past him into the hallway, rushing to the 

           ROOM AT THE END OF THE HALL.

           It’s a little girl’s bedroom now.

                                 FONTAINE
                        How... It was... Michael Jackson...

           His sprints to the closet... rips it open... clothes... 
           blankets... board games... but no staircase...

                                 BIG MOSS
                        Think you might be runnin’ low on 
                        electrolytes? Gotta hydrate, mane.

           Incredulous, Fontaine TEARS UP THE CLOSET, pounding on the 
           back wall, on the floor... Behind him, the homies watch...

                                 FONTAINE
                        There was stairs... and a-- a 
                        lab... underground... and-- and 
                        this white nigga with an afro.

           ... and glance nervously at each other. Big Moss squats down 
           beside him. Pocket fan WHIRLING, obscuring his words.

                                 BIG MOSS
                        Ay mane... Ain’t tryna rush ya, but 
                        we maybe got ourselves a Goldilocks 
                        situation here. Should prolly... 
                        get on up out these people’s house.

           Fontaine looks at Big Moss and the rest of his boys with 
           contempt: They don’t believe me...

           OUTSIDE - LATER

           He storms out. Bee-lines to his Cutlass. By the time Big Moss 
           and co. emerge Fontaine’s already CRANKING the engine...
                                 BIG MOSS
                        Wait hol’up... We ridin’ with you!

           But Fontaine drives off, leaving them stranded. To make 
           matters worse, Big Moss’ pocket fan dies.

                                 BIG MOSS (CONT’D)
                        Mane...

                                 YO-YO (V.O.)
                        You sure you got the right house?

           INT. MODEST DUPLEX - KITCHEN - DAY

           Fontaine broods against the refrigerator as Yo-Yo sits on the 
           counter and Slick Charles searches the cabinets for food. In 
           the living room, the TV’s still on from last night.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Yes! It’s just... different now. 
                        Like a family lives there. 

                                 YO-YO
                        What about the lab?

                                 FONTAINE
                        Gone! Least the stairs is gone. 
                        Like they wasn’t never there.

                                 YO-YO
                        That makes no sense.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Either that or I’m goin’ crazy. 
                        Last night... it happened, right?

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                             (still foraging)
                        I had a nightmare, so I think that 
                        means yeah. It happened.
                             (then; re: food options)
                        No Saltines? Fig Newtons? Nothin’?

                                 YO-YO
                        Will you stop?

           Yo-Yo sighs: What now... Defeated, Fontaine looks to her.

                                 FONTAINE
                        What would the Scooby-Doo bitch do?

                                 YO-YO
                        ... You mean Nancy Drew?
                                 FONTAINE
                        The bitch on them books. 

           Her face scrunches up... Fontaine gestures: Any day now...

                                 YO-YO
                        I’m thinking, shit!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Well can we think somewhere with 
                        some food? A pimp’s blood sugar is 
                        fallin’ fast.  

           Off the TV, where, wouldn’t you know it, the commercial for 
           Got Damn! Fried Chicken is playing...

                                 COMMERCIAL (ON TV)
                        --vices when you got all these 
                        herbs and spices at discount 
                        prices...

           EXT. GOT DAMN! FRIED CHICKEN - DAY

           CLOSE ON a NEON SIGN of a spinning chicken with shades. 
           Drifting down, we land on an unusually packed parking lot 
           attached to what clearly used to be a Pizza Hut. 

           It’s practically a block party out here as Fontaine’s Cutlass 
           pulls into the lone empty spot. They get out. As they make 
           their way towards the door, we notice STICKERED ADVERTISEMENTS 
           on the windows: “Limited Time Only! Hotbox Spicy Chicken!”

                                 YO-YO
                        Lit as fuck out here...

           They head

           INSIDE

           and take their place in the back of a long ass line. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        That new spicy chicken must be 
                        jumpin’ out the gym. 

           It is indeed lit AF in here, but we notice at least ONE ANGRY 
           COUPLE ahead in line embroiled in a heated argument.

           BOOTH - LATER

           Three Hotbox Spicy Chicken combos land on their table. 
                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Look at this crunchy, golden skin. 
                             (takes a bite)
                        Got damn. That’s flavor right 
                        there. Y’all better dig in.

                                 YO-YO
                        Shiiiiit, I’m already on it.
                             (takes a bite)
                        It’s good. Real good. Got damn.

                                 FONTAINE
                             (finally taking a bite)
                        Got damn.
                             (a few more chews)
                        So... missionary position.

                                 YO-YO
                        Right. First things first, as with 
                        any mystery, we gotta lay out all 
                        the facts... What do we know?

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Well, to start: he’s dead.

           Yo-Yo snickers. Fontaine scowls. 

                                 YO-YO
                        But, plot twist, he’s also right 
                        here. Which makes... two Fontaines? 
                        Which...
                             (laughing at the idea)
                        ... I mean one was bad enough, right?

           Slick Charles laughs, too. A bit jittery... Then...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        I’ll tell ya what else we 
                        know............ There’s a secret 
                        underground trap laboratory.

           Ba-dum-tish. Despite himself, even Fontaine chuckles.

                                 YO-YO
                        And according to Deebo over here... 
                        the stairs are gone! So any clues 
                        we did have are buried a hundred 
                        feet underground!

           Gangbusters. Fontaine finally succumbs, bursts into laughter, 
           chicken grease dripping from his teeth. The laughter builds 
           on itself -- a feedback loop. Their worries suddenly washed 
           away with a few bites of limited-time-only Hotbox Spicy 
           Chicken. Slick Charles slaps Fontaine on the back.
                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        There you go! See it won’t kill ya 
                        to smile from time to time!
                             (to Yo-Yo)
                        You know, I never seen this 
                        muthafucka laugh? Not once!

           More laughs. But something about that last sentence just 
           flipped a switch in Slick Charles’ brain. There’s a tinge of 
           confusion in his eyes as he considers the fact that he has 
           never, ever, seen Fontaine laugh. Strange...

           He takes another bite of chicken, scans the room. Come to 
           think of it, EVERYBODY’S LAUGHING... He sobers even more 
           when, mid-chew, he notices the FRAMED PHOTO of the STORE 
           MANAGER on the wall beside them: it’s another WHITE GUY WITH 
           AN AFRO. The only white face in the room. Stranger still...

           And as Slick Charles swallows that bite... recognition. 
           There’s still grease on his fingers. He thinks for a beat... 
           then RUBS THE GREASE ON HIS GUMS... Hold the fuckin’ phone...

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        Ahhh shit!

           Slick Charles SWIPES EVERYONE’S FOOD OFF THE TABLE.

                    FONTAINE AND YO-YO
                                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT'D)
           The fuck!
                                              It’s in the chicken!

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        The powder! From the lab! It was in 
                        the lab! Now it’s in the chicken!

                                 YO-YO
                        Wait a minute, what?!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Back in the trap lab. I see white 
                        powder. I think it’s cocaine. I 
                        taste it. It is not cocaine. I start 
                        laughing. You break some shit. I 
                        shoot a nigga. We come here. We eat 
                        the chicken. We start laughin’. 

           Yo-Yo and Fontaine scope the room. Even that ANGRY COUPLE WE 
           NOTICED IN LINE is cracking up. Slick Charles points out the 
           MANAGER, the same afro’d white guy from the photo on the wall. 
           He’s behind the counter, straightening someone’s name tag.

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        And that Bob Ross lookin’ 
                        muthafucka served it to us! Are you 
                        connectin’ the dots yet?!
           ... Well damn. Sobered, they all share a look: Somebody here 
           knows something. Fontaine starts whipping out his .45--

                                 YO-YO
                        Nigga chill. We are in public. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        I just wanna ask a few questions.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        We all know how you ask questions.

                                 YO-YO
                        You don’t necessarily have good 
                        bedside manner. How bout you let me 
                        go talk to him? 

                                 FONTAINE
                        .......... Five minutes.

           Challenge accepted. Yo-Yo stands, adjusts her dress. Turning 
           on the juice, she slinks towards the counter. The MANAGER 
           double-takes as she leans over the register and giggles...

                                 YO-YO
                        The ice melted in my sweet tea. Now 
                        it’s nasty. I wanna file a complaint.

           KITCHEN - LATER

           The Manager fumbles for the key to his office. On the door, 
           there’s a big sign that reads: “Management Only, Keep Out.”

                                 MANAGER
                        So... the complaint cards are 
                        just.. right here... in my office. 

           A fry cook rolls his eyes as the door opens and they slip

           INSIDE.

           Tacky wood paneling. Bogus health certificates. And a COLLAGE 
           OF CLOSED-CIRCUIT TVS STACKED ATOP EACH OTHER. Each showing a 
           DIFFERENT CAMERA ANGLE of the dining room... HIDDEN CAMERAS. 

                                 YO-YO
                        Look at all these cameras. You got 
                        one in the girls bathroom, too?

                                 MANAGER
                        Don’t worry about those, honey bun. 
                        We’ve been robbed a lot, that’s all.
           He kisses her neck. She giggles. Pushes him back a little.

                                 YO-YO
                             (re: the cameras)
                        So this was your idea? 

                                 MANAGER
                        Not exactly.

                                 YO-YO
                        Whose idea was it?

                                 MANAGER
                             (pressing up on her)
                        Told you don’t worry about that. 

           She kisses him on the cheek. Giggles. Slinks away. 

                                 YO-YO
                        Did you know I’ve been here three 
                        times this week?

                                 MANAGER
                        I noticed. Of course I noticed.

                                 YO-YO
                        I just can’t get enough of that new 
                        spicy chicken. It’s like, every 
                        time I eat it, I just... 
                             (a laugh)
                        I can’t explain it.

           He pulls her close again. She pushes away again.

                                 MANAGER
                        It has that effect on people. New 
                        recipe. Top secret. 

                                 YO-YO
                        Oooo, I like secrets... Go get some.

                                 MANAGER
                        What? No, I can’t. It’s not-- 
                        company policy.

           Yo-Yo leans in. Licks his neck. A sneak preview...

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        ..... Okay, okay... Don’t move.

           He darts out. Soon as he’s gone, she drops the act. Rifles 
           through shit: loose papers... a SMALL NOTEBOOK with a strange-
           looking GOVERNMENT SEAL... and a HANDHELD VOICE RECORDER. She 
           stares at it... hits REWIND... then PLAY...
                                 MANAGER (V.O.)(RECORDED) (CONT’D)
                        ... pleasure-inducing effects of 
                        the compound observed approximately 
                        44 seconds after consumption as 
                        expressed through extreme laughter 
                        and agreeability.

           Yo-Yo looks up at the screens. At all those people eating 
           spicy chicken, laughing, unawares. Aww fuck.

                                 MANAGER (V.O.)(RECORDED) (CONT’D)
                        Subject part of the 25% that 
                        experienced side-effects of 
                        sporadic muscle contractions. In 
                        reference to control group Beta 3--

           Just then, the door handle turns. Yo-Yo scrambles, hides the 
           recorder just as the manager returns. Holding a six-piece box 
           of chicken. She snatches it. Offers him a drumstick. Giggles.

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        I could get in so much trouble...

                                 YO-YO
                        That’s what makes it exciting. 

           She pushes him into his chair. He braces himself on his desk, 
           hitting his keyboard. Behind him, A FEW OF THE MONITORS 
           CHANGE CAMERA FEEDS. Yo-Yo clocks it. Straddles him to keep 
           him from noticing. Stuffs the chicken in his mouth. Giggles.

                                 YO-YO (CONT’D)
                        That’s it, baby.

           Almost immediately, he starts giggling. Jittery. She pulls him 
           closer into her bosom. Hits the arrow key over his shoulder. 
           CYCLES THROUGH NEW CAMERA FEEDS, the manager none the wiser. 
           But these new feeds aren’t showing Got Damn! anymore. Instead, 
           she’s looking at the DOLLAR STORE, the CHECK CASHING PLACE, 
           the STRIP CLUB, the LIQUOR MART... Then it hits her...

           All of these places are in The Glen.

                                 YO-YO (CONT’D)
                        I need to use the ladies room...

           OUTSIDE - LATER

           Yo-Yo, quickstepping out the restaurant, Fontaine and Slick 
           Charles shuffling behind. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        What happened?
                                 YO-YO
                        Keep walking...

           Through the restaurant’s window, we notice a guy dancing 
           euphorically as he munches on a chicken wing.

           EXT. GOT DAMN! FRIED CHICKEN - SIDE DOOR - LATER

           SHIPPING BOXES WITH THE GOT DAMN! LOGO... being unloaded by 
           hands on the back of a NONDESCRIPT WHITE CARGO VAN... 

           NEARBY IN FONTAINE’S CUTLASS...

                                 YO-YO
                        I’m talking The Check Cashing Place, 
                        The Dollar Sto’, The White Horse--

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        They watchin’ the strip club, too?

                                 YO-YO
                        Everywhere! If it’s here in The 
                        Glen, they’re watching it. But only 
                        here. I looked on every single 
                        screen... only places I saw were in 
                        our neighborhood.

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... Who gives a fuck about The Glen?

                                 YO-YO
                        That ain’t all... Your boy was 
                        taking notes. Observations and 
                        shit. About the chicken. What it 
                        was doing to people.
                             (off their confusion)
                        Check me out, what’s the one thing 
                        we didn’t see down in that lab? 
                        There were beakers and Bunsen 
                        burners and microscopes and-- 

                                 FONTAINE
                        Mice....... We ain’t see no mice...

                                 YO-YO
                        Somebody’s conducting 
                        experiments... on us.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        You mean like a conspiracy? “The 
                        Man?” Watergate. 9/11. The 
                        Berenstain Bears.
                                 YO-YO
                        Exactly. And if we find out who’s 
                        behind it... 
                             (a look to Fontaine)
                        ... we might get some answers about 
                        what was in that lab.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        I don’t wanna be the cloud that 
                        rains on ya cookout, but you 
                        forgettin’ a very necessary detail 
                        here: we ain’t detectives. So I 
                        think it’s time to let the real 
                        pros step in and take over.

                                 YO-YO
                        You gonna go down to the precinct?

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Muthafucka I got warrants. But we 
                        gotta face facts. We outta clues. 
                        Now this lil role play we got goin’ 
                        on is cute, but you’s a hoe. I’m an 
                        entrepreneur. And you’s a drug 
                        dealer. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        So are they...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Don’t go gettin’ all mysterious 
                        now. “So are they” what?

                                 FONTAINE
                        Dope game 101: Don’t trap where ya 
                        sleep. Got Damn! Fried Chicken is 
                        like a street-level dealer. You give 
                        him enough white to make a few 
                        stacks, and tell him just enough to 
                        run his lil corner. At the end of 
                        the day, he don’t know shit, he 
                        don’t control shit. Which is why 
                        when you tryna take over new turf, 
                        you don’t go after every lil nigga 
                        with a dime bag--

                                 YO-YO 
                        You go after the plug...

           The gang eyes that WHITE CARGO VAN. Watches as a WHITE WOMAN 
           WITH THICK BRAIDS and a DELIVERY UNIFORM hops into the 
           driver’s seat and pulls off. Fontaine cranks the engine. 
           I/E. FONTAINE’S CUTLASS / THE ROAD - AFTERNOON

           An old-school tail-and-surveil. Our gang’s following the 
           white van through the hood. Not really saying much. 

                                 YO-YO
                        Saw this place, too...

           THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD... we see the van idling in front of 
           WHO’S THIRSTY? LIQUOR AND SPIRITS. Fontaine slows to a stop 
           about fifty yards back, careful not to be seen.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        I don’t know about y’all but I’ma 
                        need to stretch my legs in a minute.

           They watch as the BRAIDED WHITE LADY and her COWORKER, a 
           white fellow, start unloading crates of ANACONDA MALT LIQUOR.

                                 FONTAINE
                        I drink that every day...

           EXT. THE GLEN - LATE AFTERNOON

           HIGH UP... looking down as the day winds to an end.

           I/E. FONTAINE’S CUTLASS / THE ROAD - LATER

           Everyone’s tired. Slick Charles is splayed out across the 
           whole backseat, eyes closed. Yo-Yo’s leaned against the 
           window, scribbling lazily in a purple crossword book. 

           The setting sun shines into Fontaine’s eyes; he lets down his 
           sun visor, exposing a SMALL PICTURE CLIPPED TO IT: a YOUNG 
           BOY. The same kid on Fontaine’s fridge. Yo-Yo notices...

                                 YO-YO
                        ... That your kid?
                            (he folds the visor back up)
                        Touchy subject. Okay. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        ........ It’s my brother. Ronnie...

                                 YO-YO
                        Sweet looking kid. Hope he doesn’t 
                        take after you.

           Annoyed, Fontaine grips the wheel tighter... 

                                 YO-YO (CONT’D)
                        Oh... shit, he’s... I am... sorry-- 
                                 FONTAINE
                        You good.

           UP AHEAD... the white van pulls into a run-down STRIP MALL. 
           Fontaine parks at the edge of the lot. They spy the workers 
           unloading boxes... disappearing into RAY-RAY’S BARBERSHOP... 
           For a while, they keep watch, sobered... then...

                                 YO-YO
                        ... When?

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... Right before I dropped out. He 
                        was in fifth grade. Smart, too... 
                        Some bitch ass cop, just lookin’ 
                        for an excuse. Tried to say he 
                        stole some candy or some shit...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        .............. Ya’know... in 2005, 
                        I won the Inter--

           Yo-Yo whips around, shoots him the evil eye. As she does, the 
           workers emerge from Ray-Ray’s, head back towards the van.

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        What? I thought we was openin’ up?

           Fontaine doesn’t look away from the workers as they grab more 
           boxes and head towards Ray-Ray’s next-door neighbor: REE-REE’S 
           BEAUTY SALON. This time, they leave the trunk partially ajar. 

           You can see it in Fontaine’s eyes... the wheels turning...

                                 YO-YO
                        It’s called a tail-and-surveil. Not 
                        a tail-and-go-do-some-dumb-shit. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        We been followin’ these niggas 
                        around all day, and what do we know 
                        that we ain’t know hours ago?
                        I’m tired of waitin’. So me and you 
                        gone go check ‘em out up close--
                             (to Slick Charles)
                        --while you check and see what the 
                        fuck else is in that van.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Why I gotta check the van?

                                 FONTAINE
                        Cause I’ll beat yo ass if you 
                        don’t.
           Fontaine bullies his way out. Yo-Yo hurries after.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                             (reluctantly getting out)
                        One day I’ma pimp smack the shit 
                        out yo grinch ass...

           MEANWHILE, IN RAY-RAY’S BARBERSHOP

           A SHAVING BRUSH, swirling around inside a PURPLE CONTAINER 
           labeled 2 CLEAN SHAVE CREAM... gathering a nice dollop... 

                                 RICK ROSS BEARD
                        And the doctor said I damn near got 
                        type-two diabetes up in this bih!

           ... and applying it liberally to RICK ROSS BEARD’s... uhh... 
           Rick Ross beard. It covers his face in a thick, white foam. 

                                 RICK ROSS BEARD (CONT’D)
                        Talmbout I gotta eat better. Bih 
                        how? Tryna find a got damn farmer’s 
                        market, passed by eighteen got damn 
                        Mac-Donalds, mane! I ain’t tryna, 
                        got damn, die young, ya feel me?

           But as his barber continues to brush the cream on his face, 
           Rick Ross Beard’s tone starts to mellow out...

                                 RICK ROSS BEARD (CONT’D)
                        But shiiiit, my daddy had it... 
                             (a tired sigh)
                        Really ain’t no point fightin’ it... 

           ... like he’s suddenly lost the will to give a fuck... Nearby, 
           RAY-RAY, the eponymous barber, cuts Rick Ross Beard’s homie.

                                 RAY-RAY
                        But them McFlurries hittin’ though!

           He spins the chair, and when he does, we see that fade he’s 
           been working on belongs to none other than ISAAC -- the same 
           Isaac who murdered Fontaine in the beginning. Looking in the 
           mirror, his eyes suddenly balloon: Fontaine, in the parking 
           lot, striding towards Ree-Ree’s. Very much alive...

           IN REE-REE’S BEAUTY SALON

           DING, DING! Fontaine and Yo-Yo enter, take a gander. Every 
           dryer chair and sink is occupied. Alive with chit-chat. The 
           eponymous REE-REE greets them from behind the counter, her 
           hair laid to the Gods, a do reminiscent of Jackie Onassis.
                                 REE-REE
                        Gone be a minute ‘fore I can get ya. 

           They nod, squeeze between a MAMA bouncing a toddler and a 
           TEENAGER with two-inch acrylics. Spy the van workers 
           restocking a CARDBOARD STAND advertising 2 CLEAN PERM CREAM. 
           On it, A BLACK MRS. CLEAVER showcases a purple perm kit. 

           BACK OUTSIDE

           Slick Charles approaches the white van. Checks his six. Then 
           his four. Then his two. Grumbling as he slips into its trunk.

           BACK IN REE-REE’S BEAUTY SALON

           A PERM BRUSH, swirling around the purple container of 2 Clean 
           Perm Cream... gathering a nice dollop...

                                 SPLIT ENDS
                        I’m serious! I’m buying supplies 
                        with gas money at this point, and 
                        the school board talking bout 
                        cutting our pay again next year?

           ... and applying it liberally to SPLIT ENDS’ roots... 

                                 SPLIT ENDS (CONT’D)
                        Shittin’ me! I got forty kids 
                        crammed in my class and they gone 
                        be teaching themselves cause I’ma 
                        be sliding down the pole at The 
                        White Horse just to pay rent! 

           But as the stylist continues to brush the perm into her hair, 
           she starts losing steam...

                                 SPLIT ENDS (CONT’D)
                        I mean... Really I just grade 
                        papers, girl... 
                             (a tired sigh)
                        Maybe I’m just... trippin’... 

           ... like she’s suddenly lost the will to give a fuck... 

           UP AT THE FRONT... the van workers take the now-empty box and 
           head towards the back room. Yo-Yo eyes Fontaine; they scoot 
           to the display. She snatches one of the perm kits, pissed.

                                 YO-YO
                        Ooooooooo these dirty motherf-- 
                        Half the girls on the track use 
                        this shit! I’ve used this shit!
                                 FONTAINE
                        What it do?

                                 YO-YO
                        You don’t know what a perm is?
                             (pointing at a lady)
                        See her hair? See how straight it 
                        is? Maybe she was born with it, or 
                        maybe--  

           Yo-Yo presents the box: Exhibit A. 

                                 YO-YO (CONT’D)
                        ... But apparently that ain’t all 
                        it does.

           She scans the room, trying to decipher what the possible side 
           effects might be. Fontaine grabs a kit. Squints at the label. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        Cyclo... penta... siloxane?

                                 ISAAC (O.S.)
                        Must be two sides...

           Fontaine immediately recognizes that voice... Turns to see 
           Isaac and his crew standing between him and the exit. All 
           still wearing their BARBER CAPES, napkins wedged in the their 
           necks, fades and tapers half-finished. Out of his crew, 
           Isaac’s the only one WITHOUT SHAVE CREAM on his face or head. 

           BACK IN THE WHITE VAN

           Piled high with boxes. Slick Charles rummages through them. 
           One is filled with bottles simply labeled... GRAPE DRINK. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Is these niggas serious?

           BACK IN REE-REE’S BEAUTY SALON

           Disbelief in his eyes, Isaac scans Fontaine for bullet holes. 
           Fontaine seethes. This motherfucker literally murdered him. 

                                 ISAAC
                        Been a minute.

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... Yeah. 

           Yo-Yo squeezes Fontaine’s forearm: Easy...
                                 ISAAC
                        This don’t change shit, you know 
                        that, don’t ya?

                                 FONTAINE
                        Hundred fuckin’ percent.

                                 REE-REE
                        Ay, take that bullshit outside.

                                 ISAAC
                        We just talkin’. Ain’t that right?

           Just then, the van workers emerge from the back. Clocking the 
           situation, they quickly shuffle towards the door. 

                                 YO-YO
                        Fontaine...

           The sight of them snaps Fontaine back to the mission. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        Nah, I’m done talkin’.

           Fontaine moves to get around Isaac, but Isaac blocks his path 
           as the workers slip out the door. Fontaine’s fists clench...

                                 ISAAC
                        Well I ain’t...

           BACK IN THE WHITE VAN

           Slick Charles has made his way through the mesh metal 
           partition to the front seats, looking for anything useful. He 
           notices a KEY CARD on a lanyard in the cup holder. Examines 
           it: no name, just a picture and ID number...

           Just then... VOICES... he glances into the sideview mirror... 
           sees the workers returning... Shhhit... scrambles back through 
           the partition... past the boxes... towards the trunk door... 

           IN THE PARKING LOT

                                 COWORKER
                        Yup, that’s about to be a 604.

                                 BRAIDED WHITE LADY
                        Ain’t my department.

           The Coworker notices the back door slightly ajar. Shuts it...
           BACK IN THE VAN

           Slick Charles is ducked beneath the back window, having 
           barely managed to avoid detection. Fuck my life... 

           BACK IN REE-REE’S BEAUTY SALON

                                 ISAAC
                        You got some good ass luck, I’ll 
                        give you that.

                                 FONTAINE
                        I’ll show you luck, nigga. 

           In the parking lot, the van backs out. Yo-Yo notices Slick 
           Charles giving her the old “What the fuck?!” through the back 
           window. But Fontaine’s playing chicken with Isaac... 

                                 YO-YO
                        Y’all can measure dicks later. 
                        Fontaine, we gotta go. Now...

                                 ISAAC
                        So you lettin’ hoes tell you what 
                        to do, huh?

           Fontaine lunges, but Yo-Yo steps between them. 

                           YO-YO
                                                         REE-REE
           Fontaine.
                                              I said take it outside!

                                 ISAAC
                        And I said we just talkin’! Damn!
                             (back to Fontaine; low)
                        I got a haircut to get back to, but 
                        I’ma see you round, though...

           He moves his hand to his waist... grabs something beneath his 
           barber cape... realizes no one can see his hand... clumsily 
           sweeps his cape aside to reveal the PISTOL HE’S GRIPPING... 

                                 ISAAC (CONT’D)
                        But I’ma see you round, though...

                                 YO-YO
                        Cool. He’ll call you.

           Yo-Yo yanks Fontaine past Isaac. Soon as they get

           OUTSIDE,

           they race for the car. No sign of the white van as they hop 
           IN THE CUTLASS.

                                 YO-YO
                        What is wrong with you! The van’s 
                        gone! With Slick Charles inside!

           Fontaine pulls into the street. The van has vanished.

                                 FONTAINE
                        So I’m sposed to let this nigga play 
                        me like a bitch? Which way they go?!

                                 YO-YO
                            (digging through her purse)
                        I don’t know! Pick a direction! And 
                        yes! If you’re trying to figure out 
                        why you saw your own dead fucking 
                        body on a slab, then suppress that 
                        alpha dog bullshit and let him play 
                        you like a bitch! 

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... What you doin’?

                                 YO-YO
                        Callin’ Slick Charles. You know, 
                        the pimp you just lost!

           Just then, 8-Ball and MJG’s 2000 playa’s anthem, “Pimp Hard,” 
           CUES from a cell in the backseat. Yo-Yo lets out a heavy sigh.

           I/E. THE WHITE VAN / STREET - DUSK

           Slick Charles, trying his best to be invisible as the white 
           van navigates The Glen. 

                                 COWORKER (O.S.)
                        Good, think we made it in time. 
                        Cause I did not wanna have to wait 
                        around til they finished... Y’all 
                        don’t know when to stop.

                                 BRAIDED WHITE LADY (O.S.)
                        You don’t know when to stop.

           The boxes jostle as the van turns into its destination and 
           parks. Slick Charles holds his breath while the workers hop 
           out and head towards the trunk. 

           He folds himself like origami behind a column of boxes as they 
           open the door, retrieve the box of Grape Drink, and shut the 
           trunk behind them. Then he starts breathing again. When he 
           can’t hear them anymore, he creaks open the door and climbs
           OUTSIDE.

           His face drops when he realizes where he is... GREATEST MT. 
           ZION AME MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Summummabitches...

           He spies the workers just as they disappear inside: Just walk 
           away, Slick Charles. Then, hating himself, he follows them...

           INT. GREATEST MT. ZION - VESTIBULE - SAME

           ... inside and peeks his head into the red-carpeted CHAPEL, 
           spying from a distance as the van workers walk down the aisle 
           of the completely empty church towards the altar. We stay 
           right here ON SLICK CHARLES’ FACE...

                                 COWORKER (O.S.)
                        Shit, I left my card in the van.

                                 BRAIDED WHITE LADY (O.S.)
                        Just use mine. I’m ready to go home.

           ... as he sees something that blows his mind...

           I/E. FONTAINE’S CUTLASS / THE WHITE HORSE - LATER

           Driving slow, scanning the strip club’s parking lot...

                                 YO-YO
                        I don’t see it, do you?

           Her phone RINGS. It’s a number she doesn’t recognize.

                                 YO-YO (CONT’D)
                        ... Hello?.... Slick Charles?!

           EXT. ACROSS THE STREET FROM GREATEST MT. ZION - SAME

           Slick Charles, at a payphone.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Y’all won’t believe this shit.

           EXT. GREATEST MT. ZION - EVENING

           The Cutlass arrives. Fontaine and Yo-Yo file out past the 
           church’s humble marquee: “Saturday Evening Revival!” Head 
           towards the steps where Slick Charles is pacing.
                                 YO-YO
                        Don’t even look at me--

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Y’all had one damn job!

                                 FONTAINE
                        What you find?

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        ... Just bring y’all asses.

           He shepherds them up the steps, but when he opens the door--

                                 PREACHER
                        First to his word!

           --the PREACHER appears. Smiles. Appraises their appearances: 
           A pimp, a hoe, and a drug dealer walk into a church...

                                 PREACHER (CONT’D)
                        Ain’t seen you three before. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Oh yeah, we usually attend the, 
                        uhh, other church. Round the way.

                                 PREACHER
                        Well you picked a great day to pay 
                        us a visit. All are welcome!

                                 YO-YO
                        Actually, we were just about to--

                                 PREACHER
                        Charm is deceptive and beauty is 
                        fleeting, but a woman who fears The 
                        Lord is to be praised.   

           Behind them, the first real parishioner has arrived...

                                 PREACHER (CONT’D)
                        Ahh, Mrs. Murray! Praise be to you!

           ... MRS. MURRAY, an elderly woman, tips her church hat. 

                                 PREACHER (CONT’D)
                        More folks’ll be arriving shortly. 
                        Let’s get y’all good seats. 

           He puts an insistent hand on Fontaine’s back. Smiles again. 
           Off the church doors, closing behind the gang... 
           SANCTUARY - THREE HOURS LATER...

           CLOSE ON two COMMUNION TRAYS set atop the altar. In one, a 
           few consecrated crackers, all that’s left after communion; in 
           the other, the last few plastic cups of GRAPE JUICE.

           PULLING BACK... to see the GIGANTIC WHITE JESUS painted on the 
           back wall presiding over the all-black congregation. They’ve 
           been stirred into a COMPLETE FRENZY by the Preacher’s fiery 
           sermon. A PIANIST highlights his more emphatic proclamations. 

                                 PREACHER
                        Let us not forget Proverbs 15:3. 
                        Let me hear you say, “His eyes!”

                                 CONGREGATION
                        His eyes!

                                 PREACHER
                        “Are everywhere!”

                                 CONGREGATION
                        Are everywhere!

                                 PREACHER
                        Keeping watch... on the wicked... 
                        and the good! But also, the wicked. 

           E FLAT MAJOR SEVENTH; the preacher busts a dance move. 
           SANDWICHED IN THE THICK OF IT... the gang watches in 
           disbelief: The hell was in that grape juice? 

                                 PREACHER (CONT’D)
                        And you know what He wants most out 
                        of each and every one of you... say 
                        it with me now, I know you know it--

                       CONGREGATION
                                                    PREACHER (CONT'D)
           Obedience!
                                              Ooooooo-bedience!

                     PREACHER (CONT'D)
           Eeeeeyaaaaaaay! Cause we are 
           feeble, simple, bliiiind 
           thangs. But we don’t need 
           eyes when He can see it all. 
           Trust in His vision! 
                                                      SLICK CHARLES
                                              He’d give Jim Jones a run for 
                                              his money.--------------------
                                              ------------------------------
                                              --------YO-YO--------------
                                              Got the Kool-Aid part down...

           Her eyes linger on the prep table beside the altar, where a 
           near-empty bottle of GRAPE DRINK rests...

                                 PREACHER
                        It don’t matter how bad your life 
                        is! It don’t matter that you bout 
                        to get evicted! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PREACHER (CONT'D)
                             (”Amen!”)
                        Don’t matter that you just came 
                        down with The Sugar! 
                             (”Yes, Lawd!”)
                        Don’t matter that your grandson 
                        Jamal was just gunned down in a 
                        drive-by shootin’ right next to the 
                        Dairy Queen!
                             (”Tell ‘em!”)
                        All that matters is trust! In His 
                        plan. Let me hear you say “Trust!”

                                 CONGREGATION
                        Truuuuust!

           This time the pianist, sensing the crescendo, starts playing 
           something a bit more... secular: the beginning notes of 
           Juvenile’s all-time booty-shakin’ banger, “Back That Azz Up.”

           Bum... Bum... Bum... BOM... Bum... Bum... Bum... Bum...

                         PREACHER
                                                  CONGREGATION (CONT'D)
           Say “Truuuuust!”
                                              Truuuuuuuuust!

           With no warning, the Preacher lifts his arms like that Giant 
           White Jesus painting on the wall and FALLS BACKWARDS... but he 
           doesn’t hit the ground... cause OUT OF NOWHERE the Deacon 
           electric slides into place and CATCHES HIM in his arms.

                                 PREACHER
                        Eeeeyaaaaaaaaaay! Hit me!

           The BEAT DROPS and the DRUMMER joins in as the Deacon springs 
           him back to his feet, where he lands in a seamless two-step 
           that belongs more in a strip club than a church. Gets 
           straight up bacchanal, the entire congregation HOLY-GHOSTIN’, 
           BUMPIN’ N’ GRINDIN’. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Now I know it’s been a while since 
                        I been to church, but...

           The delirium escalates. Above it all, Giant White Jesus 
           watches on in approval...

           LATER

           Service has ended. Finally. The last of the congregation files 
           past the Preacher, who glad-hands them on their way out.

                                 PREACHER
                        Bright and early tomorrow, right 
                        Mr. Ross?... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PREACHER (CONT'D)
                        I saw those moves, Mrs. 
                        Caldwell!... Mrs. Jackson, so sorry 
                        about Jamal...

           The Deacon is the last one out. As he passes the Preacher:

                                 DEACON
                        Another day servin’ His agenda.

                                 PREACHER
                        Amen.

                                 DEACON
                        See you at The White Horse tonight?

                                 PREACHER
                        Amen.

           When the Deacon leaves, the Preacher quickly scans the room 
           to make sure it’s empty. He smiles at Giant White Jesus. Hits 
           the lights. Closes the chapel door. For a moment, all is 
           still... until THREE SHADOWY BODIES pop up in the pews.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Aight, where they go?

                                 SLICK CHARLES 
                        Y’all gone see...

           He springs up, leads them up to altar. Feels around.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Fill us in, Slick Charles.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        I’m lookin’ for the-- the... the 
                        shit you put the keycard in.

                        Keycard? We ain’t go no keycard.

                        Y’all ain’t got no keycard. Cause 
                        ya’ll were dickin’ around. Lucky 
                        for you, Slick Charles was doin’ 
                        some muthafuckin’ detectin’. 

           He whips out the KEYCARD he found in the white van...

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        Now watch this churlish bullshit.

           ... and jams it into a SLOT IN THE ALTAR. Suddenly THE ENTIRE 
           ALTAR STARTS RISING... 
           Fontaine and Yo-Yo step back... as an elevator ascends from 
           beneath it... baptizing the chapel with austere white light... 

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        Not too late to turn around...

           Its doors open, expectant: Speak now... Fontaine enters the 
           elevator, but Slick Charles and Yo-Yo seem apprehensive.

                                 FONTAINE
                        We ain’t come this far...

           Yo-Yo steps in: YOLO. Resigned, Slick Charles steps in, too. 
           Fontaine presses the only button there is to press: DOWN. As 
           the doors close, Fontaine’s already COCKING his .45. Once 
           again, they vanish into the unknown. And once again, above it 
           all, Giant White Jesus watches on in approval...

           PULPIT ELEVATOR - LATER

           You could hear a pin drop... until...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                             (singing softly)
                        I’m goin’ dooooown... We goin’ 
                        dooooown. Prolly gone die 
                        undergrooooouund. Our whooole 
                        worrrld’s up! Siiiide doooownnn...
                             (then)
                        I’m goin’ dooooown.

           Fontaine tries to ignore him, but Yo-Yo joins in.

                                                          YO-YO
                  SLICK CHARLES (CONT'D)
           We goin’ dooooown. Prolly 
           gone die undergrooooouund. 
                                              We goin’ dooooown. Prolly 
                                              gone die undergrooooouund. 

           They look to Fontaine: Sing along. You can tell it’s a hell 
           no. But he does, despite himself, let out a tiny smile. 

                       SLICK CHARLES
                                                     YO-YO (CONT'D)
           Our whooole worrrld’s up! 
           Siiiide doooownnn...
                                              Our whooole worrrld’s up! 
                                              Siiiide doooownnn...

           DING. Game faces.

           INT. SECRET UNDERGROUND COMPLEX - HALLWAY - SAME

           Hard fluorescents. The stench of Cold War paranoia. For a 
           moment, all we see is Fontaine’s swole ass arm poking out, 
           his .45 turned a cool 90 degrees to the side. Then the rest 
           of him emerges, followed by Yo-Yo and Slick Charles.
           No sign of Braided White Lady, or anyone else at the moment. 
           Just a strange hallway striped with chipped burgundy paint.

                                 YO-YO
                             (to Slick Charles)
                        What now?

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Shit, I don’t know! I did my part, 
                        I earned my orange slices.
                             (to Fontaine)
                        What now?

                                 FONTAINE
                        Now we look around.

           They start sneaking down the hallway. 

                                 YO-YO
                        Am I the only one getting an old 8-
                        track kinda feel--

           Fontaine holds up a hand: Quiet.

           VOICES... coming from the INTERSECTING HALLWAY up ahead. The 
           gang gets skinny, pressing themselves up against a wall just 
           as A TRIO OF MEN IN HAZMAT SUITS pass, swapping office gossip. 
           They walk by the gang, none the wiser as to their presence. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        We gone stick out like fur coats on 
                        hoes in here...

           Fontaine peeks down the perpendicular hallway... spies one of 
           the men in hazmat suits breaking off into the men’s restroom. 
           Fontaine’s got that look in his eyes: I got an idea.

           MEN’S RESTROOM - LATER

           Hazmat Suit’s standing at one of the urinals, relieving 
           himself. He’s unzipped enough of his suit to do the deed. 

           In his periphery, someone takes the adjacent urinal... And 
           just as he realizes something’s amiss -- CRACK! -- Fontaine’s 
           fist COLLIDES WITH HIS TINTED FACE-SHIELD--

           HALLWAY - LATER

           Fontaine, NOW IN A HAZMAT SUIT, quickly dragging someone’s 
           unconscious body across the hallway... shoving him into a 
           BROOM CLOSET with TWO OTHER UNCONSCIOUS MEN, both bound with 
           their own stripped-off clothes. Shutting the door.
           Nearby we spot Yo-Yo and Slick Charles ALSO WEARING HAZMAT 
           SUITS. Their faces obscured by the TINTED FACE-SHIELDS.

                                 YO-YO
                             (re: her hazmat suit)
                        Ooooo this kinda clean though. 

           They keep moving. Their disguises are quickly tested when a 
           PENCIL-PUSHER rounds the corner. They wave... He waves. Whew. 
           Then their eyes land on a LARGE ELEPHANT DOOR at the end of 
           the hallway. Seems important. When they reach it...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Cross ya fingers...

           ... Slick Charles whips out the KEY-CARD. Presses it against 
           the CARD READER. It glows green. With a WHOOSH, the door 
           slides aside, and the gang steps into 

           THE CENTRAL CONCOURSE.

           The connective hub of whatever this place is. Bout as wide 
           across as an airport concourse, extending both ways deep into 
           the distance. Bisected in the center by a similarly-sized 
           concourse. Each dotted with other elephant doors that lead to 
           smaller, off-shooting hallways.

           Buzzing about, a plethora of WHITE FOLK. Some in hazmat suits, 
           some in lab coats, some in corporate middle management attire. 
           Some with BLACK FOLK HAIR. Some zipping around on GOLF CARTS, 
           some on segways, some even on bicycles. 

           It’s Area 51 meets Office Space down here. 1950’s 
           architecture beneath a patina of ultra-modern tech and those 
           same kitschy HR posters we saw in the trap-lab. The gang 
           stares, flabbergasted by the scale. By the weirdness. 

           There’s a HUGE MAP OUTLINING THE GLEN ON THE WALL. Detailing 
           not only the landmarks, but the subterranean structures 
           honeycombed underneath it. 

                                 YO-YO
                        All this time... these motherfuckers 
                        been hiding right under us...

           Ambling further in, they’re almost hit by a BICYCLIST. 

                        BICYCLIST
                                                      SLICK CHARLES
           Hey watch it, pal!
                                              Pardon me!

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        ... What are all these niggas doin’ 
                        down here?
                                 FONTAINE
                        ... Let’s find out...

           Off the gang... The fuck have we gotten ourselves into... as 
           the Dramatics’ 1977 ode to love, “Spaced Out Over You,” 
           SLIDES IN...

           THE “HONEYCOMB HIDEOUT” MONTAGE

           IN THE CENTRAL CONCOURSE... Gliding over the milieu as a GOLF 
           CART chugs into view. The gang, scrunched together behind the 
           wheel, gaping slack-jawed beneath their face-shields. A 
           propagandistic mural depicting THREE SMILING CHILDREN beneath 
           a bombastic letterhead: “Striving together towards peace!” 
           The painting gives way to a large sign stenciled on the wall: 

                                      manufacturing T

           IN THE PRODUCTION NODE... Assembly lines of cleanroom-suited 
           techs, overseeing the manufacture of specially-made goods 
           like Anaconda Malt Liquor. The gang navigates through.

           IN SHIPPING... Forklifts and workers, loading shipping 
           palettes of the aforementioned goods into row upon row of 
           unmarked semi-trucks. They sport license plates from 
           Michigan, Arizona, New Jersey, etc... 

           IN THE CENTRAL CONCOURSE... Driving now through a different 
           section of the underground labyrinth. The walls here have a 
           different earth-toned paint coat and the sign they pass reads:

                                 o OVERSIGHT  

           IN OVERSIGHT... Walking down a sub-corridor. Thick glass in 
           the walls lets the gang glimpse into the rooms beyond. 
           Through smoke-and-coffee-filled haze, they can make out 
           SEVERAL DOZEN PEOPLE. Arranged like mission control, awash in 
           the bluish glow of STACKED SURVEILLANCE MONITORS and COMPUTER 
           SCREENS. Inside, they chatter like bored NASA employees...

                                 OVERSIGHT TECH 
                        Got a 604 over on 22nd. Gunshots. 
                        Send a clean-up crew.

           IN THE CENTRAL CONCOURSE... The gang drives, dwarfed by 
           another propagandistic mural. This one: a SMILING SCIENTIST, 
           pointing her index finger at her own noggin: “Unity Starts 
           Here!” A flowing American flag gripped in her other hand.

                                          RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT   T

           IN RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT... This is where the magic happens:
           ... an UNCONSCIOUS BLACK MAN lies on a table, electrodes on 
           his head, measuring his BRAIN WAVES. Techs monitor.

           ... a FILM CREW, shooting the new RUCKUS MUSIC VIDEO in front 
           of a green screen. D4L would be jealous. 

           ... a BLACK WOMAN strapped to a chair, eyelids peeled open as 
           she’s assaulted with a deluge of seemingly random commercials 
           and film clips. She convulses, powerless to close her eyes.

           ... TWO BLACK MEN in an empty room, save for the GIANT 
           SUBWOOFERS in each corner. They bang desperately against the 
           glass of a TWO-WAY MIRROR. ON THE OTHER SIDE, the gang 
           watches amidst other techs and scientists in hazmat suits. 
           One of them TURNS A DIAL, flooding the room with MUSIC: 
           “Shoot a muthafucka, kill a muthafucka...” 

           Slowly but surely, the men turn on each other and start 
           fighting. After a moment, the song changes: “I love you, I 
           love you, kiss me baby, I won’t judge you...” On cue, the men 
           stop fighting... start dancing with each other... and kiss...

           Blending in with their hazmat suits, the gang spies on it all. 
           (Eagle-eyed observers may recognize the subjects as people on 
           the MISSING PERSONS flyers back in We Got Dranks! Mini-Mart.)

           INT. SECRET UNDERGROUND COMPLEX - R&D BREAK ROOM - LATER

           Yo-Yo pulls Fontaine and Slick Charles inside. Snack machine. 
           Round tables. Soon as Yo-Yo confirms the coast is clear, they 
           take off their helmets and start freaking out. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Eeeeeeeevil muthafuckas!

                                 YO-YO
                        Okay, I was wrong. This ain’t no 
                        vanilla missionary shit. We done 
                        crossed the Rubicon! This some sex 
                        dungeon, mint chocolate chip 
                        bukkake! I mean you realize what 
                        they’re doing here, right?!

                                 FONTAINE
                        Experimentin’ on niggas, yeah I was 
                        there!

                                 YO-YO
                        Mind control! Think: the chicken, 
                        the communion, the experiments... 
                        It’s all to fuck with how we feel, 
                        what we do, how we think! To 
                        control us!
                                 FONTAINE
                        But why?!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Do it matter?! We just found out 
                        they Clockwork Orange-in’ niggas! We 
                        they target audience! We gots to go!

                                 FONTAINE
                        I ain’t goin’ no fuckin’ where til 
                        I find what I came for!

                                 YO-YO
                        It ain’t just about you, nigga! I get 
                        it, you wanna know where that body 
                        came from. But there’s other people 
                        down here! We gotta get help! Tell 
                        somebody! Blow the lid off this shit!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Listen playa, this ain’t Coolhand 
                        Johnny off The Boulevard we talkin’ 
                        bout, this Uncle muthafuckin’ Sam! 
                        The major leagues! Now we gotta make 
                        like my daddy and split!

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... Nah... Not yet. 

           Fontaine puts his helmet back on... marches back out into the

           RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT HALLWAY.

           Yo-Yo and Slick Charles scramble after him.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                             (to a passing tech)
                        Hi, how are ya?
                             (then, to Fontaine)
                        Fontaine. Pssst, Fontaine.

           Fontaine ignores them: Answers are down here. Somewhere. Just 
           then, he spots... A TECH PUSHING A STAINLESS STEEL SURGICAL 
           SLAB. There’s A BODY atop it. Covered by a sheet. Yet 
           Fontaine still notices the LIFELESS BLACK ARM poking out from 
           beneath. Covered in viscous, clear fluid. 

           Then... the body GROANS, and Fontaine realizes that person is 
           NOT DEAD. His gaze stalks the retreating tech... then glances 
           down at the SMALL TRAIL OF FLUID DRIPPING FROM THE BODY.  

                                 YO-YO
                        You gone get our asses killed.
           But Fontaine’s tracking that trail of fluid...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Slow down...

           ... until the fluid disappears beneath a HUGE METALLIC DOOR. 
           Its sign reads: SUPPLY. He stops, staring down at the fluid... 

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        Sensational, another big door with 
                        some creepy shit behind it. How bout 
                        we find one that gets us outta here?

                                 FONTAINE
                        Nobody stoppin’ you. 

           He snatches the key card, taps it on the reader. The door 
           splits open. Cautious, Fontaine treks

           INSIDE.

           Vast. Stygian. Biggest room we’ve seen so far. Fontaine 
           stumbles forward... slowly takes off his helmet... his eyes 
           not believing what they’re seeing...

           BODIES... a legion of bodies. Suspended upright in tubes 
           filled with some sort of phosphorescent amniotic fluid. Their 
           glow casting the room in an eerie gold light.

           Fontaine’s feet drag him forward. Honest-to-God horror in his 
           eyes. Pulling off their helmets too, Yo-Yo and Slick Charles 
           follow, the same look of terrified awe... 

           They walk through row upon row of body tubes. Human beings 
           suspended in fluid like insects in amber. All naked... All 
           lifeless... All BLACK... All people they recognize...

           ON SLICK CHARLES... studying three bodies: they’re all the 
           PREACHER FROM MT. ZION.

           ON YO-YO... looking up at BIDDY, her eyes closed, surrounded 
           by four other Biddys.

           ON FONTAINE... power-walking through row after row. Searching 
           for something he knows is here... On the way, he passes a 
           familiar face that eases his pace, if only for a moment: 
           FROG. Continues on. Where are you.... 

           Eventually, he finds what he was searching for... Fontaine. 
           Not him... but him... a perfect replica... floating serenely 
           in his tube... flanked by a DOZEN OTHER PERFECT FONTAINES...

           Clones...
           Lost, Fontaine stares up at himselves... contempt brewing...

           ON SLICK CHARLES AGAIN... his face unusually solemn... 
           looking at something OFF-SCREEN... for the first time since 
           we’ve met him, Slick Charles has nothing slick to say...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Damn...

           Yo-Yo steps up beside him... the color draining from her face 
           when she sees what he’s been seeing... Doppelgängers. FIVE 
           LIFELESS SLICK CHARLES CLONES.

           Suddenly nothing makes sense. Yo-Yo pales, the implications 
           crashing down on her: What about me? She turns... quicksteps 
           through the tubes... scouring each and every clone body... Say 
           it ain’t so, say it ain’t so... then--

           BANG! The sound of SHATTERED GLASS snaps her back to reality. 
           She chases the sound back to Fontaine, who’s SHOT ONE OF HIS 
           CLONES. Fluid gushes from the shattered tube. Fontaine steps 
           over his clone’s naked, bleeding body, trains his sights on 
           the next clone-- BANG! 

           Glass EXPLODES. The Fontaine clone inside flops to the ground 
           like a dead fish. As he lines up his next shot--

                                 YO-YO
                        Fontaine! Stop!

           BANG! Another clone gone. Fontaine’s shaking with fury, fear, 
           frustration. Yo-Yo grabs his arm, but he shoves her aside. 

                                 YO-YO (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck are you doing?! 

           BANG! On to the next one. But this time Yo-Yo steps in front 
           of the gun. Fontaine shoves her aside again. But she doesn’t 
           quit, wrapping her arms around him. 

                                 YO-YO (CONT’D)
                        Fontaine, please. This won’t help. 
                        They’re not you... They’re not you.

           Emotional, Fontaine eventually concedes. Lowers his gun. Lets 
           himself be hugged. Nearby, Slick Charles is slumped on the 
           floor against one of the tubes. Lost, like Fontaine. Then...

           WEEEEOOOOO! WEEEEOOOOO! WEEEEOOOOO! 

                                 YO-YO (CONT’D)
                        ... Fuck.
           RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT HALLWAY - LATER

           The gang, helmets back on, weaving through the human current: 
           scientists, techs, administration... all racing towards the 
           CLONE ROOM. Yo-Yo scans the hallway, spots an ELEVATOR...

                                 YO-YO
                        Slick Charles, give me the card!

           ... snatches the KEYCARD, presses it against a reader: EGRESS 
           POINT #11: The Rose. Hits the call button. The gang piles 

           INSIDE.

           As the doors close, they catch suspicious glances and turned 
           heads. The elevator rumbles upward. They ditch the helmets. 
           Thousand yards stares... 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        .......... Couldn’t leave well 
                        enough alone, could you? 

                                 FONTAINE
                        If you don’t shut the fuck up, I’m--

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        What?! You gon’ beat my ass? Kill 
                        me? Woopty-doo! They’ll just warm 
                        up another Slick Charles in the 
                        microwave! That’s what they did to 
                        yo ass, right?

                                 FONTAINE
                        That wasn’t me!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Nigga wake up!... You ain’t the 
                        Fontaine, you a Fontaine!

                                 YO-YO
                        Stop!

           Fontaine and Slick Charles fume. Yo-Yo’s hanging on by a 
           thread herself; she slumps against the elevator wall... 
           Everyone’s at a complete loss.

                                 YO-YO (CONT’D)
                        God I’m tired... 

           They all are. We sit in silence. Until... DING.
           INT. THE ROSE NIGHTCLUB - VIP - SAME

           Crunk. Dark. Bottle service. Ballers. Fake ballers. The back 
           wall is ONE BIG MIRROR. A panel on said mirror SLIDES ASIDE, 
           and out steps the gang. Completely overdressed in their hazmat 
           suits. Yo-Yo almost laughs.

                                 YO-YO
                        Of course...

           Fontaine takes a drink off some dude’s table. Downs it.

                                 FAKE BALLER
                        Ay! 

           He takes one look at Fontaine: this motherfucker looks crazy. 
           Decides better. Yo-Yo starts shimmying out of her suit.

                                 YO-YO
                        Get rid of these. Hurry.  

           They slip out of theirs. Follow Yo-Yo out of VIP, onto 

           THE DANCE FLOOR.

           Hard to move. Sweaty partygoers, packed like sardines, dance 
           to BASS-HEAVY trap music. The gang struggles towards the exit.

           UP IN THE DJ BOOTH

           DJ STRANGELOVE, white with DREADLOCKS, taps his EARPIECE. 
           Listens... listens... finds Fontaine, Yo-Yo, and Slick 
           Charles in the crowd... nods... grabs the microphone...

                                 THE DJ
                        Y’all feelin’ good tonight?
                             (”Yeeeeeah!”)
                        Yessirrr, that’s what I like to 
                        hear. Y’all already know who it is, 
                        it’s ya boy, DJ Strangelove--
                             (AIRHORNS)
                        --from 97.1 “The Bang” on the 
                        muthalovin’ ones and twos. I see 
                        y’all in here bout to knock each 
                        other out, so I think it might be 
                        time to switch up the vibe. Fellas, 
                        find the closest dime and pull up! 
                        Got that brand new Ruckus, this 
                        right here is called, “Suggestion!”

           The BEAT DROPS, and damn if it ain’t smooth as Ronald Isley’s 
           sheets. Folks couple up. Swaying to the hypnotic groove. 
                                 RUCKUS (OVER THE SPEAKERS)
                        Can I ask you a questiooonnnn? 
                        Don’tcha love when I make ya 
                        mooOOOoove? Can I make a 
                        suggestiooooonnn? Just doooo what I 
                        tell ya to dooOOOooo...

           This that baby-makin’ shit right here. Party’s eating it up. 
           Entranced. The gang keeps their eyes on the exit door...

                                 RUCKUS (OVER THE SPEAKERS) (CONT’D)
                        When the music hits your soooooul, 
                        let me take cooooontrol. And doooo 
                        what I tell ya to dooOOOooo...

           Getting harder to move now, bodies writhing, a Caligula.

                                 YO-YO
                        Move... Move...

                                 RUCKUS (OVER THE SPEAKERS)
                        Put one hand in the skyyyyy, my, oh 
                        my, ooooh my. Won’t you doooo what 
                        I tell ya to dooOOOooo...

           Hands start floating up. Waving. Yo-Yo notices her RIGHT ARM 
           LIFTING, a mind of its own. She pulls it down. Looks back at 
           Fontaine, who’s got his hand in the air, too.

                                 YO-YO
                        Don’t focus on the music! It’s one 
                        of their songs! Distract yourself! 

           Fontaine snaps out of it.

                                 YO-YO (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Slick Charles?

           They double-check their six. He’s gone. But the exit’s right 
           there in sight. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        If he wanna stick around and get 
                        caught, that’s on him.

                                 YO-YO
                        We can’t just leave him.

                                 FONTAINE
                        You can’t.

           Fontaine pushes towards the door, fighting against the music. 
           Yo-Yo watches him disappear into the crowd, hesitating for a 
           moment before sighing and pushing back the way they came.
                                 RUCKUS (OVER THE SPEAKERS)
                        Now before you bump and griiiind, 
                        spin for me three tiiiimes... Doooo 
                        what I tell ya to dooOOOooo... 

           Everyone but Yo-Yo and Fontaine spins around three times. 
           When Yo-Yo finally spots Slick Charles, he too is spinning. 
           Totally succumbed to the music. Dancing with a lady. 

                                 YO-YO
                        Slick Charles! 

           Yo-Yo CLAPS in his face but he keeps dancing. Music’s too 
           powerful. He’s too far gone. 

                                 YO-YO (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me! You’re hypnotized! 

           She tries to yank him towards the exit, but there’s no moving 
           him. Least until... FONTAINE STEPS IN, scooping him up over 
           his shoulders in a fireman’s carry. He eyes Yo-Yo.

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... Don’t just stand there!

           They’re getting the hell out this bitch, come hell or 
           highwater... Almost at the exit...

           UP IN THE DJ BOOTH

           Strangelove eyes them. Change of plans. He GRABS THE MIC.

                                 DJ STRANGELOVE
                        I know we really feelin’ this one, 
                        and I don’t wanna stop the groove, 
                        but I just got one more thing I 
                        need y’all to do... 

           He KILLS THE MUSIC. Points at the gang, who’ve just made it 
           to the exit. That radio-host affectation gone from his voice.

                                 DJ STRANGELOVE (CONT’D)
                        Get those three motherfuckers by 
                        the door!

           BY THE DOOR... the gang looks back just in time to see the 
           whole motherfuckin’ club turn around at once...

                         FONTAINE
                                                          YO-YO
           Shhhhiiit...
                                              Go!

           No need to say it twice: Fontaine KICKS OPEN THE DOOR, THROWS 
           SLICK CHARLES TO HIS FEET, AND SPRINTS OUTSIDE INTO
           THE PARKING LOT.

           Hot on their heels, rabid partygoers FLOOD OUT OF THE DOUBLE-
           DOORS. On some Dawn Of The Dead shit. 

           Fontaine, Yo-Yo, and Slick Charles run like the wind through 
           this derelict shopping center parking lot. They’ve got maybe 
           forty yards worth of a head start, and it’s dwindling fast.

                       SLICK CHARLES
                                                          YO-YO
           Awww nawl! Aww nawl!
                                              Shut up and run!

           They burst into the street. Thinking on his feet, Fontaine 
           whips out his .45 and RUNS IN FRONT OF THE FIRST CAR HE SEES. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        Get the fuck out! 

           The door pops open; the driver quickly falls out. 

                                 YO-YO
                        You for real right now?!

                                 FONTAINE
                        Got a better idea?! 

           With no better ideas, Yo-Yo and Slick Charles dive

           IN THE CAR.

           Fontaine slams the gas. It LURCHES FORWARD. Putting a little 
           distance between them and the mob. But then the car starts 
           SPUTTERING. JERKING.

           That’s when we realize this car is a piece of shit.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Muthafucka do you even know how to 
                        drive a stick?!

                                 FONTAINE
                        I’m tryna concentrate!

                                 YO-YO
                        Aww lawd, this nigga done stole the 
                        raggediest car in the city.

           Fontaine does his best, but he doesn’t know how to drive a 
           stick. Slick Charles spies the mob in the REARVIEW MIRROR. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        We supposed to be gettin’ away, 
                        these niggas gettin’ closer! Drive!
                                 FONTAINE
                        I’m tryin’!

           POP! That didn’t sound good. The car JERKS again. The engine 
           coughs up a lung. Dies. The car’s momentum slowly dissipating 
           as it rolls to a lazy stop in the middle of the street. No 
           time to get out. Mob’s too close. They sigh...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        I hate you, Fontaine...

           ... and a second later, the mob arrives... but instead of 
           washing over their car like a tidal wave, they SURROUND IT. 
           Completely encircling them, yet standing back at a polite 
           distance. Empty faces. The gang looks on, confused.

                                 YO-YO
                        Well, we ain’t dead yet... So... 
                        glass half-full...

           Fontaine gets 

           OUT.

           Yo-Yo follows. Then a begrudging Slick Charles.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Gettin’ out the car. Why not. 

           Fontaine approaches the wall of partygoers. They’re not 
           moving. Not speaking. Just staring. Still hypnotized. 

                                 YO-YO
                        The hell are they waiting for?

                                 FONTAINE
                        I don’t know...

           And lo... the sound of BASS. Deep. Ominous. Getting closer... 
           The mob SEPARATES, making room for a COCAINE-WHITE 1977 
           CADILLAC COUP DE’VILLE. Tinted windows rattling from all that 
           knock in the trunk. It glides to a stop before them.

           For a second, nothing happens. Fontaine grips his .45. Tight. 
           Then... the driver steps out...

           ... it’s another Fontaine.

           Doesn’t seem as surprised to see Fontaine as Fontaine does to 
           see him. The back door opens... and out steps a well-coiffed, 
           middle-aged white guy. At ease. In control. 

           This is NIXON.
                                 NIXON
                             (clapping)
                        Yes! Yes! You did it, guys! Let’s 
                        bring in the cameras!
                             (off the speechless gang)
                        The look on your faces. I’m joshin’! 
                        For a second though, right?
                            (hands on his hips; a sigh)
                        You three... You three caused a lot 
                        of paperwork. But hey, not entirely 
                        your fault, I’ll throw a mea culpa 
                        in there. 
                             (to Fontaine)
                        Had some new hires really screw the 
                        pooch on your last rotation.

                                 FONTAINE
                        So you the nigga in charge. 

                                 NIXON
                        No, no, everyone’s got a boss. 
                        Mine’s a real hard-ass... You two 
                        would really hit it off... Think of 
                        me as more of a branch manager of 
                        sorts. Call me Nixon.

                                 YO-YO
                        Branch manager? You’re torturing 
                        people down there. Black people.

                                 NIXON
                        Whoa, whoa. First, Yo-Yo, we are not 
                        torturing anybody. We are 
                        researching. Experimenting. Doing 
                        science. And we’re not experimenting 
                        on black people. It’s just that 
                        everyone we’re experimenting on 
                        happens to be black. Small 
                        difference, worth noting. 

                                 YO-YO
                        Right, so you just happened to pick 
                        the poorest, blackest neighborhood 
                        to set up shop. Got you.

           He chuckles to himself. Digs a pouch of Big League Chew from 
           his breast pocket, stuffs a wad of gum in his jaw.

                                 NIXON
                        ... You’re a pretty girl, you’re 
                        clever... Why not Midtown? 
                        Suburbia? Somewhere nice?

                        john, no matter where you go. So 
                        why pick the most derelict part of 
                        town? Why not take your services 
                        elsewhere? Make more money?

                                 YO-YO
                        Get to the point.

                                 NIXON
                        You stay here. Because here is 
                        where you know you can get away 
                        with it... We don’t hate black 
                        people. We don’t hate anyone, but-- 

                                 FONTAINE
                        But you know you can get away with 
                        it here...

                                 NIXON
                        I’m sorry that your neighborhood is 
                        where the sausage is made, but 
                        we’ve got to make it somewhere. If 
                        it helps, it’s for a good cause. 

                                 YO-YO
                        Oh, so you Kevin Bacon.

                                 NIXON
                        ... I don’t follow.

                        Hollow Man, muthafucka. 

           That is clearly not what Yo-Yo was referring to...

                        You just wanna control people.

                        I can’t say I’ve seen that

                        I have seen? The news. Turn it on

                        A half-baked idea cooked up by 
                        aristocratic ideologues in mansions 
                        built by slaves. They got to check 
                        out, left us with the tab: a country

                        Doesn’t. Work. We need to control 
                        people. If we’re all on the same 
                        page, then we’re not ripping each

                        In order for us to continue our 
                        work... here... we need this place 
                        to maintain a certain... flavor. 
                        Quality of life... Je ne sais quoi.

                        Quality of-- this place is a trap. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        And you use us to keep it that way.

                        Gentrification is real, kids. You 
                        think if you weren’t out there on 
                        the front lines every day, these 
                        white people wouldn’t just roll in 
                        here like they owned the place? If 
                        we took you guys off the street, 
                        there’d be three Starbucks here by 
                        next Tuesday and there goes our 
                        control setting. You are pillars of 
                        the community. It behooves us to 
                        ensure you’re always available.

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... So the only reason I exist is 
                        to keep the place fucked up...

                                 NIXON
                        Don’t go all glass-half-empty on me 
                        now, Fontaine. You are a patriot.
                             (then)
                        Okay, so... now what?
                                 YO-YO
                        That a trick question?

                                 NIXON
                        No ma’am. There’s a choice here to 
                        be made. Way I see it, you’ve got 
                        two viable options. One, I can have 
                        my good buddy Chester here kill you. 

           CHESTER, aka the other Fontaine, stares at them, impassive. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                             (leaning into Fontaine)
                        They done named you Chester...

                                 NIXON
                        Two, you do nothing. You go back to 
                        your normal lives, you do what you 
                        do best, you look the other way. 
                             (then)
                        Now that sounds like a fuckin’ 
                        fantastic deal! Ain’t that right, 
                        Chester?
                             (guy don’t talk much...)
                        Chester agrees. Thank you, Chester. 
                        I legitimately like you three. 
                        Against all odds, we are having this 
                        conversation. That says something. 
                        So choose. What will it be?

           A moment... then Fontaine reaches for his .45--

                         FONTAINE
                                                     NIXON (CONT'D)
           Option number three--
                                              Olympia Black.

           --but before his hand can even reach it, HE FREEZES... 

           Stiff as a corpse, save for his eyeballs, which dart around 
           wildly. His hand hovering mere inches away from his gun. Both 
           Slick Charles and Chester are stuck in place as well. Chester, 
           his arms crossed, looks like he’s used to the feeling. 

           Nixon spits out his gum...

                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        You had to try. Hell, we made you 
                        that way. But you really need to 
                        understand your position here.

           Meanwhile, Yo-Yo stares at her own hands. Unlike Fontaine and 
           Slick Charles, she can move: I’m not a clone...
                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        We own you. That gold chain around 
                        your neck. That sweet gold grill. 
                        That .45 you’re reaching for. 

                                 YO-YO
                        He ain’t the only one with a gun.

           Nixon looks up to see Yo-Yo aiming her .38 at his smug ass 
           face. Doesn’t seem too worried. 

                                 NIXON
                        Yo-Yooooo. 

                                 YO-YO
                        Unfreeze ‘em... Now. ‘Fore I put a 
                        bullet through those fucking teeth.

                                 NIXON
                        Spicy! Mmmm-mmm! 
                             (then)
                        Fontaine...

           Viper-quick, Fontaine’s arm shoots out, mind of its own, and 
           clutches Yo-Yo by the wrist. Aims the gun away from Nixon. 
           Doesn’t let go. Yo-Yo YELPS. Fontaine stares at his hand, 
           wide-eyed, as his grip tightens...

                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        Wild, right?

           Yo-Yo collapses to her knees as Fontaine’s grip crushes the 
           bones in her wrist. He shakes, trying to regain control. 

                                 YO-YO
                        Fon...taine...

                                 NIXON
                        Fontaine, point that gun at Yo-Yo.

           Despite his best efforts not to, Fontaine savagely RIPS THE 
           GUN FROM HER HAND AND POINTS IT AT HER. Yo-Yo cradles her 
           wrists, reeling. Looks up at Fontaine shaking above her. 
           Slick Charles can only watch in petrified horror.

                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        My buddy Chester. Slick Charles. 
                        Fontaine. Know what they have in 
                        common? They’re expensive. You? Dime 
                        a dozen. Just a regular ol’ hoe. 

                                 YO-YO
                             (to Fontaine)
                        Don’t let him...
           Veins bulge from Fontaine’s temple. He’s trying so hard...

                                 NIXON
                        Nope. It’s still not...
                             (tapping his forehead)
                        ... getting through...
                             (a sigh)
                        Fontaine, put that gun in your 
                        mouth.

           Fontaine puts the gun his mouth. Nixon’s anger bubbles out.

                           YO-YO
                                                     NIXON (CONT'D)
           No! Stop!
                                              Fontaine, pull that hammer 
                                              back!

           Powerless, he does as he’s told.

                                 YO-YO
                        Please! Don’t hurt him!

           Fun-loving Nixon is gone. It’s like a switch flipped.

                                 NIXON
                        Fontaine, say your prayers!

           Fontaine prepares for the end.

                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        Is it getting through to you now?!
                        The only reason you’re still alive 
                        is because I don’t wanna deal with 
                        the paperwork! Your lives are not 
                        worth a few hours of my time! Are we 
                        all on the same fucking page?!

           Silence... Nixon studies the gang. Finds the answer he’s 
           looking for. Calms the fuck down. Combs his hair back. 

                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        ...Okay. Relax, everybody.

           Fontaine, Chester, and Slick Charles regain control. Yo-Yo 
           exhales. Fontaine collapses to the ground, spent. 

                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        Good talk. I knew you’d make the 
                        right choice. 
                             (taps the hood of the car)
                        Chester, let’s go. Get a burger or 
                        something. I’m starving.

           Chester shuts Nixon’s door behind him. Spares Fontaine one 
           last glance, then gets in himself. Drives away. 
           As the car disappears from view, the hypnosis controlling the 
           partygoers begins to fade as well. They start coming to, lost 
           as to how they got outside.

           Off the gang, speechless, defeated...

           EXT. THE GLEN - DAWN

           Sunrise... 

           INT. FONTAINE’S TRAP HOUSE - HIS ROOM - DAY

           Fontaine’s eyes snap open. Back in his bed. Back in his room. 
           Back in his world. He sits up. 

           KITCHEN - LATER

           Closing the fridge, eyes landing on that OLD POLAROID OF HIM 
           AND RONNIE. Grabbing the Wonderbread. Opening a jar of Skippy 
           when-- KNOCK, KNOCK. Fontaine pauses, considers... then gets 
           back to spreading peanut butter. A few seconds later:

           KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! Fontaine sighs.

           LIVING ROOM - LATER

           He unlatches the last of his six latches and opens the front 
           door. Yo-Yo pushes inside. Scans the room until she finds... 
           A STEREO. She plugs in her CELL PHONE...

                                 FONTAINE
                        Mind tellin’ me what you doin’?

           ... and HITS PLAY. It’s JAZZ. From the time of the titans. 
           CRANKS the volume. Fontaine already knows what’s up...

                                                    FONTAINE (CONT'D)

                                              Yo-Yo......

                                              Yo-Yo......
                           YO-YO
           Okay. So I checked the church 
           this morning. Keycard didn’t 
           work. They must’ve flagged 
           it. I don’t know about all 
           the other places, but I’m 
           guessing it’s more of the 
           same. We need to find another 
           way in-- 

                                 FONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        Yo-Yo... 

           Fontaine TURNS OFF THE MUSIC...
                                 FONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        I’m done.

           He serious? Yo-Yo turns the music BACK ON.

                                 YO-YO
                        What?

                                 FONTAINE
                        I said I’m done.

                                 YO-YO
                        ... Done? The fuck you talking 
                        bout? How can you say that?

                                 FONTAINE
                        Leave it alone.

           Fontaine heads back towards his room. Yo-Yo stomps after him. 

                                 YO-YO
                        This is bigger than you. Than us. 
                        You don’t get to just check out. 
                        This is your home!

                                 FONTAINE
                             (turning to face her)
                        Who gives a fuck?! This ain’t no 
                        fuckin’ community. This place is 
                        just a buncha broke niggas with 
                        nowhere else to go! 

                                 YO-YO
                        Good people live here.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Who?! The jays? The gangbangers? 
                        The niggas who pay you to suck they 
                        dick? 
                             (off Yo-Yo, hurt)
                        Nah, ain’t nothin’ good here. Cause 
                        of me. I’m the dope boy, remember? 
                        That’s who I am. So I’ma go back to 
                        doin’ me. 

                                 YO-YO
                        There’s your excuse... 

                                 FONTAINE
                        Excuse? I was grown in a fuckin’ 
                        tube. I ain’t have no say in this 
                        shit! What’s yo excuse, huh?! I saw 
                        all them trophies in ya room: What 
                        you wanted to do? Be a doctor? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FONTAINE (CONT'D)
                        Detective? Fuckin’ scientist?! Or 
                        was this the plan all along?

                                 YO-YO
                        ... You’re right... I was supposed 
                        to be in New York, chasing down 
                        leads for the Times. Or scuba diving 
                        in the Caribbean, you know, looking 
                        for lost treasures and shit... 
                        Somewhere else... Anywhere else...
                             (then)
                        But nope, still in the Glen. Right 
                        up the street from the house I grew 
                        up in. Right up the street from the 
                        motel I share with four other hoes. 
                        Right up the street from all the 
                        same old shit I always wanted to 
                        get away from... But I am here... 
                             (then)
                        And I can’t do it by myself.

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... Then don’t do it.

           He opens his room door. Done with it.

                                 YO-YO
                        ... Maybe the next Fontaine won’t 
                        be such a pussy.

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... Maybe he won’t... You know 
                        where the door is.

           With that, he shuts her out. Yo-Yo lingers, the fire in her 
           eyes extinguishing... as Kanye West’s 2005 melancholic 
           motherfuckin’ diamond, “My Way Home,” CUES...

           THE “THEY LIVE” MONTAGE

           IN SOMEBODY’S FRONT YARD... as Fontaine hits his reps on the 
           same ad-hoc bench we saw in the beginning. On autopilot.

           IN FONTAINE’S TRAP HOUSE... on a different day... as the crew 
           BAGS UP COKE. He passes an 8-ball to one of his TEEN DEALERS.

           IN FONTAINE’S CUTLASS... another day... as he drives, Big Moss 
           riding shotgun. Big Moss chats, fans himself, but Fontaine 
           just stares out the window. At the detritus. At the poverty. 
           Big Moss hits the radio, starts Bankhead bouncing to one of 
           RUCKUS’ SONGS (the same song they shot the music video for 
           down in the facility). Fontaine tunes it out as best he can.
           ON THE SIDEWALK... new day... as Fontaine walks down the 
           street. He comes across the SAME JUNKIE he stepped over once 
           upon a time. But this time the sight of him gives Fontaine 
           pause... his shaking... his suffering... hurts to see. 
           Fontaine grits his teeth, steps over him anyway.

           IN GOT DAMN! FRIED CHICKEN... yet another day... as Fontaine 
           eats dinner. Through the window he watches as, across the 
           street, an AMBULANCE loads a BLOODY GANGBANGER into its 
           wagon. Fontaine returns to his food as, all around him, 
           customers LAUGH RIOTOUSLY. 

           IN WE GOT DRANKS! MINI-MART... and another... as Fontaine 
           grabs an Anaconda malt liquor off the shelf. At the register 
           he buys cigarillos and a SCRATCH-OFF and heads... 

           EXT. WE GOT DRANKS! MINI-MART - DAY

           ... outside. He takes a swig. Scratches off one of the 
           bubbles: You Lose! He stares at it... thinking... then...

           ... something compels him to scratch off another bubble... 
           You Lose! Then another... You Lose! Then ALL OF THEM...

                              You Lose!   You Lose!   You Lose!   You Lose!
                              You Lose!   You Lose!   You Lose!   You Lose!
                              You Lose!   You Lose!   You Lose!   You Lose!

           Fontaine laughs softly to himself. Sits on the curb. Lost. 

                                 FROG (O.S.)
                        You looooose. Always. Hehehehe...

           He turns to see Frog holding up his cup. As Fontaine fills it, 
           he takes a long look at the friendly wino: He wears it well...

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... How do you do it, Frog?

           Frog smiles. It’s hard to read. He tips his cup. Takes a swig. 

           INT. FONTAINE’S TRAP HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Fontaine collapses into the couch. Chugs the 40. Drinking to 
           get drunk. Already halfway there. Turns on the TV. 

                                 COMMERCIAL (ON TV)
                        --limited-time-only Hotbox Spicy 
                        Chicken! Cause remember, who needs 
                        vices...
           Fontaine darkens...

                                 COMMERCIAL (ON TV) (CONT’D)
                        ... So if you’re in town, come on 
                        down and getcha some of this 
                        crunchy-friend golden bro--

           SMASH! The Anaconda malt liquor bottle shatters the screen. 
           Now all is quiet... Fontaine’s barely holding on... then...

                                 MAMA (O.S.)
                        Everything okay in there, baby?

           A stillness falls over Fontaine: Can’t avoid it any longer... 
           His eyes finally drift to his mother’s door... He stands... 
           approaches it... listens for a moment... TAPS softly...

                                 FONTAINE
                        Ay, Mama.

                                 MAMA (O.S.)
                        .......... Yeah, baby?

                                 FONTAINE
                        Can you come out here for a second?

                                 MAMA (O.S.)
                        .......... Not right now, baby. I’m 
                        reading The Good Book.

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... Please, Mama. 

                                 MAMA (O.S.)
                        .......... I’m tired, baby.

           He rattles the doorknob. Locked. Nearly rips it off its hinge.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Mama, open the door.

                                 MAMA (O.S.)
                        .......... I’m okay, thanks baby.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Open the door.

                                 MAMA (O.S.)
                        .......... No thanks, baby.

                                 FONTAINE
                             (KICKING the door)
                        Open this... fuckin’... door! 
           One last kick BLASTS THE DOOR OPEN. He takes inventory of the 
           room, the last shred of his identity dying at the sight... 
           There’s nothing in here. Nothing but a SMALL DESK, A SPEAKER, 
           AND AN AUDIO BOX... Fontaine tries to hold on to his rage, but 
           it melts away as he walks towards the desk...

                                 FONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        Mama, I really need you right now...

                                 MAMA (O.S.)
                        ......... I’m okay, baby. Josephine 
                        had a fish fry over at the communi--

           CRASH! Fontaine kicks the desk over. Starts hyperventilating, 
           fighting the white hot tears welling in his eyes. His home, 
           suddenly a prison cell. Suffocating him. He scrambles

           OUTSIDE.

           Only makes it as far as his front yard. Collapses. Tears 
           burning his cheeks. SCREAMS. Punches the earth. Letting it 
           all out until there’s absolutely nothing left... then...

                                 BABY G (O.S.)
                        Nigga, you cryin’?

           Fontaine glances towards the street. It’s Baby G of all 
           people. On his squeaky ass bike, sipping a Capri Sun.

                                 BABY G (CONT’D)
                        You is cryin! What you cryin’ for?

           Baby G kickstands his bike. Sits next to Fontaine.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Man get on somewhere, Baby G.

                                 BABY G
                        You owe me fifteen dollars.

           Fontaine gives up. No getting rid of this kid. 

                                 BABY G (CONT’D)
                        One time, Spongebob and Patrick got 
                        so sad, they started crying all 
                        over each other, and water sprayed 
                        outta their eyes like a water gun, 
                        and they fell on the ground like 
                        “Waaaaaaaaaaah!”

           Baby G cracks up. Fontaine watches the kid be a kid... then 
           smirks. And pretty soon that smirk becomes a chuckle. And 
           that chuckle an honest-to-God LAUGH. 
           He snatches the Capri Sun out of Baby G’s hands.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Gimme that.

           Starts sipping. Baby G plucks another one from his pocket. 
           For a good while, they just stare at the sky and sip juice.

                                 FONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        You know... you remind of someone. 

                                 BABY G
                        Who?

                                 FONTAINE
                             (a soft smile)
                        ... Nobody.

           EXT. THE ROYAL MOTEL - DAY

           The Cutlass pulls into the lot. Parks. Fontaine steps out, 
           heads toward room 22. En route, he slows down to consider the 
           parking spot in which our original Fontaine died. 

           He KNOCKS... KNOCKS again... No answer.

                                 FONTAINE
                        I know you in there, Slick Charles. 
                             (KNOCK, KNOCK)
                        Come on, ain’t nobody tryna beat ya 
                        ass. Open up... I’ma keep knockin’.

           We hear the door UNLOCK. Fontaine opens it and

           ENTERS.

           Place is a mess. Cheetos bags and empty vodka handles. Broken 
           TV. Slick Charles looks worse than the room. His once-
           pristine hair frazzled. Beard overgrown. Suit replaced with a 
           stained wife-beater and dingy robe. 

           He shuffles back to the bed. Sits. Fishes through the ashtray 
           for a butt. Lights it. Exhales and sighs at the same time.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Yeah, yeah, yeah...

                                 FONTAINE
                        When the last time you took a 
                        shower?
                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        I plead the fifth.

           Fontaine sighs, too. Eyes what used to be the TV. Gets it. 
           Takes a seat beside Slick Charles. Then...

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        I never won the Players Ball, did 
                        I? I remember it like it was 
                        yesterday. I was there. Held the 
                        trophy in my hands.

                                 FONTAINE
                        .......... I never had a little 
                        brother... Still love him, though.

           Slick Charles grins a little; Fontaine pats him on the back.

           EXT. THE TRACK - DAY

           A few prostitutes, the veterans, trying to make them daytime 
           dollars. Chatting amongst themselves when-- HOOOONK!

                                 SLICK CHARLES (O.S.)
                        Biddddaaaaaayyy! Biddy!

           Biddy looks up to see Fontaine’s Cutlass, Slick Charles 
           hanging out the window. Suited and booted again, hairdo 
           fresher than real Florida orange juice.

                                 BIDDY
                        Fuck you, Slick Charles.

           She struts away. The Cutlass ROLLS RIGHT ALONGSIDE HER.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Where Yo-Yo?

                                 BIDDY
                        No, “Hey Biddy, what’s shakin’?” 
                        Just straight to the golden goose.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Come on, live in the spirit of 
                        cooperation. I’m on a quest right 
                        now. I ain’t forgot about yo ass.

                                 BIDDY
                        You took the week off, you ain’t 
                        seein’ shit from me.
                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Fair enough. Just tell us where Yo-
                        Yo is and we’ll electric slide. 

                                 BIDDY
                        ... Yo-Yo retired. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        She always retires. And then un-
                        retires. That’s why I call her--

                                 BIDDY
                        Naw, Slick Charles. For real this 
                        time. She stacked up all week, just 
                        bought a bus ticket to Memphis. 
                        Stopped by an hour ago to tell us 
                        it’s been real. 

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

           The last few stragglers are boarding... as we find Yo-Yo 
           sitting towards the back, staring out the window... a quiet 
           goodbye to The Glen... 

                                 BUS DRIVER (O.S.)
                        Hurry up, I’m closing the doors.

           Yo-Yo inserts her earbuds, cracking open a crossword book as 
           the bus driver prepares to disembark. She scribbles an answer 
           into seventeen across as someone taps her on the shoulder...

                                 YO-YO
                             (removing her earbuds)
                        Excuse me?

           ... Fontaine.

                                 FONTAINE
                        I said... this seat taken?

           Her face drops; she puts the earbuds right back in.

                                 FONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        You ain’t listenin’ to nothin’... 

           With a huff, she snatches them right back out. He takes a 
           seat beside her as the BUS PULLS OFF...

                                 YO-YO
                        You know this bus is leaving?

                                 FONTAINE
                        I know.
                                 YO-YO
                        Then why are you on it?

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... What I said... about you... I 
                        was wrong...

                                 YO-YO
                        You were just calling a spade a 
                        spade. It is what it is. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        Nah... 
                             (re: himself and Slick 
                              Charles)
                        We bought into the bullshit. Bout 
                        who we was. Who they told us we was 
                        sposed to be... Bout The Glen... 
                        But you didn’t. 

                                 YO-YO
                        Yeah, well, where’d that get us...

                                 FONTAINE
                        That got us out the dark. We 
                        wouldn’t even know what’s goin’ on 
                        if it wasn’t for you.

                                 YO-YO
                        We? 

           Slick Charles peeks from between the seats in front of them.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Present and accounted for. Look, you 
                        know I hate this broodin’ 
                        muthafucka, but he right. Ya like a 
                        smarter, blacker, better Nancy Drew. 

                                 YO-YO
                        Oh, so now y’all wanna save the 
                        day, huh?

                                 FONTAINE
                        We don’t get to check out, right?

           Rather than go back and forth, Yo-Yo just turns away... 
           stares out the window again...

                                 FONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        Look... If you wanna ride this bus 
                        all the way to the ocean, that’s 
                        cool. We’ll be right here. Cause we 
                        ain’t doin’ it without you, Yo-Yo.
           She keeps her gaze on The Glen... disdain in her eyes...

                                 YO-YO
                        Yo-Yo: always going nowhere...
                             (then...)
                        My name’s Sabrina, you know...

           ... but after a moment... resolve...

                                 YO-YO (CONT’D)
                             (to herself)
                        Nah... Nah, fuck these niggas...

           Yo-Yo turns to Fontaine and Slick Charles. She’s back.

                                 YO-YO (CONT’D)
                        Their head’s on a swivel now. Plus 
                        the keycard don’t work no more. And 
                        even if we did find a way back 
                        down, we’d need an army.

                                 FONTAINE
                             (Glad to have you back...)
                        Just... trust me.

           A small “Then let’s do this shit...” smile. Then...

                                 YO-YO
                        Hey stop the bus!

                                 BUS DRIVER (O.S.)
                        Sit yo ass down!

                                 YO-YO
                        Motherfucker wha--

           Off Yo-Yo unzipping her purse, reaching for that .22--

           EXT. THE SIDEWALK - LATER

           The Greyhound bus, zooming off, revealing the gang. Posted.

                                 YO-YO
                             (to Fontaine)
                        Aight, what’s your plan?

           EXT. ISAAC’S TRAP HOUSE - NIGHT

           Fontaine, walking up. The THUGS posted on the porch tense, 
           grab their waistbands. Surprised to see Fontaine alive.
                                 FONTAINE
                        I ain’t come for no smoke. I need 
                        to talk Isaac. 

           Off the homies’ puzzled faces...

           INT. ISAAC’S TRAP HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Just as trapped out as Fontaine’s crib. 

                                 ISAAC
                        Hold on. So you tryna tell me there’s 
                        a bunch of Bill Nye The Science Guy 
                        lookin’ muhfuckas underneath me right 
                        now, experimentin’ on black folk, 
                        clonin’ niggas like you, so they can 
                        control our minds... 

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... Pretty much.

                                 ISAAC
                        And you need my help. To stop them.
                             (laughing to himself)
                        ... Obviously the answer is no.

           Fontaine stands his ground. Can’t leave here without a “yes.”

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... I know me and you got our 
                        differences. Nobody tryna be best 
                        friends and shit. But this is bigger 
                        than us. This our home, man. And 
                        these muhfuckas done came in here 
                        and put they feet up on our couch. 
                        Mamas, grandmamas, kids... they 
                        gotta live here, too. And we 
                        obviously made it hard for ‘em, but 
                        we can’t let them make it worse. 
                        Police for damn sure ain’t gone 
                        help. So it’s on us. Shouldn’t be, 
                        but it is. If we don’t do nothin’ 
                        about it, nobody will. 

           Isaac leans forward. Really chewing on that. Ready to saddle 
           up... but then... he remembers they got beef. Laughs.

                                 ISAAC
                        What kinda stupid ass sh-- You 
                        fucked up comin’ here my nigga.
           Before Fontaine can react -- BANG! -- Isaac whips out his 
           Glock and shoots him in the chest. Fontaine GASPS... falls to 
           his knees... collapses... 

           ... and dies.

                                                               BLACK...

           INT. UNDERGROUND COMPLEX - CLONE ROOM - NIGHT

           Two BORED TECHS, rolling an EMPTY SLAB past rows of clones. 
           Checking a clipboard against the SERIAL NUMBERS on the tubes.

                                 BORED TECH
                        No salt, no pepper? Nothing?

                                 OTHER BORED TECH
                        Nope, just the natural flavor of 
                        the chicken. Boiling really brings 
                        it out.

                                 BORED TECH
                        Just got a crock-pot so I’ll try 
                        that when I get home. Anywho, here 
                        we are... A-201... A-201...

           They’ve reached their destination: it’s the Fontaine section.

                                 OTHER BORED TECH
                        Fontaine? Geez. Guy’s really been 
                        fucking up lately.

                                 BORED TECH
                        Yeah. Supes don’t even want us to 
                        upload his most recent memories. 

                                 OTHER BORED TECH
                        Seen too much, huh? 

                                 BORED TECH
                        I don’t know, I just press the 
                        button.

           He doesn’t press a button, but he does pull a lever, 
           decanting FONTAINE A-201.

           PROCESSING LAB - LATER

           Where old clones get downloaded and their replacements get 
           booted up. Several OCCUPIED BODY BAGS lie on nearby slabs.
           Nearby, Bored Tech secures the final electrode to Fontaine A-
           201’s head. Pulls a SCREEN into place like a dental diopter, 
           inches away from Fontaine A-201’s eyes. He’s just starting to 
           come to. When he speaks, there’s no sign of his usual accent.

                                 FONTAINE A-201
                        Where... am I? What’s... going... 

                                 OTHER BORED TECH
                        Don’t worry, big guy. You’ll feel 
                        like your old self in no time...

           Other Bored Tech flips some switches. The electrodes on his 
           head BUZZ. The screen FLICKERS TO LIFE. On it: thousands of 
           images, cycling too fast to consciously register. 

           Off Fontaine A-201, starting to panic--

           INT. FONTAINE’S TRAP HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

           Fontaine A-2O1 GASPS awake. Feels for bullet holes. What a 
           crazy dream...

           KITCHEN - LATER

           Making two PB&J sandwiches. The old POLAROID still magnetized 
           to fridge behind him. Young Fontaine and young Ronnie.

           LIVING ROOM - LATER

           TV’s been repaired. He KNOCKS on his mama’s door.

                                 FONTAINE A-201
                        Mama, you hungry? Made you a 
                        sandwich. 

                                 MAMA (O.S.)
                        ............ I’m okay, thanks baby.  
                        I’m watching my stories. 

           EXT. SOMEBODY’S FRONT YARD - DAY

           Bench pressin’ like a beast. Swole Muhfuckas yelling insults.

           INT. WE GOT DRANKS! MINI-MART - DAY

           Sippin’ on an Anaconda.

                        one of them scratch-offs.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

           Strolling down the street. Stepping over a junkie with nary a 
           second glance. A lion in his jungle. When... 

                                 YO-YO
                        Fontaine! 

           ... he spots Yo-Yo coming his way. In a huff.

                                 FONTAINE A-201
                        What you want?

                                 YO-YO
                        Hey, umm, I know this is gonna 
                        sound... strange... but I need you 
                        to hear me out.

           CRACK! A sudden blow to the back of Fontaine A-2O1’s head...

                                 FONTAINE A-201
                        The fuck?!

           He whips around and finds Slick Charles. Holding his .38. 
           Looking like he just got caught sneaking out the house.

                  FONTAINE A-201 (CONT’D)
           Musta lost yo fuckin’ mind!
                                                      SLICK CHARLES
                                              Playa, I can explain!

                                 YO-YO
                        You were supposed to knock him out!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        You know I ain’t that strong!

           As Fontaine A-201 grabs Slick Charles by the collar, ready to 
           murder this fool -- CRACK! -- Yo-Yo pistol-whips him with her 
           .22, finishing the job. They stare at his unconscious body.

                                                          YO-YO
                  SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
           ... I softened him up for-- 
                                              Just grab his legs.
           INT. THE ROYAL MOTEL - ROOM 22 - DAY

           Gagged with a pillow case, Fontaine A-201 blinks away just as 
           Yo-Yo and Slick Charles finish tying him to a chair. In lieu 
           of rope they’ve used extension cords and bed sheets.

                                 FONTAINE A-201
                        Mmmmm! MmmmMmmm! Mmmmmmmmm!

                           YO-YO
           Sorry, Fontaine. Or whoever 
           you are. We can’t have you 
           running around right now. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        You understand, playa. 

                                 YO-YO
                        Come on.

           She heads out. But Slick Charles lingers...

                      FONTAINE A-201
           Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! MmmmMmmm! 
           Mmmmmmmmm!
                                                      SLICK CHARLES
                                              Almost forgot... Now, I know 
                                              it wasn’t you per se... But I 
                                              owe you one.

           ... and -- SHAPOW! -- PIMP SLAPS the taste out of Fontaine A-
           201’s gagged mouth. Pure umami. 

                      FONTAINE A-201
           Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
                                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT'D)
                                              Woooooo that felt good. Aight 
                                              now, sit tight, playa.

           INT. UNDERGROUND COMPLEX - PROCESSING - MORNING

           Empty. Antiseptic. Three STAINLESS STEEL SLABS. BODY BAGS on 
           top of each. The bodies inside, perfectly still... until ONE 
           BODY BAG SITS UP. There’s a violent RUSTLE, then it unzips 
           itself, revealing...

           ... a very much alive Fontaine.

           He winces. Presses his hand to the BULLET WOUND IN HIS 
           SHOULDER. His torso’s covered in dried blood, his breaths are 
           labored, and he’s clearly in the worst pain of life... but 
           somehow this rugged sunuvubitch is still in the game.

                                 YO-YO (V.O.)
                        Aight, what’s your plan?

                        Not my plan... His...

           Slick Charles cracks his knuckles. Channeling that 2005 
           International Players Ball swag...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        First: a change of scenery.

           INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY

           The non-fiction section. Few locals in here reading. Our guys 
           whisper in between the stacks...

                                 FONTAINE
                        Fuck we in a library for?

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Cause they got cameras everywhere 
                        they think hood niggas are. So we 
                        gotta be where they ain’t.

                                 YO-YO
                        The plan...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Okay, if we wanna start our own lil 
                        modern day Watergate, and un-fuck 
                        this clusterfuck we find ourselves 
                        ensnared in, we gotta do somethin’ 
                        that’s too big to ignore.

                                 YO-YO
                        Thank you, Captain Obvious. How?

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        We go back to the basics. To the 
                        oldest, truest virtue of the pimp 
                        game: the finesse. 

           Yo-Yo rolls her eyes as Gnarls Barkley’s frenetically funky 
           2008 anthem, “Run,” FUNKS ITS WAY INTO OUR EARS...

           The Young Dealer, serving up a junkie...

                        No pimp is an island unto himself. 
                        It’s a dirty game, so first and 
                        foremost: We need friends...

           ... when out of nowhere Fontaine CLOCKS HIM IN HIS JAW. 

           Roughs him up against a light pole; one of those “Have You 
           Seen This Person?” flyers is stapled to it. Kid looks like 
           he’s seen a ghost as Fontaine gets right in his grill.

                                 FONTAINE
                        What I tell you bout sellin’ on my 
                        block?!

           Then... Fontaine subtly slips a ROLL OF HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS 
           INTO HIS JACKET.

                                 FONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        I need to talk to Isaac. Tell him 
                        to slide through The Track. 

           INT. UNDERGROUND COMPLEX - PROCESSING - PRESENT

           Now on his feet, Fontaine looks around for a weapon... spies 
           a BIN FILLED WITH THE BELONGINGS OF PROCESSED CLONES: a crack 
           pipe, gold chains, oh, and his trusty .45. We’re in business.

           INT. ISAAC’S TRAP HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DUSK - FLASHBACK

           Isaac stares at the MONEY ROLL, then at the Young Dealer, who 
           relays Fontaine’s message while holding ice to his black eye.

                                 SLICK CHARLES (V.O.)
                        But a pimp knows better than anyone 
                        that, like everything in this life, 
                        friendship ain’t free.

           EXT. THE TRACK - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           A Chevy Celebrity pulls up to the curb, Isaac behind the 
           wheel. Biddy steps to the window. Leans in. Smiles.

                                 SLICK CHARLES (V.O.)
                        Now why do you think a pimp dresses 
                        like six gold bouillons stacked up 
                        in a pile? Because he knows... 
                        somebody’s always watchin’... 

           UP ON ONE OF THE STREETLIGHTS... a SMALL FISH-EYE LENS

           A panoply of screens, glowing with surveillance. A TECH

           I/E. ISAAC’S CHEVY CELEBRITY - LATER - FLASHBACK

           Biddy, head in Isaac’s crotch. Pantomiming a blow job. Dude 
           looks weirded out by all this. From outside, it’s pretty 
           convincing. Every time her head rises, she whispers...

                                 BIDDY
                        ........ Ten racks.

                        Ten racks? And all I gotta do is 
                        shoot him?... Again?

                                 BIDDY
                        ........ That’s what he said.

           EXT. THE TRACK - LATER - FLASHBACK

           Biddy quicksteps back to the watering hole. Whispers in Yo-
           Yo’s ear. Who in turn scuttles to the next corner and 
           whispers in ANOTHER PRO’s ear... She’s one of Slick Charles’ 
           girls, too. It’s a game of telephone.

           I/E. FONTAINE’S CUTLASS / THE TRACK - LATER - FLASHBACK

           Parked around the corner from Isaac. That other pro Yo-Yo was 
           whispering to grinds in his lap. Whispers in his ear.

                                 ANOTHER PROSTITUTE
                        Yo-Yo said Biddy said he said he 
                        wants thirty racks.

                        Thirty?! The nigga shot me for free

           A BESPECTACLED TECH enters. When he looks up from his 
           clipboard, he notices the EMPTY BODY BAG. Suspicious, he 
           approaches it. But freezes when he feels the gun in his back.

                                 ISAAC
                        ... You fucked up comin’ here my 
                        nigga. 

           BANG! Fontaine falls, “dead.” 

                                 YO-YO (V.O.)
                        What?!

           EXT. STREET - LATER - FLASHBACK

           The Celebrity pulls into view. Its door opens and a lifeless 
           Fontaine is unceremoniously DUMPED RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
           STREET. He rolls around like a rag-doll as it peels off...

                                 SLICK CHARLES (V.O.)
                             (ignoring Yo-Yo)
                        --thick skin... commitment...

           ... and, moments later, a MATTE-BLACK CHARGER rolls up. Two 
           FIELD AGENTS hop out, quickly ZIP FONTAINE UP IN A BODY BAG 
           AND TOSS HIM IN THE TRUNK. All in the blink of an eye.
           INT. UNDERGROUND COMPLEX - PROCESSING - LATER - END FLASHBACK

           Fontaine A-201, getting his history and personality zapped 
           into his brain. But this time, we realize OUR FONTAINE is 
           hiding in one of those body bags in the background...

                                 SLICK CHARLES (V.O.)
                        ... patience...

           INT. UNDERGROUND COMPLEX - ADMINISTRATION HALLWAY - MORNING

           The Bespectacled Tech, nodding nervously to passersby. 
           Pushing Fontaine, half zipped up atop the slab. Playing dead. 
           His mouth doesn’t move, but the tech can make out his threat.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Try anything and I blow ya dick off.

           We notice a glint of the .45 peeking out. The tech gulps.

           I/E. BIG MOSS’ OLDSMOBILE / THE ROAD - MORNING

           Big Moss, driving with his left, fanning with his right. Yo-
           Yo shotgun, a shotgun in her clutches. Slick Charles, his .38 
           primed, sandwiched between TWO OF THE HOMIES. Best believe 
           they’re strapped, too.

                                 SLICK CHARLES (V.O.)
                        ... and last, but most certainly 
                        not least, the willingness to 
                        protect the ones he loves... 

           PULLING OUT... to reveal a SQUADRON OF DONKS. A rainbow of 
           candy paint. 24’s. Filled to the gills with scary-lookin’ 
           hood motherfuckers. Choppers and shotties poking out of every 
           window. It’s a mix of all the G’s in The Glen. Both Fontaine 
           and Isaac’s men. They fan out into a got damn FLYING V.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        ... by any means necessary.

           INT. UNDERGROUND COMPLEX - OUTSIDE THE CONTROL ROOM - MORNING

           Fontaine’s slab comes to a stop at the door.

                                 BESPECTACLED TECH
                             (under his breath)
                        Okay, we’re here. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        Open the shit.
           Bespectacled Tech sighs... Why me... before tapping his 
           keycard. When the door slides open, Fontaine SPRINGS UP and 
           shoves him through it. 

           INSIDE THE CONTROL ROOM

           A huge CONSOLE littered with SWITCHES. The (PROBABLY HIGH) 
           FACILITIES EMPLOYEE hits a double-take when he sees Fontaine.

                                  (PROBABLY HIGH) EMPLOYEE
                        Hey... You can’t... be in here?

           CRACK! Fontaine pistol-whips Bespectacled Tech, knocking him 
           out. Then trains his .45 on this poor sap.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Do what I say and you live.

           INT. THE DOLLAR STO’ - MORNING

           ELEVATOR MUSIC. Folks hunting for early morning bargains. 
           Then... ALL THESE GANSGTERS STORM IN. Yo-Yo and Slick Charles 
           leading the pack. Customers scramble to get the hell out the 
           way as Slick Charles aims his .38 at the STORE MANAGER. Of 
           course he’s WHITE WITH BLACK FOLK HAIR...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        How you doin’, playa? Just point us 
                        to the door that leads to the 
                        freaky underground laboratory and 
                        we’ll be outta your hair.

           Petrified, the Store Manager hesitates -- BANG! -- until YO-
           YO BLOWS A HOLE IN THE CEILING. She COCKS the shottie.

                                 YO-YO
                        Now, motherfucker!

           His arm shoots up, points to a DOOR IN THE BACK: his office. 

           INT. UNDERGROUND COMPLEX - CONTROL ROOM - MORNING

                                 FONTAINE
                        Open up all the surface doors.

                                  (PROBABLY HIGH) EMPLOYEE
                        Umm... Alright.

           He switches a few switches and...
           INT. THE DOLLAR STO’ - MANAGER’S OFFICE - SAME

           ... violà, the VAULT DOOR SLIDES ASIDE. Another staircase... 
           Everybody but Yo-Yo and Slick Charles stare in disbelief. 

                                 BIG MOSS
                             (fanning himself)
                        Well... Let’s get it, mane.

           Every gun COCKS at the same fuckin’ time. 

           INT. UNDERGROUND COMPLEX - CENTRAL CONCOURSE - LATER

           Morning underground. JERRY, the bicyclist who almost hit the 
           gang last time they were down here, rides his bicycle down 
           the central concourse. Listening to a podcast in his wireless 
           earbuds. Just another ho-hum, uneventful workday--

           BOOM, BITCH! Jerry gets kicked CLEAR THE FUCK OUTTA FRAME. 
           Straight up Leonidas “This is Sparta!” shit. 

           The hood has arrived.

           They pour in, shooting into the air, causing mayhem. The 
           scientists and pencil-pushers scatter like roaches. Amidst the 
           bedlam, we FIND Yo-Yo and Slick Charles. Slick Charles lets 
           off a COUPLE SHOTS OF HIS OWN, wrapped into the theatrics.

                                 YO-YO
                        Bring yo ass, Slick Charles!

           They race towards RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT.

           NIXON’S OFFICE - SAME

           Presidential. Mid-century modern. Nixon, in his swivel chair, 
           chatting on a MAUVE ROTARY PHONE as he plays Double Dragon on 
           his ancient gray Game Boy. 

                                 NIXON
                        ... Yes, sir. Side effects are 
                        already down to 25% of test 
                        subjects. I think we’ll be ready 
                        for a national rollout by next 
                        quarter........... Haha, yes 
                        sir............ Only if you give a 
                        handicap on the back nine--

           WEEEEOOOOO! WEEEEOOOOO! WEEEEOOOOO! Nixon swivels in his 
           chair, glances at his DESKTOP MONITOR. Hits a few keys to 
           pull up SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE of the complex: pandemonium.
                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        Nothing, sir. Just a scheduled fire 
                        alarm........ Okay, I’ll be in touch.

           He hangs up... pauses the game... takes a few moments to 
           consider... then opens his desk drawer, digs through 
           scattered Game Boy cartridges and finds his COLT PEACEMAKER.

           CLONE ROOM - SAME

           The elephant door opens; Yo-Yo and Slick Charles burst inside.  

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        How we sposed to open these things!

                                 YO-YO
                             (noticing the lever)
                        I’d start by pulling these!

           She pulls the lever... a tube drains... a PREACHER CLONE 
           slithers out...

                       SLICK CHARLES
                                                     YO-YO (CONT'D)
           Damn, that’s nasty.
                                              Hey, hey... The Lord’s 
                                              calling, pastor!

           Yo-Yo’s slapping the preacher gently on the face. Like we saw 
           with Fontaine A-201, he’s essentially an empty vessel with no 
           apparent personality or accent.

                                 PREACHER CLONE
                        Ughh... What’s going... Where am...

                                 YO-YO
                        In the middle of some shit. Get up.
                             (to Slick Charles)
                        Start freeing the rest!

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        There’s so many!

                                 YO-YO
                        Then we better hurry! You take that 
                        side, I’ll take this one!

           VARIOUS ROOMS AND LABS - SAME

           Gangsters raising hell in OVERSIGHT, R&D, and MANUFACTURING. 
           A gaggle of scientists make a run for one of the exit 
           elevators... frantically pressing the call button... But as 
           soon as it opens... 
           ... our DICE ROLLERS from the first scene -- GOLD GRILL, 
           DREADS, and TANK TOP -- are right there to say, “What’s 
           crackin?!”

                                 THE DICE ROLLERS
                        What’s crackin’?!

           ADMINISTRATION HALLWAY - SAME

           People running as fast as they can, trying to get away from 
           all these scary hood negroes. Fontaine limps down the 
           hallway, holding his wounded shoulder. Brandishing his gun.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Move!... Move!

           A few brave TECHS decide today’s the day to be legends. Try 
           to jump him from behind. One grabs his hand, trying to keep 
           him from firing his gun. But Fontaine’s too physical, even 
           with his wound. He fights them off. ELBOWS one. KICKS 
           another. SHOOTS the third. Carries on.

           When he nears the corner... CHESTER ROUNDS INTO VIEW. Looking 
           like the T-1000 model. He CRACKS his neck, ready to lay down 
           the law. On Fontaine’s face: Shhhhhhhiiiit... A mirror match.

                                 FONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry they named you Chester, dawg. 

           Fontaine raises his .45 to shoot; Chester’s already on the 
           move. BANG! BANG! But he’s too quick, the bullets miss. And 
           in a split second, Chester’s RIGHT IN FONTAINE’S FACE.

           BOM, BOM! A quick TWO-PIECE sends Fontaine reeling. They 
           wrestle for the gun, and eventually it FLIES OUT OF BOTH 
           THEIR GRASPS. It hits the floor and slides a few feet...

           BACK IN THE CENTRAL CONCOURSE

           Nixon, in the thick of it, ducking for cover behind a golf 
           cart and returning fire. Until he sees... THE NAKED PREACHER 
           CLONE... wandering in a daze... His expression hardens...

           BACK IN THE ADMINISTRATION HALLWAY

           Self on self crime. As menacing as Fontaine is, he’s no match 
           for Chester. Add a bullet wound and it’s getting ugly. 
           Chester fights with the tactical precision of a Marine.

           Pretty soon Fontaine is beaten bloody and gasping for air on 
           the ground. He tries to stand, but gets PUNCHED BACK DOWN. 
           Dominance asserted, Chester calmly retrieves the .45... looms 
           over his fallen opponent... Fontaine closes his eyes... 

           ... but Chester just TUCKS THE GUN IN HIS BELT and STARTS 
           DRAGGING FONTAINE BY THE COLLAR...

           BACK IN THE CLONE ROOM

           They’ve freed most of the clones. Slick Charles helps an out-
           of-it SLICK CHARLES CLONE to his feet. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Come on, pimp. We got this. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES CLONE
                        What’s going... on... Who... am I...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        You the 2005 International Players 
                        Ball “Pimp of the Year,” now chop 
                        them feet! Get to an exit!

           BACK IN THE ADMINISTRATION HALLWAY

           Fontaine, clinging to consciousness as Chester drags him in 
           front of an office door. He taps his keycard. Pulls Fontaine 

           INSIDE THE OFFICE.

           More of a laboratory than an office. Dark. The only light 
           coming from FIVE TANKS RECESSED INTO THE BACK WALL. Fontaine 
           blinks, unsure if he’s seeing what he thinks he’s seeing. 
           Each tank is filled with the SAME PHOSPHORESCENT AMNIOTIC 
           FLUID AS THE CLONE TUBES. And in each tank...

           ... there’s THE BODY OF A YOUNG BOY. From left to right: 

               ... a DARK-SKINNED BLACK BOY

                     ... a BROWN-SKINNED BLACK BOY 

                           ... a LIGHT-SKINNED BLACK BOY

                                 ... a WHITE BOY WITH AN AFRO

                                       ... a WHITE BOY WITH BLONDE HAIR 

           Taken together, it’s a perverse, Galtonian tableaux of A 
           BLACK CHILD BECOMING A WHITE CHILD. Fontaine gapes at it with 
           a mix of revulsion and confusion. Then...
                                 SOMEONE (O.S.)
                        Remarkable, isn’t it?

           A man is emerging from the shadow. The source of the voice...

                                 SOMEONE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t let you leave this facility 
                        alive, of course, but I figured you 
                        at least deserved to know what all 
                        of this is for...

           He finally steps into recognition: at least sixty... black... 
           and looking uncannily like an older version...

           ... OF FONTAINE.

           BACK IN THE CLONE ROOM

           Only a few clones left. Slick Charles works one side. Yo-Yo 
           the other. ON YO-YO... as she helps up her latest clone. 

                                 YO-YO
                        That’s it. You’re gonna be fine.

           BANG! A hollow-point buries itself in the clone’s chest, 
           killing him instantly. Yo-Yo SHRIEKS, ducks, looks towards 
           the entrance... IT’S NIXON...

           ON SLICK CHARLES... as he ducks behind a tube. Unseen.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                             (to himself)
                        Shit, shit, shit... That’s a big 
                        muthafuckin’ gun...

                                 NIXON
                        I’m hurt, Yo-Yo. You promised you 
                        wouldn’t cause me any more 
                        paperwork. I hate paperwork... And 
                        this looks like a lot of fucking 
                        paperwork, Yo-Yo. 

           BACK ON YO-YO... as she eyes her SHOTGUN. It’s leaning 
           against one of the tubes.

                                 YO-YO
                        No one’s puttin’ a gun to your head.

           She DIVES FOR IT... scoops it... and FIRES OFF A SHOT... it 
           SHATTERS the tube next to Nixon. He takes cover.
                                 NIXON
                        I see what you did there! That was 
                        witty! Maybe we should clone you! 
                             (then)
                        Speaking of which, where are your 
                        friends?

           ON SLICK CHARLES... sweatin’ bullets, listening...

                                 YO-YO (O.S.)
                        Fucking up your house as we speak! 

           BACK ON NIXON... as he smiles.

                                 NIXON
                        Well... one problem at a time.

           He springs up-- BANG! BANG!

           BACK IN O.G. FONTAINE’S OFFICE

           O.G. Fontaine looks to Chester, who pulls Fontaine to his 
           knees. O.G. Fontaine takes a good gander. Grabs Fontaine’s 
           chin, testing its sturdiness.

                                 O.G. FONTAINE
                        After so many years... it’s still 
                        disturbing... Boy, was I handsome. 

                                 FONTAINE
                             (dawning on him)
                        You’re... me...

                                 O.G. FONTAINE
                        No... You... are me...
                             (ambling away)
                        Stripped of my intelligence, 
                        clearly. Implanted with a cheap 
                        knockoff of Boyz N The Hood for a 
                        personality. But nonetheless... me.

           O.G. Fontaine moves towards the recessed tanks... the 
           floating boys... he observes them...

                                 FONTAINE
                        What the fuck did you do...

                                 O.G. FONTAINE
                        What has to be done.

                                 FONTAINE
                        You’re workin’ for them...
                                 O.G. FONTAINE
                        A marriage of convenience.

                                 FONTAINE
                        ... Why?

                                 O.G. FONTAINE
                        .......... Ronnie...

           BACK IN THE CLONE ROOM

           Yo-Yo and Nixon are still trading shots as Slick Charles 
           gathers his courage...

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                             (to himself)
                        Come on, Slick Charles. Join the 
                        hall of fame.

           He crouch-runs behind another tube. Getting closer. 
           Motivating himself with the pimp virtues as he moves.

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        Courage... sacrifice...
                             (scurries)
                        ... thick skin... commitment...

           Slick Charles quickly dips behind a tube. Whips out his .38. 
           He’s got Nixon in his sights now, maybe ten yards away; Nixon 
           doesn’t realize he’s even in the room. Slick Charles steadies 
           his aim, waiting for a better shot...

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        ... patience...

           ... and here it is. Nixon, there for the taking...

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        ... and the willingness to 
                        protect... the ones... you...

           CLICK... This motherfucker done ran outta bullets.

                                 SLICK CHARLES (CONT’D)
                        Summummabitch...

           Nixon FIRES OFF ANOTHER SHOT at Yo-Yo, none the wiser as to 
           this failed assassination attempt...

           BACK IN O.G. FONTAINE’S OFFICE

           On Fontaine’s still-stunned face...
                                 FONTAINE
                        Ronnie... is he...

                                 O.G. FONTAINE
                        No... He died... Just the way you 
                        remember. I made sure you would. 
                        It’s the one thing of mine I wanted 
                        you all to have. 
                             (re: the floating boys)
                        He is, of course, the reason for 
                        all of this...
                             (then)
                        See, the people who fund this 
                        place... who pull the strings... 
                        they don’t understand what’s so 
                        obvious to you and me... Just 
                        thinking the same isn’t enough. 
                        That’s a Band-Aid. A half-measure. 
                        We’re too different. No amount of 
                        mind control is going to keep a 
                        good-ol’-boy from seeing you as 
                        nothing more than just some nigger. 

           Fontaine stares at those floating boys in disbelief...

                                 FONTAINE
                        You gotta be fuckin’ trippin’... 

                                 O.G. FONTAINE
                        378. That’s the number of unique 
                        genes that separate you in your 
                        ghetto from your counterpart in the 
                        suburbs. Took me three decades to 
                        track down each and every one of 
                        them. I think you’re familiar with 
                        my first test subjects. 

                                 FONTAINE
                        ...... In the lab, the tech... The 
                        manager... 

                                 O.G. FONTAINE
                        Nice to know some piece of that PhD 
                        trickled down... They weren’t 
                        complete successes. The hair... it’s 
                        stubborn... But they pass. I’ve 
                        since perfected the process. And 
                        soon, we’ll begin the true rollout.

                                 FONTAINE
                        I think niggas might notice if they 
                        wake up one morning with blonde 
                        hair and blue eyes.
                                 O.G. FONTAINE
                        It won’t happen overnight. But over 
                        generations...

                                 FONTAINE
                        You can’t erase black people from 
                        America. They been tryin’ for 400 
                        years.

                                 O.G. FONTAINE
                        I’m trying to save black people. 
                        I’m trying to save everyone. Once 
                        we’re all the same--

                                 FONTAINE
                        We’ll what? Have a big ass Kumbaya? 
                        The whole world holdin’ hands, 
                        circle-jerkin’ each other and shit? 

                                 O.G. FONTAINE
                        We’re fighting a war we can never 
                        win! Assimilation is better than 
                        annihilation.

                                 FONTAINE
                        ........ You think Ronnie would 
                        want this?

                                 O.G. FONTAINE
                        Don’t presume for a second that 
                        because I gave you a few memories 
                        you know my brother! You didn’t 
                        walk him to school every morning! 
                        You didn’t tie his tie every 
                        Sunday! You didn’t have to go to 
                        the morgue to identify his body so 
                        your mother didn’t have to see her 
                        youngest son--

           He trails off, so enraged he can’t even finish the sentence. 
           Composes himself... Then...

                                 O.G FONTAINE
                        The smell. That’s what I remember 
                        most. Cheap antiseptic solution 
                        mixed with the dried urine from his 
                        basketball shorts.  
                             (pointing to his own ribs)
                        See, he was shot right here. Just 
                        left of his sternum between 
                        anterior ribs five and six. Missed 
                        his heart, but pierced his lung. 
                        Didn’t have to be fatal. But they 
                        just left him there. Alone. Scared. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 O.G FONTAINE (CONT'D)
                        Took him fifteen minutes to die. 
                        Right outside the store on cold 
                        concrete. When I got to the morgue, 
                        I just stood over him for a long 
                        time. I knew it was him, but... 

           Fontaine’s on the verge of tears. Hard to hear this.

                                 O.G FONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        They didn’t even bother to clean 
                        all the blood; by this time it had 
                        dried, crusted black. So I found a 
                        rag and washed him myself. Cleaned 
                        his beautiful skin. The skin that 
                        killed him... I spared you that 
                        memory... 

           His eyes drift to that tableaux of boys in the wall... 

                                 O.G FONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        The ones who came before you... They 
                        were violent. Selfish. Not one 
                        displaying the passion, the 
                        altruism, that landed you in this 
                        room today. Throwing your life away 
                        to do what you think is right... I 
                        see a lot of myself in you...

           BACK IN THE CLONE ROOM

           Slick Charles has ninja’d himself close to Nixon...

                                 NIXON
                        Come on, Yo-Yo. How much longer we 
                        gonna do this?

                                 YO-YO
                        You can always hurry up and die!

                                 NIXON
                             (BANG!)
                        I like your spunk!

           ... it’s as good a chance as he’ll ever get. Nixon steps back 
           to get a better shot at Yo-Yo when Slick Charles DIVES ON HIS 
           BACK. But, just as he does, Nixon FLIPS HIM OVER HIS HEAD, 
           slamming Slick Charles hard onto the floor. 

                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        Hooooo! Krav Maga! Tuesdays and 
                        Thursdays. How are ya, Slick 
                        Charles? 
                                 SLICK CHARLES
                             (a groan)
                        Tryna stay outta trouble.

                                 NIXON
                        Ain’t we all...

           Nixon points his peacemaker square between his eyes. 

                                 NIXON (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Yo-Yo. Gonna need you to come 
                        out here sweetheart.

           Yo-Yo appears from behind cover, shotgun trained on Nixon.

                                 YO-YO
                        Touch him, you die...

                                 NIXON
                        He’ll die, too. You sure you can 
                        live with that?... How bout you 
                        slide me that shotgun?
                             (off her hesitation)
                        Now!

           She relents. Kicks it to him. Fuck.

           BACK IN O.G. FONTAINE’S OFFICE

                                 FONTAINE
                        We ain’t the same... We can’t be...

                                 O.G. FONTAINE
                        I know you think you did something 
                        important here today. But my work 
                        will continue all the same. It must. 
                        I will change things for the 
                        better... Hopefully that gives you 
                        some measure of peace.
                             (walking away)
                        Chester.

           Chester takes out Fontaine’s .45...

                                 FONTAINE
                        I can’t let you do this.

                                 O.G FONTAINE
                        I wish I didn’t have to.

           He nods to Chester, but before Chester can pull the trigger--
                                 FONTAINE
                        Olympia Black...

                                 O.G. FONTAINE
                        I’m not a clone.

                                 FONTAINE
                        Yeah, but he is.

           Chester is frozen. Rage in his eyes. O.G. Fontaine has that 
           “Oh shit” moment--

                       O.G. FONTAINE
                                                    FONTAINE (CONT'D)
           Wait--
                                              Shoot him.

           BANG.

           O.G. Fontaine still looks surprised as he crumples. Chester 
           remains frozen, trapped under Fontaine’s command.

           BACK IN THE CLONE ROOM

           Nixon sighs.

                                 NIXON
                        I really liked you guys. I mean, I 
                        let you go because you were 
                        interesting. This job can be so 
                        administrative sometimes. But then 
                        you go and do something stupid, so--

           BANG! A shotgun shell sends Nixon airborne. He lands a few 
           feet away. Very much dead. Slick Charles and Yo-Yo both look 
           around: The fuck?! Standing nearby... Big Motherfuckin’ Moss. 
           Pocket fan doin’ work. 

                                 BIG MOSS
                        Y’all straight, mane?

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        ......... Yeeeeah. I think we 
                        straight now, Big Moss.

                                 BIG MOSS  
                        Bet... Bet... Spooky place, mane. 
                        What with the tubes and all... 
                             (they just stare at him)
                        Well... Catch y’all up top.

           Like Batman, he disappears. Off Yo-Yo and Slick Charles, 
           wondering how the hell they made it out of this alive...
           BACK IN O.G. FONTAINE’S OFFICE

           Fontaine picks himself up. Allows himself a second to mourn 
           the original him, lying old and inert at the foot of his 
           life’s work... 

           There’s no victory in this moment for Fontaine as he drags 
           himself past a still-frozen Chester... past O.G. Fontaine’s 
           oak desk, upon which rests the same photo of Ronnie and a 
           teenage Fontaine that was on his refrigerator...

           He doesn’t stop. 

           INT. THE WHITE HORSE - DAY

           B-team strippers sliding down poles as C-team tippers throw 
           lazy dollars their way... until...

           ... NAKED CLONES START APPEARING FROM THE CURTAIN... covering 
           themselves, embarrassed and scared. In fact, some of them are 
           CLONES OF THE STRIPPER ON THE POLE; she damn near falls off 
           when she recognizes herselves.

           INT. THE CHECK CASHING PLACE - SAME

           More naked, confused clones popping out the woodwork. 

           INT. GREATEST MT. ZION - SAME

           Morning service. Naked clones emerging from the altar. 

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Madness. Scores of naked, lost clones littering the streets. 
           The hood is on fire. News vans are already starting to swarm. 
           Folks gawking, taking pictures, videos, Instagrams, all that. 

           This shit is going viral.

                                 SOME DUDE WITH A PHONE
                             (to his IG story)
                        They out here clonin’ niggas!

           Fontaine weaves through this impromptu block party. When...

                                 YO-YO (O.S.)
                        Fontaaaaaine! Hey Fontaine!

           ... Yo-Yo and Slick Charles catch up to him. 
                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Damn, playa. What the hell happened 
                        to you?

                                 FONTAINE
                        Got shot. Got stomped out by myself. 
                        Had to kill my other self. 

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Well, from now on, you can call me 
                        Abraham Slick Charles. 

                                 YO-YO
                        I’m just glad you’re okay.

                                 FONTAINE
                        So am I.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        They’re gonna have a hard time 
                        covering this shit up...

           Scene’s a mess... but we notice residents in the neighborhood 
           helping the clones. Giving them water, blankets, jackets, 
           shelter. There’s plenty of good in The Glen.

                                 YO-YO
                             (to Slick Charles)
                        I think now’s as good a time as any 
                        to tell you I’m retiring. 

           Slick Charles smiles. She’s for real, for real this time.

                                 SLICK CHARLES
                        Yeah... might be time for me to 
                        hang up the gators myself. 
                        Definitely can’t go back to The 
                        Royal, there’s an angry Fontaine 
                        tied up to a chair... Maybe I’ll 
                        roll witcha.

                                 YO-YO
                        What about you, Fontaine? 

                                 FONTAINE
                        I don’t know. I’m only a couple 
                        days old. Might be nice to see the 
                        world.

                                 YO-YO
                        How bout we start with Memphis? Got 
                        family out there. And a sneaking 
                        suspicion that they could use a lil 
                        pest control...
           Off Fontaine, considering... and just as he begins to grin--

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           ANOTHER FONTAINE... GASPING awake... PULLING BACK... we 
           realize this isn’t the same house we’re used to...

           He gets up... hits his bedside RADIO...

                                 THE RADIO (DJ JUICY FROOT)

           ... starts getting dressed... a BLUE SHIRT, BLUE CHUCKS, and 
           a BLUE BANDANA... 

                                 THE RADIO (RUCKUS) (CONT’D)
                        Lyin’ round the house, ain’t tryna

           This Fontaine, it seems, is a crip.

           HALLWAY - LATER

           KNOCKING on his mama’s door.

                                 CRIP FONTAINE
                             (a hard Cali accent)
                        Mama, you want somethin’ from the 
                        store?

                                 CRIP FONTAINE’S MAMA (O.S.)
                        ......... I’m okay, thanks sugar. 
                        I’ll hit the county building later.

           Drinking his 40. Stepping over junkies. 

           INT. CRIP FONTAINE’S HOUSE - LATER

           Chillin’ with the crip homies. Smoking. CNN’s on in the 
           background. ON THE SCREEN... Breaking news.

                                 REPORTER (ON TV)

                        --with what can only be 
                        described... as clones. WDBZ is 
                        here on the scene, trying to make 
                        sense of this madness.
                             (flagging a clone down)
                        Ma’am, please a word.

           A groggy, naked clone steps over.

                                 CLONE MA’AM (ON TV)
